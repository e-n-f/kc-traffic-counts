Re:    Traffic Impact Evaluation
       56th Avenue & Dunkirk Street - Aurora, Colorado
       FHU Reference No. 112239-01

Dear Mr. Hagen:

A multi-family residential development is planned for the northeast quadrant of the 56th Avenue and
Dunkirk Street intersection in Aurora, Colorado. The proposed development would consist of
approximately 204 apartment units. Primary access to the site would be located on Dunkirk Street
at the 57th Avenue alignment, with secondary site access located on Genoa Street at the 57th Place
alignment.

A previous development proposal for this site considered 300 multi-family dwelling units, with a
proposed full-movement access to 56th Avenue located at the Flanders Street alignment. Although
the number of residential units has been reduced from the previous plan, City of Aurora
engineering staff have expressed concerns that the elimination of the Flanders Street access to
56th Avenue could negatively impact neighborhood traffic operations. Therefore, the purpose of this
brief letter report is to identify the traffic impacts of the current development proposal relative to the
56th Avenue/Dunkirk Street intersection and potential increases on Dunkirk Street due to
elimination of the previous site access at Flanders Street.

Existing Conditions

56th Avenue in the vicinity of the site is a four-lane (divided) arterial roadway. 56th Avenue provides
east-west connection between central Adams County and E-470, and is an important link for
Denver International Airport. Dunkirk Street is a collector status roadway serving primarily
residential uses in the vicinity of the site. South of 56th Avenue, the cross section is four-lanes
(divided). Adjacent to the site, Dunkirk Street is constructed to a two-lane partial cross section, with
the east curb line established at its ultimate location. Future improvements to Dunkirk at the 56th
Avenue intersection are anticipated, including a raised median, additional lanes and widening, and
a traffic signal. Genoa Street, bordering the east side of the site, is a two lane collector status
roadway; turning movements at the intersection at 56th Avenue are restricted to right-in/right-out
(RIRO) only.

AM and PM peak hour traffic counts at the 56th Avenue/Dunkirk Street intersection were recently
conducted by All Traffic Data Services (traffic data is included in the technical attachments to this
letter). Figure 1 depicts the existing traffic volumes in the vicinity of the site. Daily traffic volumes
were estimated by applying a factor of 10 to the PM peak hour two-way volumes. As shown, 56th
Avenue currently carries between approximately 7,550 and 10,750 vehicles per day (VPD) in the
vicinity of the site. Dunkirk Street currently carries about 2,800 VPD adjacent to the site.

The existing peak hour traffic volumes were used as the basis for intersection Level of Service
(LOS) analyses, the results of which are also depicted on Figure 1 (SYNCHRO LOS worksheets
are included as an attachment to this letter). LOS is a qualitative measure of traffic operational
conditions, based on roadway capacity and motorist delay. The 2010 HIGHWAY CAPACITY
MANUAL defines six levels of service, ranging from A to F, with LOS A representing the best
possible operating conditions and LOS F representing over-capacity, or congested conditions. In
urbanized areas, LOS D is typically considered to be acceptable for peak hour intersection
operations. For signalized intersections, LOS represents an average of delays around the
intersection. For unsignalized intersections, LOS is reported only for movements which must yield
the right-of-way to other traffic movements; LOS is not calculated for free-flow movements, as they
are not subject to intersection delay.

It can be seen that unsignalized traffic operations at the intersection at 56th Avenue/Dunkirk Street
include LOS E for AM peak hour STOP sign controlled movements, indicating near capacity
conditions and some associated delays. As previously mentioned, this intersection is anticipated to
be signalized in the future; the existing volumes, however, do not approach peak hour signal
warrant criteria, per the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, FHWA, 2009 (MUTCD).
Unsignalized operations at 57th Avenue and Dunkirk Street are currently acceptable, at LOS A or B
during peak times.

Site Generated Traffic

The proposed development would consist of approximately 204 multi-family dwelling units. A trip
generation analysis was conducted to determine the potential impacts of this development based
on average rates contained in TRIP GENERATION, 9th Edition, Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE), 2012. As mentioned above, a previous development proposal for this site
included approximately 300 dwelling units; the traffic impacts of this earlier plan were addressed in
a letter report entitled Singletree Multi-Family Residential Project Traffic Impact Analysis, Fox-
Higgins Transportation Group, November 1, 2005. For comparison purposes, the trip generation
estimates were extracted and included in the following summary table:

It can be seen that the proposed 204 unit development would have an estimated trip generation
potential of about 1,356 daily trips, with 104 trips during the AM peak hour and 126 trips during the
PM peak hour. This represents an approximate 20 percent reduction in the trip generation potential
of the site, compared to the previous 300 unit plan.

The site generated trips were assigned to the adjacent roadways based on the following trip
distribution estimates:

       60 percent to/from the west via 56th Avenue
       30 percent to/from the east via 56th Avenue
       5 percent to/from the north via Dunkirk Street
       5 percent to/from the south via Dunkirk Street

The above distribution is based on the Fox-Higgins report (year 2025 scenario), and is similar to
the existing travel patterns exhibited in the recent traffic counts. The resultant site generated traffic
assignment is depicted on the attached Figure 2. As shown, site generated daily traffic volumes
along 56th Avenue would range between approximately 406 and 814 VPD in the vicinity of the site.
Dunkirk Street would experience about 980 VPD in site-related traffic immediately adjacent to the
site, with only about 68 VPD oriented north of 57th Avenue or south of 56th Avenue.

In comparison to the previous plan, which showed primary site access to 56th Avenue at Flanders
Street, the current site traffic assignment places more traffic onto Dunkirk Street (980 VPD versus
approximately 270 VPD). Thus, even with the 20 percent reduction in site generated traffic, the
current plan would represent an increase of about 710 VPD on Dunkirk Street. However, this
potential increase would only affect the segment between 56th and 57th Avenues; no other
neighborhood roadways would be impacted by the elimination of the Flanders Street access.

Background Traffic Conditions

Background traffic represents the traffic that would be on the adjacent roadways regardless of the
proposed development. Per direction from City of Aurora staff, the following analyses are based on
a year 2030 horizon. Figure 3 illustrates the background traffic volumes, based on growth rates
extracted from the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) 2035 Regional Traffic
Model. A comparison of model output for 2010 and 2035 indicates an annual average growth rate
of about four percent in the vicinity of the site. By applying this growth rate, traffic volumes in the
vicinity of the site would approximately double by the year 2030. As shown, 56th Avenue would
carry between approximately 15,300 and 21,780 VPD, and Dunkirk Street would carry about 5,670
VPD adjacent to the site.

Within the 2030 horizon, traffic volumes at 56th Avenue/Dunkirk Street would meet MUTCD signal
warrant criteria. Signalized intersection capacity analyses were conducted based on the peak hour
projections to establish background operations; as depicted on the figure, this intersection would
operate at LOS B or C (acceptable) during peak times. Also as shown, STOP sign controlled
movements at 57th Avenue/Dunkirk Street would operate at LOS C or B in the background scenario
(LOS worksheets are attached).

Total Traffic Conditions

The site generated traffic volumes (Figure 2) were added to the 2030 background traffic volumes
(Figure 3) to obtain the total traffic volumes depicted on Figure 4. As shown, total traffic volumes
along 56th Avenue would range between about 15,706 and 22,594 vehicles VPD). Dunkirk Street is
projected to experience about 6,650 VPD adjacent to the site.

The total peak hour traffic volumes, intersection geometrics, and traffic control were then used to
determine intersection operations for the total traffic scenario. As indicated on the figure, the 56th
Avenue/Dunkirk Street intersection (signalized for background conditions) would continue to
operate at acceptable levels, at LOS B or C, with the addition of site traffic.

The 57th Avenue/Dunkirk Street intersection would remain unsignalized, with STOP sign control on
the proposed westbound (site access) approach. This intersection would operate at generally
acceptable levels, with the exception of the westbound (site access) approach. During the AM
peak hour outbound movements from the site would experience LOS E, indicating average delays
of about 43 seconds per vehicle. This condition would not impact traffic operations along Dunkirk
Street, as any congestion associated with the projected delays would remain on site. As a part of
the LOS analysis, SYNCHRO calculates the 95th percentile maximum probable queue lengths for
all movements subject to delay; the outbound queue associated with the projected LOS E would be
only about two vehicles (LOS worksheets are included in the attachments). Of note, this
intersection would not meet signal warrant criteria, per the MUTCD. PM peak hour intersection
operations would be at LOS C for this approach. The eastbound movements at this intersection
would remain acceptable during both peak hours under the total traffic scenario.

Summary and Conclusions

The proposed residential development site at 56th Avenue/Dunkirk Street would consist of
approximately 204 multi-family residential dwelling units. Access to the site would be via Dunkirk
Street (at 57th Avenue) and Genoa Street (at 57th Place). The development would have the
potential to generate approximately 1,356 vehicle trips on a daily basis, with about 104 AM peak
hour trips and 126 PM peak hour trips. The impacts of this potential traffic were evaluated under a
projected year 2030 horizon, focusing on traffic operations along Dunkirk Street. The following is a
summary of our findings:

       The current plan represents a trip generation reduction of approximately 20 percent from
       the previous development proposal for this site.
       Background year 2030 conditions at 56th Avenue/Dunkirk Street would be sufficient to meet
       signal warrant criteria, per the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, FHWA, 2009
       (Warrant 3, Peak Hour). If signalized, this intersection would operate acceptably, with or
       without the addition of site generated traffic.
       The proposed site access to Dunkirk at 57th Avenue would be STOP sign controlled, and
       would operate at generally acceptable levels. During the AM peak hour, however,
       westbound movements would experience LOS E, indicating some delays to outbound site
       traffic. This intersection would not meet signal warrant criteria, per the MUTCD. These
       potential delays would not be expected to impact traffic on Dunkirk Street. On-site queuing
       would be minimal, and the eastbound approach at this intersection would continue to
       operate at LOS B or C.

       The current plan eliminates the previously proposed access to 56th Avenue at Flanders
       Street. The resultant increase in traffic volumes along Dunkirk Street would be
       approximately 710 vehicles per day, which represents only about 11 percent of the total
       volumes on this segment of roadway. No other neighborhood streets would be affected.
       The Flanders Street access, as previously proposed, would be unnecessary to serve this
       site, as acceptable traffic operations are projected via the existing intersection and planned
       traffic signal at Dunkirk Street.
       The previously proposed Flanders Street would serve only this site, as an extension south
       of 56th Avenue is precluded by existing residential development. Any extension to the north
       would bisect the site and impact an existing neighborhood park.
       Flanders Street, as previously proposed, would be unsignalized, as traffic volumes would
       be insufficient to meet signal warrant criteria. As such, congested conditions would exist,
       particularly for outbound left-turns. These movements would likely reroute through the site
       to Dunkirk Street and the planned traffic signal, thus minimizing the benefits of the
       additional access.

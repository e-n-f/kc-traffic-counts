                   Traffic impacts associated with the proposed CCD Revitalization Plan are
                   expected to be minor.

                   In total, the Revitalization Plan is anticipated to result in a net increase of 9,000
                   ADT. Of this total, the largest increase to any one street is expected to be around
                   3,000 ADT. Compared with existing traffic volumes of about 30,000 ADT on
                   TH-25 and more than 14,000 ADT on East Broadway; and considering anticipated
                   background growth between today and 2030 will be between 20% and 60%,
                   additional traffic generated by CCD Revitalization will be minimal.

                   Under both existing and future conditions, the intersection most critical to traffic
                   flow in and around the Monticello CCD is the intersection of TH-25 and CSAH-
                   75/Broadway. Because of high east/west traffic volumes and turning volumes
                   (especially eastbound to northbound and southbound to eastbound); little spare
                   green time is available for heavy through traffic volumes on TH-25.

                   Current plans for the intersection of TH-25 with CSAH 75/Broadway, as
                   identified in the City's recently published Transportation Plan, call for the
                   addition of roadway capacity at this intersection. Plans include dual left turn
                   lanes for the two heavy movements previously noted. In 2011 dual right turn
                   lanes were added for the westbound to northbound movement. With these
                   improvements, the intersection is anticipated to function acceptably through 2030,
                   under one important condition.

                   The condition required for acceptable operations at TH-25/Broadway is that a
                   second river crossing over the Mississippi River must be constructed to provide
                   an alternate route for trips between Monticello and Big Lake. This second
                   crossing, as noted in the City's Transportation Plan, is the difference between 20%
                   growth in background traffic with a second crossing, and 60% growth in
                   background traffic without a second crossing. Without this vital second
                   connection, no set of other minor geometric fixes to TH-25/ Broadway will be
                   able to bring the intersection up to acceptable performance thresholds.

                   As noted, the proposed CCD Revitalization Plan will bring a modest amount of
                   additional traffic to the CCD, spread among the many roads and intersections
                   within the downtown core. In order to provide for adequate access to the
                   proposed retail facilities, creation of an additional signalized access point to TH-
                   25 at 4th Street is proposed. This intersection will not only be capable of
                   providing the additional access needed by the new retail facilities, but will also
                   provide a much-needed alternate route for local east/west through traffic in the
                   downtown core, improving operations at the critical TH-25/Broadway
                   intersection, and in turn, operations along the TH-25 arterial corridor.

                   In order to maximize the benefit of the traffic signal at 4th Street and offset the
                   impact of the addition of signalized access points, access restrictions at the


Monticello CCD Revitalization                      Page iii                                November 4, 2011
                   intersection of TH-25/3rd Street are proposed. Conversion to right-in/right-out
                   access is recommended on both sides of TH-25.

                   In addition to the benefit to vehicular traffic generated by the signal at 4th Street,
                   pedestrians will also benefit. Currently, a 5-block separation exists between
                   signalized crossing points of the high traffic volume TH-25 corridor. The addition
                   of a traffic signal at 4th Street will limit the distance a pedestrian must go out of
                   his/her way to cross TH-25 to one and a half blocks.

                   Improved traffic operations at TH-25/Broadway as a result of the 4th Street traffic
                   signal will also be of benefit by limiting the potential for queues on Broadway to
                   extend upstream to both Walnut Street to the west and Cedar Street to the East.
                   Analysis of post-redevelopment traffic operations at these intersections shows
                   levels of service above acceptable thresholds with little queuing impacts from the
                   critical TH-25/Broadway intersection.

                   Other geometric improvements recommended to improve traffic operations,
                   whether or not the proposed Revitalization Plan proceeds, include an additional
                   westbound approach lane at TH-25/7th Street and revised signal phasing and
                   extension of the westbound storage bay at the I-94 North Ramp intersection.
                   MnDOT has plans to complete the I-94 North Ramp improvements in the near
                   future.

                   Lastly, to improve north/south pedestrian connectivity at Broadway, consideration
                   for future installation of a signal system at Locust Street is recommended if and
                   when warranted.

                                                                                 INTRODUCTION

                   Background
                   In 2010, the City of Monticello's Economic Development Authority hired
                   Westwood, in partnership with the McComb Group, Ltd. to complete a
                   Downtown Revitalization Plan. This Transportation Study is a component of that
                   effort.

                   The Downtown Revitalization Plan outlines a preferred scenario for potential
                   redevelopment of the Central Community District (CCD). This transportation
                   plan looks at the future infrastructure improvements that will be required to
                   implement this preferred scenario.

                   Much of the study of the future infrastructure needs for the CCD has already been
                   completed as part of Monticello's recently completed 2030 Transportation plan.
                   To the extent that the Redevelopment Plan and the 2030 Comp plan are alike, the
                   transportation needs will also remain aligned. To address the transportation needs
                   specific to the Redevelopment Plan, the 2030 Transportation Plan traffic forecasts
                   were used as a starting point in development forecasts post- redevelopment.

                   A majority of the effort associated with this transportation plan focused on Trunk
                   Highway 25, a primary arterial roadway running north/south through the CCD.
                   As noted in the City's Transportation Plan, congestion caused by traffic on TH-25
                   in the CCD is currently the cause of a majority of the City's traffic-related issues.

                   Figure 1 shows the intersections studied as part of this transportation plan.
                   Intersections studied as part of this report are highlighted. In addition to the
                   intersection along TH-25, several other intersections were analyzed as part of this
                   study:

                                three additional intersections along Walnut Street (one block west of TH-
                                25) at 4th Street, 3rd Street, and Broadway;
                                three additional intersections along Locust Street (two blocks west of
                                Broadway) at the same three cross streets; and
                                the intersection of Broadway and Cedar Street (one block east of
                                Broadway).

                   The intersections of Broadway/Walnut and Broadway/Cedar were included due to
                   their short separation from the critical intersection of TH-25/Broadway. The
                   other intersections were included due to the desire to assess the impact of
                   changing roadway capacity on Walnut Street with the various redevelopment
                   concepts.

                   Purpose
                   The purpose of this report is to identify needed transportation infrastructure
                   improvements for the future CCD Revitalization Plan. Potential infrastructure
                   improvements in three general areas were analyzed:

                                Vehicular
                                Parking
                                Pedestrian/Bicycle

                   The remainder of this report is laid out to cover three areas in turn. The first area
                   covered is vehicular operations. To assess infrastructure needs in this area, a
                   traditional Synchro/SimTraffic operational analysis was completed. Three
                   scenarios were analyzed:

                                2010 Existing. Analysis of existing conditions is undertaken primarily to
                                calibrate the computer traffic model used. Review of the results of this
                                scenario can be helpful in gaining a feel for how Level of Service
                                correlates to real life conditions.
                                2030 No-Build. This is a baseline scenario that establishes which
                                improvements will be required regardless of whether the Redevelopment
                                Plan proceeds, and;
                                2030 Build. This scenario will be studied to identify additional
                                improvements needed due to the Revitalization Plan.

                   Initially both the AM and PM peak periods were analyzed. As noted below,
                   review of the initial analysis results indicated that the PM peak hour was the
                   critical peak hour in terms of traffic capacity. This result is typical of areas with a
                   mix of residential, office, and retail land uses.

                   Because the PM peak hour will primarily control the design of any added
                   roadway capacity, it will be the focus of this report. Areas where capacity
                   limitations are observed in the AM peak are noted.

                   Analysis of Parking and Ped/Bike needs was completed by reviewing existing
                   infrastructure in light of the results of the vehicular analysis and looking to see
                   where improvements could be made. More detail on the process used for these
                   areas is provided under the respective sections of the report.

                   Turning Movement Volumes
                   Manual turning movement traffic counts were conducted by Westwood at the TH-
                   25 intersections in September 2009. All of the TH-25 intersections from the I-94
                   ramps north to County Highway 11 on the north side of the river were counted.
                   Additional ADT tube counts were collected throughout 2009 and 2010 by the City
                   of Monticello. Additional PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected
                   in March 2011 at the intersection of TH-25 and Broadway, and in August 2011 at
                   the following intersections by Westwood:

                        Locust Street /Broadway                       Walnut Street / 3rd Street
                        Locust Street / 3rd Street                    Walnut Street / 4th Street
                        Locust Street / 4th Street

                   Based on the count data, the peak hours of traffic occur weekdays from 6:45 to
                   7:45 a.m. and 4:15 to 5:15 p.m. The AM and PM peak hour volumes for the
                   study area intersections are shown on Figures 3 and 4. The volumes shown are
                   primarily from Westwood count data where available and have been adjusted to
                   reflect 2010 conditions, prior to improvements at the intersection of TH-25 and
                   Broadway. The intersection of TH-25 and Broadway is a compilation of the three
                   counts available. All of the existing volumes used in the transportation analysis
                   are considered to represent 2010 conditions.


                   2030 Transportation Plan
                   Review of Monticello's 2030 Transportation Plan indicates that background
                   traffic volumes are anticipated to grow by 60% between today and 2030. Based
                   on this information, 2030 No-Build peak hour volumes were developed by
                   factoring existing volumes up by 60%.

                   The 2030 Transportation Plan notes traffic growth of 60% between now and 2030
                   will likely lead to a breakdown of traffic flow in the CCD. In order to limit the
                   growth in background traffic volumes in the CCD, the Transportation Plan
                   recommends that an additional bridge crossing the Mississippi River be
                   constructed. This bridge would relieve traffic volumes on the TH-25 bridge,
                   lowering background growth in the CCD to 20%.

                   Two sets of 2030 background peak hour traffic volumes were therefore
                   developed. The first set assumed existing geometry (no improvements), no
                   second river crossing, and 60% growth in traffic volumes. The second set
                   assumes geometry as set forth in the City's Transportation Plan with a second
                   river crossing and 20% growth in traffic volumes.

                   Figures 5 and 6 detail the No-Build volume estimates without an additional river
                   crossing. Figures 7 and 8 provide the No-Build volume estimates with a second
                   river crossing in place.

                   CCD Revitalization Trip Generation
                   Trip generation estimates for the CCD Revitalization land uses were based on
                   rates documented in Trip Generation, 8th Edition, published by the Institute of
                   Transportation Engineers (ITE).

                   For land uses anticipated to be removed as part of the CCD redevelopment, a rate
                   equal to one-half of the ITE rate was used to estimate the amount of traffic to be
                   eliminated. The use of a rate equal to half of the ITE rate provides for a
                   conservative estimate of future traffic volumes with the redevelopment.

                   Pass-by trips and internal/shared trips were neglected both due to the small total
                   volume of added trips anticipated, and to provide for conservative forecasts.

                   The tables below provide a summary of the trip generation estimates. Table 2
                   summarizes the trips to be eliminated. Table 3 summarizes the trips to be added.
                   The total net trip generation associated with the Revitalization Plan (Table 3
                   totals less Table 2 totals) is provided in Table 4.

                   A column noting the TAZ, or Traffic Analysis Zone, for each land use is included
                   in each of the trip generation Tables. The TAZ for each land use corresponds to
                   its location within the downtown area. Further description of how this data is
                   used is provided under Trip Distribution/Trip Assignment below.

                   Trip Distribution / Assignment
                   Trip distribution for site-generated traffic was based on the market surveys
                   completed by McComb. A plot of the CCD users was produced and divided into
                   travelsheds based on anticipated travel routes to/from the CCD. The percentage
                   of users in each travelshed was determined by counting the number of users in
                   each travelshed. Figure 9 provides an illustration of the anticipated trip
                   distribution pattern. Survey respondents were mapped.

                   Using this trip distribution pattern, site-generated trips were assigned to the study
                   area roadways. The exact path through the study area is determined by the TAZ
                   the trip is destined to (or originating from). Routing was accomplished separately
                   for each TAZ. The resulting totals were then summed to provide overall trip
                   assignment totals. Figures 10 and 11 provide this summary for the AM and PM
                   peak hours, respectively.1

                   Adding the site-generated trips to the No-Build trips results in the estimates of
                   Build trips. As will be noted in the next section of the report, forecasts of 2030
                   traffic operations without a second river crossing in place show extreme

                     The routes chosen assume the post-redevelopment roadway network, including a traffic signal at
                   4th Street. Please see the discussion later in this report under 2030 Build with 2 nd River Crossing.
                   Inclusion of this traffic signal is anticipated to result in a diversion of some local east/west traffic
                   from Broadway to 4th Street to make better use of available capacity. The amount of traffic
                   anticipated to divert is small; roughly 50-100 peak hour vehicles, depending on peak hour. These
                   totals represent less than one-third of the peak hour volume on these movements. The traffic
                   volumes assumed to divert are reflected in Figures 10 and 11.

                   congestion, even without the proposed CCD redevelopment. Accordingly,
                   operational analysis of post-CCD redevelopment conditions focused on the
                   scenario with a second river crossing. Figures 12 and 13 depict the 2030 Build
                   scenario volume estimates with this second crossing in place.

                   Figure 14 provides a look at traffic volumes on a daily basis. Existing volumes
                   are shown along with 2030 No-Build (with bridge) and 2030 Build scenario
                   volumes at locations throughout the study area where existing ADT count data is
                   available.

                   Operational Analysis
                   Using the roadway geometric and traffic volume data described above as input,
                   traffic operational analysis was performed per the standards set out in the 2000
                   Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board. The
                   industry-current Synchro/SimTraffic 7 package was used to complete the analysis.

                   Two fundamental outputs from the model are typically used to characterize traffic
                   flow. The first is Level of Service (LOS); a letter grade ranging from A (free
                   flow) to F (over-saturated forced flow). Generally, Level of Service D
                   represents the threshold for acceptable overall intersection operating conditions
                   during a peak hour in an urban area such as Monticello. On an individual
                   movement basis, LOS E is typically considered the lowest acceptable LOS.
                   Movement LOS F can sometimes be considered acceptable for a side street
                   movement at a two-way stop controlled intersection under peak hour conditions
                   that does not meet warrants for installation of a traffic signal.

                   For movements operating at a low LOS, the second important output to consider
                   from the model is queuing. A queue is a line of vehicles waiting to pass through
                   an intersection. While an intersection may be reported as operating at an
                   acceptable level of service, queues from the intersection extending to upstream
                   intersections or driveways could create a potential safety issue. The 95th
                   percentile queue is typically considered the standard for design purposes. The
                   microsimulation component of the model, SimTraffic, is best suited for reporting
                   queuing between closely-spaced intersections.

                   Analyses were conducted for the AM and PM peak hour conditions for the 2010
                   Existing and 2030 Build scenarios. Results of the operational analyses are
                   summarized below, by scenario:

                   2010 Existing
                   Analysis of 2010 Existing conditions was performed in order to properly calibrate
                   the model to match observed real-world conditions. Results of the analysis are
                   summarized in Table 5. Detailed results are available in the appendix.

                   The operational analysis of existing conditions assumes completion of a Mn/DOT
                   project currently under construction at the first TH-25 intersection north of the
                   river, County Road 11/14. This project involves the addition of dual northbound
                   left and dual eastbound right turn lanes along with modifications to signal
                   phasing.

                   Existing traffic operations in the AM peak hour are very good, with all
                   intersections and movements meeting or exceeding acceptable LOS thresholds.

                   Operations in the PM peak hour are good, with all intersections operating at
                   acceptable overall LOS. LOS F movements are observed at two of the studied
                   intersections (Cty. Rd. 11/14, 3rd Street).

                   The intersection with the most significant capacity issues is the intersection of
                   TH-25 and Broadway. This intersection operates at LOS D overall. 95th
                   percentile queuing reported by the model extends beyond available storage bays
                   for the eastbound and southbound lefts for 12% and 6% of the peak hour,
                   respectively. 95th percentile queuing on the northbound through movement is the
                   most critical, extending to 3rd Street 33% of the peak hour.

                   These queues are based on the existing signal timing plan in place, and vary from
                   day to day based on actual traffic conditions2. The levels of service and 95th
                   percentile queues reported are intended to represent typical midweek (Tuesday-
                   Thursday) conditions. Conditions on Friday afternoons during the summer are
                   likely to be worse.

                   Observation of the model suggests that the queuing experienced is typically of a
                   short duration. Few, if any, cycle failures (vehicles waiting several cycles to
                   move through an intersection) are likely to be experienced in the field.

                   2
                     As of August 2011, the intersection of TH-25 and County Road 11/14, located north of the River,
                   is currently under construction. Delays to northbound TH-25 traffic in the PM peak period are
                   severe, with queues often spilling back to south of I-94.

                   2030 No-Build
                   The results reported below for 2030 Build conditions assume optimized signal
                   timing. Operations also assume additional capacity improvements at the
                   intersection of TH-25/Broadway. The ultimate intersection configuration of dual
                   southbound lefts, dual eastbound lefts, and dual westbound rights is assumed for
                   this intersection.

                   With the 60% growth in traffic anticipated between today and 2030, traffic
                   operations become extremely congested in the study area. Half of the study
                   intersections are forecast to experience LOS F movements in the AM peak hour,
                   and all but five will have LOS F movements in the PM peak hour.

                   In order to provide acceptable levels of service for baseline 2030 conditions,
                   significant additional capacity will be required. The main constraint to expanding
                   capacity to additional facilities is the existing 4-lane bridge over the Mississippi
                   River. Due to this constraint, adding lanes on TH-25 in the CCD will provide
                   little, if any, benefit. As noted in the City's transportation plan, the only effective
                   long-term solution is to construct an additional river crossing. In the
                   Transportation Plan, the City notes that a second river crossing is an essential
                   upgrade to the existing roadway network to support anticipated increases in both
                   local and regional traffic growth.

                   Beyond the second river crossing, other recommended improvements include 1)
                   the addition of a third approach lane (to provide left, through, and right turn lanes)
                   on the westbound approach at 7th Street and 2) extension of the storage bay for
                   the westbound off-ramp at the I-94 North Ramp intersection from 225 to 400 feet

                   The addition of a second river crossing improves traffic operations within the
                   CCD substantially. The additional capacity at 7th Street and the I-94 North
                   Ramps provides improved operations at these intersections as well.

                   For the AM peak hour, all intersections return to acceptable overall intersection
                   LOS. Three TH-25 intersections (3rd Street, 4th Street, 6th Street) experience
                   movements at LOS F.

                   In the PM peak hour, all intersections again operate at overall LOS D or better.
                   Three intersections have movements operating at LOS F. They include TH-
                   25/Broadway, TH-25/4th Street, and TH-25/6th Street.

                   Other than the westbound approach to TH-25/Broadway, queuing does not
                   present a major issue throughout the network. Queues are short in duration with
                   few, if any, cycle failures observed.

                   2030 Build with Second River Crossing
                   The addition of traffic associated with the proposed Revitalization Plan will drive
                   the need for some capacity improvements along TH-25 in the heart of the
                   Monticello CCD.

                   In order to provide for adequate access opportunities to the proposed retail land
                   uses west of TH-25, installation of a traffic signal at 4th Street is needed. Without
                   a traffic signal in place, retail operations are likely to be less than optimal.

                   To offset the addition of a controlled full access point onto TH-25, conversion of
                   3rd Street to right-in/right-out (RIRO) access only is recommended.

                   Results of traffic operations for 2030 Build conditions with these modifications in
                   place are summarized in Table 8:

                   Traffic operations post-redevelopment show little change from those pre-
                   redevelopment.

                   One notable improvement is operations at the intersection of TH-25/Broadway.
                   This improvement is due to the diversion of some east/west through traffic to the
                   new traffic signal at 4th Street. It is anticipated that up to one-third of the
                   east/west through traffic (100 - 150 vph in each direction during peak times) may
                   divert to 4th Street. Trips making this diversion are anticipated to be very local in
                   nature (origins/destinations within 5-6 blocks) as opposed to more regional trips
                   originating from or destined to the perimeter of Monticello and beyond.




Monticello CCD Revitalization                          Page 28                            November 4, 2011
                   The improvement at TH-25/Broadway also helps to improve operations at
                   Broadway/Cedar. Queuing from TH-25/Broadway is not expected to impede
                   operations at the Broadway intersections located one block in either direction
                   (Cedar and Walnut).

                   One critical issue involved with the addition of a traffic signal on TH-25 will be
                   whether the traffic signal will result in increased delay and/or stops for mainline
                   traffic.

                   The current cycle length for the traffic signals on TH-25 (in both the AM and PM
                   peak hours) is 130 seconds. At the intersection with Broadway, north/south
                   through traffic receives 76-78 seconds of green time during the AM peak hour
                   and 55-65 seconds during the PM peak hour. At the intersection with 4th, with the
                   proposed traffic signal, north/south through traffic would receive 94-95 seconds
                   during the AM peak hour and 78-85 seconds during the PM peak hour. In simple
                   terms, the amount of green time is 20-40% greater for north/south traffic at 4th
                   Street, depending on the direction and peak period. The availability of extra
                   green time will provide extra flexibility when developing optimized signal
                   coordination timing plans for the TH-25 corridor. This added flexibility will
                   offset the loss in flexibility inherent with the addition of another signalized
                   intersection to the corridor.

                   Walnut and Locust Street non-Arterial Intersections
                   Analysis was performed at the non-arterial intersections along Walnut and Locust
                   Streets to determine if the addition of redevelopment-related traffic would result
                   in traffic capacity issues.

                   Under existing conditions which included MnDOT's TH-25/ CR 11/14
                   intersection reconstruction project, field observations conducted in 2011 suggest
                   that some northbound vehicles divert to Walnut Street to bypass queuing on TH-
                   25. Some of the vehicles using Walnut Street as an alternate route are destined
                   west along Broadway, although a majority of the cut-through traffic appeared
                   destined to the TH-25 river bridge. Although spare capacity exists at the Walnut
                   Street intersections, the cut-through traffic eventually reaches the TH-
                   25/Broadway intersection, where little spare capacity is available. The cut-
                   through vehicles add to the volume of eastbound lefts at this intersection, taking
                   away green time from the northbound through movement.

                   Despite this additional cut-through traffic, operations on Walnut Street as
                   observed in the field were quite good, with no queues in excess of two vehicles
                   observed at any intersection.

                   Under the proposed CCD Revitalization Plan, Walnut Street would be designed to
                   serve not only local through traffic, but also as a primary drive aisle for retail
                   traffic. As such, pedestrian volumes would likely increase to reflect increased
                   store-to-parking-lot foot traffic. The existence of increased vehicle-pedestrian
                   conflict has the potential to lessen Walnut Street's role as a desirable alternate


Monticello CCD Revitalization                     Page 29                                 November 4, 2011
                   route to TH-25 under times of high traffic congestion. Because of Locust Street's
                   location one block immediately west, it was included in operational analysis of
                   post- redevelopment conditions to determine if adequate capacity was available to
                   handle any traffic diversion that might occur.

                   The operational analysis conducted for 2030 post-redevelopment conditions
                   assumed a high volume of pedestrian crossing traffic at the intersection of Walnut
                   Street and 3rd Street. 160 peds per hour were assumed to be crossing each of the
                   legs of this intersection, equal to the peak hour traffic volume expected for the
                   primary retail generator planned for the southwest corner of the intersection.

                   Even with the significant volume of ped traffic assumed, results of the operational
                   analysis post-redevelopment (summarized in Table 8) indicate that reserve
                   capacity is likely to remain available along Walnut Street. Overall intersection
                   operations remain at LOS A at Walnut Street intersections. Accordingly, the
                   amount of traffic to be diverted to Locust Street would be expected to be small. If
                   this conclusion proves to be incorrect and a significant portion of existing traffic
                   does divert to Locust Street, the analysis shows that the necessary roadway
                   capacity exists to be able to handle the extra traffic while maintaining a LOS A.

                   The intersection of Walnut/7th Street and intersections along Cedar Street were
                   not included in this supplemental analysis because the amount of added traffic is
                   expected to be small (less than 50 vph / 500 ADT). Accordingly, no change in
                   LOS would be expected. Any operational issues identified at these intersections
                   in the future are not likely to be appreciably impacted by the proposed
                   Revitalization Plan.

                   Operational Analysis Conclusions
                                The addition of a second Mississippi River crossing will be essential to
                                providing acceptable level of service along TH-25 by the year 2030.
                                Without a second river crossing, traffic volumes are anticipated to increase
                                by as much as 60% per the City's Transportation Plan, resulting in
                                demand exceeding capacity along the entire TH-25 corridor from the
                                River to I-94.

                                Assuming a second river crossing is implemented as recommended in the
                                City's Transportation Plan, the intersection of TH-25 and Broadway is
                                forecast to operate at LOS D through 2030. This intersection is the critical
                                intersection in terms of north/south capacity on TH-25 through downtown
                                Monticello.

                                The addition of traffic related to the proposed Redevelopment Plan will
                                result in additional traffic demand at and around the TH-25/Broadway
                                intersection. The addition of a traffic signal at 4th Street will provide an
                                alternate route for local east/west traffic, resulting in additional green time

                                for TH-25 traffic at 7th Street and Broadway and improved operations for
                                all traffic along TH-25.

                                Post-Redevelopment, acceptable LOS D is forecasted to remain for the
                                TH-25/Broadway intersection. Queues are expected to remain short and
                                result in minimal upstream intersection interference at the intersections of
                                Broadway/Walnut and Broadway/Cedar. These two intersections are
                                expected to operate at acceptable overall LOS with all movements at
                                acceptable LOS.

                                The non-arterial intersections along Locust Street and Walnut Street are
                                expected to be able to handle the anticipated post-Redevelopment traffic
                                demands with reserve capacity. No diversion to Locust Street from
                                Walnut Street will be required to achieve LOS A, even with significant
                                pedestrian activity that is likely to be present along Walnut Street between
                                Broadway and 4th Street. Spare capacity is available along Walnut Street
                                to handle traffic that may choose to divert.

                                Capacity improvements are likely to be needed by 2030 at the TH-25
                                intersections of 7th Street and the I-94 North Ramp intersection, regardless
                                of whether the proposed CCD Revitalization Plan proceeds. The
                                recommended improvements are as follows:

                                   o 7th Street: Add 3rd westbound approach lane. Add
                                     protected/permitted eastbound/westbound left turn phasing.
                                   o I-94 North Ramps: Extend westbound left turn lane storage bay
                                     from 225 feet to 400+ feet. Modify signal phasing to incorporate a
                                     westbound right turn overlap phase that is able to run concurrent
                                     with southbound throughs or northbound lefts. MnDOT currently
                                     has this work programmed for completion in the near future.

                   A parking study was conducted within the Monticello CCD to assess the quantity
                   of public parking available on a typical weekday.

                   Counts were conducted in December, 2010. In general, the area studied is the
                   region bounded by River Street on the north, Locust Street on the West, Cedar
                   Street on the east, and 5th Street on the South. Figure 15 depicts this area:

                   To ensure that the average mid-week parking demand was accounted for, all of
                   the public parking spaces (both on-street and off-street) within this region were
                   counted at the following times:

                                8:30 AM, 10:30 AM, and 12:30 PM on Thursday, December 9, 2010.

                   Based on the findings in this parking study, public parking is generally in ample
                   supply within the 12-square-block study area. Between 70% and 90% of the
                   public parking spaces are available throughout an average day.

                   The one exception to this general trend is within the vicinity of the existing
                   Cargill facility at 4th and Walnut (Block 18). Parking on this and nearby blocks is
                   in short supply during working hours, forcing employees to park up to a block or
                   more away. Employees are also observed parking in adjacent land use parking
                   lots, including the Wells Fargo Bank parking lot across Walnut Street.

                   Although a parking deficiency exists in the immediate vicinity of the Cargill
                   facility, the availability of a significant amount of reserve parking capacity
                   elsewhere in the CCD suggests that no additional parking capacity is needed
                   within the CCD to support existing demand.

                   Future parking facilities should incorporate stormwater infiltration and ponding
                   elements as much as practicable.

                   East/West Ped Crossing of TH-25
                   One of the primary issues facing pedestrians in downtown Monticello is how to
                   cross TH-25. Currently, pedestrian crossing is available at the following
                   locations:

                                Pedestrian underpass north of River Street
                                   o 1.5-block separation from Broadway
                                Signalized crossing at Broadway
                                   o 5-block separation from 7th Street
                                Signalized crossing at 7th Street

                   The 5-block separation between available crossing opportunities at Broadway and
                   7th Streets presents the biggest barrier to pedestrians.

                   The proposed traffic signal at 4th Street would provide an additional signalized
                   crossing opportunity for pedestrians. This signal would be located roughly
                   midway between Broadway and 7th Streets, reducing the maximum separation
                   between signalized crossing opportunities for pedestrians from 5 blocks to 3.

                   The recommended signal phasing for east/west movements at the proposed 4th
                   Street traffic signal is permitted only, similar to existing operation at 7th Street.
                   The minimum required time for the east/west phase to accommodate ped crossing
                   will be approximately 26 seconds.3

                   Based on the operational analysis conducted and discussed earlier, a signal cycle
                   length of 130 seconds is anticipated for 2030 conditions. In the PM peak hour,
                   the side street (east/west) phase is projected to receive 30 seconds of green time,
                   sufficient to meet the ped minimum.

                   In the AM peak hour, when peds are less likely to be present, the amount of time
                   projected for the side street is 20 seconds. If and when a ped call occurs during
                   the AM peak hour, the signals would pause coordinated operations for one cycle
                   to fully serve the pedestrian minimum time, returning to coordination in one cycle
                   by shortening time on the mainline TH-25 phase.

                   During off peak times, when cycle lengths would likely be less than 130 seconds,
                   operation similar to the AM peak hour would occur if the side street phase were
                   shorter than the required ped minimum. Coordination would be paused while the
                   ped phase is serviced, then reinstated. The amount of time necessary to return to

                    Assumes 4-second Walk, 22-second Flashing Don't Walk (5 travel lanes @ 12 ft. wide + 6 ft
                   median + four 2-ft shoulders @ 3.5 ft/sec.)

                   coordinated operation would vary depending on the cycle length and total number
                   of phases. As flashing yellow arrow signal indications become more prevalent,
                   the potential to eliminate unnecessary phases by time of day (such as north/south
                   protected lefts during off peak times) expands, decreasing the likelihood that a
                   ped call would require the signal to temporarily pause coordinated operations to
                   serve the ped call.


                   North/South Ped Crossing of Broadway
                   The other issue facing pedestrians is north/south crossing of Broadway in the
                   vicinity of the CCD. Currently, only one signalized crossing opportunity exists--
                   at TH-25. Under existing conditions, low traffic volumes on Broadway permit
                   crossing at the unsignalized intersections to the west and east (Walnut, Locust,
                   Cedar, etc.) However, as traffic volumes on Broadway continue to grow, crossing
                   at these unsignalized locations will become more problematic.

                   One solution for this problem would be to add a traffic signal at one of the nearby
                   unsignalized intersections. The mostly likely candidate for signalization is likely
                   to be Locust Street. Although Walnut Street and Cedar Street experience higher
                   daily and peak hour traffic volumes, their separation from TH-25 (one
                   block/approximately 330 feet) suggests that operations could become problematic
                   at some point in the future due to queuing. Locust Street, at two blocks separation
                   to the west would be the next best option in terms of proximity to the heart of the
                   CCD, traffic volumes, and separation from TH-25.

                   Neither the intersection of Walnut Street nor Cedar Street currently meets peak
                   hour vehicular volume warrants for signalization. Noting that traffic volumes are
                   slightly lower on Locust Street indicates that this intersection currently would not
                   meet peak hour signal warrants as well.

                   In order to meet pedestrian warrants for signalization, the intersection would at a
                   minimum need to experience over 190 pedestrians in the peak hour. Based on
                   field observation of minimal ped activity, this threshold is far from being met.


                   Bicycle Circulation and Facilities
                   The major issues confronting bicyclists in the CCD include high traffic volumes
                   on TH-25 and lack of dedicated facilities. In large part, as shown on the City's
                   Existing Parks and Pathways Plan, bicyclists must share lanes with automobile
                   traffic in the CCD. No dedicated bicycle facilities, except trails within East and
                   West Bridge Parks adjacent to the Mississippi River, exist within the CCD.

                   In order to improve service for bicyclists, implementation of a comprehensive
                   dedicated network of bicycle facilities is needed. Such a plan has been developed
                   by the City and published in May of 2011 as the Park and Trail Draft System


Monticello CCD Revitalization                     Page 35                                November 4, 2011
                   Plan. The Park and Trail Draft System Plan identifies two corridors within the
                   CCD as bicycle corridors:

                                Broadway/River Street is identified as a Primary Pathway Route
                                TH-25 is identified as a Secondary Pathway Route

                   While bicycle use of these two facilities within the CCD is not prohibited, the
                   current geometric design of these two facilities does not consistently facilitate use
                   by bicycles. To the extent possible, as improvements are made to both Broadway
                   and TH-25, a prudent action would be to design the improvements mindful of
                   bicyclists as users in addition to automobiles. Due to right-of-way constraints
                   within the CCD, the bicycle facilities developed for these roadways may need to
                   be of the on-street variety (wide shoulders or dedicated bike lanes), as opposed to
                   dedicate off-street trail facilities.

                   The implementation of bicycle facilities on TH-25, while recommended in the
                   City's Park and Trail Draft System Plan, runs contrary to the functional
                   classification of TH-25 as an arterial roadway, the primary purpose of which is to
                   carry regional vehicular traffic. As preliminary-level design of bicycle-related
                   improvements on this corridor is undertaken, consultation with Mn/DOT should
                   take place to ensure that the functional integrity of the corridor will not be
                   impacted.

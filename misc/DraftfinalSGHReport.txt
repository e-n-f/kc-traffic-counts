INTRODUCTION
Project Background
The South Greeley Highway (SGH) serves a variety of vital functions within and beyond the
South Cheyenne Community. In South Cheyenne, the SGH serves as the "main street" of the
community, providing visibility and access for numerous businesses that depend on the
highway. At the same time, the South Greeley Highway, in its role as US Highway 85, is a
regional highway providing for long distance travel between Cheyenne and its neighbors to the
south in Colorado. Thus, combining both local and regional trips, it must carry tens of thousands
of vehicles per day safely and efficiently. In addition, area residents travel the corridor by bus,
on foot and by bicycle as part of their everyday life in the community.
These multiple functions bring challenges. Like many older highway corridors, the South
Greeley Highway corridor exhibits characteristics that are typical of land use planning, access
management and roadway design policies and standards that were in place at the time of
development but that do not meet the needs of today. Many short, local vehicle-trips are forced
to travel the highway itself because the supporting street network is discontinuous. Aesthetics
vary widely, and the lack of sidewalks and street lighting along much of the corridor creates
hazardous conditions for pedestrians.
The community, which recognized these and other challenges in its recently completed South
Cheyenne Community Assessment, is committed to enhancing the quality of life and supporting
economic growth and prosperity in the corridor. This commitment finds expression in the desire
to develop a vision plan for land use, traffic flow, traffic safety, and beautification improvements
in the South Greeley Highway corridor.
To further the vision for SGH, the Cheyenne Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) initiated
the South Greeley Highway Corridor Plan in 2010. The plan has been a collaborative effort
involving the general public, corridor stakeholders, the South Cheyenne Community
Development Association (SCCDA), and multiple agencies, including Laramie County, the
Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT), Federal Highway Administration, and the
City of Cheyenne. The plan has sought to listen to public values and concerns, provide policy
and strategic statements to guide future corridor improvements and translate those
improvements to infrastructure design with a conceptual plan. This project is anchored in the
principles established in PlanCheyenne and the application of those principles to this particular
location.

Goal and Objectives
The goal of the Plan is to create a shared vision for the South Greeley Highway Corridor that
sets the stage for multimodal transportation safety and efficiency improvements, encourages
beautification efforts along the highway, and provides a catalyst for economic development.




                                                                                              Page 1
                                         Draft

Although there is no current funding for improvements along the highway, it is hoped that this
vision will establish a blueprint that can be used by the community to guide future improvements
that will build toward the ultimate vision as opportunities present themselves. These
opportunities could arise when a landowner is considering development or redevelopment or
when funding becomes available.
To support this goal, the project steering committee identified a series of objectives:
1. Involve the public and stakeholders in the planning process
2. Address needs of all corridor users and travel modes in the plan
3. Suggest future corridor land uses to address corridor-specific needs and opportunities
4. Recommend access management strategies toward improving both vehicular access and
   South Greeley Highway safety and efficiency.
5. Recommend solutions for existing traffic safety issues
6. Analyze existing and future multimodal intersection operations and recommend traffic
   control enhancements
7. Identify future roadway and multimodal links to improve the transportation network
8. Identify capital and maintenance costs and sources of funding for future improvements
9. Develop templates for the future streetscapes of the South Greeley Highway
10. Provide an implementation plan for recommended improvements, including project
    prioritization and phasing methods to provide large or small components to match available
    funding
11. Compile most recent plans of all corridor utilities and develop overall utility mapping
    information
12. Develop policy guidelines for maintenance of future corridor improvements

Study Area
Figure 1 depicts the study area and vicinity. As shown, the entire corridor length lies within
Laramie County, with the South Greeley Highway (US Highway 85) entering the City of
Cheyenne near Interstate 80 (I-80).The study area includes approximately 4.4 miles of the
South Greeley Highway between I- 80 on the north and Terry Ranch Road on the south. The
study area extends east to Avenue C and west to Walterscheid Boulevard.

Planning and Public Involvement Process

Project Governance

The project was supervised by a steering committee comprised of representatives of the
following agencies:
    Cheyenne Metropolitan Planning                      South Cheyenne Community
    Organization (MPO)                                  Development Association (SCCDA)
    Laramie County                                      Federal Highway Administration
    City of Cheyenne                                    South Cheyenne Water and Sewer
    Wyoming Department of Transportation                Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power
    Laramie County School District #1

The steering committee met 5 times throughout the project to guide the work of the consultant
team, review project information, discuss public and stakeholder involvement efforts, and
collaborate to make decisions about plan direction and recommendations.

Planning Phases

The work process to complete the Corridor Plan is illustrated in Figure 2. The project generally
followed the four phases of PlanCheyenne: Snapshot, Structure, Shape and Build.
The Snapshot phase captured current characteristics of the South Greeley Highway, including
traffic crash history, traffic volumes, intersection traffic operations, land use, non-motorized
travel and transit, and roadway network conditions. The project team assembled corridor
mapping, zoning information, aerial photography and previous studies and reports related to
SGH and South Cheyenne.
The Structure phase brought a collaborative effort to define the vision for the Corridor Study
area. Information gathered during the Snapshot phase and meetings with the project
Stakeholder group and Steering Committee helped frame the vision.
Development of the plan occurred in the Shape phase. Each of the vision elements in the
Structure phase were formed into a series of policies and strategies to be implemented to
eventually bring about the vision.
The Build phase was used to prioritize corridor strategies and identify action steps toward
implementing the plan over time. Potential sources of project funding are identified in this phase.

Public and Stakeholder Involvement

As shown on Figure 2, the public and stakeholder involvement process has extended
throughout the project, supporting each of the four phases. Activities were coordinated with the
following groups:
Stakeholder Group ­ The project team reached out to local businesses, residents and land
owners to form a stakeholder group of 15 individuals to be involved in the project. The project
team sought input from the group early in the project and met again with the Stakeholders to
collaborate on the shared vision for the corridor. The group will meet again prior to project
completion. In addition to two corridor residents, the project stakeholder group included
representatives of:
    Palomino Industries                            Town and Country Pharmacy
    Tripoli Square Shopping Center                 Town and Country Liquor
    American Storage and Postal                    West Winds Mobile Home Community
    Heartland Homebuilders                         Dirty Duds Commercial Linen Service
    Action Automotive

Individual Business and Landowner meetings ­ To gather additional input and feedback on
the corridor plan, the project team conducted a series of individual meetings with landowners
and businesses along the South Greeley Highway corridor. The individual meetings offered a
way to connect with those residents, business and land owners not able to participate in the
Stakeholder group and provided additional opportunities to coordinate directly with members of
the Stakeholder group. Meetings were held with 17 individuals in total, and multiple meetings
were held with several individuals.
General Public ­ The general public consisted of citizens interested in the future of the corridor
who attended the public open houses and made comments on the direction and content of the
plan.
Table 1 provides a summary of all public, stakeholder, and steering committee activities for the
project and the planning phase supported by each.

As shown, a significant outreach effort accompanied the Snapshot phase to capture input about
current corridor conditions and receive comments from citizens, business owners and agencies.
This input helped the stakeholder and steering committee groups craft a corridor vision at
meetings held during the Structure phase.
The Shape phase was supported by meetings with individuals, steering committee meetings, a
public open house, and two meetings with MPO committees, where corridor policies and
strategies were presented, discussed and refined.
This draft report will be presented and discussed with individuals, stakeholders and agencies
during the Build phase. Plan content will be revised as needed to address comments received
and provide information needed by decision-makers to implement the plan.

1.0      SNAPSHOT
1.1      Roadway Network
The primary roadway network is depicted on Figure 3 and can be described as follows:

1.1.1    North-South Roadways
South Greeley Highway (US Highway 85) ­ US Highway 85 is a north-south United States
Highway that runs for nearly 1,500 miles between El Paso, Texas and the Canadian border.
Over this length, it is known as the CanAm highway. In the Cheyenne area, US 85 is called
South Greeley Highway (SGH), a principal arterial roadway maintained by the Wyoming
Department of Transportation (WYDOT). SGH is posted at a range of speeds through the study
area increasing from 40 miles per hour (mph) near I-80 up to 65 mph south of Julianna Road.
Four travel lanes are provided throughout the 4.4 mile study length.
Walterscheid Boulevard ­ Walterscheid Boulevard is a two-lane, collector roadway that
parallels SGH on its west side approximately 0.5 miles away. Walterscheid Boulevard passes
beneath I-80 at a grade-separated crossing north of the study area. The southern terminus of
Walterscheid Boulevard is College Drive. It is posted at 35 mph through the study area.
Avenue C ­ Avenue C is a two-lane minor arterial parallel to SGH on the east side. Similar to
Walterscheid Boulevard, Avenue C passes underneath I-80 and extends north into the City of
Cheyenne. It is posted at 30 mph through the study area.
South Greeley Highway Frontage Road ­ Between Wallick Road and High Plains Road, a
frontage road parallels SGH on its west side. The frontage road provides two travel lanes and
accesses SGH at five locations over its 1-mile length.
Overall, north-south roadway continuity is extremely limited in the study area. Avenue B-6
provides sporadic continuity between Fox Farm Road and Nation Road as a two-lane roadway
east of SGH, but all other north-south roadways provide only local access and do not support
longer trips.

1.1.2    East-West Roadways
Interstate 80 ­ Interstate 80 (I-80) extends east-west from San Francisco to New York City. In
the Cheyenne area, I-80 extends across the south edge of the City of Cheyenne and provides
two travel lanes in each direction. I-80 interchanges with Interstate 25 west of the study area,
and is posted at 75 mph.
Fox Farm Road ­ Fox Farm Road is an arterial roadway that extends approximately 2.5 miles
east and west from SGH. It provides two travel lanes and is posted at 30 mph west of SGH and
40 mph east of SGH.

College Drive ­ College Drive, State Highway 212, is a loop road around the south and east
sides of Cheyenne. In the vicinity of the project, it extends east-west as a three-lane arterial
roadway posted at 40 mph east of SGH and 30 mph west of SGH.
Wallick Road ­ Wallick Road is a local connector extending east-west across SGH but not
beyond the study area. It provides two travel lanes. Wallick Road is limited to 20 mph during
school hours due to the presence of Afflerbach Elementary School west of SGH.
Terry Ranch Road ­ State Highway 223, Terry Ranch Road extends from SGH to meet I-25
approximately 5.5 miles to the east. It is a two-lane principal arterial, posted at 55 mph. Terry
Ranch Road is the south boundary of the study area.
Overall, east-west roadways in the study area possess some continuity, particularly north of
Wallick Road. North of College Drive, Jefferson Road, Allison Road and Prosser Road are
spaced at regular ¼ mile intervals and extend between Walterscheid Boulevard and Avenue C
and beyond. South of College Drive, Murray Road, Artesian Road, and Nation Road extend
east-west at ¼ mile intervals but Murray and Artesian Roads are discontinuous across SGH. In
the more rural portion of the corridor farther south, east-west roadways serve primarily as
accesses to residential areas.

1.2       Current Traffic Conditions
1.2.1     Traffic Volumes
Current traffic volumes in the study area are depicted on Figure 4. Daily traffic counts were
compiled from information available at the Cheyenne MPO www.plancheyenne.org website and
AM and PM peak hour traffic counts were also made available by the Cheyenne MPO. Daily
traffic counts were recorded between 2008 and 2011, with the majority taken in the Year 2009.
Peak hour intersection traffic counts were conducted between 2007 and 2011. Traffic count
information is included in Appendix A.
As shown, SGH carries a range of approximately 5,000 vehicles per day (vpd) at the south end
of the study area, increasing to nearly 29,000 vpd near I-80. This reflects the greater
development density in the north portion of the study area as well as the presence of
Cheyenne's city center to the north. Walterscheid Boulevard and Avenue C carry much less
traffic than SGH, at 7,000 vpd or less throughout. College Drive is the heaviest-traveled east-
west roadway, carrying approximately 8,000 to 10,000 vpd.
As a major commercial corridor, SGH carries a higher than average percentage of heavy
vehicles ranging from single-unit trucks to semi tractor-trailers. Based on vehicle classification
data provided by the Cheyenne MPO, trucks comprise approximately two percent of the traffic
stream along SGH. This value is comparable to that observed on many urban facilities in
Cheyenne and other cities.

1.2.2    Traffic Operations
Traffic operations within the study area were evaluated according to techniques documented in
the Highway Capacity Manual, (Transportation Research Board, 2000) using existing traffic
volumes, intersection geometry and signal timing. The signal timing information at each of the
existing signalized intersections was provided by the Wyoming Department of Transportation
(WYDOT). Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure of traffic operational conditions
based on roadway capacity and vehicle delay. LOS is described by a letter designation ranging
from A to F, with LOS A representing almost free-flow travel, while LOS F represents congested
conditions. For signalized intersections, LOS is calculated for the entire intersection while LOS
for unsignalized intersections is calculated for movements which must yield the right-of-way.
The agencies involved in the project each provide standards regarding acceptable intersection
LOS. For traffic impact analyses, the City of Cheyenne and WYDOT both consider LOS C or
better operations to be acceptable, and the City of Cheyenne further specifies a minimum
standard of LOS E for left turns entering the major street at unsignalized intersections. Laramie
County does not publish Level of Service guidelines.
The results of the intersection LOS analysis are depicted on Figure 4. As shown, all
intersections and movements currently operate at LOS B or better during peak hours with the
exception of eastbound movements entering SGH from Wallick Road, which operate at LOS C
during the PM peak hour. Level of Service worksheets for existing conditions can be found in
Appendix B.
A repeated comment received from project stakeholders, agency representatives and general
public concerned the SGH / Jefferson Road intersection and the need to install a traffic signal to
regulate movements and improve safety. In response, the project team conducted traffic counts
and an operational evaluation of existing conditions at the intersection. As shown on Figure 4,
movements entering SGH from Jefferson Road currently operate at LOS E/LOS F during peak
hours, an unacceptable Level of Service.
One potential solution to the poor traffic operations observed at the SGH / Jefferson Road
intersection is installation of a traffic signal. However, a cursory review of existing peak hour
traffic counts relative to signalization warrants in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) indicated that conditions at the intersection do not support the need for signalization.

1.3      Traffic Safety
The historic record was consulted to develop a picture of the reported crashes that occurred
along SGH through the study area over the five year time period between 2006 and 2010. Of
note, early project efforts analyzed the 5-year period between 2005 and 2009, but information
for the Year 2010 later became available and the 5-year analysis period was shifted to 2006-
2010 to more accurately reflect current conditions in the study area.
Figure 5 depicts these crashes, each shown as a single dot on the map. Crashes are
categorized as injury crashes or property damage only crashes. A total of 322 crashes were
reported along SGH during this time, with 133 injury crashes and, and 189 Property Damage
Only (PDO) crashes. Six crashes involved bicyclists and/or pedestrians.

1.3.1      Intersection-Related Crashes
A significant portion (30 percent) of the reported crashes occurred at the intersection selected
for operational analysis. Table 2 provides a summary of these intersections and the crashes
reported at each. In addition to the total number of crashes, a rate per Million Entering Vehicles
(MEV) is provided. The crash rate provides a means of comparing intersection safety
performance across the corridor and the region.

As shown, the top crash rate intersection found between 2006 and 2010 was the College Drive
intersection at 1.25 crashes/MEV. This intersection was also highlighted in the Cheyenne
MPO's 2010 Annual Crash Report for the Cheyenne Urban Area as the intersection with the
5thhighest crash rate in the Cheyenne Urban Area for 2010. A preliminary review of the crash
history at the SGH/College Drive intersection revealed that a significant percentage of the
crashes involved northbound and southbound left-turning traffic. The signal phasing at this
intersection allows for protected/permissive left turns, the permissive portion of which can lead
to heightened crash potential. Similar issues were observed in the reported crash history for the
intersection of SGH with Fox Farm Road, where 14 of the 50 recorded crashes involved left turn
conflicts. However, no such crashes occurred during the Year 2010, indicating that conditions
are improving. The remaining analyzed intersections shown in Table 2 demonstrated no clear
crash patterns.

1.3.2      Crashes between Major Intersections
As shown on Figure 5, numerous crashes were reported between the major intersections
analyzed in Table 2. It is evident that such crashes increase with traffic volumes, as the north
portion of the corridor demonstrates the most crashes. To capture and compare these crashes,
SGH between I-80 and Williams Street was evaluated to identify crash rates per million vehicle-
miles traveled (MVMT). These rates provide information about the relative concentration of
crashes at locations along the SGH corridor. Table 3 summarizes crash rates between major
intersections.

As shown, the highest concentration of crashes occurred between I-80 and Fox Farm Road, a
busy section of SGH with a number of closely spaced property accesses. An elevated
concentration of crashes was also observed between Jefferson and Allison Roads, another
location where numerous property accesses multiply traffic conflicts. Within this section, the
area immediately north of Allison Road up to the main access to the Safeway store showed a
particularly high frequency of crashes. One possible explanation for this record is the
occurrence of traffic conflicts in the existing Two-way Left Turn Lane (TWLTL). A condition of
interlocking left turns is observed in the section between two busy properties (a grocery store
and a popular restaurant), confusing drivers and increasing the potential for head-on and other
collision types. Interlocking left turns are also observed with some frequency throughout the
corridor.

1.3.3      Bicycle / Pedestrian Crashes
A total of six crashes involving bicyclists and pedestrians were reported along SGH between
2006 and 2010, scattered throughout the corridor. No observable pattern emerged from a
review of these crash locations.

1.4        Transit and Non-motorized Travel Modes
The SGH accommodates a healthy demand for travel by modes other than auto, including
transit, bicycling and walking. The current state of travel by these "alternative" modes is
described as follows.

1.4.1      Transit
Currently, the Cheyenne Transit Program (CTP) operates a fixed-route and ADA
complementary paratransit services throughout the City of Cheyenne. Within the study area,
CTP's South Route fixed route service extends along SGH as far south as Wallick Road. As
shown on Figure 6 and listed in Table 4, the South Route includes 5 stops in each direction
along SGH. The South Route stops at each of these stop locations one time per hour. The
CTP's fixed route and paratransit services operate Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 7:00
p.m. and Saturdays 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

The CTP has completed recent upgrades to a number of bus stops, including a shelter at the
northbound Prosser Road stop. Most of the existing stops include benches for waiting riders.

1.4.2      Bicycle Transportation
The Cheyenne Greenway forms the backbone of the bicycle network in the study area,
extending east-west along the Allison Draw, which crosses beneath SGH north of Allison Road.
As shown, the south portion of the study area provides minimal off-street bicycle paths, with
only a short shared path in the vicinity of Afflerbach Elementary School along Wallick Road.
Bicyclists traveling on street within the study area encounter a variety of conditions. The project
team conducted a Bicycle Level of Service analysis using the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) methodology. The Bicycle LOS of a given facility is calculated based on the traffic
volume in the adjacent travel lane, speed of adjacent traffic, shoulder width and the percentage
of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream. The methodology provides a qualitative assessment of
bicycle conditions. Based on a qualitative survey of conditions experienced by bicyclists, LOS A
represents ideal conditions for cyclists and LOS F represents poor conditions. Table 5 provides
the results of existing bicycle LOS analyses along SGH.
Table 5.       South Greeley Highway Bicycle Level of Service
                            Section                                          Bicycle LOS

Julianna Road to Terry Ranch Road                                                 E

As shown, bicycle LOS varies from acceptable conditions in the northern portion of the study
area to poor conditions in the higher-speed south portion. Factors that account for better bicycle
travel north include wide shoulders and slower travel speeds.
The bicycle LOS calculations provide a general appraisal of conditions for bicyclists. However,
important details of the corridor are not reflected in the results shown in Table 5. For example,
the presence of multiple closely spaced property accesses is not accounted for in the LOS
calculation, and this condition serves to worsen travel for bicyclists in the north portion of the
corridor.




                                                                                             Page 17

1.4.3      Pedestrian Travel
Similar to the bicycle analysis, a methodology for calculating pedestrian LOS is provided in the
2010 HCM. Pedestrian LOS is calculated based primarily on traffic volumes, travel speeds and
width of sidewalk. Table 6 depicts pedestrian LOS results along SGH.

                            Segment                                       Pedestrian LOS
I-80 to College Drive                                                           E
College Drive to Wallick Road                                                   F
Wallick Road to Julianna Road                                                   F
Julianna Road to Terry Ranch Road                                               E

As shown, pedestrian travel conditions are currently rated poor along SGH throughout the study
area. Though conditions are poor north of College Drive, the presence of a curb and sidewalk
make conditions better than south of College, where no sidewalk is provided. It is important to
consider this condition in addition to the LOS results when evaluating potential pedestrian
improvements along SGH.
The following photos depict
signalized pedestrian crossing
conditions at the SGH/Allison
Road intersection. Photo 1
depicts a situation in which the
pedestrian-actuation button is
difficult to reach from the
sidewalk, particularly for
impaired users. This situation
can cause minimal use of the
pedestrian button and lead to
more pedestrians choosing to
make the crossing without the
benefit of sufficient protected
crossing time.

                                                          preventing a pedestrian from seeing the
                                                          walk indication on the pedestrian signal
                                                          head. This utility conflict could cause a
                                                          pedestrian to attempt to cross at the
                                                          wrong time or simply not use the
                                                          pedestrian button due to the invisibility
                                                          of the pedestrian signal head.
                                                          Both of these conditions observed at
                                                          the SGH/Allison Road intersection
                                                          make crossing SGH more difficult and
                                                          increase the potential for pedestrian
                                                          crashes.

1.5       Corridor Design Elements
The physical characteristics of the corridor vary widely across the study area, adapting to the
changing context. To capture these conditions, the Snapshot phase includes a review of the
configuration of SGH itself within the right-of-way. In addition, corridor drainage was highlighted
for review in the plan due to a number of current concerns.

1.5.1     South Greeley Highway Segments
The South Greeley Highway possesses a variety of physical characteristics as it traverses the
context of the study area. Such characteristics include right-of-way width, number of private
accesses, posted speed, median type, and sidewalk provision. Table 7 provides a summary of
physical characteristics of the South Greeley Highway.




                                                                                             Page 19

As shown in Table 7, the attached, 5 foot sidewalks along SGH between Fox Farm Road and
College Drive are the only continuous sidewalks along the highway. The posted speed
increases to 65 mph farther south as the right-of-way (ROW) broadens and a center, grassed
median is provided. There is a 100' ROW section in the middle of the study area with broader
ROW to the north and south. A painted median is provided from Fox Farm Road to Wallick
Road, allowing for left turn storage in the more heavily developed parts of the study area.
Figure 7 depicts current typical sections for SGH within the study area.

1.5.2     Drainage
The main drainage channel in the study area is Allison Draw, located south of Allison Road. In
general, Allison Draw is channelized within the study area, flowing north and east. The south
fork of Allison Draw generally flows north and east in a less defined overland flow path. The
Allison Draw channel is adequately sized to handle a 100-year storm without overtopping, as
indicated by the current FEMA floodplain map and visual observations.
Large storms regularly occur along the corridor. In general, storms seem to drain away from the
corridor well; however the storm sewer system does not appear to be efficient. The majority of
the existing major drainage problems occur along the corridor from College Drive to Wallick
Road. A summary of existing drainage conditions is provided below:
Allison Draw to College Drive ­ Storm sewer collects water from the highway and does not
appear to possess reserve capacity for additional flows. Drainage from the west side of SGH
corridor flows to Allison Draw, and does not affect the highway.
College Drive to Murray Road ­ There is no defined storm sewer system. All drainage is
conveyed in concrete ditches located in the roadway shoulder. A few sump areas, or drainage
collection points, exist west of the Murray Road intersection.
Murray Road to Artesian Road­ The existing elliptical pipe system is partially plugged. The
existing collection system is located on the west side of the corridor, with no ability to convey
water to the east. Thus, there is an existing "swampland" east of SGH, at South Avenue B-6
north of Artesian Road.
Artesian Road to Nation Way­ Several
sump areas exist on the west side of the
corridor.
Nation Way to Wallick Road ­ Existing
homes and businesses adjacent to SGH
are located well below the existing
roadway, creating a dam effect that
causes storm drainage to accumulate.
Drainage pipes are crushed east of
SGH. This area would be very difficult to
redevelop at its current elevation.
Wallick Road ­ Many drainage
pathways converge at the intersection,
creating the potential for stormwater
accumulation.                               Photo 3. - Highway elevated above adjacent developed land
High Plains Road­ Existing culverts are undersized to handle increased development to the
west of SGH.
In summary, the portion of the study area south of College Drive possesses a number of
drainage deficiencies that cause problems during storm events.

1.6      Land Use
The corridor currently includes large areas of residential development and commercial/light
industrial development, but few services, parks and public facilities. Figure 8 displays the
current zoning in the study area. As shown, community businesses are clustered close to SGH
north of College Drive with residential development farther from the highway. Between College
Drive and Wallick Road, more industrial-type commercial uses border SGH and residential
development continues in a pattern similar to north of College Drive. The corridor transitions to a
mostly rural context south of Wallick, where large-lot residences and public/agricultural lands
occupy much of the land area.

1.7        Aesthetics
Beautification of the South Cheyenne area and South Greeley Highway in particular was
discussed during the collaborative process used to create the South Cheyenne Community
Assessment in April of 2009. It was stated in the assessment that the South Greeley Highway
does not present a positive image for the community, and the Assessment placed a high priority
on "cleaning up" the corridor and noted the need for a consistent visual theme to unify the area.
A review of corridor aesthetics revealed some positive trends toward beautifying the corridor.
Recent redevelopment projects north of College Avenue have included landscape features, and
flower boxes located at major intersections help to enhance the appearance of SGH. However,
corridor aesthetic features vary in nature and extent.
Table 8 provides an overview of existing aesthetic features along the corridor.

1.8       Future Conditions
In addition to reviewing existing conditions, the Snapshot phase provided a look at anticipated
future conditions in the corridor in order to identify appropriate long term planning strategies to
be included in the plan. The future evaluation focused on future land use and roadway network,
traffic volume forecasts and traffic operations.

1.8.1     Land Use and Roadway Network
The PlanCheyenne process completed by the Cheyenne MPO in 2006 envisioned the future
roadway network and land use throughout the Cheyenne Metropolitan area, including South
Cheyenne. The plan anticipated significant growth in South Cheyenne, particularly new
residential development in the area between I-25 and South Greeley Highway. In the study
area, commercial uses are expected to intensify adjacent to the highway. New mixed-use
commercial activity centers are identified at the north end of the study area, College Drive and
High Plains Road.
Extensions of Walterscheid Boulevard, Avenue C, Wallick Road and High Plains Road were
identified in PlanCheyenne to complete the roadway network to accommodate future growth.
Widening of portions of College Drive and South Greeley Highway is also anticipated to help
provide capacity for growth.
This vision of PlanCheyenne as it applies to the study area is pictured on Figure 9.

1.8.2    Traffic Forecasts
The PlanCheyenne effort included development of a regional travel demand model for the
Cheyenne area. The model, maintained by WYDOT in the TransCad software platform,
provides Year 2030 traffic forecasts based on the land use assumptions included in
PlanCheyenne. The Cheyenne MPO requested that traffic analyses in this corridor plan be
based upon forecasted Year 2035 traffic conditions, an approximate 23-year planning horizon
relative to current conditions.
Traffic forecasts were developed for the corridor using a version of the travel demand model,
updated to incorporate the Swan Ranch development being constructed near I-25 and High
Plains Road. The development includes industrial, commercial and residential uses, and is
expected to bring significant growth to the South Cheyenne area. In addition to the modeling
effort, the project team reviewed historic traffic growth along the South Greeley Highway, finding
that past growth in traffic has varied between 2 percent and 4 percent per year.
To account for a range of future growth potential and its effect on the corridor, the steering
committee determined that three future growth scenarios should be addressed in the plan; 2
percent annual growth, 4 percent annual growth, and the traffic volume forecasts included in the
PlanCheyenne regional model. Figure 10 presents daily traffic volume growth for portions of the
SGH corridor. The travel demand model forecasts lie between 2 percent and 4 percent annual
growth except for the section of SGH between I-80 and College Drive, where model growth is
slightly below 2 percent.
As previously described, SGH currently provides four travel lanes throughout the corridor. An
approximate daily traffic volume threshold for considering widening a roadway from 4 to 6 travel
lanes is 35,000 vehicles per day (vpd). As shown, traffic forecasts north of Wallick Road would
reach approximately 35,000 vpd between roughly the Year 2025 and Year 2035, depending on
the growth rate experienced. South of Wallick Road, it is anticipated that 4 travel lanes would
remain adequate along SGH into the longer term future.

1.8.3    Traffic Operations
An intersection traffic operations sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of
future growth on peak hour intersection traffic operations. The 2 percent and 4 percent annual
growth scenarios were applied to existing intersection turning movements to forecast Year 2035
AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes at six study intersections. The results of the sensitivity
test are shown on Figure 11. As shown, all intersections would operate at LOS C or better
during peak hours by the Year 2035 assuming 2 percent annual growth, with the exception of
the PM peak hour at the SGH/Fox Farm Road intersection.
Additional operational challenges are revealed by the more aggressive 4 percent growth

       Widening to six through lanes along SGH through the Fox Farm Road and College Drive
       intersections
       Widening to four through lanes along College Drive through its intersection with SGH
       Providing exclusive left-turn auxiliary lanes along eastbound and westbound Allison
       Road approaches to SGH
The intersection of SGH with Jefferson Road is currently unsignalized, and LOS conditions are
expected to continue to deteriorate with future traffic growth. Year 2035 conditions at the
intersection are not anticipated to exceed signal warrant thresholds at an annual growth rate of
2 percent. However, if traffic volumes grow at a rate of 4 percent per year, Year 2035 forecasted
traffic levels would be sufficient to warrant a signal at the Jefferson Road intersection.
The SGH/Jefferson Road intersection is located ¼ mile away from the nearest adjacent
signalized intersections, at Fox Farm Road and Allison Road. The WYDOT Access Manual
specifies a minimum spacing of ½ mile between signalized intersections for Principal Arterials
such as SGH. The project team conducted a preliminary analysis progression along the SGH
corridor to understand the impact of substandard signal spacing on corridor progression, and
found that the addition of a signal at Jefferson Road would not degrade progression levels.
Further progression analyses have been requested by WYDOT Staff to better understand the
implications of signalizing Jefferson Road on the SGH corridor, including analyses that
incorporate the SGH/I-80 interchange and provide a range of different signal cycle length
assumptions.
The intersection of SGH with Prosser Road was mentioned in the public involvement process as
a potential future signalized intersection. Similar to the Jefferson Road location, a signal at
Prosser Road would introduce substandard spacing between signals and require additional
analysis and coordination with WYDOT prior to further consideration of signalization.

1.9        Corridor Segments and Key Planning Considerations
Based on the findings of the Snapshot phase, corridor conditions may be communicated by
grouping similar portions of the corridor into three main segments. This segmentation enables
the plan to accurately reflect the unique context of the each area. The segments are listed as
follows and will be used in later sections of this report.
Segment 1: I-80 to College Drive­ 1.2 miles: Segment 1 is the most urbanized portion of the
corridor, possessing numerous commercial businesses close to the highway. It is posted at a
speed limit of 40 mph. The ROW width is 100 feet for most of the segment, and an attached 5-
foot sidewalk is provided on both sides of the highway.
Segment 2: College Drive to Wallick Road ­1.0 mile: Segment 2 introduces more residential
land uses and the posted speed increases to 50 mph. The typical section is rural in nature with
side drainage ditches. No sidewalk is provided along SGH.
Segment 3: Wallick Road to Terry Ranch Road ­ 2.2 miles: The right-of-way width broadens
to 250 feet south of Wallick Road, and a frontage road is provided along the west side of SGH.
The posted speed is 65 mph for the majority of Segment 3.
In summary of the Snapshot phase, key planning considerations for Segments 1, 2 and 3 are
provided on Figures 12, 13 and 14.

2.0        STRUCTURE
The findings of the Snapshot phase provided a foundation for the project team to develop the
framework for a shared corridor vision in cooperation with the project steering committee and
stakeholder group. The shared corridor vision was also shared with the general public at the
second public open house. The groups arrived at a shared corridor vision, which is summarized
in this section in 7 components: Land Use, Access Management/Roadway Connectivity, Traffic
Safety and Operations, Transit and Non-motorized Transportation, Beautification, Infrastructure,
and Implementation.

2.1        Land Use
       Locate community services in the corridor that are currently scarce within South
       Cheyenne; including parks and youth centers
       Encourage development of new local and regional retail nodes along SGH, reinforcing
       the area as a retail destination
       Provide walkable connections between retail centers and nearby neighborhoods
       Locate uses to support and enhance current neighborhoods, residences and businesses
       Reinforce and enhance the role of the Laramie County Community College in the area
       Remove barriers to redevelopment (i.e. inadequate drainage, roadway or utility
       infrastructure or zoning inconsistencies)
2.2        Access Management/Roadway Connectivity
       Improve continuity, safety and efficiency of SGH vehicular crossings
       Improve safety for vehicles entering and exiting local accesses
       Build a complete regional roadway network supporting SGH that enhances travel
       efficiency and does not force SGH to act as a local street
2.3        Traffic Safety & Operations
       Provide appropriate speed limits to balance the needs of through traffic with local
       circulation and safety
       Provide peak hour intersection operations at LOS D as a minimum LOS and LOS C
       desired through the Year 2035
       Widen SGH as needed to provide capacity for increased future throughput
       Construct clearly-marked exclusive right turn lanes at major accesses and intersections
       Provide street lighting where appropriate




                                                                                             Page 35
                                         Draft

2.4        Transit and Non-Motorized Transportation
       Ensure adequate and safe pedestrian crossings of the South Greeley Highway
       Provide safe, accessible and continuous sidewalk connections the entire length of the
       corridor
       Increase connections to the greenway system
       Improve ease of access to transit for users
2.5        Beautification
       Install plantings and enhancements; i.e. pedestrian lighting, light pole banners,
       decorative sidewalk treatments or monumentation, within the right-of-way that
       complement the surrounding environment
       Develop a gateway feature for South Cheyenne
       Implement a consistent theme; i.e. modern western, that expresses the values of the
       South Cheyenne Area
       Create a corridor that the surrounding neighborhoods and businesses take pride in
       Develop strategies for maintenance of public areas
2.6        Infrastructure
       Ensure that infrastructure improvements coordinate with current and future utility needs
       Encourage development plans that address current and future drainage needs
       Preserve adequate right-of-way for future roadway widening needs
2.7        Implementation
       Preserve ability to implement various improvement packages as funding becomes
       available
       Provide a sustainable and well-maintained streetscape for many years
       Develop the corridor in a fiscally responsible manner




                                                                                           Page 36

3.0        SHAPE (STRATEGIES AND TOOLS)
The Shape phase adds to the shared corridor vision by recommending strategies and tools that
may be applied to the corridor to fulfill the elements of the vision. Strategies and tools are
identified in five primary areas; Land Use, Roadway Network, Transit and Non-motorized Travel,
Traffic Safety and Operations, and Beautification.

3.1        Land Use
Land use strategies and tools are identified to help put components into place to bring about the
elements of the community's vision. The strategies and tools are listed and described in Table
9.
Table 9.      Land Use Strategies and Tools
               Strategy/Tool                                 Description/Results
Land Dedication
                                                   Since the South Cheyenne area has a
                                                   high concentration of residential
                                                   neighborhoods, consider opportunities
% to park/play space
                                                   for dedication of park space and play
                                                   areas with new developments to allow
                                                   for nearby recreational opportunities.
                                                   Requiring ROW dedication and/ or
                                                   provisions of cross-access with
ROW for access/backage roads
                                                   redevelopment helps to reduce use of
                                                   SGH for local trips
                                                   Requiring additional ROW dedication
                                                   with redevelopment in areas where
ROW for amenity zone and widening of SGH           future widening and amenities are
north of Wallick                                   proposed helps to alleviate future needs
                                                   for ROW acquisition and property
                                                   impacts.
Land Consolidation
                                                   Smaller, shallow parcels require
                                                   multiple access points along South
                                                   Greeley Highway. Encouraging
Consolidate shallow parcels to create mixed-use    consolidation of small and shallow
planned developments along SGH                     parcels allows the ability to develop
                                                   larger planned developments and helps
                                                   to reduce use of SGH for local trips.

Policies/Enforcement
                                                  Enforcement helps to reduce more
                                                  significant property impacts in future
Enforce ROW encroachment
                                                  when improvements in the ROW are
                                                  implemented.
Coordinate recommendations of the South           Coordination helps to avoid conflicts,
Cheyenne Community Assessment and other           may help to create common goals and
area plans                                        potential for shared resources.
Implement zoning changes to reach conformity      n/a
with PlanCheyenne
Provide desired new land uses

                                                  incentives for redevelopment. These
Redevelopment incentives                          may include financing incentives,
                                                  zoning changes, and/or infrastructure
                                                  improvements (utility extensions, storm
                                                  drainage improvements, etc).


3.2      Roadway Network
A roadway network with good connectivity would help to support the function of SGH as a
Principal Arterial, which should accommodate few short trips. Strategies and tools are provided
to enhance the connectivity of the roadway network in the study area. Table 10 depicts roadway
network strategies and tools.




                                                                                           Page 38

Table 10.      Roadway Network Strategies and Tools
            Strategy/Tool                      Description/Example
Complete the Arterial Network:
A number of extensions to arterial
roadways in the corridor are
recommended to occur in
PlanCheyenne. Extending these
arterials will furnish the backbone
for accommodating traffic growth
in the area. The grid diagram
shown here depicts the
approximate spacing between
arterials identified in
PlanCheyenne as appropriate for
the context of the study area.
Principal arterials are to be spaced
approximately 1 mile apart, with
minor arterials at the ½ mile
interval between and collector
roadways at ¼ mile spacing.

Complete network of collector and
local streets: The network of
collector and local streets
accommodates shorter trips and
delivers vehicles to the arterial
network for longer trips. A
complete, connected network
helps relieve congestion along
arterial roadways, allows more
direct travel between origins and
destinations, and offers more route
options.




                                                                     Page 39

3.3      Transit and Non-motorized Travel
Transit and non-motorized travel strategies and tools are summarized in the following sections.
Table 11 describes strategies and tools to be used at the network level.

          Strategy/Tool                                    Example
Complete Sidewalk
Connections: As stated in the
Cheyenne Metropolitan Area
Pedestrian Plan (2010),
"Sidewalks are the most
fundamental element of the
walking network, as they
provide an area for pedestrian
travel that is separated from
vehicle traffic." Along with
completing the roadway
network, completing a network
of connected sidewalks of
adequate width and extent will
enhance pedestrian travel
through the corridor.
Build neighborhood
Cheyenne Greenway
connections: The Cheyenne
Greenway system is steadily
expanding throughout the
Cheyenne Metropolitan Area.
The Greenway currently
parallels Allison Draw, and
plans to extend the Greenway
include the SGH area and South
Cheyenne. Local linkages
between the greenway and the
surrounding community should
be provided to help maximize
use of the greenway and allow
users to enter the greenway at
locations other than major
roadway junctions.

          Strategy/Tool                                     Example
Add to the on-street bicycle
network: Completion of a
buffered bike lane along South
Greeley Highway through the
project area has been identified
in the Cheyenne Area On-Street
Bicycle Plan and Greenway
Plan Update (June 2012).
According to the plan, buffered
bike lanes are designed to
increase the space between the
bicycle lane and travel lane
along streets with higher speeds
and traffic volumes.




Table 12 identifies strategies and tools specifically targeted toward improving pedestrian
crossings of SGH.

               Strategy/Tool                                   Example
Improve Visibility at Crossings
High-visibility crosswalks: High
visibility crosswalks have the potential
to improve driver awareness of
pedestrians, as well as increasing use
of the crosswalk by pedestrians. A
number of treatments may be used to
increase visibility, including colors
(see photo), textured pavement, skip
striping, and in-roadway warning
lights.

Provide Luminaires: Intersection
lighting may be used to illuminate
pedestrian paths and increase visibility
at night. At signalized intersections,
crosswalks may be illuminated by
luminaires mounted on traffic signal
poles (see photo).




Accommodate Pedestrians at Signals
Ensure adequate pedestrian
crossing time: Review existing signal
timings to make certain that sufficient
time is provided for pedestrians to
safely cross SGH.




Improve signal head visibility:
Ensure that pedestrian indications
may be clearly seen by those for
whom they are intended. Ensure that
no obstacles obstruct the view,
including utility poles or street
furniture. Consider installing
pedestrian signal heads on the
intersection side of the crosswalk
rather than at the back of the
crosswalk to reduce the potential for
large vehicles to block the view.

             Strategy/Tool                                   Example
Countdown pedestrian heads:
Countdown pedestrian signal heads
are increasingly being used to assist
crossing pedestrians in determining
whether and when to cross a roadway
during the flashing "Don't Walk" signal
phase. Research suggests that
pedestrians are more likely to obey
the "Don't Walk" signal when delivered
with a countdown display.


Enhance Street Corners
Construct curb ramps: Provide ADA-
compliant, directional curb ramps with
truncated domes to accommodate
visually impaired users.

Provide corner refuge area: Provide
an adequate refuge area for
pedestrians to wait before crossing the
intersection.
Local pedestrian push button close
to ramps/sidewalk: Ensure that the
signal pole is located close to the
corner refuge area to keep the
pedestrian button within reach of
users seeking to cross the
intersection.                              This corner provides directional curb ramps
                                           and a corner refuge area. The pedestrian
                                           push button is easily reached by pedestrians.

3.4       Traffic Safety and Operations
The project team developed a series of strategies and tools for addressing traffic safety and
operations based on the issues identified in the Snapshot phase. Table 13 outlines strategies
and tools for increasing roadway and intersection capacity.

               Strategy/Tool                              Description/Example
Intersection Enhancements: Intersection
capacity enhancements can significantly
improve overall capacity along the SGH
corridor. Such capacity enhancements
may consist of traffic control changes,
lengthening or adding turn lanes, adjusting
signal timing parameters and signal
phasing, improving coordination between
signals, correcting geometric deficiencies,
and channelizing movements.



Widening of SGH: Widening of SGH to
provide additional travel lanes would
provide additional capacity for through
movements and at corridor intersections.
Widening considerations include potential
impacts to corridor Right-of-way and
utilities, construction cost, and ability to
accommodate traffic growth. One concern
associated with widening of SGH is the
additional walking time that would be
required to cross a wider section. Also of
note, completion of a more connected
supporting roadway network would help
delay the need for widening SGH.
                                               Right-of-way may need to expand by 50
                                               feet or more to accommodate a 6-lane SGH.

Posted Speeds: Posted speed limits are an important roadway design parameter that
influences roadway capacity and safety. Currently, the posted speed along SGH changes
from 65 miles per hour on the south end of the study area to 40 mph at the north end.
Adjustments to the posted speed limits along SGH may be considered to enhance traffic
capacity and safety, but should be evaluated in view of the corridor context ­ and should only
be implemented with additional study.

3.4.1    Access Management
Access management is the systematic control of the location, spacing, design and operation of
driveways, median openings, and street connections to a roadway (Access Management
Manual, Transportation Research Board, 2003). To address the application of access
management principles to State Highways in Wyoming, the Wyoming Department of
Transportation (WYDOT) completed the WYDOT Access Manual in 2005. The Manual states
that access management balances the competing needs of providing access to land while
preserving safe and efficient traffic flow on the roadway.
A primary purpose of access management is to reduce the number of conflict points and
improve traffic safety along roadways. When direct accesses are provided at short intervals
along a major highway such as SGH, conflict points multiply and increase the potential for
crashes. In addition, consecutive closely spaced accesses force drivers to negotiate conflict
areas without adequate time to perceive and react to traffic entering and exiting the access. The
South Greeley Highway is a principal arterial, which typically carry lengthy vehicle-trips and are
not well-suited to providing frequent and direct property access. In addition, closely-spaced and
poorly designed accesses adversely affect corridor businesses by detracting from safety for
entering and exiting customers.
More developed, higher-traffic portions of the SGH are vulnerable to access-related problems.
For example, there are currently 106 accesses along both sides of SGH between Fox Farm
Road and College Drive, which translates to approximately 100 accesses per mile and an
average of roughly 50 feet between accesses. The high density of accesses is reflected in a
review of historic crash information, which demonstrates elevated crash rates at locations where
more direct accesses are provided.
Access-related safety problems often become apparent when traffic volumes increase, as is
anticipated along SGH with future growth in South Cheyenne. Access management techniques
are identified in Table 14 to address this issue.




                                                                                           Page 45

Table 14.     Access Management ­ Strategies and Tools
Access Management Techniques
On-site circulation: On-site circulation improvements help organize conflicting flows into and
out of parking areas and provide space for exiting vehicles to queue when leaving the site.
Potential tools for on-site circulation improvements on SGH include:
Throat length: Provision of
adequate throat depth helps
avoid conflicts between
parking and entering traffic,
and provides space for exiting
vehicles to queue.

Access Management Techniques
Cross Access: Cross access
is the sharing of access
between two adjacent
properties, helping to reduce
the number of direct highway
accesses. Where adjacent
properties each possess a
direct access to SGH or when
development or
redevelopment is occurring
adjacent to a parcel with
access, efforts should be
made to share the access.     Example of good cross access between parcels


Access Reduction
The WYDOT Access Manual
calls for one access per 330
feet of site frontage, and
multiple accesses for a single
parcel are often unnecessary.
Consolidation of redundant
accesses reduces vehicular
conflict and improves traffic
safety.
Closing accesses is also a
technique for reducing
vehicular conflict on SGH. If
an access is to be closed,
adequate access to the
property must be provided via
alternate means.
Redevelopment of a group of
adjacent parcels can provide
an opportunity to close
accesses and reduce the
number of driveways.




                                                                             Page 47

Access Management Techniques
Limited movement access/Channelization
Left turn movements are more
vulnerable to crashes than
right turns due to additional
conflict points. Limiting
access to right-turn only or
restricting outbound left turns
reduces the number of conflict
points. Raised channelization
islands are typically
necessary to regulate access
movements.



Exclusive Turn Lanes
Providing exclusive turn lanes
for vehicles entering and
exiting an access gives refuge
from through traffic and
reduces potential for rear-end
crashes.

Access Management Techniques
Signal Spacing
Providing regular spacing
between signalized
intersections is important to
maintaining progression of
traffic flow. The WYDOT
Access Manual has identified
a minimum spacing of ½ mile
between signals along urban
principal arterials like SGH.




Access Placement/Relocation
Provide spacing between
accesses: Minimum spacing
between accesses helps
lessen the potential for
conflicts and crashes on the
highway. The WYDOT
Access Manual calls for a
minimum of 330 feet between
accesses of any type along a
Urban Principal Arterial.

                                  Draft

Access Management Techniques
Provide corner clearance:
Spacing between accesses
and adjacent major
intersections ensures that
access traffic does not
interfere with traffic queuing
from the intersection. Limiting
accesses within the functional
area of the intersections helps
reduce interference.




Backage Roads/Parallel Access Roads
Backage roads provide a
means for vehicles to enter
and exit properties without
having to do so directly from
the adjacent higher-speed
arterial. The WYDOT Access
Manual states the preference
that direct access to parcels
not come from the state
highway, but rather from side
and backage roads.

Access Management Techniques
Raised Median
The WYDOT Access Manual
states that installation of a
raised, non-traversable
median should be considered
when daily traffic volumes
along a roadway exceed
24,000 vpd, and installed
when volumes reach 30,000
vpd. Installing a median helps
to regulate movements and
concentrate turning
movements at locations
where proper turn lanes may
be provided. The advantages
of installing a median include
increased safety and capacity
by separating opposing flows.
Disadvantages include
increased emergency
response times and additional
U-turns or out-of-direction
travel.

4.0      BUILD
The Build phase of the South Greeley Highway Corridor Plan provides recommendations for
implementing the strategies and tools outlined in the Shape phase, and highlights opportunities
to do so. The recommendations are organized according to the segments identified in the
Snapshot section.

4.1      Segment 1: I-80 to College Drive
4.1.1    I-80 to Fox Farm Road
Early in the project, the section of SGH between I-80 and Fox Farm Road was identified as a
special project area, and a separate preliminary design process was undertaken to identify
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-conforming pedestrian improvements. The area of
improvement extends between Fox Farm Road and 9th Street (north of I-80). Because
improvements to this portion of the corridor were addressed in the separate process, minimal
attention is given in this report to SGH between Fox Farm Road and I-80.

4.1.2    Segment Recommendations and Opportunities
Figure 15 depicts, in map and tabular form, the recommendations and opportunities present in
corridor segment 1 between I-80 and College Drive. As shown, the recommendations highlight
locations where strategies and tools may be implemented to further the shared corridor vision.
Consistent with the Shape phase, recommendations are provided in the categories of land use,
roadway network, transit and nonmotorized travel, traffic operations and safety, and
beautification. Descriptions of the recommendations and opportunities by category are provided
as follows.
Land Use ­ Segment 1 is currently mostly developed, but opportunities for redevelopment are
likely to arise over time. The map highlights locations where multiple parcels may be
consolidated to facilitate such redevelopment, along with park and open space opportunity
zones. Rezoning of the parcel at the northwest corner of Allison Road and Walterscheid
Boulevard would be necessary to bring about the mixed-use identified for this parcel in
PlanCheyenne.
Roadway Network ­ The roadway network north of College Drive demonstrates a need for
enhanced connectivity in all directions. Figure 15 highlights general areas of roadway linkages
that would help to bring about improved continuity and connectivity. As noted, such linkages
should also provide sidewalks to enhance the non-motorized travel network. Enhancements to
area roadway connectivity would help relieve traffic along SGH, delaying the need for the
widening of SGH to 6 lanes shown in PlanCheyenne's Fiscally Constrained Roadway plan.
However, in recognition of this plan and potential future traffic growth, a mid-term priority is
assigned to preserving right-of-way along SGH along Segment 1 for future widening needs.
Transit and Non-motorized Travel ­ No specific transit recommendations are provided.
However, enhancements to the non-motorized network will help to increase demand for travel
by bus. The plan reflects the bicycle lane on SGH recommended in the current Cheyenne On-
Street Bicycle plan. The SGH/Allison Road intersection currently demonstrates some
deficiencies for crossing pedestrians, and it is recommended that these deficiencies be
corrected by enlarging the corner refuges areas and improving pedestrian signal head visibility.

Traffic Operations and Safety ­ Traffic operations and safety elements comprise the majority
of recommendations for Segment 1. Several access management techniques are
recommended for initial action, including completion of a comprehensive Access Management
Plan for SGH between Fox Farm Road and Wallick Road. Consideration of a raised median is
recommended to occur when traffic volumes along SGH reach 24,000 ­ 30,000 vehicles per
day, consistent with guidance provided in the WYDOT Access Manual. Operational
enhancements to intersections are included, with a near-term focus on the SGH/Jefferson Road
intersection and long term future attention to the Fox Farm Road, Allison Road, and College
Drive intersections. Right-of-way (ROW) should be preserved to accommodate future widening
of both SGH and College Drive.
Beautification ­Large-scale beautification efforts will require dedication of land along SGH, but
smaller individual efforts may be completed as parcels redevelop adjacent to the highway. The
existing ROW of SGH should be kept clear of obstacles. Table 16 depicts recommended
enhancements to be implemented within Segment 1, along with relative cost information.

As shown, recommended enhancements are designated with a check mark in the appropriate
row and column. A number of the recommended enhancements for Segment 1 are depicted on
Figure 16.




               Figure 16.     Segment 1: Example Midblock Enhancements

A plan view depiction of example beautification elements that could be provided along Segment
1 is provided on Figure 17.

4.1.3    Prioritization
A priority has been identified for each recommendation and opportunity, depicted on Figure 15.
Three general priority categories are provided: Near term, Mid-term and Long term. The
recommendations and opportunities are prioritized based on the urgency of the need being
addressed, steering committee discussion, and public and stakeholder input. The priority
information indicates the `start time' for each recommendation or opportunity. For example, it is
recommended that roadway network improvements be pursued in the Near term timeline, but
efforts to enhance the roadway network are expected to continue well beyond the Near term
future.

4.1.4    Typical Section Options
Figure 18 provides a menu of typical roadway sections from which to select when implementing
future improvements to Segment 1. As shown, the ultimate condition includes widening the
ROW from the current approximate 100 feet to 120 feet, along with a raised center median,
amenity zone/detached sidewalk, and buffered bike lane. A number of interim options are
provided as less costly options that would deliver elements of the corridor vision while not
requiring completion of the ultimate section. The least expensive option would provide a bike
lane by simply restriping the existing shoulder.

4.2      Segment 2: College Drive to Wallick Road
4.2.1    Segment Recommendations and Opportunities
Figure 19 depicts, in map and tabular form, the recommendations and opportunities present in
corridor segment 2 between College Drive and Wallick Road. As shown, the recommendations
highlight locations where strategies and tools may be implemented to further the shared corridor
vision. Consistent with the Shape phase, recommendations are provided in the categories of
land use, roadway network, transit and nonmotorized travel, traffic operations and safety, and
beautification. Descriptions of the recommendations and opportunities by category are provided
as follows.
Land Use ­ The land area within Segment 2 is currently developed with residential units,
industrial properties and vacant areas. The map highlights locations where multiple parcels
might be consolidated to facilitate such redevelopment, along with park and open space
opportunity zones. A variety of opportunities for development and redevelopment exist,
particularly within the southwest corner of the SGH/College Drive intersection. PlanCheyenne
has highlighted this location for a future activity center. Figure 20 provides an example of how
this property could be redeveloped to include uses of interest to the community. A large area
has also been identified for potential use as an Industrial park east of SGH between Murray and
Wallick Roads.
Roadway Network ­ The roadway network south of College Drive possesses limited continuity
both north-south and east-west. Improvements would result from extending Walterscheid
Boulevard and Avenue C south from College Drive as minor arterials. Figure 19 highlights
additional general roadway linkages that would help to bring about improved continuity and
connectivity in the local and collector roadway network. As noted, these roadways should also
provide sidewalks to enhance the non-motorized travel network. Enhancements to area
roadway connectivity would help relieve traffic along SGH, delaying the need for the widening of
to 6 lanes shown in PlanCheyenne's Buildout Vision Roadway plan. However, in recognition of
this plan and the potential for aggressive future traffic growth along SGH, a mid-term priority is
assigned to preserving right-of-way along SGH along Segment 2 for future widening needs.
Transit and Non-motorized Travel ­ A major need identified for this portion of the corridor is
the provision of sidewalks on both sides of SGH. Additional street lighting would help maximize
safety for pedestrians. No specific transit recommendations are provided. However,
enhancements to the non-motorized network will help to increase demand for travel by bus. The
plan reflects the bicycle lane on SGH recommended in the current Cheyenne On-Street Bicycle
plan.
Traffic Operations and Safety ­ Several access management techniques are recommended
for initial action, including completion of a comprehensive Access Management Plan for SGH
between Fox Farm Road and Wallick Road. Consideration of a raised median is recommended
to occur when traffic volumes along SGH reach 24,000 ­ 30,000 vehicles per day, consistent
with guidance provided in the WYDOT Access Manual. The intersections of SGH with Artesian
and Wallick Roads have been identified as future potential signalized intersections, and right-of-
way should be preserved to accommodate future enhancements to these intersections.
Enhancements to the Wallick Road intersection should include reconfiguration of the frontage
road to connect farther west.

Beautification ­Large-scale beautification efforts will require dedication of land along SGH, but
smaller individual efforts may be completed as parcels redevelop adjacent to the highway. The
existing ROW of SGH should be kept clear of obstacles. Table 17 depicts recommended
enhancements to be implemented within Segment 2, along with relative cost information.

A priority has been identified for each recommendation and opportunity, depicted on Figure 19.
Three general priority categories are provided: Near term, Mid-term and Long term. The
recommendations and opportunities are prioritized based on the urgency of the need being
addressed, steering committee discussion, and public and stakeholder input. The priority
information indicates the `start time' for each recommendation or opportunity. For example, it is
recommended that streetscape amenities be provided with adjacent property redevelopment
starting in the Near term future. However, efforts to provide streetscape amenities are expected
to continue well beyond the Near term future as opportunities arise to do so.

4.2.3    Typical Section Options
Figure 23 provides a menu of typical sections from which to select when implementing future
improvements to Segment 2. As shown, the ultimate condition would include widening the ROW
from the current approximate 100 feet to 120 feet, along with a raised center median, amenity
zone/detached sidewalk, and buffered bike lane. A number of interim options are provided as
less costly options that would deliver elements of the corridor vision while not requiring
completion of the ultimate section. The least expensive option would add a detached sidewalk
to the existing section.

4.3      Segment 3: Wallick Road to Terry Ranch Road
4.3.1    Segment Recommendations and Opportunities
Figure 24 depicts, in map and tabular form, the recommendations and opportunities present in
corridor segment 3 between Wallick Road and Terry Ranch Road. As shown, the
recommendations highlight locations where strategies and tools may be implemented to further
the shared corridor vision.
Land Use ­ The land area within Segment 3 is currently primarily urban transitional and rural
residential west of SGH and vacant areas east. The map highlights the SGH / High Plains Road
intersection as an area for potential redevelopment. PlanCheyenne has highlighted this location
for a future activity center. Figure 25 provides an example of how this property could be
redeveloped to include uses of interest to the community.
Roadway Network ­ As the area south of Wallick Road is a patchwork of vacant and
developed land, the roadway network possesses limited continuity both north-south and east-
west. Improvements would result from extending Walterscheid Boulevard and Avenue C south
from College Drive as minor arterials. Figure 24 highlights additional general roadway linkages
that would help to bring about improved continuity and connectivity in the local and collector
roadway network and set the stage for future development activity in the area. As noted, these
roadways should also provide sidewalks to enhance the non-motorized travel network.
Transit and Non-motorized Travel ­ It is recommended that wider shoulders (8') be provided
on the outside edges of SGH to enhance safety for bicyclists and for stopped motorists.

Traffic Operations and Safety ­ Several access management improvements are
recommended related to the frontage road located west of SGH. The frontage road intersections
with cross street should be reconfigured to provide appropriate spacing away from SGH.

4.3.2    Prioritization
A priority has been identified for each recommendation and opportunity, depicted on Figure 24.
Three general priority categories are provided: Near term, Mid-term and Long term. The
recommendations and opportunities are prioritized based on the urgency of the need being
addressed, steering committee discussion, and public and stakeholder input. The priority
information indicates the `start time' for each recommendation or opportunity. For example, the
opportunity to provide park and open space areas is noted as a Mid-term priority. However,
efforts to provide parks and open space are expected to continue well beyond the Near term
future as opportunities arise to do so.

4.3.3    Typical Section Options
Figure 28 provides a menu of typical sections from which to select when implementing future
improvements to Segment 3. As shown, recommended improvements would provide a wider
shoulder for bicyclist use and for disabled vehicles.

4.4      Funding Sources
The South Greeley Highway Corridor Plan presents a multifaceted corridor vision and a wide
variety of recommendations and opportunities needed to fulfill the vision. Implementation will
depend on receiving funding from a similarly broad base of sources. A number of potential
funding sources are highlighted as follows for further consideration. The adopted PlanCheyenne
document was used as a reference.

Grant Programs ­ A growing list of grant programs are available for transportation and
community enhancement projects. Grants are typically awarded through a competitive
application process. Recent federal grant programs include a series of TIGER grants, and
highway safety grant programs are ongoing. Winning projects tend to demonstrate a high level
of local commitment to the project and show clear transportation benefits.

Wyoming Business Council (WBC) Grant and Loan Programs ­ According to their website
(www.wyomingbusiness.org), the Wyoming Business Council offers a variety of grant and loan
programs to help communities with economic development projects. Such programs could be
researched to determine their applicability to the South Greeley Highway area.

Surface Transportation Program (STP) ­ The Surface Transportation Program consists of
federal funding administered by the State of Wyoming. The STP provides flexible funding that
may be used by States and localities for projects on any Federal-aid highway.

State Highway Funding - The State of Wyoming allocates funds from the State's 4th penny tax
to each WYDOT District, and individual projects are selected for funding based on public
involvement, engineering studies, and the collective judgment of the Transportation Commission
and WYDOT.

Impact Fees - The City of Cheyenne and Laramie County can require developers to pay for
improvements needed to facilitate development activities through an impact fee system.

Taxing mechanisms - Laramie County has the ability to impose a sales tax to fund specific,
well defined projects. To utilize this funding source, county commissioners must include a
project on the ballot and the ballot measure must pass with a majority vote.

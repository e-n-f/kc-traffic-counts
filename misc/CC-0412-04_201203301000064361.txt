Subject: Bailey Boswell and Comanche Springs Analysis

Mark and Dolph:

Per your request we have analyzed the existing operations at the Bailey Boswell and Comanche Springs intersection. We
collected traffic counts and accident data to perform our analysis. Based on our analysis a traffic signal is warranted. We
also believe a traffic signal will improve the safety at this intersection. See attached tech memo for a detailed report.

Our recommendations are as follows:

    ·   Option 1- Install a temporary span wire signal at this intersection with no roadway improvements.
        Construction Cost Estimate at $40,000 (Assumes utilizing the existing equipment salvaged from the Old Decatur
        and Bailey Boswell signal).
        Engineering Estimate $15,000 (includes bidding)- Note: this number could be reduced if we will just need to
        provide basic drawings and phasing information for a contractor to install.
        Total Estimated Cost- $55,000

    ·   Option 2 -Widen the existing pavement to install an east bound left turn lane and install temporary signal
        Construction Cost Estimate- $115,000 -(pavement widening only (no overlay)- $75,000)
        Survey and Engineering Estimate- $35,000 (includes bidding)
        Total Estimated Cost- $150,000

Please let us know if you need additional information or have any questions.

Sorry for the delay.

Thanks, Dana

Subject: Operations Analysis
         Comanche Springs Drive & Bailey Boswell Road

Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to conduct an operations analysis
study for the existing stop controlled "T" intersection of Comanche
Springs Drive and Bailey Boswell Road in the City of Saginaw,
Texas.

Existing Conditions

Comanche Springs Drive is currently a four-lane divided facility
with a posted speed limit of 30 mph at its intersection with Bailey
Boswell Road. Comanche Springs Drive forms the southbound
approach of a three (3) leg intersection with Bailey Boswell Road
and is stop controlled. This section of Comanche Springs Drive's
existing pavement is approximately sixty (60) feet wide. Based on
the City of Saginaw, Texas 2011 Comprehensive Master Plan and
CIP Master Thoroughfare Plan, Comanche Springs Drive is a
Local Street (two-lane undivided facility). This roadway is built to
its ultimate cross section.

Bailey Boswell Road is currently a four-lane undivided facility with
a posted speed limit of 40 mph at its intersection with Comanche
Springs Drive. This section of Bailey Boswell Road's existing
pavement is approximately forty-eight (48) feet wide, and is divided
evenly by existing lane and center lines. Both approaches of
Bailey Boswell Road at Comanche Springs Drive are uncontrolled.
Based on the City of Saginaw, Texas 2011 Comprehensive Master
Plan and CIP Master Thoroughfare Plan, Bailey Boswell Road is a

Principal Arterial (six-lane divided facility) and is not built to its
ultimate cross section at its intersection with Comanche Springs
Drive.

Exhibit 1 presents the existing lane use configurations, traffic
control devices, and existing volumes at this intersection.

Study Procedure

The Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (Texas
MUTCD) defines that the installation of signal should be based on
an engineering study. The Texas MUTCD also defines nine (9)
warrants, or justifying set of conditions, which at least one of which
should be fully satisfied before signalization is considered as an
option for traffic control. Factors included in the evaluation of
these warrants include vehicle and pedestrian traffic volumes, the
number of traffic lanes, the prevailing traffic speeds, traffic accident
experience, and measured delay for minor street traffic.

Directional recording machine (24-hour) counts and Turning
Movement Counts were collected on Tuesday, February 28, 2012.
The previously mentioned Exhibit 1 presents the daily and peak
hour traffic volumes. Copies of the raw count sheets have been
provided in the Appendix.

Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis

An existing conditions analysis was completed to determine
whether or not the current conditions warrant a traffic signal.
Based upon the analysis, a traffic signal is warranted per the
Texas MUTCD under Warrant 2 (Four Hour Volumes) and Warrant
3 (Peak Hour Volumes). Table 1 summarizes the warrant studies.

It should be noted that five (5) recorded accidents have occurred
at the intersection in the past 12 months. Even though the
accident history does not cause the intersection to meet signal
warrants, three (3) of the previously mentioned accidents may
have been prevented by a traffic signal. Exhibit 2 summarizes the
crash history at the study intersection.

The traffic signal warrant study report summary can be seen in the
Appendix.

    Existing Capacity Analysis

    Capacity defines the volume of traffic that can be accommodated
    by a roadway at a specified "level-of-service." Capacity is affected
    by various geometric factors including roadway type (e.g. divided
    or undivided), number of lanes, lane widths, and grades. Level-of-
    service (LOS), which is a measure of the degree of congestion,
    ranges from LOS A (free flowing) to LOS F (a congested, forced
    flow condition). LOS C is typically considered to be the minimum
    acceptable level of service for design and evaluation purposes,
    while LOS D is considered acceptable for long-term planning due
    to the uncertainty of study assumptions.
    Existing intersection level of service analysis was performed to
    evaluate the existing intersection's operation during the AM and
    PM peak hours. For analysis purposes, Bailey Boswell Road was
    considered the EB/WB facility and Comanche Springs Drive was
    considered the NB/SB facility. Using the Synchro 6TM software,
    both AM and PM peak hour intersection level of service analyses
    were completed. Based on the results of the capacity analysis, the
    intersection of Comanche Springs Drive & Bailey Boswell Road
    does not operate at an acceptable level of service during both the
    AM and PM peak hours. The results can be seen in Table 2.
    Synchro 6TM output sheets are provided in the Appendix.

Based on the existing capacity analysis and traffic signal warrant
analysis, we recommend the installation of a traffic signal.

Auxiliary Lanes

Based on the existing traffic volumes (125 AM, 85 PM) and future
traffic signal operations (permitted only), we recommend that the
City install a left-turn lane for the eastbound intersection approach.
A traffic signal could be installed as an interim measure until the
left-turn lane could be constructed. The proposed eastbound left-
turn lane would not have a large impact of the intersection level of
service, but would assist in the overall safety of the roadway.

Signalized Conditions Capacity Analysis

Level of service analysis was performed to evaluate the
intersection's signalized operation during the AM and PM peak
hours. This analysis was completed both with and without the
previously mentioned eastbound and westbound dedicated turn
lanes. Using the Synchro 6TM software, both AM and PM peak
hour intersection level of service analyses were completed. Table
3 presents the results of the analysis and illustrates the benefit of
constructing the previously mentioned eastbound and westbound
dedicated turn lanes. Synchro 6TM output sheets are provided in
the Appendix.

Other Observations

With the installation of a traffic signal, we recommend that the City
evaluate the realignment of the future collector to the west of
Comanche Springs Drive as seen in the City of Saginaw, Texas
2011 Comprehensive Master Plan and CIP Master Thoroughfare
Plan so that it intersects the study intersection.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we offer the following recommendations
and conclusions:

    A traffic signal is warranted under Warrant 2 (Four Hour
    Volumes) and Warrant 3 (Peak Hour Volumes). It is our
    recommendation that a traffic signal be installed at the
    intersection of Comanche Springs Drive & Bailey Boswell
    Road.

    We recommend that the City install an eastbound left-turn,
    although this can be completed after the signal installation.

    Exhibit 3 illustrates the left turn lane improvements.

    With the installation of a traffic signal, we recommend that the
    City consider realigning the future collector to the west of
    Comanche Springs Drive as seen in the City of Saginaw, Texas
    2011 Comprehensive Master Plan and CIP Master
    Thoroughfare Plan so that it intersects the study intersection.

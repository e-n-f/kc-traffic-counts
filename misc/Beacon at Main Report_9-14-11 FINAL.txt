          RE: Main Street at Beacon Street Intersection Reconfiguration
              Laconia, New Hampshire



         INTRODUCTION

         TEC has been retained by the City of Laconia, New Hampshire to prepare a traffic impact
         assessment for the potential conversion of streets in the downtown area to accommodate two-
         way flow on Beacon Street East and Beacon Street West as a means of improving access and
         circulation to the downtown area. As part of this project, TEC has been asked to evaluate the
         intersection of Main Street (NH Route 106) / Beacon Street West / Beacon Street East separately
         to provide preliminary analysis of traffic operations and recommendations for proposed roadway
         geometry. This information will be used by the City's bridge consultant, DuBois and King, Inc., to
         prepare a preliminary bridge design for the reconstruction of the Main Street Bridge over the
         Winnipesaukee River. The entire intersection of Main Street / Beacon Street West / Beacon
         Street East is situated on this unique semi-circular bridge.

         TEC evaluated the traffic operations for the intersections under existing and future conditions.
         This memo examines traffic operations after a 10-year design horizon (2021) traffic volume
         projections, which includes an evaluation of the no-build conditions (without the proposed two-
         way conversion) and build conditions (with the proposed two-way conversion). These conditions
         are compared to determine if the conversion of Beacon Street West and Beacon Street East from
         one-way to two-way will provide a reasonable benefit to traffic operations in the downtown area
         after the project is complete.

         TEC is currently preparing a full traffic impact assessment for the proposed two-way conversation;
         this document will be issued to the City in late September 2011.

Existing Geometry & Traffic Control

Intersections

Main Street / Beacon Street West / Beacon Street East

Main Street (NH Route 106) intersects Beacon Street East and Beacon Street West to form an
unsignalized intersection situated on the Main Street Bridge over the Winnipesaukee River. This
intersection serves as the southern gateway to Downtown Laconia. Although traffic signal
equipment is provided at this intersection, it operates in constant "flash" mode only due to the
limited volume of conflicting traffic and proximity to Union Street. The push buttons at the
southwestern crosswalk activate the traffic signal to switch to red indications for Beacon Street
West (southbound). This operation is no longer recommended in the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD).1 Additionally, the constant flashing operation often leads to a
diminished reaction for approaching drivers because they may be callous to the operation of the
lights. The volume of pedestrian traffic is not expected to exceed the thresholds for full traffic
signal control.

The Beacon Street West (eastbound) approach operates under STOP control (left-turns and
through movements only), while the Main Street northbound approach is free-flowing. There are
no approaching vehicles from Beacon Street East (westbound) or from Main Street (southbound),
north of the intersection, due to the one-way flow. The Beacon Street West (eastbound) approach
provides one shared left-turn / through travel lane and two channelized right-turn lanes that are
free­flowing southbound toward the intersection of Main Street / Union Avenue / Court Street.
The Main Street northbound approach provides one exclusive through lane and one channelized
right-turn lane. The intersection contains crosswalks across all approaches and sidewalks along
each roadway edge. The northern side of the intersection has a pedestrian plaza that is
approximately 20 feet wide at some points.

The two travel lanes on Beacon Street West (southbound) are currently required to navigate
around an aggressive horizontal curve of only 50 feet before the roadway widens as it approaches
Union Avenue. This roadway geometry is unsafe and adds to traffic congestion on Beacon Street
West. The sub-standard roadway geometry can be partially alleviated with a widening of the
southerly bridge abutment and the superstructure toward the west.

Land uses surrounding this area include retail and service establishments, the Landmark Inn
Hotel, the City's parking garage, and recreational and scenic greenspace.

Existing Traffic Volumes

In order to establish existing traffic-volume conditions at the study area intersection, manual
turning movement counts (TMC's) were conducted at the study area intersections during the
midday peak period (11:00 AM to 1:00 PM) on Saturday June 25, 2011 and during the weekday
morning (7:00 to 9:00 AM) and evening (3:00 to 5:00 PM) peak periods on Tuesday, June 28,
2011. A detailed summary of the traffic counts, partitioned into 15-minute intervals, is provided
within Attachment A.

Seasonal Adjustment

Traffic volumes are typically adjusted to reflect peak-month conditions in accordance with the
New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) standards for preparation of a traffic
study. A review of historic traffic-volume counts collected by NHDOT at the permanent count
stations in Belmont, Meredith, and Gilford indicated that traffic volumes in June are 1.9 percent
lower than peak-month conditions during the weekday morning peak period, 3.2 percent lower
than peak-month conditions during the weekday evening peak hour period and 7.2 percent lower
than peak-month conditions during the Saturday midday peak period. Therefore, the June traffic
volumes were upwardly increased accordingly to reflect peak-month conditions.

Seasonal adjustment factors applied to the traffic-volume networks are reflective of average June
conditions compared to peak-month conditions. As the traffic volume data utilized in this study
was observed late in June between "Bike Week" and the 4th of July Holiday Weekend, the
seasonal adjustment represents a conservative value based on the raw data corresponding more
to a summer value than traffic volumes that would be seen earlier in June when schools are still
is session.

The seasonal adjustment data is provided in Attachment B. The resulting 2011 Existing weekday
morning, weekday evening, and Saturday midday peak-hour traffic-volume networks are
illustrated in Figure 3.

FUTURE CONDITIONS

Background Traffic Growth

Traffic-volume data compiled from NHDOT permanent count stations near Downtown Laconia
were researched in order to determine traffic growth trends. These sources show that traffic is
decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.5 percent per year. In order to provide a conservative
(worse-case) analysis scenario, TEC used a 1.0 percent growth rate compounded annually to
account for general background traffic growth and private developments not yet identified. See
Attachment C for traffic growth rate calculations.

Re-occupancy of Vacant Space

TEC is in the process of coordinating with the City of Laconia Planning Department to identify the
vacant retail and office space along Main Street and Pleasant Street in order to project a
conservative value for future traffic volumes in the downtown area. Table 1 presents a
preliminary estimate of generated trips for the re-occupancy of the vacant space.

No-Build Traffic Volumes

The 2021 No-Build weekday morning, weekday evening, and Saturday midday peak-hour traffic-
volume networks were developed by applying the 1.0 percent annual background traffic growth
rate to the 2011 Existing peak-hour traffic volumes over 10 years and adding the traffic to be
generated by the re-occupancy of vacant space along Main Street and Pleasant Street. The
resulting 2021 No-Build weekday morning, evening, and Saturday peak hour traffic volumes for
the intersection of Main Street / Beacon Street East / Beacon Street West are illustrated in
Figure 3.

Redistribution of One-Way Traffic

In order to establish future converted-flow traffic-volume conditions at the study area intersection,
an origin-destination study (O-D study) was conducted at key intersections in the downtown area
on Tuesday June 28, 2011 during the weekday afternoon peak period (3:00 PM ­ 5:00 PM). TEC
staff collected license plate data at designated locations, which was later analyzed to determine
the origin and destination of vehicles circulating around Beacon Street West and East.

The following intersection movements were analyzed during the study:

    1. Through movements from Church Street westbound (Church Street / Beacon Street East)
    2. Right-turns from North Main Street southbound (Church Street / Veterans Square / Main
       Street / North Main Street)
    3. All movements from Veterans Square southbound (Veterans Square / Beacon Street
       West / Pleasant Street)
    4. Left-turns and through movements from Beacon Street West eastbound (Beacon Street
       West / Beacon Street East / Main Street)
    5. Through movements from Main Street northbound (Beacon Street West / Beacon Street
       East / Main Street)

This data was utilized to estimate the percentage of vehicles conducting the following O-D
movements in order to redistribute them based on the conversion of Beacon Street East and
Beacon Street West from one-way flow to two-way flow:

    1. Church Street westbound motorists that circulate on Veterans Square and Beacon Street
       West to access Main Street (in the core of downtown) or Beacon Street East,
    2. Main Street northbound motorists crossing the river that circulate onto Veterans Square,
       Pleasant Street or Water Street to access Pleasant Street and businesses along Beacon
       Street West,
    3. North Main Street southbound motorists that circulate on Veterans Square to access
       Main Street northbound or Beacon Street East in downtown.

TEC did not collect O-D data for vehicles on South Main Street or Union Street northbound that
may utilize Fair Street to access businesses or residences on Pleasant Street, Water Street, or
elsewhere on the west side of Downtown. This is expected to be a low volume of traffic that will
not noticeably change the results of the analyses.

The Two-way Flow Redistribution is graphically depicted in Figure 4. A detailed summary of the
origin-destination data and current travel trends is provided within Attachment D.

Build Traffic Volumes

The 2021 Build condition traffic-volume networks consist of the 2021 No-Build traffic volumes
with the addition of the anticipated traffic redistributed to and from Beacon Street East and West
from the conversion of both Beacon Street East and Beacon Street West from one-way flow to
two-way flow. The 2021 Build weekday morning, weekday evening, and Saturday midday peak-
hour traffic volumes are graphically depicted in Figure 4.




                                                                                    Page 8 of 16
TRAFFIC OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

Measuring existing and future traffic volumes quantifies traffic flow within the study area. To
assess the quality of flow, roadway capacity and vehicle queue analyses were conducted under
Existing, No-Build, and Build traffic-volume conditions. Capacity analyses provide an indication of
how well the roadway facilities serve the traffic demands placed upon them, with vehicle queue
analyses providing a secondary measure of the operational characteristics of an intersection or
section of roadway under study.

Methodology

A primary result of capacity analyses is the assignment of level-of-service to traffic facilities under
various traffic-flow conditions.2 The concept of level-of-service is defined as a qualitative measure
describing operational conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by motorists and/or
passengers. A level-of-service definition provides an index to quality of traffic flow in terms of
such factors as speed, travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort,
convenience, and safety.

Six levels of service are defined for each type of facility. They are given letter designations from A
to F, with level-of-service (LOS) A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F
representing the worst.

Since the level of service of a traffic facility is a function of the traffic flows placed upon it, such a
facility may operate at a wide range of levels of service, depending on the time of day, day of
week, or period of year.

The six Levels of Service (LOS) for unsignalized intersections may be described as follows:

        LOS A represents a condition with little or no control delay to minor street traffic.
        LOS B represents a condition with short control delays to minor street traffic.
        LOS C represents a condition with average control delays to minor street traffic.
        LOS D represents a condition with long control delays to minor street traffic.
        LOS E represents operating condition at or near capacity level, with very long control
        delays to minor street traffic.
        LOS F represents a condition where minor street demand volume exceeds capacity of an
        approach lane, with excessive control delays resulting.

The levels of service of unsignalized intersections are determined by application of a procedure
described in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. Level of service is measured in terms of
average control delay. Mathematically, control delay is a function of the capacity and degree of
saturation of the lane group and/or approach under study and is a quantification of motorist
delay associated with traffic control devices such as traffic signals and STOP signs. Control delay
includes the affects of initial deceleration delay approaching a STOP sign, stopped delay, queue
move-up time, and final acceleration delay from a stopped condition. Definitions for level of
service at unsignalized intersections are also given in the 2000 edition of the Highway Capacity
Manual. Table 2 on the following page summarizes the relationship between level of service and
average control delay.

Unsignalized Intersection Capacity Analysis Summary

Table 3 below provides a summary of the results of the capacity analysis for the intersection of
Main Street / Beacon Street West / Beacon Street East during each peak period.

All movements at the intersection are anticipated to operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS
C or better) under all analysis scenarios. There is no significant increase in delay per vehicle with
the implementation of two-way flow on both Beacon Street East and Beacon Street West. The
queue for the Beacon Street West (eastbound) approach is not expected to exceed three vehicles
under 2021 Build conditions. However, the two southbound through lanes are often impacted by
queues that extend back from the signalized intersection at Union Avenue / Court Street, which is
currently operating in a pre-timed mode.

Under a separate contract, the City of Laconia is currently improving the vehicle detection at the
intersection of Main Street / Union Avenue / Court Street, which will allow it to operate in a fully-
actuated mode. This will allow the traffic signal to sense the presence of vehicles and more
efficiently service waiting vehicles. This will partially alleviate the queue of traffic on Beacon
Street West (southbound) that can, at times, extend back to Water Street. Additional capacity
improvements may be required at the intersection of Main Street / Union Avenue / Court Street in
the future.

PROPOSED INTERSECTION RECONSTRUCTION

TEC has prepared a draft conceptual layout plan for the intersection of Main Street / Beacon
Street East / Beacon Street East that accommodates the conversion of both Beacon Street East
and Beacon Street West from one-way flow to two-way flow. A graphical depiction of the proposed
conceptual layout plan is presented in Attachment F. The following is a summary of the
conceptual layout plan.

Main Street (south of intersection)

        The Main Street northbound approach should be restriped to provide an 11-foot shared
        left-turn / through lane, an 11-foot exclusive right-turn lane, and 2-foot shoulders on both
        sides. The existing channelized right-turn lane can be reconfigured with a tighter radius of
        45 feet to induce slower turning speeds onto Beacon Street East. The triangular traffic
        island can be replaced with a striped island to better accommodate trucks with smaller
        curb line radii. The approach can continue to operate with a free-flow condition to move
        traffic away from Union Avenue and efficiently process traffic into Downtown.
        The existing sidewalk along the southeasterly (upstream) edge of the bridge structure
        should be maintained. Depending on the layout of the bridge structure, raised planters or
        pavers can be installed to delineate the roadway and the widened sidewalk area. This
        area is often used as an extension of the adjacent park spaces.

Main Street (north of intersection)

        Main Street north of the intersection should remain one-way away from the intersection
        due to the level of parking impacts associated with a two-way conversion. Main Street
        can be re-striped to better align the receiving lanes for the minor shift in the shared left-
        turn / through lane along Main Street northbound. In addition, 2-foot shoulders should be
        striped up to the on-street parking on the west side of Main Street.
        These improvements are not expected to require the removal of any on-street parking
        spaces.

Beacon Street East (east of intersection)

        Beacon Street East can be converted from one-way flow to two-way flow. The new
        southwestbound approach can be restriped as an 11-foot exclusive right-turn lane with 2-
        foot shoulders on either side. The approach will operate under STOP control. TEC does
        not recommend a provision for left turns or through movements from Beacon Street East
        onto Beacon Street West due to the increased level of traffic conflict.
        The adjacent Beacon Street East receiving lane can be striped at 11 feet wide. At the
        intersection, the two opposing lanes can be separated by a new triangular island. Beyond
        this point, two-way traffic on Beacon Street East would be separated by a double-yellow
        centerline (DYCL).
        The curb distance from the edge of the Parking Garage Building and the existing bridge
        structure should be increased on Beacon Street East to provide a minimum 5-foot
        sidewalk. The sidewalk can be constructed to meet the existing sidewalk under the
        parking structure. Landscape planters or pavers should be installed on both sides of
        Beacon Street East to better delineate the roadway from the edge of pedestrian space.
        The improvements, as shown, which include 9-foot sidewalks on the bridge side of the
        street, can be completed without permanent impacts to on-street parking spaces along
        the southeasterly edge of the street by restriping the stalls with standard 8'x22'
        dimensions. This results in the travelway narrowing to accommodate proposed geometry


                                                                                  Page 13 of 16
       without widening the roadway. A 9-foot sidewalk will be maintained on the easterly side
       of the roadway as it is part of the City's Riverwalk and provides access between two parks
       and nearby parking areas. In addition, this sidewalk is a popular fishing location and
       requires additional width to accommodate fishing and pedestrians.

Beacon Street West (west of intersection)

       Beacon Street West can also be converted from one-way flow to two-way flow. The
       eastbound approach can be re-striped to provide an 11-foot shared left-turn / through
       lane, two 11-foot channelized right-turn lanes (bound for South Main Street or Union
       Avenue), and 2-foot shoulders on both sides of the roadway. The two channelized right-
       turn lanes can be tapered to meet the three lanes where Main Street meets Union
       Avenue. These right-turn lanes can continue to operate under free-flow control. The
       Beacon Street West (eastbound) shared left-turn / through lane should continue to
       operate under STOP control. A 6-foot sidewalk should be reconstructed in a new
       alignment along the southwesterly edge of the bridge. This sidewalk is part of the City's
       Riverwalk and provides access between several parking areas and retail land uses in the
       downtown area. It is also a popular fishing location. Therefore, a 6-foot sidewalk is
       recommended to accommodate the high pedestrian traffic volumes and fishing activities.
       The adjacent Beacon Street West receiving lane (new with the two-way conversion) can be
       striped at 11 feet wide with a wider throat where it meets Main Street. Two-way traffic on
       Beacon Street West will be separated by a double-yellow centerline (DYCL).
       These improvements will require the widening of the existing bridge structure to
       accommodate a fourth travel lane. The proposed layout improves the horizontal
       alignment of the Beacon Street West (southbound) curb lines from a 50-foot radius to a
       100-foot radius.
       The crosswalk at the southeasterly corner of the intersection (crossing the two
       southbound lanes from Beacon Street West) should be accompanied by a pedestrian-
       activated flashing warning beacon that illuminates when a push button is depressed.
       Alternatively, the system can be designed with "passive" detection equipment that will
       illuminate the beacon without requiring a pedestrian to push a button. Both options are
       expected to provide better notification to drivers as the beacons will remain dark when
       not in use.

Other Design Considerations

       Truck Turning Radii

       In order to reduce the footprint on the intersection, TEC assumed that a tractor trailer
       truck will be allowed to utilize both lanes on Main Street northbound in order to turn onto
       Beacon Street West and Beacon Street East. As traffic from Union Avenue, Court Street,
       and South Main Street operates within one lane, it is not likely to result in any safety
       degradation.

       Alternate Forms of Traffic Control

       Traffic Signal ­ Based on criteria in Chapter 4 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
       Devices (MUTCD), the traffic volumes entering the intersection from Beacon Street West
       will not be sufficient to warrant the installation of a traffic signal. It is possible that the
       proposed bridge can be designed to accommodate anchor bolts for MUTCD-compliant
       signal equipment, pullboxes, and conduit in the event that full traffic signal control is
       warranted in the future.


                                                                                   Page 14 of 16
       Modern Roundabout ­ The construction of a roundabout is not appropriate because there
       is a high volume of "through" traffic and a limited volume of turning traffic at this
       intersection, which is essentially limited to the Beacon Street West approach. The queues
       that extend back from the traffic signal at Union Avenue will impact the flow of traffic
       around a roundabout because there is a limited stacking distance between the
       intersections. If traffic from the newly introduced approach from Beacon Street East
       (assuming two-way conversion) is allowed to use the roundabout to access points to the
       south, those motorists may block conflicting northbound traffic seeking to enter
       Downtown. The blocking may occur until the Main Street southbound approach to Union
       Avenue / Court Street gets the green light and the queue dissipates.


CONCLUSIONS

TEC has prepared this memorandum as a preliminary summary of the merits of the proposed two-
way conversion of Beacon Street West and Beacon Street East. Although the full analysis will be
presented in a subsequent detailed traffic impact assessment, there appears to be sufficient
merit in the proposed two-way conversion to offer recommendations regarding lane geometry.
TEC recommends that the City retain the existing unsignalized traffic control at this location as it
will continue to be the most efficient method to process vehicles accessing and egressing the
downtown area. The following is a summary of the analysis results and our early conclusions:

       Beacon Street East, Beacon Street West, and Main Street (north of the intersection)
       currently operate under one-way flow. The Beacon Street West eastbound approach
       will continue to operate efficiently under STOP control with Level of Service C or
       better during each peak period while the Main Street northbound approach operates
       under free-flow conditions.
       The proposed conversion of Beacon Street East and Beacon Street West is not
       expected to significantly increase the delay or resultant vehicle queues at their
       intersection with Main Street.
       In order to reduce the number of conflicting turning movements, TEC recommends
       channelizing the new westbound approach on Beacon Street East as a right-turn-only
       onto Main Street northbound.
       The alterations to lane configuration and the addition of a fourth travel lane on
       Beacon Street West will require a widening of the existing bridge structure footprint
       toward the west (downstream) end of the structure. The bridge footprint on the east
       (upstream) end can be maintained in the same approximate location. This bridge
       widening is required in order to maintain a 9-foot sidewalk on the easterly side of the
       bridge and a 6-foot sidewalk on the westerly side of the bridge. The sidewalk on the
       easterly side provides a connection between two parks and nearby parking areas and
       is a popular fishing location. The sidewalk on the westerly side is part of the City's
       Riverwalk and has a high volume of pedestrian traffic as it provides access between
       parking areas and retail land uses in the downtown area. This sidewalk is also a
       popular fishing location.
       The widening of the bridge will be minor in nature and occur only on the westerly
       side. No further abutments will be required to accommodate this widening.
       The proposed improvements to travel lanes and the conversion to two-way flow
       should not affect on-street parking in the vicinity of the Main Street / Beacon Street
       West / Beacon Street East Intersection.
       The existing bridge provides a substandard geometry, which results in unsafe
       conditions and is difficult to navigate, increasing traffic congestion in the downtown


                                                                                 Page 15 of 16
       area.   The proposed improvements will improve safety by addressing the
       substandard geometry and will reduce traffic congestion on Beacon Street West.

In conclusion, the traffic redistributed by the proposed two-way flow conversion can be safely
and efficiently accommodated at the subject intersection. TEC recommends that the City
coordinate with NHDOT as part of the preliminary bridge design effort to incorporate these
recommendations.

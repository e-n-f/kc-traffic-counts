                                            I. Introduction

Project Overview

This traffic impact study addresses the capacity, geometric, and control requirements associated
with the proposed development entitled Culver's Restaurant. The development site is approximately
1.0 acre in size and is located within the Town of Parker at the northeast corner of Twenty Mile Road
and Mainstreet.

The study scope and level of analysis needed for this in-fill development was coordinated with Town
Staff on February 27, 2014 and is intended to comply with the limited scope of a redevelopment
traffic study as defined in Section 5.4 of the Town's Roadway Design and Construction Criteria
Manual. The Town's standard checklist of required traffic impact study items is included for
reference in Appendix A.


Study Area Boundaries

The study area examined in this analysis encompasses the Stage Run intersections with Twenty
Mile Road and Dransfeldt Road, and the intersection of Mainstreet and Existing Access. Private
drive intersections that are immediately adjacent to site development and located internal to the
Twenty Mile Road, Mainstreet and Dransfeldt Road boundary are considered secondary
intersections. These secondary intersections were excluded from analysis as coordinated with Town
Staff.

Figure 1 illustrates general site location and study intersections.


Site Description and Access

Land for the development is vacant and surrounded by a mix of commercial, residential, office,
entertainment, restaurant and retail land uses. Previous site development intentions are unknown.

The proposed development is understood to entail the construction of an approximate 4,000 square
foot quick serve restaurant with drive-through window.

Primary site access exists at the following locations: One right-in/right-out movement access onto
Twenty Mile Road, one right-in/right-out movement access on Mainstreet between Twenty Mile Road
and Dransfeldt Road, and one full movement access on Dransfeldt Road at Stage Run.

For purposes of this study, it is anticipated that development construction would not be phased and
be completed by end of Year 2016.

A preliminary site plan, as prepared by Galloway, is shown on Figure 2. This site plan is provided for
illustrative purposes only.

Existing and Committed Surface Transportation Network

Within the study area, Twenty Mile Road, Mainstreet and Dransfeldt Road are the primary roadways
that will accommodate traffic to and from the proposed development. Stage Run is a secondary
roadway. A brief description of the roadways is provided below:


        Mainstreet is a 40 MPH, east-west arterial roadway having four through lanes (two lanes in
        each direction) with a combination of shared and exclusive turn lanes at intersections.

        Twenty Mile Road is a four lane, north-south, arterial roadway with turn lane configurations
        and posted speed limit similar to Mainstreet.

        Dransfeldt Road is a north-south major collector roadway having four through lanes (two
        lanes in each direction). There are combinations of exclusive and shared turning lanes within
        the proximity of the site. North of Mainstreet, Dransfeldt Road is a three lane roadway
        section having one southbound through lane. The posted speed limit is 35 MPH.

        Stage Run is a 25 MPH, two lane, east-west roadway that provides area businesses with
        limited local access to Twenty Mile Road, Mainstreet, and Dransfeldt Road. Combinations
        of exclusive and shared turning lanes exist at intersections with Twenty Mile Road and
        Dransfeldt Road.


The Stage Run and Dransfeldt Road intersection is signalized. Twenty Mile Road and Mainstreet
intersections with Stage Run and existing site access operate under a stop-controlled condition. A
stop-controlled intersection is defined as a roadway intersection where vehicle rights-of-way are
controlled by one or more "STOP" signs.

Town Transportation plans describe Twenty Mile Road and Mainstreet as an arterial having an
ultimate four lane roadway section (two through lanes in each direction). Dransfeldt Road is defined
as a major collector. No future roadway classification is defined for Stage Run.

No specific improvements for Twenty Mile Road, Mainstreet, Dransfeldt Road or Stage Run are
known to be committed at this time, and the area roadways are built to their ultimate cross-section.

                                                  II. Existing Traffic Conditions

AM and PM Peak Hour turning movement traffic counts were collected at the Stage Run
intersections of Twenty Mile Road and Dransfeldt Road. Peak hour traffic counts were also collected
at the existing Mainstreet and site access intersection. These counts are shown on Figure 3. Traffic
count data is included for reference in Appendix A. 24-hour volume counts were not collected
because of the degree of analysis required with this redevelopment traffic study. Through traffic on
Twenty Mile Road and Mainstreet is divided by raised median. Peak hour traffic volumes for
southbound and eastbound through movements on Twenty Mile Road and Mainstreet were derived
from traffic counts collected with the adjacent Vanterra Apartments development.

The Signalized and Unsignalized Intersection Analysis techniques, as published in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) by the Transportation Research Board and as incorporated into the
SYNCHRO computer program, were used to analyze the study intersections for existing traffic
conditions. These techniques allow for the determination of intersection level of service (LOS) based
on the congestion and delay of each traffic movement.

The level of service analyses results for existing conditions are summarized in Table 1.

Definitions of levels of service are given in Appendix B. Intersection capacity worksheets are
provided in Appendix C.

                  III. Future Traffic Conditions without Proposed Development

Background traffic is the traffic projected to be on area roadways without consideration of the
proposed development. Background traffic includes traffic generated by development of vacant
parcels in the area.

Pursuant to the non-committed area roadway improvements discussion provided in Section I,
background traffic conditions assume no roadway improvements to accommodate regional
transportation demands.

Since the construction of this small in-fill development is expected to occur well before Year 2016, no
annual growth rate was applied to existing traffic volumes to account for projected increases in
background traffic. However, vehicle trip generation estimates for the remaining 5.2 acres of un-
developed parcels, immediately adjacent to the development site, were considered for analysis and
are later discussed in Section V of this study.

                                                IV. Proposed Project Traffic

Vehicle Trip Generation

Standard traffic generation characteristics compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) in their report entitled Trip Generation, 9th Edition, were applied to the proposed restaurant use
in order to estimate average daily traffic (ADT), AM Peak Hour, and PM Peak Hour vehicle trips.

A vehicle trip is defined as a one-way vehicle movement from a point of origin to a point of
destination.

Trip generation rates used in this study are presented in Table 2.

Table 3 illustrates that the proposed restaurant development has the potential to generate
approximately 1,984 daily trips with 182 of those occurring during the AM Peak Hour and 131 during
the PM Peak Hour.

Adjustments to Vehicle Trip Generation Rates

While a development of this type is likely to attract trips from within area land uses as well as pass-
by trips from the adjacent roadway system, no trip reduction was taken in this study. This
assumption provides for a conservative analysis.


Vehicle Trip Distribution

The overall directional distribution of site-generated traffic was determined based on proposed and
existing area land uses, allowed turning movements, and available roadway network.

Trip distribution patterns for the development are shown on Figure 4.


Vehicle Trip Assignment

Traffic assignment is how generated and distributed vehicle trips are expected to be loaded onto the
available roadway network.

Applying trip distribution patterns to site-generated traffic provides the overall site-generated trip
assignments shown on Figure 4.

                         V. Future Traffic Forecasts with Proposed Development

Site-generated traffic was added to existing traffic volumes to develop total traffic projections. For
analysis purposes, it was assumed that development build-out would occur by end of Year 2016.
The projected Year 2016 total traffic volumes and intersection geometry are shown in Figure 5.

Included in the Year 2016 total traffic scenario are vehicle trip generation estimates for the remaining
5.2 acres of un-developed parcels that are located immediately north and east of the development
site. The assumed land uses are described as:

          A sit-down restaurant on 2.1 acres to be located in the southwest quadrant of the Stage
          Run/Private Drive intersection, west of Dransfeldt Road. Sit-down restaurants commonly
          range in size between 5,000 to 8,000 square feet. The larger size restaurant is assumed for
          a conservative analysis.
          A fast-food restaurant with drive-through window on a 0.85 acre lot located at northwest
          corner of Mainstreet/Private Drive and immediately east of the development site. This use is
          estimated to be 1,500 square feet, based on typical fast-food uses.
          A retail building of varying users (defined by ITE as Specialty Retail) for the remaining 2.25
          acres is assumed to be located in the southeast quadrant of the Stage Run/Private Drive
          intersection, east of Twenty Mile Road. This use is estimated to be 19,600 square feet upon
          general application of a 0.20 floor area ratio.

A trip generation analysis of these potential uses was conducted based on standard ITE rates.
Table 4 summarizes this analysis.

distribution patterns indicated on Figure 4. The resultant traffic projections were then added to the
total traffic volumes to obtain the volumes depicted on Figure 5.

As with existing traffic, the operations of the study intersections were analyzed under projected total
traffic conditions using the SYNCHRO computer program. Total traffic level of service analysis
results for Year 2016 is summarized in Table 5.

Total Traffic Analysis Results upon Development Build-Out

Table 5 shows that the signalized Stage Run intersection at Dransfeldt Road, upon development
build-out (Year 2016) with conservative assumptions defined in this study is projected to have an
overall operation at LOS A during peak traffic hours.

All other unsignalized study intersections are expected to operate at LOS B or better during the
morning and afternoon peak hour.

No mitigation to Year 2016 intersection operation results appear needed since the Town's minimum
acceptable level of service goal (LOS D) has not been exceeded.

                                          VII. Conclusion

This redevelopment traffic impact study addressed the capacity, geometric, and control requirements
associated with the proposed development entitled Culver's Restaurant. This development is
located within the Town of Parker at the northeast corner of Twenty Mile Road and Mainstreet.

The study area examined in this analysis encompasses the Stage Run intersections with Twenty
Mile Road and Dransfeldt Road, and the intersection of Mainstreet and existing site access.

Analysis was conducted for critical AM Peak Hour and PM Peak Hour traffic operations for existing
traffic conditions and Year 2016 total traffic conditions. No analysis for background or long term total
traffic conditions was provided due to degree of in-fill development proposed and traffic analysis
requirements defined by Town Staff.

Analysis of existing traffic conditions indicates that the signalized intersection of Stage Run and
Dransfeldt Road operates overall at LOS A during both morning and afternoon peak traffic hours.
The stop-controlled intersections of Stage Run and Twenty Mile Road, and existing site access and
Mainstreet have right-in/right-out turn movement operates at or better than LOS B during peak traffic
hours.

Analysis of future traffic conditions indicate that the addition of site-generated traffic, including
assumed future development, is minimal and expected to create no discernable impact to traffic
operations for the existing and surrounding roadway. With all conservative assumptions defined in
this analysis, study intersections are projected to operate at future levels of service comparable to
existing peak hour traffic conditions. Site access is compliant to Town's desired standards for
intersection performance.

Level of Service Definitions
   The following information can be found in the Highway Capacity Manual, Transportation Research Board, 2010:
           Chapter 18  Signalized Intersections and Chapter 19  Two-Way Stop Controlled Intersections.

                      Automobile Level of Service (LOS) for Signalized Intersections

Levels of service are defined to represent reasonable ranges in control delay.

LOS A
     Describes operations with a control delay of 10s/veh or less and a volume-to-capacity ratio no greater than 1.0.
This level is typically assigned when the volume-to-capacity ratio is low and either progression is exceptionally
favorable or the cycle length is very short. If it is due to favorable progression, most vehicles arrive during the green
indication and travel through the intersection without stopping.

LOS B
     Describes operations with control delay between 10 and 20 s/veh and a volume-to-capacity ratio no greater than
1.0. This level is typically assigned when the volume-to-capacity ratio is low and either progression is highly favorable
or the cycle length is short. More vehicles stop than with LOS A.

LOS C
     Describes operations with control delay between 20 and 35 s/veh and a volume-to-capacity ratio no greater than
1.0. This level is typically assigned when progression is favorable or the cycle length is moderate. Individual cycle
failures (i.e., one or more queued vehicles are not able to depart as a result of insufficient capacity during the cycle)
may begin to appear at this level. The number of vehicles stopping is .significant, although many vehicles still pass
through the intersection without stopping.

LOS D
     Describes operations with control delay between 35 and 55 s/veh and a volume-to-capacity ratio no greater than
1.0.This level is typically assigned when the volume-to-capacity ratio is high and either progression is ineffective or
the cycle length is long. Many vehicles stop and individual cycle failures are noticeable.

LOS E
     Describes operations with control delay between 55 and 80 s/veh and a volume-to-capacity ratio no greater than
1.0. This level is typically assigned when the volume-to-capacity ratio is high, progression is unfavorable, and the
cycle length is long. Individual cycle failures are frequent.

LOS F
     Describes operations with control delay exceeding 80 s/veh or a volume-to-capacity ratio greater than 1.0. This
level is typically assigned when the volume-to-capacity ratio is very high, progression is very poor, and the cycle
length is long. Most cycles fail to clear the queue.

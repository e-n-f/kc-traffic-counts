RE:      Traffic Engineering Peer Review
         150 Main Street, LLC
         Finnerty's Village Mixed-Use Development
         Wayland, Massachusetts


Dear Mr. Sarkisian and Mr. Dandrade:

Dermot J. Kelly Associates, Inc. (DJK), Civil Design Group, LLC (CDG) and the project proponent, 150
Main Street, LLC, has completed a response to the TEC, Inc. peer review comments dated December 5,
2012 which reviewed the Traffic Impact and Access Study, Proposed Mixed Use Commercial
Redevelopment Project prepared by Dermot J. Kelly Associates, Inc., dated 7/25/2012 and the Site
Layout Plan, Finnerty's Village, 150 Main Street, LLC prepared by Civil Design Group, LLC dated
10/13/2012. TEC also reviewed the Site Layout Plan, Finnerty's Village, 150 Main Street, LLC prepared
by Civil Design Group, LLC dated 12/7/2012. That Traffic Study and Site Layout Plans were prepared for
the proposed Finnerty's Village Mixed-Use Development project located in the northwest quadrant of the
Main Street/West Plain Street intersection in Wayland, Massachusetts. Each comment is repeated below
and the proponent response follows each comment. It should be noted that the current attached Site
Layout Plan dated 12/7/2012 is not a Final Plan but does represent a working draft plan subject to
additional review and comment.

Additionally, at the request of the Town Planner through TEC, additional peak hour weekday traffic counts
were ordered for the Main Street/West Plain Street intersection between 7 and 9 AM and between 2 and
6 PM. The weekday evening peak hour counts were conducted on Friday December 14, 2012. The
morning peak hour counts should be conducted next week. The results of the evening traffic count
reveals that some turning movements were lower and some turning movements were higher compared to
the May 31, 2012 traffic count. The overall volume of traffic entering the intersection was slightly higher
on December 14 with 1,887 vehicles entering the intersection compared to 1,871 vehicles entering the
intersection in May, 16 vehicle per hour difference.

Comment No. 1

Traffic Study:
     The background growth does not appear to consider other area projects, such as Wayland Town
        Center or Danforth Green. The 1% ambient growth rate will not account for these background
        traffic volumes.

Response:
The Danforth Green residential development project was included for background traffic growth
purposes as noted on page 9 of the initial Traffic Impact & Access Study. As requested, the traffic
volume networks work sheets are shown in the appendix of this report.


Comment No. 2
    The trip generation estimates were appropriately calculated based on industry practice. The
     removal of the drive-thru has a negligible impact on the results.

Response:
No additional response is necessary to address the above comment.


Comment No. 3
    The distribution of the site-generated trips is reasonable based on existing travel patterns. The
     types of land uses are local in nature and are not expected to have a regional draw of patrons.

Response:
No additional response is necessary to address the above comment.


Comment No. 4
    The traffic projections should be updated to show the traffic distribution based on right-in / right-
     out access to Main Street. This will increase the number of left turns occurring at the intersection
     of Main Street / West Plain Street / East Plain Street.

Response:
The revised traffic analysis is reproduced in the appendix of this report and reflects the right-
in/right-out driveway. The analysis was also revised to reflect the requested phasing, timings and
paek hour factors that are requested below. The Level of Service (LOS) summarized in the
appendix of this report reveals that the Main Street/West-East Plain Street intersection currently
operates at LOS C/C/B during the weekday morning, evening and Saturday midday peak hours,
respectively. Under 2017 No Build and 2017 Build Without Mitigation, the intersection will
continue to operate at LOS C/C/B. With the mitigation suggested below, the LOS will deteriorate
slightly to LOS D/D/C. As requested, the network worksheets for this analysis in shown in the
appendix of this report.




                                                                                      12/16/12; 2 of 50

Comment No. 5
    The analysis of the intersection of Main Street (Route 27) at West Plain Street / East Plain Street
     should be updated to reflect the following:
         o The signal phasing should be adjusted to show the northbound lagging phase, during
             which southbound traffic is stopped.

Response:
The revised traffic analysis shown in the appendix of this report reflects the above noted phasing
and timings. It should be noted that the initial traffic analysis was based on the observed traffic
signal phasing and timings at the time of the initial data collection.


Comment No. 6
         o The peak hour factors, which are an indication of the variability of traffic volumes over the
             course of the peak hour, are artificially low because they were calculated on an overall
             intersection basis. They should be adjusted to show the peak hour factor for each
             approach in accordance with industry standards.

Response:
As requested, the revised traffic analysis shown in the appendix of this report reflects the peak
hour factors by approach.


Comment No. 7
         o The lane use should be modeled with the short right-turn lanes so the queuing
             calculations can adjust for lane blockages.

Response:
The initial traffic analysis did analyse the short right-turn lanes at 100 feet. For example, see page
89 of 133 of the July 25, 2012 initial Traffic Impact and Access Study where the eastbound and
westbound right turns lanes are programmed at 100 feet.


Comment No. 8
         o The Main Street movements are on maximum recall, but there is detection on West Plain
             Street and East Plain Street. The intersection could be modeled as semi-actuated. The
             following timings are in the existing traffic signal controller and should be incorporated
             into the analysis:
                   Main Street (all movements): 30 sec green + 5 sec clearance
                   Main Street (northbound lag): 4 sec green + 5 sec clearance
                   East/West Plain Streets: 30 sec green + 5 sec clearance
                   Total cycle length (without pedestrian phase): 79 sec

Response:
The revised traffic analysis shown in the appendix of this report reflects the above noted phasing
and timings.

Comment No. 9
    The study makes no reference to the existing operational deficiencies at the signalized
     intersection. The intersection currently has substandard horizontal geometry, sight distance
     obstructions, ADA/AAB compliance issues for ramps and pedestrian pushbuttons, and non-
     compliant pedestrian and signal indications.

Response:
We are engaged in discussions with appropriate town officials with respect to this comment and
will report back with the resolution of this issue once those discussions have ended.


Comment No. 10
Site Plan & Access Considerations

         TEC has reviewed the number and layout of the driveways accessing the site. The currently
         proposed configuration will allow an efficient distribution of traffic to and from the adjacent
         roadways. However, we recommend the following changes to improve the safety and regulatory
         control of the Main Street driveway:
             o The dumpster and compactor should be relocated to an area north of the proposed
                  transformer and appropriately screened with an architectural wall and dense
                  landscaping. This will remove an unnecessary pedestrian obstruction and conflict point
                  for traffic.

Response:
The proposed dumpster and compactor enclosure has been relocated to the northern portion of
the site, approximately 25 feet from the Main Street curb line. The dumpster and compactor will
be housed within an 8' high stockade fence enclosure and screened by dense vegetation as
shown on the Landscape Plan (L-1).


Comment No. 11
         o The curb line geometry for the right-in / right-out should be modified to create a sweeping
             curve to direct exiting motorists to the right or limit the maneuverability for entering left-
             turn movements.

Response:
The curb line geometry for the right-in/right out access on Main Street has been modified to create
a more pronounced sweeping maneuver and to discourage unintended vehicular movements.


Comment No. 12
         o Create a 5-foot wide sidewalk within the new triangular island as a pedestrian refuge
             area. This will increase pedestrian safety by allowing pedestrians to cross one driveway
             movement at a time.

Response:
A five-foot wide sidewalk within the new triangular island has been provided.


                                                                                       12/16/12; 4 of 50

Comment No. 13
         o Coordinate with the Wayland Fire Department to add a landscaped raised island that will
             separate the Main Street northbound travel way from the Fire Department's parking area.
             The raised island could be 10 feet wide and extend approximately 25-30 feet from the
             current northerly curb cut for the fire station. This may better delineate the fire
             department driveway without compromising the ability for the emergency vehicles to
             efficiently exit to respond to calls, and provide an area for the "no left-turn" traffic signs
             related to the newly proposed driveway.

Response:
We are engaged in discussions with appropriate town officials with respect to this comment and
will report back with the resolution of this issue once those discussions have ended.


Comment No. 14
    The sight lines for intersection sight distance can be attained for each driveway if there are no
     prominent visual obstructions greater than 30" in height. The AASHTO-recommended
     intersection sight distance for a 25 mile per hour zone is 280 feet. If the 85th percentile speeds on
     West Plain Street or Main Street are higher than the posted speed limit, the sight lines should be
     increased accordingly. If the proposed patio and outdoor seating area lies within the sight
     triangles, it may be necessary to create a slightly wider landscaped offset from the West Plain
     Street frontage line.

Response:
The Sight Lines have been developed for the three proposed driveways and it appears that the
Sight Lines interference with the patio is very minimal. An Off-Site Mitigation Plan will be
developed and submitted for a review shortly.


Comment No. 15
    With an area of patron congregation in the proposed patio near the access driveways, the
     Applicant should consider ornamental bollards to prevent an errant vehicle from entering the
     space.

Response:
Per our conversation, two (2) ornamental bollards will be utilized, one (1) bollard will be located
along the outside corner of the stone wall at the westerly curb cut on West Plain Street and one
(1) bollard will be located approximately six (6) feet to the north along the outside stone wall of the
same access drive.


Comment No. 16
    With the site's proximity to the Town's recreational fields across the street, coupled with the
     orientation of the municipal sidewalk on the south side of West Plain Street, there is an
     understandable desire line for pedestrians away from the signalized intersection. The Applicant
     should consider establishing a crosswalk with pedestrian warning signs and ADA-compliant
     ramps near the westerly end of the site. This may require reconstruction of a portion of the
     sidewalk on the south side of the street to introduce standard curb reveal.

                                                                                       12/16/12; 5 of 50

Response:
A mid block crosswalk with pedestrian warning signs and ADA compliant ramps will be provided.
Reconstruction of a portion of the sidewalk and curbing on the south side of the street would be
beneficial and we are engaged in discussions with appropriate town officials. We will report back
with the resolution of this comment once those discussions have ended.


Comment No. 17
    The on-site crosswalk between the two buildings does not provide an ADA-compliant accessible
     path near the entrance to the proposed CVS. The row of parking along the westerly face of the
     CVS building may need to shift to the south to provide a 5-foot opening to the sidewalk adjacent
     to the building. TEC recommends that a portion of the quarter-circle area of striping be curbed
     and landscaped to deter motorists from "cutting the corner". Stop signs should be provided on all
     approaches to this internal intersection.

Response:
The onsite crosswalk between the two buildings has been modified to provide an ADA-compliant
path. The quarter circle striping has been modified and now reflects a landscape area and stop
signs have been provided on all legs of the intersection.


Comment No. 18
    The Applicant's designer should provide an exhibit to demonstrate that the delivery and
     emergency access vehicles can traverse the site without impacting curbed islands or other site
     features.

Response:
A Site Circulation Plan will be developed.


Comment No. 19
    The centerlines along the site access aisles should be converted from a single white line to a
     double-yellow centerline. TEC recommends that these lines be limited to the three access
     driveways and the short segments near the internal all-way stop intersection. The directional
     pavement arrows may be limited to the right-out-only driveway onto Main Street southbound. We
     understand the arrows on the current plan are shown for graphical purposes only.

Response:
All double-yellow centerlines (DYCL) were developed and are shown on the Site Plan.


Comment No. 20
Recommended Off-Site Mitigation
    Given the existing deficiencies at the signalized intersection, TEC recommends the Applicant
     address the following critical signal infrastructure improvements:
         o Replace all existing signal posts and signal heads on existing or modified post
             foundations that conform to ADA/AAB and MUTCD requirements.


                                                                                   12/16/12; 6 of 50

             o  Modify the signal phasing to create a northbound advancing protected-permitted
                operation that will require a new 5-section signal head to introduce the clearance phase
                for the left-turn movement.
             o Install new pedestrian pushbuttons and "countdown" pedestrian signal indications in the
                new post locations.
             o Replace defective loop detectors in the pavement surface.
             o Apply new pavement markings and install new traffic signs.
             o Provide two separate ADA/AAB-compliant ramps on the CVS corner and reapply
                crosswalks that correspond to the new ramp locations. This may require a minor
                adjustment to the signal conduit network.
             o Install emergency pre-emption equipment in the cabinet with a secondary priority to the
                existing hardwire connection to the fire station
             o Coordinate with the Wayland Fire Department to confirm the operation of their hardwired
                push button operation of the traffic signal
             The traffic signal and striping improvements listed above are estimated to cost $90,000 to
             $100,000.

Response:
We are engaged in discussions with appropriate town officials with respect to this comment and
will report back with the resolution of this issue once those discussions have ended.


Comment No. 21
    Perform sidewalk improvements along the entire site frontage and a portion of the southerly side
     of West Plain Street associated with a new crosswalk as noted above. TEC recommends
     introducing a 3- to 4-foot grass panel between the roadway and the sidewalk to improve the
     pedestrian experience near the intersection. This is expected to result in approximately $10,000
     is physical improvements that were not originally proposed by the Applicant.

Response:
We are engaged in discussions with appropriate town officials with respect to this comment and
will report back with the resolution of this issue once those discussions have ended.


Comment No. 22
    The Applicant should establish and donate a permanent transportation easement along the West
     Plain Street and Main Street frontages to allow for future geometric improvements at the
     signalized intersection should a future project be advanced by the Town of Wayland. Major
     geometric improvements to the intersection may be excessive given the scope of a private
     development project of this scale.

    TEC recommends a 10-foot reservation along Main Street and a tapered reservation along West
    Plain Street that may facilitate roadway realignment with East Plain Street at some future date. The
    West Plain Street reservation could be approximated as a 25-foot offset from the face of the CVS
    building and extend back into the existing right-of-way line. Based on the structure offsets from the
    frontage lines required to satisfy current zoning requirements, this does not appear to create a
    burden for the Applicant and does not require a change in the layout of the site.

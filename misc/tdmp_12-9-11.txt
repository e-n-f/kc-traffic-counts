Linden Corner                                          i                        Travel Demand Management Plan
     1. Introduction and Summary
                a. Purpose of Report and Study Objectives
                  Linden Hills Redevelopment is proposing to redevelop the
                  northwest corner of West 43rd Street & Sheridan Avenue South in
                  southwest Minneapolis, Minnesota (as shown at the end of this
                  section in Figure 1.1). A mixed-use building is proposed at this
                  location with 11,013 square feet of office/restaurant/retail space on
                  the first floor and 40 condo units on the second through fifth floors.

                  The purpose of this report is to determine if the completion of the
                  Linden Corner Development will significantly impact the adjacent
                  transportation system.     The report will satisfy the City of
                  Minneapolis' requirement for the development to have a Travel
                  Demand Management Plan in place.

                  Based on discussions with the City of Minneapolis Transportation
                  Division staff, the study objectives are:
                       i.  Document the existing and proposed conditions with
                           respect to the transit, parking, bicycle and pedestrian
                           facilities.
                      ii.  Document the parking impacts associated with the
                           development.
                     iii.  Identify any traffic operations issues.
                     iv.   Develop and recommend measures to encourage non-
                           single occupancy vehicle modes of transportation with the
                           goal of attaining a 55% automobile, 35% transit, 10%
                           pedestrian/bicycle mode split.

                b. Executive Summary
                  Based on the analysis in this report, traffic from the proposed
                  Linden Corner Development is not anticipated to have a significant
                  impact on area traffic operations.      Traffic operations at the
                  intersections on West 43rd Street at Sheridan Avenue South,
                  Sheridan Avenue South at Upton Avenue South, the site driveway
                  on West 43rd Street and the two site driveways on Upton Avenue
                  South were analyzed as part of this study.

                  The principal findings of this study are:
                      i. The study intersections will operate acceptably at Level of
                         Service B or better in the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours
                         with the addition of the development traffic.
                     ii. 135 parking stalls are proposed for the site, which is
                         between the minimum required and maximum allowed for
                         this type of development.



Linden Corner                                1                  Travel Demand Management Plan
                  iii. At least 29 secure bicycle parking stalls must be provided on
                       site per Chapter 541 of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances.
                       Of these 29 spaces, 20 of them need to meet the standards
                       for long-term bicycle parking.

                To achieve the targeted 45% of trips being made by non-single
                occupancy vehicle modes, the Travel Demand Management
                measures detailed in Section 6 of this report should be
                implemented at the development building. No other mitigation
                measures are necessary to facilitate the traffic generated by the
                site.

     2. Proposed Development
                a. Site Location
                  The proposed site is located north of West 43rd Street and west of
                  Sheridan Avenue South and Upton Avenue South in the Linden
                  Hills neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota (as shown in Figure
                  1.1). Figure 2.1 shows the site location.




                  Figure 2.1 ­ Site Location

                b. Land Use and Intensity
                  An 11,013 square foot office/restaurant/retail space is proposed for
                  the first floor of the development with 40 condo units on the second
                  through fifth floors. The existing 1,200 square foot general retail
                  building and 2,700 square foot Famous Dave's building on the site
                  will be demolished.

                  The building site is currently zoned C1 (Neighborhood Commercial
                  District). The site is also part of the Linden Hills Overlay District
                  (LH).

                c. Development Phasing and Timing
                  Construction of the development is expected to begin in 2012. This
                  study assumes the development will be fully occupied by 2013.

     3. Analysis of Existing Conditions
                a. Pedestrians and Bicycles
                  There are currently sidewalks on the southern and eastern edges of
                  the site. The sidewalks are planned to remain adjacent to the site
                  after the proposed redevelopment project is constructed. No
                  designated bicycle facilities exist adjacent to the project site.

                  Pedestrian and bicycle data is included in the Appendix as part of
                  the turning movement count data. The Sheridan Ave & W 43rd St
                  intersection has more than 110 pedestrians and more than 25
                  bicycles crossing it in the p.m. peak hour which are accommodated
                  by a traffic signal.

                b. Transit
                  There are bus stops on Sheridan Ave on both the north and south
                  sides of W 43rd Street that are served by Metro Transit route 6.
                  Route 6 has 20 minute frequency throughout the day at the site.

                c. Physical Characteristics of Roadway Network
                  W 43rd Street, Sheridan Ave and Upton Ave at the site are under
                  the jurisdiction of the City of Minneapolis and have 30 mph speed
                  limits. The Sheridan Ave/Upton Ave intersection is controlled by a
                  stop sign while the Sheridan Ave/W 43rd Street intersection is
                  controlled with a traffic signal. The three driveway intersections are
                  currently uncontrolled, but are modeled as having stop signs on the
                  minor approaches. The southernmost existing site driveway on
                  Upton Ave will be closed as part of the project, and the other two
                  driveways will be switched to one-way traffic with vehicles entering
                  the site via the driveway on W 43rd St and exiting via the
                  northernmost driveway on Upton Ave.                 In addition, the
                  northernmost driveway on Upton Ave will be moved approximately
                  ten feet north on Upton.           Existing traffic control and lane
                  configurations at each study intersection are shown in Figure 3.1.

                d. Traffic Volumes
                  A.M. and p.m. peak hour turning movement counts were conducted
                  at the study intersections in June 2011. The turning movement
                  count data is contained in fifteen minute intervals in the Appendix.
                  Figures 3.2 and 3.3 show the existing a.m. and p.m. peak hour
                  turning movement volumes, respectively. The City of Minneapolis
                  lists an average annual daily traffic volume from 2008 of 10,285
                  vehicles on Upton Ave between W 44th St and W 43rd St (just south
                  of the site location).

                e. Intersection Level of Service Analysis
                         LOS A         An intersection capacity analysis was
                                       conducted for the existing intersections per the
                                       2000 Highway Capacity Manual. Intersections
                                       are assigned a "Level of Service" letter grade
                                       for the peak hour of traffic based on the
                                       number of lanes at the intersection, traffic
                   LOS D = Acceptable
                                       volumes, and traffic control. Level of Service
                                       A (LOS A) represents light traffic flow (free
                                       flow conditions) while Level of Service F (LOS
                                       F) represents heavy traffic flow (over capacity
                                       conditions). LOS D at intersections is typically
                  LOS F = Unacceptable considered acceptable in the Twin Cities
                                       region.      Individual movements are also
                                       assigned LOS grades. One or more individual
                                       movements typically operate at LOS F when
                                       the overall intersection is operating acceptably
                                       at LOS D. The pictures on the left represent
                                       some of the LOS grades (from a signal
                  controlled intersection in San Jose, CA). These LOS grades
                  represent the overall intersection, not individual movements.

                  The Level of Service for each intersection during the existing a.m.
                  and p.m. peak periods can be seen in Table 3.1.

                  Note: The first letter is the Level of Service for the intersection. The second
                  letter (in parentheses) is the Level of Service for the worst operating movement.

                  All intersections currently operate acceptably at LOS B or better
                  during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. These grades are
                  based on the existing traffic control and lane configurations as
                  shown in Figure 3.1. The existing peak hour turning movement
                  volumes from Figures 3.2 and 3.3 were used in the LOS
                  calculations along with the existing signal timing, which was
                  observed on site.       The LOS calculations were done using
                              TM
                  SYNCHRO         software.    The complete LOS calculations are
                  included in the Appendix.

                  A trip generation analysis was performed for the site based on the
                  methods and rates published in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th
                  Edition. The resultant trip generation for the proposed development
                  is shown in Table 4.1.

                  The directional orientation of the generated traffic is shown in
                  Figure 4.1. This orientation is based on a weighted distribution of
                  the traffic volumes currently using the area roadways near the site.
                  The distribution pattern takes site access, the one way parking lot
                  configuration, and access to the regional transportation system into
                  account. In addition to the traffic generated by the businesses on
                  the site, there will be 25 parking spaces on the site to be used by
                  neighboring businesses. To be conservative, it is assumed that
                  these 25 spaces will be turned over once each peak hour meaning
                  that in addition to the trips from Table 4.1, there will be 25 vehicles
                  entering and 25 vehicles exiting the site during both the a.m. and
                  p.m. peak hours.

                  The traffic generated by the site development was assigned to the
                  study intersections per the trip distributions shown in Figure 4.1.
                  The traffic generated by the Linden Corner development during the
                  a.m. and p.m. peak hours is shown in Figures 4.2 and 4.3.

                  To provide a conservative traffic analysis, traffic from the buildings
                  that will be demolished was not removed from the traffic forecasts.
                  Based on the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, the
                  demolished buildings would be forecast to generate approximately
                  400 daily trips, 35 a.m. peak hour trips, and 35 p.m. peak hour trips.

                b. Non-site Traffic Forecasting
                  Traffic forecasts were developed for weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
                  hours at the study intersections in the year 2013 No-Build scenario
                  by applying a 1.00% compounded annual growth rate to the
                  existing traffic volume data. This level of traffic growth is typical in
                  Minneapolis. The resultant 2013 No-Build forecasts are shown in
                  Figures 4.4 and 4.5.

                c. Total Traffic
                  Traffic forecasts were developed for the study intersections in the
                  2013 Build scenarios by adding the traffic generated by the
                  proposed developments to the 2013 No-Build volumes. The
                  resultant 2013 Build forecasts are shown in Figures 4.6 and 4.7.

     5. Traffic and Parking Analysis
                a. Level of Service Analysis
                  The Level of Service results for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
                  hours in the 2013 No-Build and Build scenarios are shown in Table
                  5.1. These are based on the existing intersection configurations
                  and traffic control shown in Figure 3.1. The forecast turning
                  movement volumes from Figures 4.4 through 4.7 were used in the
                  LOS calculations along with the existing signal timing. The LOS
                  calculations were done using SYNCHROTM software.              All
                  intersections operate acceptably at LOS B or better with each
                  individual intersection movement operating acceptably at LOS B or
                  better.    The complete LOS calculations are included in the
                  Appendix.

                  letter (in parentheses) is the Level of Service for the worst operating movement.

                b. External Site Change
                  The proposed site plan for the development shows a change being
                  made to the radius of the northwest corner of the Sheridan Ave/W
                  43rd St intersection. The corner will go from its current 30 foot
                  radius to an 18 foot radius, which will be more consistent with the
                  other corner radii at the intersection (which range from 11 feet to 20
                  feet). This change will benefit pedestrian traffic by making the
                  street crossings shorter and providing more space on the sidewalk.

                  This change will still allow cars to turn comfortably at this corner,
                  but could make it difficult for heavy vehicles to make the turn.
                  However, since there were no southbound heavy vehicles observed
                  making right turns at this intersection during the morning and
                  evening study periods, this change is not seen to be an issue.

                c. Vehicle Parking Analysis
                  The proposed site plan provides 137 parking spaces for the
                  development. Sixty spaces will be provided for the condos (1.5

                spaces per unit), 52 spaces for the on-site commercial uses, and
                25 spaces will be provided to serve nearby business properties that
                have parking easements for stalls on the project site.

                According to the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances Table 541-1
                Specific Off-Street Parking and Table 551-1LH Overlay District
                Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements, the minimum parking
                requirements for the site is 87 spaces. Forty spaces is the
                minimum requirement for the residential use. Forty-seven spaces
                is the minimum requirement for the commercial uses after applying
                a 5 stall bicycle incentive reduction per Section 541.220. There is
                no maximum parking restriction for the residential uses. The
                maximum allowed parking for the on-site commercial uses is 81
                spaces. A summary of the parking calculations is shown in Table
                5.2.

                d. Bicycle Parking Analysis
                  Chapter 541 of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances requires at
                  least one bicycle parking space for every two dwelling units, with at
                  least 90% of these spaces meeting the requirements of long-term
                  bicycle parking. Restaurants, general retail and offices are required
                  to have at least three bicycle parking spaces each with the office
                  needing to have at least 50% of its spaces meet requirements for
                  long-term bicycle parking. For the site, this means a minimum of
                  29 bicycle parking spaces are required, 20 of which need to meet
                  the standards for long-term bicycle parking.

                  According to the ordinance, "Required long-term bicycle parking
                  spaces shall be located in enclosed and secured or supervised
                  areas providing protection from theft, vandalism and weather and
                  shall be accessible to intended users. Required long-term bicycle
                  parking for residential uses shall not be located within dwelling units
                  or within deck or patio areas accessory to dwelling units. With
                  permission of the zoning administrator, long-term bicycle parking
                  spaces for non-residential uses may be located off-site within three
                  hundred (300) feet of the site."

                e. Loading Zones
                  Due to the design of the parking structure, large vehicles will be
                  prohibited from the site. A loading space that can be utilized by
                  delivery vans and small trucks is provided near the northeast corner
                  of the building. Deliveries and loading/unloading that require larger
                  trucks will take place from the street. Trash bins will be rolled out to
                  either 43rd Street or Upton Avenue to trucks parked on the street.
                  Public Works has indicated preliminary support for the proposed
                  use of the street for loading and trash pickup.

                f. Internal Circulation
                  Based on the previous analyses, vehicles are expected to have
                  safe and efficient access to the site. The parking lot is designed in
                  a manner to promote efficient parking for each business and is not
                  expected to have significant internal congestion. Sidewalks are
                  provided adjacent to the site and clear sight lines are provided in
                  the parking lots to provide safe access for pedestrians and
                  bicyclists. Overall, the internal site is expected to have acceptable
                  transportation operations.




Linden Corner                                21                   Travel Demand Management Plan
     6. Travel Demand Management (TDM) Plan
          The purpose of this section is to provide a description of the Linden
          Corner Development TDM Plan and related programs to support the use
          of alternative methods of transportation other than a single occupancy
          vehicle. Linden Hills Redevelopment, LLC will develop and implement
          measures to encourage non-single occupancy vehicle modes of
          transportation with the goal of having at least 45% of its transportation
          trips being made by transit, bicycling, telecommuting, or walking. Linden
          Hills Redevelopment, LLC (or their successors ­ hereinafter referred to as
          "landlord") is responsible for and specifically commits to the
          implementation of the following actions.

                a. Designate a Transportation Coordinator to Promote
                   Transit/Ride-Share
                  Linden Hills Redevelopment, LLC will designate an employee or
                  contractor to act as the Transportation Coordinator. That employee
                  will maintain and monitor TDM activities as well as serve as liaison
                  to Metro Commuter Services and Metro Transit.                   The
                  Transportation Coordinator will serve as the conduit for providing
                  up-to-date information on alternative commute programs and
                  incentives to all building occupants. At a minimum, the
                  Transportation Coordinator will:
                      ! Make available information on various bus incentive
                         programs (e.g GoCard, Guaranteed Ride Home, and
                         Commuter Check program), vanpool incentives, and ride-
                         matching programs sponsored by Metro Transit Commuter
                         Services.
                      ! Set up and maintain a display of commuter information at the
                         entrance of the building. This information, which will be
                         supplied by Metro Transit, will include transit schedules,
                         rideshare applications, bike information, Guaranteed Ride
                         Home Program brochures, etc. To maintain an awareness of
                         alternative modes of transportation, information may be
                         distributed through e-mail, flyers, posters in frequented
                         locations, etc.
                      ! Provide a move-in packet for new residents containing
                         information on alternative transportation modes available at
                         the time.
                      ! Distribute information on Mn/DOT's real-time traveler
                         information program: 5-1-1 or www.511mn.org.

                b. Promote Walking
                  Well lit sidewalks will be provided on the southern and eastern
                  sides of the site. The site will meet Minneapolis' requirements for
                  on-site lighting to provide a pedestrian friendly environment. If any



Linden Corner                               22                  Travel Demand Management Plan
                  existing sidewalks are impacted by construction, the sidewalks shall
                  be rebuilt with ADA-compliant tactile dome curb ramps to assist the
                  visually impaired.

                c. Promote Bicycling
                  The building will provide convenient and safe bicycle storage for at
                  least 29 bicycles per Table 541-3 Minimum Bicycle Parking
                  Requirements of Minneapolis' Code of Ordinances. Linden Hills
                  Redevelopment, LLC will designate additional bicycle storage
                  facility space if and when the demand warrants.

                d. Minimize the Impact of Trucks
                  To the extent possible, Linden Hills Redevelopment, LLC or their
                  successors will encourage truck and service vehicles (not including
                  small package deliveries) to access the site outside of the weekday
                  peak hours (from 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m.). Loading/unloading of
                  deliveries as well as garbage trucks will occur from Upton Avenue
                  and/or 43rd Street.

     7. Conclusions and Recommendations
          Traffic from the proposed Linden Corner Development is not anticipated to
          have a significant impact on area traffic operations. No roadway or traffic
          control improvements are recommended for the existing transportation
          system as part of the redevelopment project.

          The principal findings of this study are:
             i. The study intersections will operate acceptably at Level of Service B
                or better in the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours with the addition
                of the development traffic.
            ii. 135 parking stalls are proposed for the site, which is between the
                minimum required and maximum allowed for this type of
                development.
           iii. At least 29 secure bicycle parking stalls must be provided on site per
                Chapter 541 of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances. Of these 29
                spaces, 20 of them need to meet the standards for long-term bicycle
                parking.

          Adequate parking will be provided on site, per Chapter 541 of Minneapolis'
          Code of Ordinances. It is recommended the travel demand management
          measures documented in Section 6 of this report be implemented to
          encourage non-single occupancy vehicle modes of transportation for the
          site's employees and patrons.

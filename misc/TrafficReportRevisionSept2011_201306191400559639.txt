INTRODUCTION
In June 2011, LSA Associates Inc. (LSA) prepared a traffic analysis to identify the potential
circulation and parking impacts associated with the proposed expansion of the San Mateo County
Library branch in the Town of Atherton (Town), California. Expansion could occur at the existing
library site or expansion could be achieved by constructing a new facility within Holbrook-Palmer
Park. Figure 1 shows the location of the existing library and Holbrook-Palmer Park within the Town.
The June 2011 Traffic Study compared existing traffic conditions to forecasted traffic conditions at
completion of the project for the three site alternatives. The analysis also included an evaluation of
parking conditions at the existing library site and at Holbrook-Palmer Park and an analysis of the
project's impacts to parking.

Site plans prepared by the project architect identified the 12,000-square-foot (sf) space that could
accommodate the planned 11,100 sf library. The June 2011 Traffic Study provided a conservative
analysis of a 12,000 sf facility. Based on comments received during public review of the Traffic
Study, this revision addresses the impacts of a new 11,100 sf library. LSA has also revised the trip
distribution previously analyzed based on local feedback that few, if any, trips to the library would
require travel on United States Route 101 (US-101). In addition, the Town is no longer contemplating
reuse of the existing library that could generate similar peak-hour trips. Therefore, for the two
alternatives located in Holbrook-Palmer Park, trips generated by the existing library, have been
removed from the roadway network. The results of these three revisions are reported below.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Since 1968, the San Mateo County Library branch in the Town of Atherton has been located at 2
Dinkelspiel (Station) Lane. The current building provides 4,790 sf. A Library Needs Assessment
conducted in 2009-2010 revealed that the library needed to house a larger collection, increase the
number of seats available, increase the number of public computers available, provide areas for
library-related programs and events, and create zones for various uses, and that the existing facility
was inadequate to effectively deliver those services.

The Atherton Library Building Steering Committee has identified three alternative locations for an
approximately 11,100 sf facility to replace the existing library. The first alternative (Figure 2a) is on
the site of the existing library. Additional parking required by the library expansion would be
accommodated with on-street parking. The second alternative (Figure 2b) is located in Holbrook-
Palmer Park on the site of the Main House. Parking for this alternative would be accommodated in
existing park parking lots. The third alternative (Figure 2c) is also located in Holbrook-Palmer Park
and would replace an existing parking lot. To compensate for this lost parking lot, additional spaces
would be constructed adjacent to another existing lot within the park.


METHODOLOGY
Traffic conditions in the study area were assessed through the evaluation of peak-hour levels of
service (LOS) at critical intersections. The LOS concept qualitatively characterizes traffic conditions
associated with varying levels of traffic. An LOS determination is a measure of congestion, which is
the principal measure of roadway service.

The LOS definitions for signalized and unsignalized intersections are presented in Table A. These
range from LOS A, which indicates a free-flow condition, to LOS F, which indicates a congested
condition. The Town has established LOS C as the minimum acceptable LOS for intersections on
collector roadways and LOS D as the minimum acceptable LOS for intersections on arterial
roadways.

The Menlo Park Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines, used in this study at the direction of the
Town, establishes significance criteria to determine whether trips added to the circulation system by a
project will require mitigation. A project has a potentially significant impact if one of these conditions
applies:

·      An intersection operating at an acceptable LOS is caused to operate at an unacceptable LOS;
·      Delay is increased by 23 seconds or greater at an intersection operating at an acceptable LOS; or
·      Average delay to vehicles on the critical turn movements increases by greater than 0.8 seconds at
       an intersection operating at an unacceptable LOS.

It should be noted that each intersection in the study area, with the exception of one, is stop-controlled
in only one direction. In these cases, the LOS reported by the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)
methodology is the stop-controlled direction, which is also the critical movement. As a result, both
the 23-second criterion and the 0.8-second criterion are applied to the intersection delay as a whole.
As stated in the project description, three alternative sites for the new library have been proposed.
Parking demand generated by the new library will be compared to parking supply for each alternative.
The alternative would be determined to have a significant parking impact if the alternative would
result in deficient parking at the proposed location.


EXISTING CONDITIONS
Study Area
The existing library is located at 2 Dinkelspiel (Station) Lane in the Town of Atherton. The Atherton
Caltrain station and parking lot is north of the existing library. Holbrook-Palmer Park is located east
of Watkins Avenue and north of the Caltrain corridor. Land uses surrounding the existing library and
park are primarily residential in nature. The intersections listed below (and depicted on Figure 3)

Existing Circulation System
Key roadways in the vicinity of the proposed project are as follows:

·    US Highway 101: US-101 is a north-south regional freeway, extending through the Bay Area to
     the City of San Francisco. In the vicinity of the project, US-101 consists of one high­occupancy
     vehicle (HOV) and four general-purpose lanes in the northbound direction and one HOV lane and
     three general-purpose lanes in the southbound direction.
·    El Camino Real: El Camino Real is a six-lane arterial roadway traveling roughly parallel to US-
     101 through the Bay Area. The Town's General Plan Circulation Element classifies El Camino
     Real as a highway.
·    Middlefield Road: Middlefield Road is a north-south roadway. In the vicinity of the project,
     Middlefield Road consists of two undivided lanes. The Town's General Plan Circulation Element
     classifies Middlefield Road as a minor arterial.
·    Fair Oaks Lane: Fair Oaks Lane is an east-west roadway traveling between El Camino Real and
     Middlefield Road. Fair Oaks Lane provides access to the Atherton Caltrain station and consists of
     two undivided lanes. The Town's General Plan Circulation Element classifies Fair Oaks Lane as
     a collector.
·    Watkins Avenue: Watkins Avenue is a two-lane undivided east-west roadway traveling between
     El Camino Real and Middlefield Road. Watkins Avenue is parallel to and approximately 1,500
     feet (ft) east of Fair Oaks Lane. Holbrook-Palmer Park takes access from Watkins Avenue. The
     Town's General Plan Circulation Element classifies Watkins Avenue as a collector.
·    Dinkelspiel (Station) Lane: Dinkelspiel (Station) Lane is a two-lane local street traveling
     between Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue. Perpendicular and parallel parking for the
     Atherton Library is provided on Dinkelspiel (Station) Lane.
·    Marsh Road: Marsh Road is a two-lane east-west arterial that provides access between US-101
     and the study area where it terminates at Middlefield Road. The Town's General Plan Circulation
     Element classifies Marsh Road as a minor arterial.

Existing Level of Service
LSA contracted a qualified company, All Traffic Data, to conduct intersection turn-movement counts
at the six study area intersections. Traffic counts were collected during the AM peak period (7:00 a.m.
to 9:00 a.m.) and the PM peak period (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) on Wednesday, May 25, 2011. Due to
equipment malfunction, traffic counts were recounted for Fair Oaks Lane/Dinkelspiel (Station) Lane
on Thursday, May 26, 2011 (PM peak period), and Wednesday, June 1, 2011 (AM peak period).
Existing traffic counts are illustrated on Figure 5. Existing count data are included as Appendix A of
this analysis. Table B presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour LOS for the study area. LOS
calculation worksheets are available in Appendix B of this analysis. Table B displays the delay on the
stop-controlled leg, which are the critical turn movements, of each intersection.

LOS = level of service
    = exceeds LOS standard



As the table indicates, two intersections currently function at an unacceptable LOS. Watkins
Avenue/Middlefield Road operates at LOS E in the PM peak hour. Watkins Avenue/El Camino Real
operates at LOS F in the AM peak hour. Both intersections exceed LOS standards due to the
difficulty of turning left from a collector onto an uncontrolled arterial.


Existing Parking Availability
LSA also contracted All Traffic Data to collect parking accumulation counts at the existing library
and at Holbrook-Palmer Park. Parked vehicles were counted every hour between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00
p.m. on Wednesday, May 25, 2011. The resulting counts are displayed on Tables C and D below.

Palmer Park is highest during the 7:00 p.m. hour. At this time, 64 parking spaces are utilized and 60
are available. It should be noted that the Northern Lot was not observed to be greater than 25 percent
full at any time throughout the day.


PROJECT CONDITIONS
Trip Generation
The proposed project would construct a new 11,100 sf library in one of three locations. The daily and
peak-hour trips for the project are generated using trip rates documented in the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (Eighth Edition, 2008). The trip rates for
"Land Use 590: Library" were used to calculate the net new trips generated by the proposed project.

As Table E indicates, the proposed 11,100 sf library is forecast to generate approximately 624 trips
per day, 12 trips in the AM peak hour, and 81 trips in the PM peak hour. Alternative 1 would replace
an existing library that generates approximately 269 trips per day, 5 trips in the AM peak hour, and 35
trips in the PM peak hour. As a result, new trips utilizing the circulation system for Alternative 1
(replacement of the library on the existing site) are forecast to be 355 trips per day, 7 trips in the AM
peak hour, and 46 trips in the PM peak hour.

In Alternative 2, the new library would replace the Main House in Holbrook-Palmer Park. The Main
House, however, does not generate regular, predictable trips on a daily basis. Therefore, no credit was
taken for trips being replaced by the new library. In Alternative 3, the new library would be placed on
an existing parking lot in Holbrook-Palmer Park, and an informal amphitheater would replace the
Main House. The replacement of the Main House with an amphitheater is not part of the library
project. At this time, the potential use of the amphitheater is unknown and was not accounted for in
this analysis. Because Alternatives 2 and 3 would construct a new library on a new site, and the Town

intends to reuse the existing library site for Town functions that will not generate new trips, trips to
and from the existing library are removed from the roadway network in these alternatives.


Trip Distribution and Assignment
New trips generated by the project were distributed between south toward Palo Alto, west within the
Town of Atherton, and north toward Redwood City. Based on use of the existing library, half of the
new trips were distributed toward the south. Where multiple routes to the ultimate destination are
available, the shortest route was used for project trips. This is a reasonable presumption; however, it
should be noted that motorists making routine trips will avoid congested intersections and routes in
favor of faster routes.


Parking Generation
Data regarding the parking generation characteristics of land uses are available in ITE Parking
Generation (Fourth Edition, 2010). ITE surveys showed that the peak period for "Land Use 590:
Library" is 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and that average peak-parking demand is 2.61 vehicles per 1,000 sf
of gross floor area. The project proposes a 11,100 sf facility, which would generate demand for 29
parking spaces.

LSA also collected parking data at the existing library. The highest parking demand (during the 3:00
p.m. to 4:00 p.m. hour) was 14 vehicles. Since the existing library is 4,790 sf, this parking demand
equated to a rate of 2.92 spaces per 1,000 sf. If this relationship continues for the new 11,100 sf
library, a parking demand of 33 parking spaces is expected. Because the parking demand estimate
calculated from data collected at the existing library was higher, LSA applied this more conservative
estimate to the parking analysis.


EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
Intersection Operation
Project traffic resulting from Alternative 1 was added to existing traffic counts and the resulting turn-
movement volumes are illustrated on Figure 6a. LOS for the Existing Plus Alternative 1 condition at
each of the six study area intersections was calculated. The existing LOS was then compared to the
Existing Plus Alternative 1 LOS to determine (1) project impacts and (2) whether those impacts are
considered significant. Table F displays the results of that analysis. Again, because all six study area
intersections are two-way stop controlled, the delay displayed is the average for all turn movements
of the most delayed approach.

The additional trips generated by Alternative 1 would slightly increase delay at some of the study
intersections during the peak periods. Average delay decreases at Watkins Avenue/Middlefield Road
due to additional eastbound right-turn movements added by Alternative 1. Right-turns are facilitated
with little delay thereby decreasing average delay across the approach. No intersections operating at
an acceptable LOS would operate at an unacceptable LOS due to the addition of Alternative 1 traffic.
Nor does Alternative 1 add 23 seconds of delay to any intersections operating at an acceptable LOS.
Finally, Alternative 1 would not increase delay by greater than 0.8 seconds at either intersection

operating at an unacceptable LOS. Therefore, based on the traffic impact significance criteria
described in this report, Alternative 1 would not result in significant adverse impacts.

Project traffic resulting from Alternatives 2 or 3 were added to existing traffic counts and the
resulting turn movement volumes are illustrated on Figure 6b. LOS for the Existing Plus Alternatives
2 or 3 conditions at the six study area intersections were calculated. The existing LOS was then
compared to the Existing Plus Alternatives 2 or 3 LOS to determine (1) project impacts and (2)
whether those impacts are considered significant. Table G displays the results of that analysis.

Alternatives 2 or 3 do not add 23 seconds of delay to any intersections operating at an acceptable
LOS. Nor would Alternatives 2 or 3 increase delay by greater than 0.8 seconds at either intersection
operating at an unacceptable LOS. Therefore, based on the traffic impact significance criteria
described in this report, Alternatives 2 or 3 would not result in significant adverse impacts.

Parking Conditions with Project Alternatives
As described previously, the time period of highest parking demand for a library is 3:00 p.m. to 4:00
p.m. This was determined at sites surveyed for ITE Parking Generation (Fourth Edition, 2010) and
confirmed at the existing library. The period of highest parking demand at Holbrook-Palmer Park,
however, is between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. In order to provide a complete analysis of potential
parking impacts to Holbrook-Palmer Park, both time periods are analyzed in Table H.

Alternative 3
   3:00 p.m.                88                58       33              (3)

Surveys at the existing library found that parking demand during the 7:00 p.m. hour was
approximately 43 percent of peak 3:00 p.m. demand. This is, however, much lower than other surveys
conducted by ITE. In order to provide a conservative analysis, a higher, 75 percent of peak-parking
rate was chosen to represent parking demand during the 7:00 p.m. hour.

As Table H shows, Alternative 1 (expansion of the existing library site) would require no additional
parking spaces. However, peak demand on a typical day is expected to fully utilize all available
parking spaces.

Alternative 2 (replacing Main House in Holbrook-Palmer Park with a new library) would not require
any additional parking spaces. Sufficient unutilized parking currently exists in the park during both
peak-library parking demand and peak-park parking demand to absorb the increased parking demand
generated by the new library.

Alternative 3 (placing the new library on the Northern Lot in Holbrook-Palmer Park) would require
23 additional parking spaces to accommodate total park demand during the 7:00 p.m. hour. Figure 2c
illustrates plans to add additional parking adjacent to the Central Lot. According to the Urban Land
Institute Dimensions of Parking, Fourth Edition, 270 to 300 sf per parking space is a reasonable
estimate for a surface parking lot. By this estimate, approximately 6,900 sf of currently green space
would need to be used for parking under this alternative.

SATURDAY ANALYSIS
Holbrook-Palmer Park is a popular location on weekends for events and recreation. As such, the
Town requested that conditions without and with the project be analyzed for a typical Saturday. The
purpose of this analysis is to determine whether Holbrook-Palmer Park's driveways or parking lots
would be more severely impacted on Saturday than they would be on a weekday.

In addition to intersection turn movement counts collected at all study area intersections during AM
and PM peak periods on a weekday, turn movement counts were collected at the park driveways
between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, May 21, 2011. These counts are displayed on
Figure 7. Project trips were determined using ITE Trip Generation Manual (Eighth Edition, 2008)
Saturday trip generation rates. Table I presents the project trips anticipated on a Saturday.

Similar to the weekday analysis, project trips were distributed eastbound and westbound at the park
driveways. The resulting traffic volumes with the project are illustrated on Figure 7. Table J displays
Saturday midday LOS without and with the project. As the table shows, no impacts to the park
driveways are anticipated on Saturday as a result of the project.

Parking
All Traffic Data collected parking accumulation counts at Holbrook-Palmer Park between the hours
of 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, May 21, 2011. The result of that survey is provided on
Table K. Unlike the surveyed weekday, the highest parking demand occurred in the morning at 10:00
a.m. At that time, 75 spaces were utilized and 49 were available. LSA consulted the schedule of
events for Holbrook-Palmer Park. Weddings are occasionally held at the park, but none occurred on
the surveyed day. The survey results are believed to represent a typical Saturday at the park. It should
be noted that fewer than 40 percent of the Northern Lot was utilized during this typical Saturday.

ITE Parking Generation (Fourth Edition, 2010) provides limited data regarding weekend parking
demand for libraries. The sites that were surveyed on a weekday, Saturday, and Sunday revealed
parking rates that were 71 percent of weekday demand on Saturday and 87 percent of weekday
demand on Sunday. LSA used the more conservative 87 percent figure to determine weekend peak-
parking demand for the library of 29 vehicles.

While weekend peak-parking demand is lower than weekday peak-parking demand for the library,
total parking demand was higher during much of surveyed weekend for Holbrook-Palmer Park. An
analysis of potential impacts to Holbrook-Palmer Park was conducted to determine if the library
weekend parking demand would exceed the park's available weekend parking. The highest parking
demand at the park (10:00 a.m.) is not the highest hour for parking at the library. Both ITE Parking
Generation (Fourth Edition, 2010) and surveys of the existing library found parking demand at 10:00
a.m. to be approximately 57 percent of peak-parking demand, or 17 spaces.

As Table L shows, Alternative 2 (replacing Main House in Holbrook-Palmer Park with a new library)
would not require any additional parking spaces to accommodate weekend parking demand.
Alternative 3 (placing the new library on the Northern Lot in Holbrook-Palmer Park) would require
26 additional parking spaces to accommodate total park demand during the 10:00 a.m. hour. This is
greater than the number of parking spaces required for weekday parking. Based on the estimate of
270 to 300 sf per parking space provided earlier, approximately 7,800 sf of currently green space
would need to be used for parking under Alternative 3.

SUMMARY
Alternative 1
Alternative 1 would place the new 11,100 sf library at the site of the existing 4,790 sf library. No
impacts to study area intersections are anticipated due to this alternative. No intersection mitigation
would be required by this alternative. This alternative would not require any additional parking
spaces. However, peak demand on a typical day is expected to fully utilize all available parking
spaces.


Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would place the new 11,100 sf library in Holbrook-Palmer Park where the Main House
is currently located. No impacts to study area intersections are anticipated due to this alternative. No
additional parking spaces would be required in excess of existing parking at Holbrook-Palmer Park.


Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would place the new 11,100 sf library in Holbrook-Palmer Park where the northern
parking lot is currently located. No impacts to study area intersections are anticipated due to this
alternative. This alternative would require 26 additional parking spaces to satisfy weekend parking
demand. The additional parking spaces would require that approximately 7,800 sf of currently green
space be converted to parking.


CONCLUSIONS
This traffic analysis examined the potential impacts to study area intersections and parking resulting
from replacing the existing library with a new 11,100 sf library. Three alternative locations for the
library were examined. Additionally, impacts to Holbrook-Palmer Park on Saturday were analyzed.
Based on the results of this traffic analysis, no alternative is anticipated to result in a significant
impact to study area intersections. Alternative 3 would require additional parking spaces to satisfy
weekday and weekend parking demand.

Please note that traffic counts and worksheets contained in these appendices utilize a different
directional convention than the body of the report. Because the San Francisco Bay is predominantly
north of the Town of Atherton, roads headed toward the bay (e.g., Fair Oaks Lane) are designated
northbound-southbound in the appendices while roadways parallel to the bay (e.g., Middlefield Road)
are designated eastbound-westbound in the appendices. The body of the report utilizes the same
directional convention as the Town of Atherton where roadways progressing along the peninsula
toward the City of San Francisco (e.g., El Camino Real) are designated northbound-southbound.

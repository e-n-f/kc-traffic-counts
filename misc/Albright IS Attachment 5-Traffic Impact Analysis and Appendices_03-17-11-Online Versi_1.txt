Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Albright Way
development in Los Gatos, California. The project site is located on Albright Way at the southeast corner
of the SR-85 and Winchester Boulevard interchange. The project will be served by a full-access entrance
on Winchester Boulevard at the approximate location of the existing Winchester Boulevard and Albright
Way intersection.


Project Description
The project proposes a Planned Development zoning that will allow for flexibility in the ultimate mix of
land uses on the site. There are existing office buildings on the project site, that total 250,000 s.f. The
project may consist of office alone or a mix of office and multi-family/senior residential uses. As currently
proposed, the project could include up to a maximum of 550,000 square feet of office space or a
combination of less office space with residential uses. Multi-family or senior residential uses could include
up to a maximum of 516 multi-family or 600 senior units. Within these parameters, the Town could
authorize any combination of these uses, up to these maximums, at the at the Site & Architectural Review
Approval stage.

Though this study evaluates the potential 550,000 s.f. of office space development on the project site, the
Town has developed three additional illustrative development scenarios that may occur on the project
site. The following illustrative development scenarios have been identified for the project site:

Scenario 1: Replacement of 250,000 s.f. of existing office space with 550,000 s.f. new office space

Scenario 2: Addition of 200,000 s.f. of office space to 141,000 s.f. of existing office to remain

Scenario 3: Replacement of 250,000 s.f. of existing office space with 200,000 s.f. of new office space
            and 516 multi-family units

Scenario 4: Replacement of 250,000 s.f. of existing office space with 200,000 s.f. of new office space
            and 600 senior units

Each of the development scenarios includes the application of a credit for the existing office uses on the
site. Traffic counts collected at each of the existing project entrances indicate that the project site is
currently generating significantly less traffic than is anticipated/approved for the site buildings suggesting
that the buildings are either underutilized or vacant. Therefore, trips were added to background conditions
to account for the underutilized/vacant space on the project site for each of the development scenarios. In
order to evaluate the potential transportation impacts of the various illustrative development scenarios
now, each of the three additional development scenarios were analyzed. The analysis of each scenario
includes an evaluation of intersection and freeways segment levels of service as was completed and
                                                                                       iv | Page   
                                                                          
Albright Way Development                                                                   March 17, 2011 

presented for the 550,000 s.f. office development scenario (Scenario 1) within this report. The results of
the analysis for each development scenario are described in detail in Chapter 5.
The evaluation of the additional illustrative scenarios determined that each of the development scenarios
would result in the same or less traffic impacts as the 550,000 s.f. office scenario. Therefore, the
additional scenarios are briefly described within this study, but are not discussed in the same level of
detail as the 550,000 s.f. office scenario.


Scope of Work
The potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the Town of Los Gatos and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP). Although the
proposed project is located in the Town of Los Gatos, facilities within the Cities of San Jose and Campbell
also will be affected by the proposed project. Thus, the impacts of the project also were evaluated
following the standards and methodologies set forth by the Cities of San Jose and Campbell for facilities
located within their jurisdiction. The study included an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions
for 17 signalized intersections, 2 unsignalized intersections, and 32 directional freeway segments.


Project Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation
rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development.
Hexagon has prepared project trip estimates for the proposed additional 300,000 s.f. of office space
based on trip generation rates obtained from ITE's Trip Generation, Eighth Edition, 2008. It is estimated
that the proposed 300,000 square foot of additional office space would generate an additional 3,126 daily
trips, with 411 trips (366 inbound and 45 outbound) occurring during the AM peak hour and 366 trips (51
inbound and 315 outbound) occurring during the PM peak hour.


Project Impacts
Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis are summarized in Table ES 1. Based on the
intersection level of service analysis, two of the 19 study intersections would be impacted by the project
according to applicable level of service standards. Each of the proposed mitigation measures is
presented below:

(4) Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way (Unsignalized)
Mitigation:     The necessary improvements to mitigate project impacts at this intersection consist of the
                signalization of the intersection with protected left-turn phasing on Winchester Boulevard.
                Intersection level of service would improve to LOS B during both peak hours with the
                improvements. However, based upon vehicular queuing analysis, it is recommended that
                the project entrance at Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way be restricted to right-turn
                in and out only and a new signalized project entrance be provided along Winchester
                Boulevard approximately 200 feet south of Albright Way. The new signalized entrance
                will be aligned with the entrance to the Courtside Club forming a new four-legged
                signalized intersection with signal interconnect to the signals at Winchester Boulevard
                and Wimbledon Drive and Winchester Boulevard and SR 85(S). The close spacing of
                                                                                      v | Page   
                                                                         
Albright Way Development                                                                    March 17, 2011 

                only 400 feet between the new signal and the signal at Wimbledon Drive will require that
                the two signals be coordinated.

(7) University Avenue and Lark Avenue (Unsignalized)
Mitigation:     The necessary improvements to mitigate project impacts at this intersection consist of the
                signalization of the intersection with signal interconnect to and coordination with the
                signal at Winchester Boulevard and Lark Avenue. Intersection level of service would
                improve to LOS B during both peak hours with the improvements. It should be noted that
                this intersection is projected to operate at unacceptable levels under Town of Los Gatos
                2020 General Plan Conditions. The Town of Los Gatos Draft 2020 General Plan identifies
                the above improvement as a roadway improvement necessary to accommodate the
                future development allowed under the 2020 General Plan. However, due to the lack of
                dedicated funding sources for the improvements identified in the General Plan, this
                improvement cannot be assumed to be completed under project conditions. Therefore,
                the project will be required to fund and construct the improvement, unless other
                development is identified that will contribute a `fair share' amount toward the
                implementation of the improvement.

Freeway Segment Analysis
The results of the freeway level of service analysis are summarized in Table ES 2. The freeway level of
service analysis shows that there would be no significant impact under project conditions on any of the
study freeway segments.


Other Transportation Issues
Intersection Operational Impacts
Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way
Based on projected traffic volumes and signalization of the Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way
intersection, it is estimated that 95 percent of the time during the AM peak hour the southbound
Winchester Boulevard to eastbound Albright Way vehicle queue is estimated to be 7 vehicles per lane
under project conditions. Therefore, the estimated queue would extend back and over the rail line under
project conditions by approximately two vehicles, or 50 feet.
It is recommended that the project entrance at Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way be restricted to
right-turn in and out only and a new signalized project entrance be provided along Winchester Boulevard
approximately 200 feet south of Albright Way. The new signalized entrance will be aligned with the
entrance to the Courtside Club forming a new four-legged signalized intersection with signal interconnect
to the signals at Winchester Boulevard and Wimbledon Drive and Winchester Boulevard and SR 85(S).
The close spacing of only 400 feet between the new signal and the signal at Wimbledon Drive will require
that the two signals be coordinated. The new entrance location would provide adequate storage for
projected queues and would not interfere with the rail line.

Winchester Boulevard and Lark Avenue
Under project conditions, the southbound Winchester Boulevard to eastbound Lark Avenue vehicle queue
is estimated to be 19 vehicles, or 475 feet per lane, presenting an inadequacy of 200 feet per lane.
Currently, vehicles exceed the existing storage capacity and extend into the southbound through lanes
back through the signalized Wimbledon Drive intersection and frequently block access to and from this
signalized intersection. If the Town of Los Gatos desired to lengthen the left turn pockets to the 475 feet
that is necessary to accommodate the vehicle queues, the signal at the Wimbledon Drive intersection
could be removed and restricted to right-turn only access, thereby gaining the necessary storage space.
However, the removal of the signal at Wimbledon Drive would eliminate access from northbound
                                                                                      vi | Page   
                                                                         
Albright Way Development                                                                   March 17, 2011 

Winchester Boulevard to the residences and commercial properties located along Wimbledon Drive.
Presently, any overflow of left-turning vehicles backs into the through lanes. However, most traffic turns
left at Lark Avenue, and as a consequence, what inconvenience is made for through traffic is not felt by
many drivers. Alternatively an additional 100 feet of storage space per lane could be added with the
extension of the existing left-turn lanes back to Wimbledon Drive. The extension of the southbound left-
turn lanes will require removal and reconstruction of the median along Winchester Boulevard between
Lark Avenue and Wimbledon Drive. However, the improvement will not provide sufficient storage space to
serve the projected queue.
Project generated traffic at other locations would be too low to have a measurable effect on queue
lengths. The vehicle queuing analysis is summarized in Table ES 3.

Transit, Pedestrian, and Bicycle Analysis
The existing transit services are expected to accommodate the additional transit trips generated by the
project without any improvements. Likewise, the existing bicycle facilities would be adequate to serve the
anticipated demand.
The project would be required to signalize the existing Albright Way and Winchester Boulevard
intersection or a construct a new signalized entrance along Winchester Boulevard approximately 200 feet
south of Albright Way. With the signalization, crosswalks will be provided and eliminate the need for
pedestrians to back track. The planned Vasona Light Rail Station will be located north of the project at the
southeast quadrant of the Winchester Boulevard and SR 85 northbound ramps.
There is no existing sidewalk provided along the eastside of the Winchester Boulevard north of Albright
and on the overcrossing of SR 85. The overpass provides adequate width to accommodate a sidewalk
along its eastside, however possible right-of-way acquisition will be required along the eastside of
Winchester Boulevard between Albright Way and the SR 85 overcrossing to provide a continuous
sidewalk between the overpass and existing sidewalk south of Albright Way. The new sidewalk would be
of benefit to pedestrian connectivity from Los Gatos south of SR 85 as well as the proposed project site.
However, the proposed project will not solely create a need for the sidewalk and the required right-of-way
to implement the sidewalk is not within the project's right-of-way. Therefore, the construction of the
sidewalk is not a feasible improvement that can be implemented by the project.

Site Access and On-Site Circulation
The review of site access and circulation is based on an illustrative site plan prepared by RBF Consulting
and Form Architecture, Inc., dated June 30, 2010 and shown in Figure 2. The site plan is illustrative only
and may vary based on final project land uses and layout. Therefore, the evaluation of site access and
circulation and recommendations discussed below may require adjustment based on a final site plan.

The project will be served by one full-access driveway and one right-turn-only access driveway along
Winchester Boulevard. As discussed above, it is recommended that the project entrance at Winchester
Boulevard and Albright Way be restricted to right-turn in and out only and a new signalized project
entrance be provided along Winchester Boulevard approximately 200 feet south of Albright Way. The new
signalized entrance will be aligned with the entrance to the Courtside Club forming a new four-legged
signalized intersection with signal interconnect to the signals at Winchester Boulevard and Wimbledon
Drive and Winchester Boulevard and SR 85(S). The close spacing of only 400 feet between the new
signal and the signal at Wimbledon Drive will require that the two signals be coordinated.

The existing surface parking lots will be reconfigured. All surface parking would have drive aisles of 25
feet in width, which would allow for adequate two-way circulation and maneuvering for 90-degree parking
stalls. According to the site plan, the internal roadway network would contain no dead-end drive aisles on
site. The existing emergency vehicle access to the project site form Charter Oaks Drive will remain in its
current location. The design and layout of the surface on-site roadways is adequate to accommodate
circulation of passenger vehicles.

Albright Way Development                                                                      March 17, 2011 

Accident Safety Analysis
The recorded collisions at the Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way intersection equate to a collision
rate 0.13 collisions per million vehicle miles. The calculated collision rate is lower than the Caltrans
average of 0.22 for an urban multi-lane roadway and 0.14 for an urban T-intersection. Based on the
provided data and collision rate calculation, there does not appear to be an issue with traffic collisions at
the Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way intersection.


Cumulative Impacts on Intersection Levels of Service
Based on the intersection level of service analysis, the same two study intersections identified to be
impacted by the project would also be impacted by the cumulative traffic volumes according to applicable
level of service standards. The required improvements at each of the two intersections to which the
project would be a cumulatively considerable contributor to a significant cumulative impact would be
identical to the required improvements in the project scenario. Each of the mitigation measures are
described below.

    (4) Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way (Unsignalized)
Mitigation:      The necessary improvements to mitigate cumulative impacts at this intersection consist
                 of the signalization of the intersection with protected left-turn phasing on Winchester
                 Boulevard. Intersection level of service would improve to LOS B during both peak hours
                 with the improvements. However, based upon vehicular queuing analysis, it is
                 recommended that the project entrance at Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way be
                 restricted to right-turn in and out only and a new signalized project entrance be provided
                 along Winchester Boulevard approximately 200 feet south of Albright Way. The new
                 signalized entrance will be aligned with the entrance to the Courtside Club forming a new
                 four-legged signalized intersection with signal interconnect to the signals at Winchester
                 Boulevard and Wimbledon Drive and Winchester Boulevard and SR 85(S). The close
                 spacing of only 400 feet between the new signal and the signal at Wimbledon Drive will
                 require that the two signals be coordinated.

    (7) University Avenue and Lark Avenue (Unsignalized)
Mitigation:      The necessary improvements to mitigate cumulative impacts at this intersection consist
                 of the signalization of the intersection with signal interconnect to and coordination with
                 the signal at Winchester Boulevard and Lark Avenue. Intersection level of service would
                 improve to LOS B and C during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively, with the
                 improvements. It should be noted that this intersection is projected to operate at
                 unacceptable levels under Town of Los Gatos 2020 General Plan Conditions. The Town
                 of Los Gatos Draft 2020 General Plan identifies the improvement above as a roadway
                 improvement necessary to accommodate the future development allowed under the 2020
                 General Plan.
One additional intersection, Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive is projected to operate at unacceptable
LOS F during the PM peak hour under cumulative with North 40 conditions. An evaluation of intersection
levels of service for cumulative with North 40 conditions without the proposed project indicate that the
Bascom Avenue and Samaritan Drive intersection would operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour. In
addition, the proposed project will account for only approximately 4% of total projected traffic volume
growth at the intersection. In contrast the North 40 project will account for approximately 90% of the total

 Notes:   Intersection Control based on existing conditions
          - Signal = signalized Intersection
          - OWSC = one-way stop controlled intersection
          - TWSC = two-way stop controlled intersection
          1
            Whole intersection weighted average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle is reported for signalized intersections.
           For unsignalized intersections, the worst case delay is reported which is normally the time it would take a vehicle on the minor street of an unsignalized intersection to make a left-turn onto the major street, expressed in seconds per vehicle.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed Albright Way
development in Los Gatos, California. The project site is located on Albright Way at the southeast corner
of the SR-85 and Winchester Boulevard interchange. The project will be served by a full-access entrance
on Winchester Boulevard at the approximate location of the existing Winchester Boulevard and Albright
Way intersection.


Project Description
The project proposes a Planned Development zoning that will allow for flexibility in the ultimate mix of
land uses on the site. There are existing office buildings on the project site, that total 250,000 s.f. The
project may consist of office alone or a mix of office and multi-family/senior residential uses. As currently
proposed, the project could include up to a maximum of 550,000 square feet of office space or a
combination of less office space with residential uses. Multi-family or senior residential uses could include
up to a maximum of 516 multi-family or 600 senior units. Within these parameters, the Town could
authorize any combination of these uses, up to these maximums, at the Site & Architectural Review
Approval stage.

Though this study evaluates the potential 550,000 s.f. of office space development on the project site, the
Town has developed three additional illustrative development scenarios that may occur on the project
site. The following illustrative development scenarios have been identified for the project site:

Scenario 1: Replacement of 250,000 s.f. of existing office space with 550,000 s.f. new office space

Scenario 2: Addition of 200,000 s.f. of office space to 141,000 s.f. of existing office to remain

Scenario 3: Replacement of 250,000 s.f. of existing office space with 200,000 s.f. of new office space
            and 516 multi-family units

Scenario 4: Replacement of 250,000 s.f. of existing office space with 200,000 s.f. of new office space
            and 600 senior units

Each of the development scenarios includes the application of a credit for the existing office uses on the
site. Traffic counts collected at each of the existing project entrances indicate that the project site is
currently generating significantly less traffic than is anticipated/approved for the site buildings suggesting
that the buildings are either underutilized or vacant. Therefore, trips were added to background conditions
to account for the underutilized/vacant space on the project site for each of the development scenarios. In
order to evaluate the potential transportation impacts of the various illustrative development scenarios


                                                                                       1 | Page   
Albright Way Development                                                                   March 17, 2011 

now, each of the three additional development scenarios were analyzed. The analysis of each scenario
includes an evaluation of intersection and freeways segment levels of service as was completed and
presented for the 550,000 s.f. office development scenario (Scenario 1) within this report. The results of
the analysis for each development scenario are described in detail in Chapter 5.
The evaluation of the additional illustrative scenarios determined that each of the development scenarios
would result in the same or less traffic impacts as the 550,000 s.f. office scenario. Therefore, the
additional scenarios are briefly described within this study, but are not discussed in the same level of
detail as the 550,000 s.f. office scenario.
The project site location and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1. An illustrative project site
plan is shown on Figure 2.


Scope of Study
The potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the Town of Los Gatos and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP). Although the
proposed project is located in the Town of Los Gatos, facilities within the Cities of San Jose and Campbell
also will be affected by the proposed project. Thus, the impacts of the project also were evaluated
following the standards and methodologies set forth by the Cities of San Jose and Campbell for facilities
located within their jurisdiction. The study included an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions
for 17 signalized intersections, two unsignalized intersections, and 32 directional freeway segments.

Traffic conditions at all of the study intersections and freeway segments were analyzed for the weekday
AM and PM peak hours. The weekday AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM
and the weekday PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the
most congested traffic conditions occur on a typical weekday.
In summary, the study includes an analysis of 17 signalized intersections, two unsignalized intersection,
and 32 directional freeway segments in the vicinity of the project site. The five CMP signalized study
intersections were evaluated against the standards of the Santa Clara County CMP while the remaining
study intersections were evaluated against the standards of each of the applicable municipalities.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
Scenario 1:        Existing Conditions. Existing conditions were represented by existing peak-hour traffic
                   volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from new
                   manual peak hour traffic counts.

Scenario 2:        Background Conditions. Background conditions were represented by future traffic volumes
                   on the existing roadway network. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding
                   the projected volumes from approved but not yet constructed developments in the study
                   area to existing peak-hour volumes. Background conditions represent the baseline
                   conditions to which project conditions are compared for the purpose of determining project

Scenario 3:        Project Conditions. Background plus project conditions (also referred to as Project
                   Conditions) were represented by future traffic volumes with the project. Future traffic
                   volumes with the project (hereafter called project traffic volumes) were estimated by
                   adding to background traffic volumes the trips associated with the proposed project.
                   Project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine
                   potential project impacts.

Scenario 4:        Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative conditions represent future traffic volumes on the
                   future transportation network. Cumulative conditions include traffic growth projected to
                   occur due to the approved development projects, the proposed project, and other
                   proposed but not yet approved (pending) development projects.
Scenario 5:        Cumulative Conditions (With 40 North). Cumulative conditions with 40 North represent
                   future traffic volumes on the future transportation network. Cumulative conditions with 40
                   North include traffic growth projected to occur due to the approved development projects,
                   the proposed project, and other proposed but not yet approved (pending) development
                   projects including the 40 North development.



Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from previous traffic studies, the Town of Los Gatos and
the Cities of San Jose and Campbell, the CMP Annual Monitoring Report, new intersection turning-
movement counts, and field observations. The following data were collected from these sources:

·   existing traffic volumes
·   lane configurations
·   signal timing and phasing
·   average speeds on freeway segments
·   list of approved and planned projects

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The analysis method is described
below.

Signalized Intersections
Signalized study intersections are subject to the local municipalities' level of service standards. The
Town of Los Gatos and Cities of San Jose and Campbell level of service methodology is TRAFFIX, which
is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method for signalized intersections. TRAFFIX
evaluates signalized intersections operations on the basis of average delay time for all vehicles at the
intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the CMP-designated intersections level of service methodology, the
Town's and each of the Cities' methodologies employs the CMP defaults values for the analysis
parameters. The Town's and each of the Cities' level of service standard for intersections is LOS D or
better. The correlation between average delay and level of service for signalized intersections is shown
in Table 1.

CMP Intersections
The only difference between the local municipal and CMP analyses is that project impacts are determined
on the basis of different level of service standards ­ the CMP level of service standard for signalized
intersections is LOS E or better.

Unsignalized Intersections
The unsignalized study intersections are located in the Town of Los Gatos and are therefore subject to
the Town of Los Gatos Level of Service standards. The correlation between average delay and level of
service for unsignalized intersections is shown in Table 2.
The level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is supplemented with an assessment of the
need for signalization of the intersection. The need for signalization of unsignalized intersections is
assessed based on the Peak Hour Volume Warrant (Warrant 3) described in the California Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (CA MUTCD), Part 4, Highway Traffic Signals,
2010. This method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication
whether vehicular peak hour traffic volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic
signal. Intersections that meet the peak hour warrant are subject to further analysis before determining
that a traffic signal is necessary. Additional analysis may include unsignalized level of service analysis
and/or operational analysis such as evaluating vehicle queuing and delay. Other options such as traffic
control devices, signage, or geometric changes may be preferable based on existing field conditions.

Freeway Segments
As prescribed in the CMP technical guidelines, the level of service for freeway segments is estimated
based on vehicle density. Density is calculated by the following formula:

                    D = V / (N*S)

                    Where:

                    D= density, in vehicles per mile per lane (vpmpl)
                    V= peak hour volume, in vehicles per hour (vph)
                    N= number of travel lanes
                    S= average travel speed, in miles per hour (mph)

The vehicle density on a segment is correlated to level of service as shown in Table 3. The CMP specifies
that a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) be used for mixed-flow lane segments that are
three lanes or wider in one direction, and a capacity of 2,200 vphpl be used for mixed-flow lane segments
that are two lanes wide in one direction. A capacity of 1,650 vphpl was used for high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lanes. The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better.

Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
the site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.


Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via SR 17 and SR 85 as described below.
SR 17 is a four- to eight-lane freeway in the vicinity of the study area. It extends south to Santa Cruz and
north to I-280 in San Jose, at which point it makes a transition into I-880 to Oakland. Access to the project
site is provided via its interchange with Lark Avenue.
SR 85 is a six-lane freeway in the vicinity of the study area. It extends north from its origin at US 101, in
South San Jose, to its termination point in Mountain View, where it once again joins with US 101. Within
the study area, SR 85 runs generally in an east-west direction and consists of two mixed-flow lanes plus a
high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction of travel. Interchanges with Bascom Avenue, SR 17,
and Winchester Boulevard provide access to the study area from SR 85.
Local access to the site is provided by Winchester Boulevard, Lark Avenue, Los Gatos Boulevard, and
Albright Way. These roadways are described below.
Winchester Boulevard is a north-south major arterial extending from Santa Clara southward to Los Gatos.
Within most of the study area, Winchester Boulevard consists of four-lanes (two lanes in each direction)
plus a two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) with a posted speed limit of 35-mph. Winchester Boulevard
changes designation to Santa Cruz Avenue south of Blossom Hill Road, in Los Gatos, and to Lincoln
Street north of Market Street, in Santa Clara. Access to the project site is provided via its intersection with
Albright Way.
Lark Avenue is a four-lane east-west arterial that runs between Winchester Boulevard and Los Gatos
Boulevard in Los Gatos with a posted speed limit of 30-mph. Direct access to SR17 is provided via an
interchange.
Los Gatos Boulevard is a four to six-lane north-south arterial that extends from SR 85 south to SR 17 with
a posted speed limit of 35-mph. North of SR 85 and south of SR 17, Los Gatos Boulevard changes
designation to Bascom Avenue and Main Street, respectively. Los Gatos Boulevard is four lanes between
SR 85 and Lark Avenue, then widens to six lanes between Lark Avenue and Blossom Hill Road. South of
Blossom Hill Road, the roadway narrows to two lanes.



                                                                                           10 | Page
                                                                                                                    
Albright Way Development                                                                      March 17, 2011

Albright Way is a two-lane loop road that runs though the project site. Direct access to the project site is
provided via its unsignalized intersection with Winchester Boulevard.


Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
There is a limited amount of bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the project site. Class II bikeways (defined
as striped bike lanes on street), are provided on Winchester Boulevard between Lark Avenue and Daves
Avenue and Blossom Hill Road between the Los Gatos Creek Trail and Cherry Blossom Lane. There is a
bike path adjacent to Los Gatos Creek, the Los Gatos Creek Trail, which extends from South of Los
Gatos through Vasona Park and into San Jose. Although there is no dedicated access point to the Los
Gatos Creek Trail from the project site, the trail can be accessed from the project site parking lots.
Though many roadways in the project area are not considered ideal routes for bicyclists due to the
moderate to heavy traffic volumes, presence of on-street parking, frequent bus service and stops, and
narrow travel area for bicyclists, bicyclists may nonetheless choose to use them for commuting and
recreational purposes since they often provide the shortest route. Due to the lack of bicycle lanes within
the study area, bicyclists should use the surrounding roadways with extreme caution. The existing bicycle
facilities within the study area are shown on Figure 3.
Pedestrian facilities in the study area consist of sidewalks along most of the surrounding streets, with the
exception of Winchester Boulevard. Sidewalks are provided along both sides of Winchester Boulevard
between Lark Avenue and Albright Way. However, due to the rail line, sidewalks are only provided along
the west side of Winchester Boulevard north of Albright Way. No sidewalks are provided along
Winchester Boulevard south of Lark Avenue. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads are located at all
of the signalized intersections in the study area. Overall, the existing sidewalks have good connectivity
and provide pedestrians with safe routes to all of the surrounding land uses in the area.


Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the VTA. The VTA provides bus service to the
immediate project area via two local routes that are described below and shown on Figure 4.
Local Route 48 operates on Winchester Boulevard in the study area. It runs from the Los Gatos Civic
Center to the Winchester Transit Center in Campbell with 30-minute headways in the AM and PM peak
hours. Route 48 operates between 6:30 AM and 8:30 PM.
Local Route 49 operates on Los Gatos Boulevard in the study area. It runs from Los Gatos Civic Center
and the Winchester Transit Center with 30-minute headways in the AM and PM peak hours. Route 49
operates between 6:30 AM and 8:00 PM.
The Winchester Transit Center is located approximately two miles from the project site. The Winchester
Transit Center provides connections to both of the above bus routes as well as serves as the southern
station and termination point of the Mountain View-Winchester LRT Line.


Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by observations in the field,
and are shown on Figure 5.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing peak-hour traffic volumes were obtained from the Town of Los Gatos and City of San Jose
TRAFFIX database and new manual intersection turning movement counts. The existing peak-hour
intersection volumes are shown on Figure 6. The traffic count data are included in Appendix A. Peak hour
intersection turning movement volumes for all intersections and study scenarios are tabulated in
Appendix B.


Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 4. The
results show that, measured against the applicable municipal and CMP level of service standards, all
signalized study intersections currently operate at an acceptable level of service. The levels of service
calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.
The level of service analysis for the unsignalized intersections of Winchester Boulevard/Albright Way and
University Avenue/Lark Avenue, which are located in the Town of Los Gatos, shows that the controlled
movements at the intersections (the movements from Albright Way and University Avenue) currently
operate with large delays equivalent to LOS E or worse during at least one peak hour. Observations in
the field confirm the accuracy of the level of service analysis.


Existing Peak-Hour Traffic Signal Warrant Checks
The results of the peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks under existing conditions are summarized in
Table 5. The results indicate that the University Avenue and Lark Avenue intersection currently has traffic
conditions during both peak hours that meet the signal warrant thresholds. The peak-hour signal warrant
sheets are contained in Appendix D.


Existing Freeway Levels of Service
Traffic volumes for the subject freeway segments were obtained from the 2009 CMP Annual Monitoring
Report. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 6. The results show that the mixed-flow lanes
on 10 of the 32 directional freeway segments analyzed currently operate at an unacceptable LOS F
during at least one of the peak hours. The results also show that one of directional HOV lane segments
analyzed currently operates at an unacceptable LOS F during at least one of the peak hours.

Background Conditions
This chapter describes background traffic conditions. Background conditions are defined as conditions
just prior to completion of the proposed development and include traffic volumes associated with
approved developments that are either under construction, built but not fully occupied, or that have yet to
be constructed but are approved. Trips also were added to background conditions to account for the
underutilized/vacant space on the project site. This chapter describes the procedure used to determine
background traffic volumes and the resulting traffic conditions.


Background Transportation Network
There are no approved and fully funded roadway improvement projects in the study area. Thus, the
roadway network under background conditions would be the same as the existing roadway network.


Background Traffic Volumes
Background peak-hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing volumes the estimated traffic
from approved, but not yet constructed, developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet
constructed developments was provided by the Town of Los Gatos in the form of their TRAFFIX database
network. Traffic generated by approved projects within the City of San Jose was also included in the
background traffic volumes. The list of approved projects included in this analysis is included in Appendix
E and is as follows:

    ·   15940 Blossom Hill Road (Residential)
    ·   15881 Linda Avenue (Residential)
    ·   371 Los Gatos Boulevard (Residential)
    ·   55 Los Gatos Boulevard (Motel)
    ·   15720 Winchester Boulevard (Office)
    ·   14881 National Avenue (Medical/Dental Office)
    ·   15400 Los Gatos Boulevard (Medical ­ Dental/Hi-Turnover Restaurant)
    ·   930 University Avenue (Warehouse)
    ·   Samaritan/Los Gatos Boulevard (Medical Office)
    ·   Town Library (Library)

    ·   192 Los Gatos Boulevard (Walk-in Bank)
    ·   16922 Mitchell Avenue
    ·   15780 Los Gatos Boulevard (Medical Office)

The existing buildings on the project site, that total 250,000 s.f., have approval as office space. However,
a comparison of existing traffic counts collected at each of the existing project entrances with trip
generation estimated using trip rates recommended in the Institute of Transportation Engineer (ITE) Trip
Generation, Eighth Edition, 2008 indicates that the project site is currently generating significantly less
traffic than is anticipated/approved for the site. The existing counts indicate that the buildings on site are
underutilized. Since the existing buildings on the project site have the potential to generate traffic that is
equivalent to that estimated based on ITE rates, the difference between the ITE estimated trip generation
and existing entrance counts was added to background conditions to account for the underutilized space.
The existing entrance counts and trip generation based on ITE trip generation rates is presented in Table
7. The peak-hour trips estimated to be generated by the underutilized space were assigned to the
roadway system in accordance with the trip distribution pattern discussed in Chapter 4.
Background traffic volumes are shown on Figure 7.


Background Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing and background conditions are
summarized in Table 8. The results show that, measured against the applicable municipal and CMP level
of service standards, all of the signalized study intersections are projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service under background conditions. The levels of service calculation sheets are included in
Appendix C.

The level of service analysis for the unsignalized intersections of Winchester Boulevard/Albright Way and
University Avenue/Lark Avenue, which are located in the Town of Los Gatos, shows that the controlled
movements at the intersections (the movements from Albright Way and University Avenue) are projected
to operate with large delays equivalent to LOS E or worse during at least one peak hour under
background conditions.


Background Peak-Hour Traffic Signal Warrant Check
The results of the peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks under background conditions are summarized
on Table 9. The results indicate that both unsignalized study intersections would have traffic conditions
that meet the signal warrant thresholds during at least one peak hour under background conditions. The
peak-hour signal warrant sheets are contained in Appendix D

Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures
This chapter describes project traffic conditions, significant project impacts, and measures that are
recommended to mitigate project impacts. Included are descriptions of the significance criteria that define
an impact, estimates of project-generated traffic, identification of the impacts, and descriptions of the
mitigation measures. Project conditions are represented by background traffic conditions with the addition
of traffic generated by the proposed project.


Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, significance
criteria for impacts on intersections are based on the Town of Los Gatos, Cities of San Jose and
Campbell, and CMP Level of Service standards.
Project impacts on other transportation facilities, such as bicycle facilities and transit, were determined on
the basis of engineering judgment.

Town of Los Gatos Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at an intersection in the
Town of Los Gatos if for either peak hour:
    1. The addition of project traffic causes an intersection operating at LOS A, B, or C under
       background conditions to degrade more than one letter grade under project conditions, or

    2. The level of service at an intersection is LOS D or worse under background conditions and the
       addition of project trips causes a degradation at all of LOS.

The project shall mitigate any intersection project impact so that the level of service will remain at an
acceptable level.

City of San Jose Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
in the City of San Jose if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under project conditions, or
    2. For intersections where LOS E has been established as an acceptable level, the addition of
       project trips causes the level of service to degrade to LOS F under project conditions.


                                                                                                        2 7   |   P a g e   
Albright Way Development                                                                           March 17, 2011 

    3. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase.
An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average delay
for critical movements (i.e. the change in average delay for critical movements is negative). In this case,
the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by City of San Jose standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.

City of Campbell Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
in the City of Campbell if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable level of service under project conditions, or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
       increase by one percent (.01) or more.
A significant impact by City of Campbell standards is said to be satisfactory mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection levels of operation to background conditions or better.

CMP Definition of Significant Intersection LOS Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of San Jose, except
that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or better.
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a CMP-designated
signalized intersection if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions, or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS F under background conditions
       and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the intersection to
       increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by one
       percent (.01) or more.
An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average delay
for critical movements (i.e. the change in average delay for critical movements is negative). In this case,
the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.

CMP Definition of Significant Freeway Segment Impacts
The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better. A project is
said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions on a CMP freeway segment if for either
peak hour:
    1. The level of service on the freeway segment degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions, or
    2. The level of service on the freeway segment is an unacceptable LOS F under project conditions
       and the number of project trips on that segment constitutes at least one percent of capacity on
       that segment.

A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore freeway conditions to background conditions.


Transportation Network under Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under project conditions would be the same
as described under background conditions.


Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution step, an estimate is made
of the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment step, the
project trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections in the study area. These procedures are
described further in the following sections.

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation
rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development.
Hexagon has prepared project trip estimates for the proposed additional 300,000 square feet (s.f.) of
office space based on trip generation rates obtained from Institute of Transportation Engineer (ITE) Trip
Generation, Eighth Edition, 2008.
The total net project trips that would be added to the roadway network were estimated by subtracting the
number of trips associated with the existing/approved 250,000 s.f. of office uses on site from the total
estimated gross number of trips that would be generated by the proposed 550,000 s.f. of office space.
After reduction of the existing trips from the gross project trips, t is estimated that the proposed 300,000
s.f. of additional office space would generate an additional 3,126 daily trips, with 411 trips (366 inbound
and 45 outbound) occurring during the AM peak hour and 366 trips (51 inbound and 315 outbound)
occurring during the PM peak hour. The project trip generation estimates are presented in Table 10.

Trip Distribution
The trip distribution pattern for the proposed office development was estimated based on traffic patterns
on the surrounding roadway system and on the locations of complementary land uses. The trip
distribution was reviewed and approved for use by Town of Los Gatos staff. The project trip distribution
pattern is shown graphically on Figure 8.

Trip Assignment
The peak-hour trips associated with the proposed project were added to the transportation network
in accordance with the distribution pattern discussed above. Figure 9 shows the assignment of
project traffic on the local transportation network. A tabular summary of project traffic at each study
intersection is contained in Appendix B.

Project Traffic Volumes
Project trips, as represented in the above project trip assignment, were added to background
traffic volumes to obtain background plus project traffic volumes. Background traffic volumes plus
project trips are typically referred to simply as project traffic volumes; this is contrasted with the
term project trips, which is used to signify the traffic that is produced specifically by the project.
The project traffic volumes are shown on Figure 10.


Project Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under project conditions are summarized in Table
11. Under project conditions, the level of service analysis at the unsignalized intersections of Winchester
Boulevard/Albright Way and University Avenue/Lark Avenue, which are located in the Town of Los Gatos,
indicates that the controlled movements at the intersections (the movements from Albright Way and
University Avenue) are projected to continue to operate with large delays equivalent to LOS E or worse
during at least one peak hour under project conditions. The addition of project traffic would worsen the
delays under project conditions. Based on the Town of Los Gatos significance criteria, the project would
significantly impact the unsignalized intersections of Winchester Boulevard/Albright Way and University
Avenue/Lark Avenue.

All other study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service under project
conditions. Levels of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix C.


Project Peak-Hour Traffic Signal Warrant Check
The results of the peak-hour traffic signal warrant checks under project conditions are summarized on
Table 12. The results indicate that both unsignalized study intersections would have traffic conditions that
meet the signal warrant thresholds during at least one peak hour under project conditions. The peak-hour
signal warrant sheets are contained in Appendix D.


Project Intersection Level of Service Impacts and Mitigations
Described below are the intersection impacts and recommended mitigation measures. Table 13 shows
the resulting levels of service for project conditions with the recommended mitigation measures.

(4) Winchester Boulevard and Albright Way (Unsignalized)
Impact:          This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable LOS E during both peak
                 hours under background conditions. The addition of project traffic would cause the
                 intersection's level of service to degrade to LOS F during both peak hours under project
                 conditions. The intersection also would meet signal warrants with the addition of project
                 traffic. This constitutes a significant impact by Town of Los Gatos standards.
Mitigation:      The necessary improvements to mitigate project impacts at this intersection consist of the
                 signalization of the intersection with protected left-turn phasing on Winchester Boulevard.
                 Intersection level of service would improve to LOS B during both peak hours with the
                 improvements. However, based upon vehicular queuing analysis discussed in the
                 following chapter, it is recommended that the project entrance at Winchester Boulevard
                 and Albright Way be restricted to right-turn in and out only and a new signalized project
                 entrance be provided along Winchester Boulevard approximately 200 feet south of
                 Albright Way. The new signalized entrance will be aligned with the entrance to the
                 Courtside Club forming a new four-legged signalized intersection with signal interconnect
                 to the signals at Winchester Boulevard and Wimbledon Drive and Winchester Boulevard

           Whole intersection weighted average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle is reported for signalized intersections.
          For unsignalized intersections, the worst case delay is reported which is normally the time it would take a vehicle
          on the minor street of an unsignalized intersection to make a left-turn onto the major street, expressed in seconds per vehicle.

                       at Wimbledon Drive will require that the two signals be coordinated.

(7) University Avenue and Lark Avenue (Unsignalized)
Impact:                This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable LOS F during the PM peak
                       hour under background conditions. The addition of project traffic would cause the
                       intersection's operating levels to worsen during both peak hours under project conditions.
                       The intersection also would meet signal warrants with the addition of project traffic. This
                       constitutes a significant impact by Town of Los Gatos standards.
Mitigation:            The necessary improvements to mitigate project impacts at this intersection consist of the
                       signalization of the intersection with signal interconnect to and coordination with the
                       signal at Winchester Boulevard and Lark Avenue. Intersection level of service would
                       improve to LOS B during both peak hours with the improvements. It should be noted that
                       this intersection is projected to operate at unacceptable levels under Town of Los Gatos
                       2020 General Plan Conditions. The Town of Los Gatos Draft 2020 General Plan identifies
                       the above improvement as a roadway improvement necessary to accommodate the
                                                                                                                                                 3 5   |   P a g e

                future development allowed under the 2020 General Plan. However, due to the lack of
                dedicated funding sources for the improvements identified in the General Plan, this
                improvement cannot be assumed to be completed under project conditions. Therefore,
                the project will be required to fund and construct the improvement, unless other
                development is identified that will contribute a `fair share' amount toward the
                implementation of the improvement.


Freeway Segment Analysis
Traffic volumes on the study freeway segments under project conditions were estimated by adding project
trips to the existing volumes obtained from the 2009 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. The results of the
freeway analysis summarized in Table 14 show that the project would not cause a significant impact on
any of the study freeway segments.

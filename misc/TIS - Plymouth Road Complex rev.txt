EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of this study is to determine the traffic impacts that would occur due to the development of a
retail building within an existing retail development fronting on Plymouth Road in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The
one acre site is located at 3600 Plymouth Road, and is currently predominantly vacant, but includes an
existing parking area. The proposed 9,490 square foot building will house a coffee/donut shop with a drive
through, a fast food restaurant without drive through and a small retail site.

This report contains an introduction to the project, describes methodology used in the analyses, provides
backup data in the form of figures and appendices, and documents the conclusions from the data
presented and subsequent recommendations.

Trips generated by the proposed site were calculated using the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual, 8th Edition. Hourly traffic volumes for the existing street network were provided using
manual traffic counts conducted by DGL Consulting Engineers, LLC and estimated data at the Plymouth
Road & US 23 interchange. The generated trips and the existing volumes were then combined to assess
the impacts of the proposed development for the existing, opening and horizon years.

Analyses were conducted to determine needed turn lanes, traffic control (signalized or unsignalized) and
other necessary improvements. The results of the analyses lead to recommendations that will manage the
traffic generated by the proposed site.

The following recommendations are offered to manage the traffic in and around the site:

        ·   Retain current access to Plymouth Road and Green Road via common access drives.
        ·   Retain existing stop control at current access points on Plymouth Road and Green
            Road.
        ·   Retain existing lane configuration on Plymouth and on Green Road at access locations.
        ·   Improve access management signing present on the Plymouth Road Access Drive
            adjacent to the site in an effort to eliminate the prohibited left turn movements which are
            currently being made.

It is recommended that the Traffic Impact Study for this parcel be approved and the development be
allowed to continue through the site development review process with the recommendations provided in
this report.

INTRODUCTION

The proposed parcel is located at 3600 Plymouth Road in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The location of the
proposed development is shown on the Location Map, Figure 1.




                                         FIGURE 1 ' LOCATION MAP

The nearby land uses are commercial in nature with adjacent properties consisting of hotels, a grocery
store and various small businesses. A BP gas station is located directly opposite the common shopping
center access drive. An eastbound to southbound entrance ramp to US 23 is located immediately east of
the parcel.

Plymouth Road is generally a five lane urban principal arterial with a two way left turn lane, and a posted
speed limit of 45 mph. A supplemental eastbound through lane is present beginning west of Green Road
and continuing/transitioning into an exclusive right turn lane to SB US 23. Dedicated left and right turn
lanes are developed approaching signalized intersections. Signals are located at Green Road, 540 feet to
the west and at the US 23 interchange, 570 to the east, as measured from the center of the common
access drive. The signals along Plymouth Road are coordinated under SCOOT traffic adaptive control.

Green Road is an urban collector road consisting of three lanes with a two way left turn lane south of
Plymouth Road and 5 lanes with a two way left turn lane north of Plymouth Road. Bike lanes are also
present adjacent to each curb beginning approximately 400' south of Plymouth Road. Left and right turn




                                                                                                               2
                                                                      Traffic Impact Study ­ Plymouth Road Retail
                                                                                              Ann Arbor, Michigan



lanes are present on both approaches at the Plymouth Road intersection. The speed limit on Green Road
is 35 mph. A common access drive to Green Road exists 230' south of Plymouth Road.

Figure 2 shows an aerial view of the current conditions.




                                           FIGURE 2 AERIAL VIEW

The proposed site will consist of a 9,490 square foot, 1 story building having 2,400 square feet of space
designated for the coffee/donut shop; 2,400 square feet designated for the fast food restaurant; and the
balance dedicated to general retail use. Construction is expected to begin in early fall 2012 and ready for
tenant occupancy during the summer of 2013.

The existing parcel accesses Plymouth Road and Green Road via common access drives. The common
access drive to Plymouth Road is a two lane boulevard posted with a left turn restriction, but with enough
width on egress for drivers to utilize it as a double right turn facility. The northernmost common access
drive to Green Road is a 2 lane drive. Additional access points are available toward the south on Green
Road via cross access to hotels, a medical facility and office sites. The proposed development will utilize
these existing access points; no additional access is requested.

The proposed site plan is shown in Figure 3.




                                                                                                               3

METHODOLOGY

The methodology used in this study follows the recommended practice contained in Manual of
Transportation Engineering Studies, 2nd Edition, ITE, 2010 as follows:

    ·   Existing Conditions Data Collection
    ·   Site Traffic Forecasts
    ·   Non Site Traffic Forecasts
    ·   Total Traffic Estimates
    ·   Analyses
    ·   Recommendations

Existing Conditions Data Collection
Traffic forecasting for the adjacent street network involves collection of existing data including traffic counts,
adjacent drive locations, access control, access management regulations, signal phasing and timing, signs
and pavement markings, parking regulations, street lighting, posted speeds, transit, pedestrians, location of
other large traffic generators and current or future projects for within the study area. Traffic data for the
study area were collected from the following sources:

    ·   Manual turn count (7 9 am, 3 6 pm), Plymouth Road & Green Road, by DGL Consulting Engineers,
        LLC, July 23, 2012.
    ·   Manual turn count (7 9 am, 3 6 pm), Plymouth Road & Common Access Drive, by DGL Consulting
        Engineers, LLC, July 23, 2012.
    ·   Manual turn count (7 9 am, 3 6 pm), Green Road & Northernmost Common Access Drive, by DGL
        Consulting Engineers, LLC, July 23, 2012.
    ·   Manual turn count (7 9 am, 3 6 pm), Plymouth Road & SB US 23, by DGL Consulting Engineers,
        LLC, August 2, 2012.

See Appendix A for Traffic Data.

Site Traffic Forecasts
Site Traffic Forecasts include trip generation, trip distribution and assignment along with modal splits (if
applicable). Trip generation was performed utilizing the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition. Other trip
generation considerations include passby trips, diverted link trips and internal capture trips.

Land uses such as retail establishments, restaurants, banks, and drug stores attract a portion of their trips
from the traffic passing by on the adjacent street network. Passby trips divert traffic already using the
adjacent road network for other purposes. Pass by trips were estimated based on land use utilizing
equations contained in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, and average 50 percent.

Multi use sites also generate trips within the site itself. These trips are defined as internal to the site and
are commonly known as captured trips. A key characteristic of a multi use site is that trips can be made
among the various land uses without leaving the internal site street network. Land uses such as residential
to office, office to retail, and retail to office are associated with captured trips. The existing site is a multi
use development, containing multiple land uses including a grocery store, several hotels and restaurants,


                                                                                                                   5
                                                                       Traffic Impact Study ­ Plymouth Road Retail
                                                                                               Ann Arbor, Michigan



professional office space, various medical facilities and other commercial. The ITE Trip Generation Manual
provides estimates of internal capture rates within multi use developments. This rate for office to retail is
estimated as 23% during the p.m. peak hour; and 20% for retail to retail during the same period. Captured
trips were estimated on the conservative side at 20 percent.

In order to generate the traffic volumes expected to enter and exit the site, certain assumptions must be
made as to the distribution of those trips. Assumptions were made based on population density, current
travel patterns and knowledge of the area to assign percentages. Site generated trips were distributed
in/out of the site according to access points available in the existing development. See Appendix B for
Proposed Site Trip Generation.

Non'site Traffic Forecasts
In addition to the traffic generated by the site and approved projects, changes may occur outside the study
area that will affect the transportation system in the design years, typically 20 years beyond the opening of
a development. Estimates of non site traffic are required for a complete analysis of design year conditions.
The base or background condition is established in the existing conditions data collection. The growth
expected due to buildup or transportation projects is calculated using growth rates or regional traffic
models. The growth rate method is typically used for smaller studies using historical data and regression
analysis. Regional traffic modeling is more common with larger developments.

The land surrounding Plymouth Road west of US 23 is highly developed, and traffic flow is nearly saturated
for much of the day. A growth rate of 0.5% per year was estimated for the surrounding street network
based on these conditions.

Total Traffic Estimates
For each analysis period, a projected total traffic volume must be determined for the study area. The
projected total traffic volumes consist of site and non site traffic volumes. The projected total traffic
volumes are then used to determine whether the roadway system can handle the increased traffic demand.

Analyses
Analyses are conducted to assess the change in roadway operating conditions resulting from the
development traffic. These analyses may include but are not limited to turn lanes, capacity, signal
warrants, and access management.

Turn Lanes ­ MDOT's Michigan Access Management Guidebook provides guidelines to promote
uniformity in determining the need for left turn lanes and right turn lanes. These guidelines conform to the
NCHRP Intersection Design Guide and are based on traffic volumes and roadway speed. If applicable,
local turn lane requirements are also reviewed.

Capacity ­ Highway Capacity Software is utilized to evaluate traffic operating conditions and measure
them against the standard known as Level of Service (LOS). Existing conditions are first analyzed using
existing traffic control and geometrics. Each analysis period is then studied using these same parameters
to determine whether mitigation measures are needed at a particular intersection. Unsignalized
intersections should be analyzed as unsignalized throughout the study process unless signalization is
planned and warranted. Signalized intersection should be analyzed under the same signalized parameters



                                                                                                                6
                                                                       Traffic Impact Study ­ Plymouth Road Retail
                                                                                               Ann Arbor, Michigan



until mitigation measures are identified. If signalization is proposed and will be part of an arterial street
system, analysis of traffic progression within the system should be conducted.

Capacity analyses, based upon timing and phasing data provided by the City of Ann Arbor, were used to
determine the level of service at the following intersections:

    ·   Green Road & Access Drive (Unsignalized)
    ·   Plymouth Road & Green Road (Signalized)
    ·   Plymouth Road & Access Drive (Unsignalized)
    ·   Plymouth Road & SB US 23 (Signalized)

Signal Warrants ­ PC Warrants software and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) is
used to determine whether an intersection meets the requirements for signalization.

Access Management ­ The MDOT Michigan Access Management Guidebook is a valuable resource used
to determine the necessary spacing of driveways and intersections both along the development frontage
and with adjacent property owners. Safe and efficient movement of traffic for site and non site traffic is
important. Mitigation may include combining of drives, removal of drives, and the installation of median or
island to restrict certain movements.

Traffic impact studies do not typically include parking studies or on site circulation analysis, however, the
relationship between site ingress/egress location and lane configurations may affect various site plan
components and should be reviewed.

Drive Thru Analysis ­ When a development involves a drive thru facility, an analysis is performed to verify
that queues developed within the drive thru lane will not exceed on site constraints. The analysis will use
average arrival and service rates provided by the owner or accepted observed data. This analysis utilizes
data provided in a report by Mike Spack et.al. dated February, 2012 entitled "Drive Thru Queue
Generation" which provides information and analysis on recent data and observations for various lane
uses, including Coffee Shops. The report includes information provided in a 2009 presentation from the
ITE Annual Meeting and Exhibit entitled "New Drive Through Stacking Information for Banks and Coffee
Shops". Both studies supplement the accepted "Queuing Areas for Drive Thru Facilities" ITE Journal, (May
1995) which did not address this land use type.

Recommendations
After all calculations and analyses have been completed and a thorough examination of the resulting data
takes place, recommendations are presented. The recommendations will provide improvements needed to
maintain traffic flow adjacent to the site at acceptable levels of service.

EXISTING YEAR (2012)

Existing (2012) traffic was determined from the AM & PM Peak hour manual traffic counts. Figure 4 depicts
the Existing Year (2012) AM Peak Traffic Volumes. A definite directional pattern is noted on Plymouth
Road during the AM peak hour, with westbound traffic approximately 75% higher than eastbound traffic.

Figure 5 depicts the Existing Year (2012) PM Peak Traffic Volumes. Again, a definite directional pattern
exists on Plymouth Road during the PM peak hour, with eastbound traffic approximately 50% higher than
westbound traffic. These patterns reflect the commuter activity associated with the site's proximity to US
23.

     The proposed use is not expected to be open during the am peak hour, however, to be conservative,
     AM trips have been included in the analysis

Table 1 shows the site generated trips in the AM Peak Hour. Table 2 shows the site generated trips in the
PM Peak Hour. Where available, trip generation was based on data during the roadway peak hour. In the
case of the Fast Food Restaurant without Drive Through Window, the generation for PM Peak Hour of
Street appeared to be exceptionally low, so the generation for PM Peak Hour of Generator was used. Trip
generation calculations are found in Appendix B and notations are provided regarding assumptions made.

Trips were distributed on the site access points. It was assumed that employees and visitors would travel
to and from the local area and US 23, and site generated trips are based upon existing site trip distribution.
Expansion factors were used to generate the Opening Year (2013) background traffic. An annual
expansion rate of 0.5% per year was assumed based upon the relatively full development of the area and
current traffic saturation on Plymouth Road. The site generated trips were then added to the Opening Year
(2013) Background Traffic to obtain the Opening Year (2013) AM Peak Traffic Volumes as shown on Figure
6. Figure 7 shows the Opening Year (2013) PM Peak Traffic Volumes.

ANALYSES AND CONCLUSIONS

Signal Warrant Analyses
Signal Warrants have not been prepared for this analysis for the reasons noted below.

Plymouth Road Access
This drive functions as a full access ingress, and right turn only egress point. Traffic signals do not
typically benefit left turns into a facility, and when installed for this purpose, can become disruptive to traffic
flow on the primary street. Right turns are made using available gaps in traffic. Signalization is not
necessary or proper at this location and has not been considered as a feasible option.

Green Road Northernmost Access
Over 70% of drivers exiting the site at this location turn right, which makes its operation somewhat similar
to that of the Plymouth Road drive. Additional access points south on Green Road are available for traffic
entering and exiting the site. Traffic was observed to queue on Green Road through this intersection
several times during the am peak and routinely through the pm peak. Neither existing nor projected traffic
volumes are sufficient to consider installation of a traffic signal, and the intersection functions at LOS C or
better under the current stop control. Signalization would be disruptive to traffic flow on Green Road and
has not been considered as a feasible option.

Turn Lane Analyses
The MDOT Michigan Access Management Guidebook has been used to determine the necessary turn
lanes based on traffic volumes and speed. The MDOT Geometric Design Guide provides some guidance
as to turn lane lengths, with 250' lengths being specified as "desirable" in all cases where warranted. Both
Synchro and Highway Capacity Software were used to assess 95% queues for the two unsignalized drives.
However, these analyses only address current conditions, do not result in recommended storage lengths
and completely ignore potential right turn queues. For this reason, we have calculated storage
requirements using a commonly accepted practice.

Plymouth Road Access
A westbound two way left turn lane is provided for ingress to the site. This lane also serves an opposing
shared access drive 270' to the east. Peak left turns onto the site currently occur during the AM peak. The
eastbound curb lane is effectively a continuous right turn lane that serves the high right turn traffic volume
to SB US 23. Peak right turns onto the site currently occur during the PM peak. Limitations present in HCS
do not allow accurate modeling of this intersection's true function, thus the 95% queue values shown are
those generated by Synchro. Recommended storage for turn movements is as follows:

Recommended left and right turn storage is available for both present and projected conditions and
modifications associated with this development are not required.

Green Road Northernmost Access
A dedicated left turn lane is not provided southbound at this location; however, a de facto turn lane exists,
as the two southbound lanes merge into a single lane at this point. The northbound curb lane is effectively
a continuous right turn lane that serves the high right turn movement at Plymouth Road, and is marked as
such to a point approximately 30' south of this drive. Peak left and right turns onto the site currently both
occur during the PM peak. 95% calculated queues are identical in HCS & Synchro for this location.
Recommended storage for turn movements is as follows:

While the southbound left turn lane is not marked, recommended left and right turn storage is available for
both present and projected conditions and modifications associated with this development are not required.

See Appendix C for all Storage Length Calculations.

Capacity Analyses
When assessing capacity at an isolated intersection, the signal timings are typically balanced so that the
delay of the worst approach of the main direction is within one to three seconds of the delay of the worst
approach of the minor direction. However, the existing signals along Plymouth Road are within a
coordinated system.

For this study, capacity was evaluated using Synchro models, a software package that is based upon the
Highway Capacity Manual. The capacity analyses focused on the following intersections:

    ·     Green Road & Access Drive (Unsignalized)
    ·     Plymouth Road & Green Road (Signalized)
    ·     Plymouth Road & Access Drive (Unsignalized)
    ·     Plymouth Road & SB US 23 (Signalized)

While the SCOOT System on Plymouth allows the cycle length to adapt to differences in traffic volumes,
this function is difficult to model. Per the recommendation of the City of Ann Arbor, these analyses were
performed using existing timing for the combination 120"/60" cycles under system controlled phasing.

In summary:
    · Site generated "new" traffic represents about 2% of traffic currently present on the street system
       adjacent to this development.
    · Both of the unsignalized intersections operate very well (LOS B or better) during the AM Peak
       under all scenarios.
    · The Plymouth Road & Green Road intersection currently operates at LOS E, and is projected to
       retain LOS E operation in 2013 under both no build and build conditions. For 2033, this
       intersection is projected to operate at LOS E under both no build and build conditions.
    · The Plymouth Road & SB US 23 intersection currently operates at LOS D, and is projected to
       retain LOS D operation in 2013 under both no build and build conditions. For 2033, this
       intersection is projected to operate at LOS E under both no build and build conditions.

In summary:
    · Site generated "new" traffic represents about 2% of traffic currently present on the street system
       adjacent to this development.
    · All of the unsignalized intersections operate well (LOS C or better) during the PM Peak under all
       scenarios.
    · The Plymouth Road & Green Road intersection currently operates at LOS F. Observations
       suggest that the delays at this intersection may be partially attributed to the split phasing present
       for Green Road coupled with the significantly increased traffic on this corridor during the PM peak
       hour. Site generated traffic increases overall delay by about 3%.
    · The Plymouth Road & SB US 23 intersection currently operates at LOS B, and is projected to
       retain LOS B operation in 2013 under both no build and build conditions. It is interesting to note
       that PM Peak operation is better than during AM Peak. Data and observations indicate that this
       may be attributed to the lower volumes exiting US 23 than during the AM Peak, particularly the left
       turn volume. Left turns cleared nearly every cycle, and were only disrupted by periodic heavy exit
       movements from the Park & Ride lot. For 2033, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS C
       under both no build and build conditions.

Time Space Diagrams ­ The PM Peak Hour timing plan currently provides an eastbound arterial band of 13
seconds and a westbound arterial band of 26 seconds. The westbound band remains for all scenarios; the
eastbound band is reduced to 12 seconds for the 2013 scenarios and 11 seconds for the 2033 scenarios.

Drive Thru Analysis
The proposed site does not have direct access to the public right of way, thus, queuing has been assessed
to ensure that projected queues will not interfere with circulation on the shared access drive. Based on the
proposed site plan, approximately 285' is available for on site queuing. The report "Drive Thru Queue
Generation" concludes that the 85th percentile queue length for Coffee Shops is 13 vehicles, or 260'. Thus,
adequate space is available on site to accommodate expected queues.

Appendix E includes applicable information from the referenced report.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of this study is to determine the traffic impacts that would occur due to the development of a
retail building within an existing retail development fronting on Plymouth Road. The one acre site is located
at 3600 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan and is currently predominantly vacant, but includes some
existing parking area. The proposed 9,490 square foot building will house a coffee/donut shop with a drive
through, a fast food restaurant without drive through and a small retail site.

The Green intersection & Plymouth Road intersection currently fails during the PM peak. Site generated
traffic does not necessitate any improvements over and above what is appropriate to accommodate the
existing traffic.

Based on the results of the signal warrant consideration, turn lane analyses, capacity analyses, and
coordination analyses, the following recommendations are offered to manage the traffic in and around the
site:
        · Retain current access to Plymouth Road and Green Road via common access drives.
        · Retain existing stop control at current access points on Plymouth Road and Green
            Road.
        · Retain existing lane configuration on Plymouth and on Green Road at access locations.
        · Improve access management signing present on the Plymouth Road Access Drive
            adjacent to the site in an effort to eliminate the prohibited left turn movements which are
            currently being made.

1.0 Introduction
This report provides queuing data for businesses with drive-through services. It is intended to
be an aid for site designers and reviewers, similar to the Institute of Transportation Engineers'
Trip Generation and Parking Generation reports. The data presentation is modeled on the
Parking Generation report and data is provided based on at least six sites, similar to data sets
marked as statistically significant in Trip Generation.

Businesses with drive-through lanes are very common in the United States and having data that
gives usage information for drive-through lanes will assist designers as well as cities in
determining the appropriate amount of storage needed for proposed drive-through businesses.
Data for drive-through queues was published by the ITE Technical Council Committee 5D-10 in
1995 based on information collected between the late 1960's and the 1990's. A paper was also
published in 2009 by Mark Stuecheli, PTP giving updated information for bank and coffee shop
drive-through lanes. The results from the 2009 study are incorporated into this paper (thank
you Mark for your assistance).


2.0 Data Collection
Data was collected using COUNTcam video recording systems at a total of 30 drive-through
locations in Minneapolis, MN and several surrounding suburbs between 2010 and 2012 (26 of
the 30 videos were recorded in February of 2012, which should represent peak usage in the
cold Minnesota winter). Videos of drive-through lanes were collected at banks, car washes,
coffee shops, fast food restaurants and pharmacies. A total of six locations were selected for
each of the five different land uses. Each location was recorded for between one and five days
where the majority of locations were recorded for two consecutive days. The days of the week
that each video was recorded on varies.

The 24-hour videos were watched at high speeds with the PC-TAS counting software and
maximum queues throughout the day were noted. Most of the COUNTcams were set up such
that the entire queue lane could be seen, but at a few locations the drive-through lanes
wrapped around the building in a way that the entire queue length would not be able to be
seen. For these situations, the COUNTcams were set up so that the ordering window and back
of the queue could be seen and it was noted how many vehicles could fit between the ordering
window and the front of the queue. For drive-through locations with multiple lanes, the
number of lanes was noted but the maximum queue is defined as the sum of the queues at
each lane for any given point in time, not the queue per lane. This approach provides overall
demand, which may assist designers in determining how many drive through lanes are
appropriate in addition to determining how long they should be.


Drive-Through Queue Generation                 1                                   February 2012
Once the maximum queue for each day at each location was determined, the data was
compiled and statistics for each land use were calculated. The average maximum queue,
standard deviation, coefficient of variation, range, 85 th percentile and 33rd percentile were
calculated for each land use.

Data for drive-through coffee shops and banks from the Kansas City, Kansas metropolitan area
was published in the 2009 paper New Drive-Through Stacking Information for Banks and Coffee
Shops by Mark Stuecheli. This data is included in the analysis.


3.0 Data Analysis
Based on the peak queue lengths, it is apparent that each land use will require a different
minimum drive through stacking distance. The results for each land use can be found below.
The peak queue lengths for each location, broken down by land use and day of the week, can
be found in the Appendix.

3.3 Coffee Shops
Data collection was done at six coffee shops with drive-through services in November 2010,
August 2011 and February 2012. Fourteen days of data were collected. The coffee shops were
located in the cities of Edina, Hopkins, Minneapolis, Roseville and St. Louis Park, MN. Vehicles
being served were counted as being in the queue. Twelve days of data from the Kansas City,
Kansas area is also included.

Coffee shops produced the longest maximum queues of any of the land uses in this study with
all of the maximum queues occurring in the morning. In four of the six cases, the queues spilled
out of the parking lot and into the street. These spillovers would typically only happen once or
twice a day and last only a few minutes, however, one location had stacking into the street for
about 15 minutes in addition to multiple periods of several minutes where cars would queue in
the street.

With an 85th percentile maximum queue of 13 vehicles, the data suggests that coffee shops
with drive-through lanes should be able to accommodate at least 260 feet of vehicle stacking
during morning hours.

4.0 Conclusions
The 85th percentile maximum queue lengths for each land use are: 160 feet for banks (eight
vehicles), 140 feet for car washes (seven vehicles), 260 feet for coffee shops (13 vehicles), 240
feet for fast food restaurants (12 vehicles) and 100 feet for pharmacies (five vehicles).

While some of the locations observed have an excess of space dedicated to drive-through lanes
(i.e. some banks and pharmacies), others could occasionally use additional space for drive-
through lanes (i.e. coffee shops in the morning).

Fast food restaurants and coffee shops have the longest maximum queues of the five land uses
observed. Coffee shops have a tendency for the morning queues to build so long that they spill
out onto the street, though, as is expected, their afternoon and evening queues are minimal.
Fast food restaurants also have large queues, but they tended to have enough dedicated space
that stacking did not go beyond the designated queuing area.

The data collected for this paper along with the data from the papers by Mark Stuecheli and the
ITE Technical Committee 5D-10 (see Appendix for both of these) will hopefully provide useful
data for traffic engineers and others trying to analyze drive-through queuing storage areas.

Abstract

This paper provides updated queuing information for drive-in banks and new queuing
data for coffee shops with drive-through lanes. The data is presented in a format similar
to that used in the report for ITE Technical Council Committee 5D-10, originally
published in 1995.




In the last few years coffee shops with drive-through lanes have become prevalent
throughout the country. Because those businesses were uncommon when the 1995
report was prepared, no data was gathered for those operations. This paper contains
information on counts taken at those establishments, once again in the Kansas City
metropolitan area.

Based on the count data, recommendations are included for the minimum amount of
stacking distance to require for the two types of drive-through businesses that were
studied.


Background

ITE Technical Council Committee 5D-10 was formed in 1987 to produce a database
of queuing information for various types of drive-through lanes. The report of the
findings of the Committee, published in the May 1995 ITE Journal, included information
on the characteristics of drive-through lane stacking for fast-food restaurants, drive-in
banks, car washes, day care centers and dry cleaners. The counts that were included
in the Committee report were conducted from the late 1960s through the late 1980s in a
limited number of mid-western, southern and eastern states.

 As a former member of that Committee, and having submitted drive-through counts for
the effort, I am in a position to make some observations about the change in drive-
through usage.

This paper analyzes two types of drive-through operations ­ one that is greatly modified
and another that is new since the original report was published. First, significant
changes have occurred in the ways that bank patrons conduct business with their
financial institutions. On-line banking, direct deposit and the wide usage of ATMs have
resulted in greatly reduced trip generation totals for drive-in banks. In recognition of that
fact, ITE adjusted the trip generation information for drive-in banks in the Eighth Edition
of Trip Generation, an ITE Informational Report, to include only data collected since
2000. The trip generation rates during the p.m. peak hour for the newer data are about
44% lower than rates in the Seventh Edition.




The second area of analysis in this paper pertains to observed queuing characteristics
for coffee shops with drive-through lanes. In the last few years, drive-through coffee
shops have become common throughout the country. Because those businesses were
an insignificant factor when the report for ITE Technical Council Committee 5D-10
was completed, no counts were conducted for that land use category. This paper
contains data on queuing for coffee shops with drive-through lanes, based on counts
conducted predominantly in the Kansas suburbs of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

As is the case for drive-in banks, the length of stacking required for a site has a major
impact on potential site layouts. If a relatively short stacking distance is permitted, the
lanes can be fit into very restricted sites or be more easily retrofitted to work with
existing buildings. But if more queuing occurs than is provided for in a dedicated lane,
the flow of traffic within a parking lot can be seriously restricted by that excess queue.
In the worst case, if the drive-through stacking is located close to a public street and the
excess queue extends into or near the street, the operation of the adjoining public street
may be negatively impacted.

Coffee Shops With Drive-Through Lanes

Counts were conducted in the fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009 at twelve coffee shops
located in the Kansas suburbs of Merriam, Olathe and Overland Park in the Kansas City
metropolitan area and also in suburban Kansas City, Missouri. All but two of the
establishments were situated in free-standing buildings, and several were located within
shopping centers. Three were drive-through-only operations and the remaining nine
were full-service locations that included both drive-through lanes and inside seating
facilities. Because this type of use is busiest in the morning peak hour, all counts were
completed during that time period.

Similar to the process used for drive-in banks, the counting process involved noting the
maximum number of vehicles queued in the drive-through lane at each location for
fifteen minute increments. As was done for the drive-in bank counts, the vehicle in the

service position was included in the counts. Information on the number of vehicles
entering and leaving the parking lot was collected for full-service operations (drive-
through-only locations did not have any parking activity). The queuing information was
tabulated for both the total length of queue and for the number of vehicles behind the
menu board. The observed queue length was noted at five minute intervals as a way
to evaluate the frequency of various queue lengths.

Once again, the queuing data was analyzed in ways similar to the methods used in the
1995 Report. Table 2 lists the observed frequency of maximum queue lengths. Figure
3 plots the per-lane maximum queue lengths and Figure 4 plots the probability that the
queue will not exceed a given maximum queue length.

The total trip generation figures were compared to the a.m. peak hour ITE rates for
Land Use Code 937, Coffee/Donut Shop with Drive-Through Window, and Land Use
Code 938, Coffee/Donut Shop with Drive-Through Window and No Indoor Seating. The
observed counts generally fell within the range of counts included in those categories,
although two of the rates for the No Indoor Seating category exceeded the published
range. No correlation was found between the adjoining major street traffic volumes or
the size of the building and either the queuing or the trip generation results.

Observations

Several of the drive-through lanes were under-designed for the usage that was
observed and queues spilled-out into parking lot circulation areas. In most cases the
excess stacking did not result in disruptions of the operations of surrounding uses, since
most other businesses were not open in the early morning. But for those sites where
the end of the drive-through lane extended into the coffee shop parking lot, the excess
queue often disrupted the movements of drivers who were trying to enter or exit parking
spaces or the site itself.

One interesting facet of the data is that the three lowest observed maximum queue
lengths were for the drive-through-only locations. The highest observed queue length
for those operations was seven vehicles, which occurred only once at one location and
only for a very short period of time. A six vehicle maximum stack was a more common
occurrence.

The data shows that the volume of drive-through traffic and, therefore, the required
stacking distance, is higher for full-service coffee shops than for drive-through-only
operations. When total trip generation (both drive-through business and customers who
park and walk in) is factored in, the full-service coffee shops did, on average, about two
and one-half times the business of drive-through-only facilities. Since all of the full-
service operations were Starbucks locations, it may be possible to apply the results of
those counts to other proposed suburban Starbucks locations elsewhere in the country.

Total vehicular stacking available for a drive-through lane is an important consideration,
but the location of the menu board relative to the pick-up window also impacts the
efficiency of a drive-through lane operation. If the spacing is too short, stacking behind
the pick-up window will extend into the menu board area, delaying ordering for those
farther back in the line. In the counts conducted for this study, the pick-up window to
menu board available stacking distances ranged from two to five vehicles.

The operation with the two car stack between the pick-up window and menu board
regularly resulted in delays for drivers waiting to order at the menu board. The location
with a five car stack rarely experienced delays for those ordering. Based on field
observations, if an unlimited amount of stacking were available at a proposed site, the
five car spacing would be ideal. Realizing that space for stacking nearly always is
limited, an acceptable alternative would be the four car spacing.

Conclusions




Coffee shop drive-through lanes are most heavily used during the morning peak period,
and therefore it is important to design sites to accommodate that peak demand. The
following recommended minimum stacking lengths should be appropriate in most cases.
The only exceptions would be situations in which excess queuing could impact a nearby
street or major drive, in which case a more conservative approach should be taken.

Based on the data that was gathered for drive-through-only operations, it appears
reasonable to require that a dedicated drive-through lane be provided with a stack of
120 feet ­ enough to handle six vehicles. That should be sufficient to accommodate
nearly all vehicles that are likely to arrive during the morning peak hour time period.

For full service establishments, a 220-foot long drive-through lane, providing eleven
cars of total storage, should be adequate to handle the vast majority of the drive-
through lane volumes that might be encountered. In those cases where more than
eleven vehicles were counted, the duration of the extreme queue lasted for only a few
minutes. For the most efficient operation, the distance between the pick-up window and
menu board should be at least 80 feet to accommodate four vehicles.

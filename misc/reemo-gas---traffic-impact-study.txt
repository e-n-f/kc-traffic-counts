               Executive Summary
               Background: The 1200 Rice Street parcel in St. Paul, MN is proposed to
               be redeveloped with a new gas station, convenience store/deli and
               general retail. The site is on the southeast corner of Maryland Avenue
               West & Rice Street North and is currently occupied by a gas station and
               convenience store. The development is planned to include four gas
               pumps (totaling eight fueling positions) with 2,636 square feet of gas
               station convenience store, 100 square feet of deli and two rental retail
               spaces totaling 1,824 square feet. Access is planned to be provided via
               25 foot wide driveways on Rice Street south of Maryland Avenue and on
               Maryland Avenue east of Rice Street. This study analyzed the proposed
               development to identify potential traffic operations issues and
               recommended improvements if needed.

               Results: The traffic impacts of the proposed development on the site's
               driveway intersections as well as the public road intersection of Maryland
               Avenue & Rice Street were analyzed for multiple future scenarios. The
               principal findings are:
                i. The full site is anticipated to generate approximately 2,250
                   entering/2,250 exiting vehicles on a daily basis, with approximately 75
                   entering/exiting vehicles in the a.m. peak hour and 80 entering/exiting
                   vehicles in the p.m. peak hour.
               ii. All study intersections are forecast to operate acceptably at Level of
                   Service B or better in the 2015 Build peak hour scenarios.
              iii. All queue lengths at each study intersection are forecasted to be at
                   acceptable lengths in the 2015 PM Build peak hour scenario.

               Recommendations: The study intersections are forecast to operate
               acceptably with the addition of traffic from the proposed development in
               the 2015 Build scenarios. The 25 foot driveway on Maryland Avenue was
               recently reconstructed by Ramsey County and will remain as part of the
               redevelopment. The Rice Street driveway will be reconstructed to a 25
               foot width and moved to the south as far as practical. The 25 feet wide
               driveways will be wide enough to provide access for gasoline tanker truck
               deliveries while minimizing the driveway width pedestrians will need to
               cross.

               No modifications to the existing public transportation system will be
               needed to accommodate the proposed development.

     1. Introduction
          A new gas station and convenience store/deli with some general retail is
          proposed at the site of an existing gas station and convenience store on the
          southeast corner of Maryland Avenue & Rice Street in St. Paul, MN.

          The purpose of this study is to:
              i. Document how the transportation system adjacent to the development
                 currently functions.
             ii. Determine how the transportation system will function in 2015 with the
                 existing use occupying the site.
            iii. Determine how the transportation system will function in 2015 after the
                 site is redeveloped and fully occupied
            iv. Recommend appropriate transportation improvements if poor operations
                 are identified in any of the study scenarios.

          The following intersections are analyzed in this study:
              i. Maryland Avenue & Rice Street
             ii. Maryland Avenue & Site Driveway
            iii. Rice Street & Site Driveway

     2. Proposed Development
          The proposed development is on the southeast corner of Maryland Avenue &
          Rice Street in St. Paul, Minnesota (see Figure 2.1). The development is planned
          to include four gas pumps (totaling eight fueling positions) with 2,636 square feet
          of gas station/convenience store, 100 square feet of deli and two rental retail
          spaces totaling 1,824 square feet. A site plan for the entire site is shown in the
          Appendix. The site currently has driveways on Maryland Avenue and Rice
          Street.

          The driveway on Maryland Avenue was recently reconstructed by Ramsey
          County and is 25 feet wide. That driveway will remain as part of the
          redevelopment. The Rice Street driveway will be reconstructed and moved to
          the south as far as practical. The driveway on Rice Street is proposed to be 25
          feet wide, which will be wide enough to provide access for gasoline tanker truck
          deliveries while minimizing the driveway width pedestrians will need to cross.

          The site currently includes a gas station and convenience store with two pumps
          that will be demolished as part of the project. For purposes of this study, it is
          assumed the full development will be built and occupied in 2015.

     3. Analysis of Existing Conditions
               a. Transportation Network Characteristics
                       Maryland Avenue is classified as Ramsey County State Aid 31. It is a four
                       lane, undivided east-west road with a 30 mph speed limit near the site.

                       Rice Street is classified as Ramsey County State Aid 49. It is a four lane,
                       undivided east-west road with a 30 mph speed limit near the site.

                       Existing traffic control and travel lanes are shown in Figure 3.1 for each
                       study intersection.

               b. Traffic Volumes
                       Intersection video was collected at each of the study intersections under
                       normal weekday conditions on May 23, 2013. Using these videos, a
                       turning movement count was done from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Maryland
                       Avenue/Rice Street intersection. Based on the peak hours determined
                       from this count, the a.m. and p.m. peak hour counts were done at the two
                       study driveways. The turning movement count data contained in fifteen
                       minute intervals is contained in the Appendix.

                       The a.m. peak hour was determined to be from 8:15 to 9:15 a.m. and the
                       p.m. peak hour was determined to be from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. The peak
                       hour volume turning movement count diagrams for each peak hour are
                       shown in each scenario's Appendix.

               c. Level of Service
                                 LOS A         An intersection capacity analysis was conducted for
                                               the existing intersections per the Highway Capacity
                                               Manual, 2010. Intersections are assigned a "Level
                                               of Service" letter grade for the peak hour of traffic
                                               based on the number of lanes at the intersection,
                                               traffic volumes, and traffic control. Level of Service
                                 LOS C         A (LOS A) represents light traffic flow (free flow
                                               conditions) while Level of Service F (LOS F)
                                               represents heavy traffic flow (over capacity
                                               conditions). LOS D at intersections is typically
                                               considered acceptable in the Twin Cities region.
                         LOS D = Acceptable    Individual movements are also assigned LOS
                                               grades. One or more individual movements typically
                                               operate at LOS F when the overall intersection is
                                               operating acceptably at LOS D.

                                               The pictures on the left represent some of the LOS
                        LOS F = Unacceptable
                                               grades (from a signal controlled intersection in San
                                               Jose, CA). These LOS grades represent the overall
                                               intersection operation, not individual movements.

                                           The LOS results for the existing study hours are
                        San Jose, CA       shown in Table 3.1. These are based on the
                                           existing traffic control and lane configurations as
                       shown in Figure 3.1. The existing turning movement volumes from the
                       Appendix were used in the LOS calculations. The LOS calculations were
                       done in accordance with the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 using
                       VISTROTM software.      Signal cycle lengths were obtained through
                       observation and the splits were optimized for each Scenario with
                       VISTROTM software. The complete LOS calculations, which include

                       grades for individual movements, are included in each scenario's
                       Appendix. The study intersections currently operate acceptably at LOS B
                       or better.

                       (in parentheses) is the Level of Service for the worst operating approach.



     4. Projected Traffic
               a. Site Traffic Forecasting
                       A trip generation analysis was performed for the development site based
                       on the methods and rates published in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th
                       Edition. The resultant trip generation is shown in Table 4.1.

                       Deductions for pass-by trips (vehicles which are already on Rice Street or
                       Maryland Ave W and turn in/out of the site as part of their route) were
                       taken per the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition. These are
                       shown in Table 4.1.

                       The site generated trips were then added to the study roadways through
                       the use of a trip distribution pattern as shown in Figure 4.1. The trip
                       distribution pattern shown in Figure 4.1 is based on existing traffic counts
                       as well as taking into account site access and access to the regional
                       transportation system. The traffic generated by the site development was
                       assigned to the area roadways per these distribution patterns. The peak
                       hour forecasts are shown in the Appendix under the capacity analysis
                       section for each study scenario.

               b. Non-site Traffic Forecasting
                       Traffic forecasts were developed for the year 2015 No-Build scenario by
                       applying a 0.90% compounded annual growth rate to the existing traffic
                       volume data. This growth rate is based on the 20 year growth factor of 1.2
                       the Mn/DOT State Aid office has assigned to Ramsey County.

               c. Total Traffic
                       Traffic forecasts were developed for the Build Scenarios by adding the
                       traffic generated by the proposed development to the No-Build volumes as
                       well as subtracting out the volumes of the vehicles currently using the
                       existing site. The peak hour forecasts are shown in the Appendix under
                       the capacity analysis section for each study scenario.

     5. Traffic and Improvement Analysis
               a. Level of Service Analysis
                       The LOS results for the 2015 Scenario study hours are shown in Table
                       5.1. These results are based on the existing traffic control and lane
                       configurations as shown in Figure 3.1 for the existing intersections.

                       The LOS calculations were done using VISTROTM software and are based
                       on the peak hour forecasts in the Appendix for each scenario. Signal
                       cycle lengths were obtained through observation and the splits were
                       optimized for each Scenario with VISTROTM software. The complete LOS
                       calculations, which include grades and queues for individual movements,
                       are included in the Appendix.

                        The first letter is the Level of Service for the intersection. The second letter
                       (in parentheses) is the Level of Service for the worst operating approach.

                       All of the intersections will operate acceptably at Level of Service B or
                       better in the 2015 scenarios. The proposed redevelopment is not
                       expected to significantly impact the transportation system.

               b. Micro-Simulation Analysis
                       The Level of Service calculations based on the Highway Capacity Manual
                       do not always reflect the interaction of vehicles between intersections or
                       the long queues which can occur at traffic signals with long cycle lengths.
                       They also do not identify the benefits of a signal creating gaps at nearby
                       side street stop sign controlled intersections.

                       Micro-simulations, such as those done with the VISSIMTM software
                       package, can highlight these issues that may be missed by Level of
                       Service analyses because they better account for the interactions between
                       individual vehicles as they move throughout the transportation network.

                       In order to more accurately determine how the development driveways will
                       interact with the signalized intersection (mainly if queuing at the signal will
                       cause problems for vehicles entering/exiting the development) a micro-
                       simulation was conducted the 2015 PM Build peak hour scenario. This
                       scenario was chosen because it had the lowest LOS results.




Traffic Impact Study                                         8                                          Reemo Gas & Deli
                       The 2015 Build PM Peak Hour scenario was transferred from VISTRO TM
                       to VISSIMTM. The simulation software was seeded with a random number
                       seed of 1 and a recording duration of 60 minutes. Then the simulation
                       software was run and recorded five times with random number seeds of 1,
                       2, 3, 4, and 5. The simulation was allowed five minutes to populate before
                       the 60 minute recording of data began.

                       For the micro-simulation model, some changes were made, but it is
                       assumed most of the default settings in VISTRO/VISSIMTM approximate
                       the conditions in the study area. This is typical practice in Minnesota for
                       traffic impact studies.

                       The stacking and delay results from the micro-simulation are contained in
                       the Appendix. These reports include measures of effectiveness for each
                       intersection movement (such as delay per vehicle in seconds, 95th
                       percentile queues and average queues). The micro-simulation analyses
                       predict the northbound and westbound queues at the Maryland Avenue &
                       Rice Street intersection will have an average queue length of 50 feet or
                       less. Based upon the future location of the development driveways, these
                       sized queues will not cause problems for vehicles entering/exiting the
                       development. All other queue lengths are predicted by the micro-
                       simulation analysis to be reasonably sized.

               c. Daily Traffic Volumes
                       Existing average daily traffic volumes were taken from multiple road
                       segments near the site. These volumes were then forecast for the 2015
                       No-Build and Build Scenarios as shown in Table 5.2. Table 5.2 also
                       shows estimated capacity volumes based on the Highway Capacity
                       Manual 2010. The forecasts seen in Table 5.2 show the corridors
                       adjacent to the proposed site are forecast to operate acceptably.

     6. Conclusions and Recommendations
          The study intersections are forecasted to operate acceptably with the addition of
          traffic from the proposed development in the 2015 Build scenarios. The queue
          lengths are forecasted to be at acceptable lengths that will not cause significant
          blockage during the 2015 PM Build peak hour scenario.

          The driveway on Maryland Avenue was recently reconstructed by Ramsey
          County and is 25 feet wide. That driveway will remain as part of the
          redevelopment. The Rice Street driveway will be reconstructed and moved to
          the south as far as practical. The driveway on Rice Street is proposed to be 25
          feet wide, which will be wide enough to provide access for gasoline tanker truck
          deliveries while minimizing the driveway width pedestrians will need to cross.

          No modifications to the existing public transportation system will be needed to
          accommodate the proposed development.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

A.       Purpose of the TIA and Study Objectives


         The purpose of this traffic impact analysis (TIA) is to evaluate the traffic impacts of the
         proposed Murrieta Apartments development. The project is proposed to be developed with
         approximately 112 apartment dwelling units. The site is located north of Murrieta Hot
         Springs Road and east of Via Princesa in the City of Murrieta.

         Study objectives include the following:

         Existing Traffic. Existing traffic will be counted to determine current conditions. This
         constitutes the environmental setting for a CEQA analysis at the time that the hearing
         body reviews the project. Traffic count data shall be new or recent. In some cases, data
         up to one year old may be acceptable with the approval of the City of Murrieta
         Engineering Department. Any exception to this must be requested prior to approval of
         the scoping agreement

         Project Completion (existing + ambient + project). Traffic conditions prior to the time
         that the proposed development is completed will be estimated by increasing the existing
         traffic counts by an appropriate growth rate to be provided by City of Murrieta
         Engineering Department staff, projected to the year that the project is estimated to be
         completed. Traffic generated by the proposed project will then be added, and the
         impacts on the circulation system will be analyzed. This will be the basis for determining
         project-specific impacts, mitigation, and conditions of approval.

         Cumulative (existing + ambient + project + cumulative). Traffic generated by other
         approved projects in the study area shall be identified and added to the Project
         Completion traffic identified in Scenario 2. This may also include projects that are
         proposed and in the review process, but not yet fully approved. This scenario will be
         analyzed, and a determination made if improvements funded through an approved
         funding mechanism (TUMF, DIF, CFD, etc.) can accommodate the cumulative traffic at
         the target Level of Service (LOS) identified in the General Plan. If the "funded"
         improvements can provide the target LOS, payment into the fee program will be
         considered as cumulative mitigation through the conditions of approval. Other
         improvements needed beyond the "funded" improvements (such as localized
         improvements to non-TUMF facilities) should be identified as such.

B.       Site Location and Study Area

         The project site is generally located north of Murrieta Hot Springs Road and east of Via
         Princesa in the City of Murrieta. Figure 1-A illustrates the site location and the traffic
         analysis study area.

         In general, the study area shall include any intersection of Collector or higher classification
         street with another Collector roadway or higher classification street, at which the proposed
         project will add 50 or more peak hour trips, not exceeding a 5-mile radius from the project
         site. Pursuant to the attached scoping agreement (see Appendix "A") and discussions with
         City of Murrieta staff, the study area includes the following existing intersections:


          ID                                         STUDY AREA INTERSECTIONS
              1    Via Princesa (NS) / Clearbrook Dr. (EW)
              2    Via Princesa (NS) / Murrieta Hot Springs Road (EW)
              3    Project Driveway 1 (NS) / Clearbrook Dr. (EW) ­ Future Roadway
              4    Project Driveway 2 (NS) / Murrieta Hot Springs Road (EW) ­ Future Roadway
          NOTE: NS = North-South Roadway; EW = East-West Roadway



C.       Development Project Identification

         1.         Project Size and Description

                    The Murrieta Apartments Site is proposed to be developed with approximately 112
                    apartment dwelling units. It is anticipated that the project will be built by 2013.

         2.         Existing Land Use

                    The project site is currently vacant. Adjacent uses include the following:

                                 North   ­ Residential
                                 South   ­ Vacant

         4.        Site Plan of Proposed Project

                   Figure 1-B illustrates the conceptual land use plan. The project is proposed to have
                   one full access point along Clearbrook Drive and one restricted right-in/right-out/left-
                   in access point along Murrieta Hot Springs Road. In addition, the project is
                   proposed to have a dedicated eastbound left turn lane and a westbound right turn
                   lane along Murrieta Hot Springs Road.

         5.        Proposed Project Opening Year

                   The proposed project is anticipated to be completed in 2013. Future traffic analysis
                   has been based upon one year of background (ambient) growth, at 2% per year,
                   along with traffic generated by other future developments in the surrounding area.
                   The total ambient growth rate is 2% for 2013 conditions.

         6.        Proposed Project Phasing

                   The project is expected to be completed in a single phase. Therefore, all traffic
                   recommendations included in this report have not been separated into different
                   development phases.

2.0 AREA CONDITIONS

A.       Study Area and Intersections

         In general, the minimum area to be studied shall include any intersection of "Collector" or
         higher classification street, with "Collector" or higher classification streets, at which the
         proposed project will add 50 or more peak hour trips, not exceeding a 5-mile radius from
         the project site. The City of Murrieta Engineering Department may require deviation from
         these requirements based on area conditions. The study area includes the following
         existing intersections (shown previously on Figure 1-A):


          ID                                         STUDY AREA INTERSECTIONS
           1       Via Princesa (NS) / Clearbrook Dr. (EW)
           2       Via Princesa (NS) / Murrieta Hot Springs Road (EW)
           3       Project Driveway 1 (NS) / Clearbrook Dr. (EW) ­ Future Roadway
           4       Project Driveway 2 (NS) / Murrieta Hot Springs Road (EW) ­ Future Roadway
          NOTE: NS = North-South Roadway; EW = East-West Roadway



B.       Existing Traffic Controls and Intersection Geometrics

         Figure 2-A identifies the existing roadway conditions for study area roadways. The existing
         intersection traffic controls and geometrics are identified. The site is bounded by
         Clearbrook Drive to the north and Murrieta Hot Springs Road to the south.

C.       Existing Traffic Volumes

         Existing intersection level of service calculations are based upon manual AM and PM peak
         hour turning movement counts made for Trames Solutions, Inc. in August 2012. Existing
         AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movements are shown on Figure 2-B. Existing
         daily count along Clearbrook Drive, east of Via Princesa is also shown in Figure 2-B. The
         traffic count worksheets are included in Appendix "B".

D.       Existing Delay and Level of Service

         The City of Murrieta has established Level of Service (LOS) "D" as the maximum
         allowable threshold for the intersection operations. Therefore, LOS "E" or "F" is
         considered unacceptable and requires improvements measures.

         Operations Analysis Methodology

         The City of Murrieta Engineering Department requires the use of the Transportation
         Research Board - Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), 2000 Update, or most recent
         release. Unsignalized intersections are analyzed using Chapter 17 of the Highway
         Capacity Manual. Signalized intersection Level of Service are analyzed using the
         Operational Method as described in Chapter 16, Section II.

         The results of the existing conditions intersection analysis are summarized in Table 2-1. The
         existing condition operations analysis worksheets are provided in Appendix "C". The study
         area intersections are currently operating at an acceptable level of service (LOS "D" or

3.0 PROJECTED FUTURE TRAFFIC

This section of the report quantifies the number of trips generated by the proposed project and
other known developments in the area.

A.       Project Traffic

         1.        Ambient Growth Rate

                   Some traffic volume increases on roadways can be attributed to vehicles originating
                   outside of the study area. These types of trips either end up within the study area or
                   pass-through onto an outside destination. Therefore, to account for these trips
                   (termed "ambient growth"), a growth rate can be applied to existing traffic volumes.

                   A 2% ambient growth rate that has been used in this study to account for traffic not
                   attributed to the project or other planned developments within the study area. The
                   City of Murrieta Transportation Department staff has previously reviewed and
                   approved this rate.

         2.        Project Trip Generation

                   Trip generation represents the amount of traffic which is attracted and produced by
                   a development. The trip generation for the project is based upon the specific land
                   use which has been planned for this development. For the purpose of this analysis,
                   the following land use assumption is evaluated:

                              112 apartment dwelling units

                   Trip generation rates for the proposed development are shown in Table 3-1. The trip
                   generation rates are based upon data collected by the Institute of Transportation
                   Engineers (ITE).

                   The daily and peak hour trip generations for the proposed project are shown on
                   Table 3-2. The proposed development is projected to generate a total of
                   approximately 745 trip-ends per day with 57 vehicles per hour during the AM peak
                   hour and 70 vehicles per hour during the PM peak hour.

         3.        Project Trip Distribution and Assignment

                   Trip distribution represents the directional orientation of traffic to and from the project
                   site. The project's trip distribution patterns are based on the proximity of the
                   residential units to the proposed driveway locations, the surrounding trip attractors
                   (employment bases, commercial opportunities, schools, recreation centers, etc.),
                   and the regional freeway interchanges. The trip distribution pattern for the project is
                   illustrated on Figure 3-A.

         4.        Other Trip Generation Factors

                   The project consists of residential units that do not generate a significant amount of
                   pass-by trips. Furthermore, it is unlikely that trips will be reduced to/from the site by
                   non-motorized modes of travel due to the lack of; 1) convenient transit opportunities,
                   2) bike lanes, and 3) pedestrian trails.

         5.        Project Peak Hour Turning Movement Traffic

                   The assignment of traffic from the site to the adjoining roadway system has been
                   based upon the site's trip generation, trip distribution, proposed arterial highway and
                   local street systems, which would be in place by the time of initial occupancy of the
                   site. Based on the identified project traffic generation and distribution, project peak
                   hour intersection traffic volumes and average daily traffic (ADT) volumes are shown
                   on Figure 3-B.

B.       Cumulative Traffic (Background)

         1.        Ambient Growth Rates

                   To assess existing plus ambient plus cumulative plus project traffic conditions,
                   project traffic is combined with existing traffic, area-wide growth and other future
                   developments which are approved or being processed concurrently in the study
                   area. Developments which are being processed concurrently in the study area have
                   been provided by City staff.

         2.        Other Approved or Proposed Development Projects

                   The cumulative developments have been included along with the land use
                   associated with each project. The location of the cumulative projects provided by
                   the City are shown on Figure 3-C.

                   For cumulative projects, ITE Trip Generation Rates (8th Edition) were used. Table 3-
                   3 presents the cumulative trip generation rates. Table 3-4 presents the cumulative
                   development land uses and trip generation summary. As presented in Table 3-4
                   Cumulative developments are projected to generate a total of approximately 70
                   vehicle trips per hour during the PM peak hour.

                   Based on the identified trip distribution for the cumulative development on arterial
                   highways throughout the study area, cumulative development PM peak hour
                   intersection turning movement volumes are shown on Figures 3-D.

4.0 TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

Peak hour intersection analysis has been performed at the study area intersections for each of the
project scenarios and for projected future conditions. Improvements are recommended to satisfy
the level of service requirements of the City of Murrieta and if the following impacts are identified:

1)       When existing traffic conditions (Analysis Scenario 1) exceed the General Plan target
         LOS.

2)       When project traffic, when added to existing traffic (Analysis Scenario 2), will deteriorate
         the LOS to below the target LOS, and impacts cannot be mitigated through project
         conditions of approval.

3)       When cumulative traffic (Analysis Scenario 3) exceeds the target LOS, and impacts
         cannot be mitigated through existing infrastructure funding mechanisms.

         It is important to note that the General Plan allows the City Council to approve
         development projects even in instances where the target LOS is exceeded, if the project
         has overriding benefits. Examples include projects that provide jobs in a local area,
         projects that provide needed transportation improvements that otherwise would not be
         constructed, projects that provide habitat conservations, projects that implement non-
         motorized transportation systems, or projects that provide some unique benefits to the
         City which outweigh the traffic impacts. These projects are required to mitigate traffic
         impacts to the extent that it is economically feasible as determined by the Engineering
         Department, based on a value engineering analysis. Projects that have a significant
         traffic impact and require a finding of overriding benefits may be required to prepare an
         Environmental Impact Report. The need to prepare an EIR shall be determined through
         consultation between the Engineering Department, Planning Department, and the City
         Attorney.

A.       Delay and Level of Service for Existing with Project Conditions

         Intersection levels of service for the E+A+P traffic conditions are shown in Table 4-1. Table
         4-1 shows HCM calculations based on the geometrics at the study area intersections. The
         operation analysis worksheets for E+A+P traffic conditions are provided in Appendix "D".

         For E+A+P traffic conditions, the study area intersections are projected to operate at an
         acceptable levels of service during the peak hours with existing geometry.

5.0 FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A.       Traffic Impacts and Level of Service Analysis

         1.        Existing Conditions

                   For Existing traffic conditions, the study area intersections are currently operating
                   at an acceptable level of service during the peak hours with existing geometry.

         2.        Existing + Ambient + Project Conditions

                   For E+A+P traffic conditions, the study area intersections are projected to
                   operate at an acceptable levels of service during the peak hours with existing
                   geometry.

         3.        Existing + Ambient + Project + Cumulative Conditions

                   For E+A+P+C traffic conditions, the study area intersections are projected to
                   operate at an acceptable levels of service during the peak hours with existing
                   geometry.

B.       Circulation Recommendations

         1.        On-Site

                   Figure 5-A illustrates the on-site recommended roadway and intersection lane
                   improvements. Construction of on-site improvements shall occur in conjunction with
                   adjacent project development activity or as needed for project access purposes.

                   The recommended on-site roadway improvements are described below.

                      Provide stop sign control at the project driveways.

                      Provide a dedicated eastbound left turn lane (approximately 100 ft. turn pocket
                      length) at Driveway 2 and Murrieta Hot Springs Road.

                      Provide a dedicated westbound right turn lane (approximately 100 ft. turn pocket
                      length) at Driveway 2 and Murrieta Hot Springs Road.

                      On-site traffic signing and striping should be implemented in conjunction with
                      detailed construction plans for the project.

                      Verify that minimum sight distance is provided at the project access points.

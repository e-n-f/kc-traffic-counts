    COMMENTS

 PROJECT UPDATE         Henige stated she had gone to the Board of Public Works
                        meeting two weeks ago and gave them an update on what the
                        Commission has been working on.
    DEPARTMENT
       UPDATES
Planning Department -   Fish had none at this time.
Joe Fish

Engineering Dept. ­     West 3rd Street Traffic Calming:
Justin Wykoff           Wykoff stated the neighborhood had gone through the NTSP
                        process in 2001 for traffic calming and the chicanes were
                        installed. The neighborhood is now coming back for
additional traffic calming. They neighborhood feels the
volume and speeds are still too high and the chicanes are not
effective enough. Wykoff stated the Engineering Department
had conducted counts before and after the installation of the
chicanes. The numbers show the speeds have gone down.
Wykoff stated the neighborhood recently went before the
Traffic Commission to have the speed limit lowered to 25
MPH and this was approved and the signage has been
changed. The City temporarily installed a multi-way stop at
3rd & Walker but the findings showed there was not much of a
difference in speeds. Karen Knight stated the stop sign was
only up for 2 weeks but in that time the residents saw a
difference in speeds. Knight stated the residents have talked
with Wykoff & the City about alternative traffic calming ideas
and some suggestions were: changing the directions of some
streets, speed bumps and changing the timing of the signal at
Rogers & 3rd Streets. One main aspect was having the
entrance into the neighborhood at 3rd & Rogers be similar to
that at 6th & Rogers (i.e. traffic circle). Knight stated the
neighborhood and the traffic coming through has changed
since they first came before the Commission in 2001. The
drivers are more aggressive. Gavin stated he did not know if
more traffic calming will make drivers more civil but it could
help to slow down traffic. Cotter stated the numbers show the
chicanes worked. It seems people may have become
aggressive due to the initial traffic calming devices and more
traffic calming may make them more aggressive. Sears stated
he has walked through this area for the past 4 years and
doesn't see the speeding. He mainly goes through in the a.m.
so the problem may be more in the evenings. Wykoff stated at
this time he needs to the approval of the Commission to
enable the neighborhood to go onto the next step which would
be the public meeting. Stuebe made the motion to approve the
request that the West 3rd Street Traffic Calming proposal go
onto the next step of the NTSP. Henige seconded the motion.
The motion carried with a vote of 5-0-0.
East 17th Street East/West of Jordan Avenue:
The project from last year ended at the Church just west of the
intersection. This project will continue with the side path on
the north side as well as bring down the grade of the hill to
improve visibility. Cotter stated there needed to be street cuts
for the side paths. Rosenbarger stated he is worried about the
speeds coming from 17th & Fee. Wykoff stated that there had
been 2 accidents in the past year but none were related to
speeds. Johnson stated the City would bring an actual set of
plans for the Commission members to review.
               "No Turn on Red" in the Downtown Corridor:
NEW BUSINESS   Wykoff stated he is developing a system to do an analysis for
               each intersection. He will bring the findings, one intersection
               at a time, to each meeting starting in February.
               Discussion on Crosswalks:
               Johnson stated the Commission had questions regarding the
               crosswalk removal on East Maxwell. When the Maxwell
               Lane project was completed the paving crew inadvertently
               installed the crosswalks. When the City Traffic Division
               went through this area to touch up pavement markings they
               found out the crosswalks were not supposed to have been
               there and they were taken out. There were several neighbors
               who were upset by the removal and called in. Johnson stated
               the City looked at the area again and the crosswalks were put
               back. They do not need to be codified since they are at
               intersections.
               Rice stated she was present at the meeting to discuss concerns
               some Commission members had in regards to the City's
               interpretation of the state law regarding pedestrians and
               crosswalks. Rice stated she has read several e-mails going
               around and has talked to various attorneys and she feels the
               members of the City are all on the same page amongst
               themselves as well as with the Commission members. Rice
               read the state law regarding crosswalks and pedestrians and
               there was a lengthy and detailed discussion amongst City
               representatives and Commission members (this is available
               on tape). The intersection of 3rd & Grant was brought up in
               regards to who would yield for whom. Rice stated if the
               pedestrian steps into the roadway they need to yield to
               vehicles. Rice stated the City unfortunately is not able to
               change state legislation. Johnson stated one of the outcomes
               from the IU Task Force is the installation of two mid block
               crosswalks on Fee Lane. These will be enforced by IUPD.
               Gavin asked if there could be flashing lights prior to the
               crosswalks to make drivers more aware. Johnson stated that
               at this time, due to budgetary constraints, this is not feasible.
               The question was asked on how the B-Line Trail was treated.
               At this time, pedestrians and bicyclists yield to vehicles. The
               crosswalks currently marked are not codified. Sears stated
               he feels it comes down to education for both drivers and
               pedestrians in regards to crosswalks. He as a pedestrian will
               always stop to look both ways before crossing.
OLD BUSINESS   Lincoln Street Green Markings:
               The Commission would discuss this further, draft a proposal
               to vote on and then forward to the City to review.


ADJOURNMENT    The meeting adjourned at 7:05 p.m. Due to City offices being
               closed on January 18, 2010 for Martin Luther King Day, the
               Commission decided to cancel the January meeting.

               The next work session for the Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety
               Commission is scheduled for Monday, January 4, 2010 at 5:30
               p.m. in the Hooker Conference Room.

               The next official meeting of the Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety
               Commission is Monday, February 15, 2010 at 5:30 p.m. in the
               Hooker Conference Room.

             Room at the Showers Building.
Bike/Ped Commission Members,

There is one project to review at next week's meeting. The development is called "Morton
Mansions," located at the corner of Tenth and Morton Street. The description below is from the
developer. Please see the attachments for the site plan and building elevations.

Also, please remember to bring your comments on the draft College Mall Study
recommendations to the meeting.

Thanks,

Joe

------------

The surrounding land use includes an apartment complex (Tenth & College Village) across Tenth
street to the North, an empty lot to the South, Office buildings across Morton street to the West
and a commercial office building across the alley to the East. The lot currently has a run down
home being used as a rental property and two garages. The home and garages are not historic and
will be cleared to construct this project. The project is a 4 story structure (garage, plus 3 levels of
apartments).

The design draws on the old world charm of a large country manner house with it's heavy cast
stone base, verticality of building elements, and simple corner towers that are reminiscent of the
guard towers that once defined the perimeter of the manner. The structure takes a simple shape
for building efficiency and stacks the building over retail and parking. Internally, the manner is
divided into smaller dwelling units all accessed off of a common covered exterior walkway
system that has been sized to serve as the primary path to each unit as well as create sheltered
areas for gathering.

Parking is located under the building on the South façade and is accessed and exited through a
one way drive system. Residents will enter from Morton Street and travel under the building to
the back of the site where covered parking is provided under the building. When leaving.
Residents will pull out to the alley on the east where they can turn North and exit onto Tenth
street.

A steady rhythm of (3) grated trees and a single old fashion street lamp set in a hard-scape
sidewalk with a pattern of brick pavers enhance the curb appeal and charm of the development.
Where possible, additional landscaping and spots for bike racks have been provided. Additional
landscaping is shown in planter beds along the base of the building to pick-up on and continue the
streetscape rhythm established by the Village project.

Pedestrians can enter the site at grade off of Morton Street, from Tenth street, or from the South
face / parking area. The primary entrance from Morton Street provides an accessible entry path to
the buildings elevator core. All other building access points are through secured stair towers. One
additional unit has been placed at grade with an accessible entry at street level.

An effort has been made to make the facility "bike friendly" through the incorporation of bike
parking focused around the Morton Street building entry point for the convenience of the
residents. (6) Visitor spaces will be provided at the buildings main entrance. A secured bike room
is not required based on the building scale and number of units.

Project/Event:            17th Street and Jordan Avenue Intersection and Roadway Improvements   
Design Engineer:          Clark Dietz Engineering      
Staff Representative:  Justin Wykoff          
Date:  February 10, 2010                                        
                           
                                                                                                             

Report:    The  City  of  Bloomington  has  identified  the  intersection  of  17th  Street  and  Jordan 
Avenue  as  a  location  eligible  for  Hoosier  Safety  Improvement  Program  (HSIP)  Funding.    This 
identification  was  discovered  following  the  2005  Annual  Accident  Report  prepared  by  the  City 
Planning  Department.    That  same  year  the  intersection  of  17th  Street  and  Fee  Lane  was 
identified  and  programmed  for  improvements  using  HSIP  funding  through  the 
Bloomington/Monroe County MPO, and those improvements were constructed in 2008. 

At  this  time  we  are  working  with  the  same  design  firm  (Clark  Dietz)  to  continue  improvements 
along  17th  Street  that  will  include  both  intersections  with  Jordan  Avenue.    These  changes  will 
include  a  reduction  in  the  height  of  the  hill  for  improved  sight  distance.   Other  improvements 
include  completion  of  pedestrian  sidewalk  (with  grass  separation)  linkages  between  the  two 
projects,  as  well  as  continuing  the  multiuse  pathway  (with  grass  separation)  along  the  north 
side of 17th Street.   

We  have  identified  modifications  to  the  existing  plans  that  would  create  additional  pedestrian 
crossings at the intersections, and will detail further at the meeting. 
 
                                                                                                             

Request:  At this time we are requesting comments from members of the Bicycle and Pedestrian 
Safety  Commission  regarding  proposed  pedestrian  improvements  as  well  as  suggestions  for 
additional modifications to the plans to better support pedestrian usage along these streets.

Report:   The  City  of  Bloomington  has  began  design  work  on  the  intersection  of  Sare  Road  and 
Rogers Road through the Bloomington / Monroe County MPO. 

Included  in  your  packet  is  the  preliminary  design  for  a  roundabout  at  this  intersection  that  will 
compare  in  size  to  the  existing  roundabout  at  the  intersection  of  High  Street/Winslow 
Road/Rogers Road, that was completed in 1999.  (see overlay included) 

At this time one section of sidewalk (east side of Sare Road) is shown to not be included.  This is 
still  being  discussed  and  your  input  is  needed  on  this  and  other  pedestrian  and  cyclist 
considerations  that  will  be  constructed  with  this  project.   We  are  working  to  schedule  meetings 
with the Tree Commission and Environmental Commission to discuss this project. 
 
                                                                                                                 

Request:  At this time we are requesting comments from members of the Bicycle and Pedestrian 
Safety  Commission  regarding  proposed  pedestrian  improvements  as  well  as  suggestions  for 
additional modifications to the plans to better support pedestrian usage along these streets.

Design Engineer:          Engineering Department   
Staff Representative: Justin Wykoff            
Date:                     February 10, 2010                                
                           
                                                                                                                

Report:    The  City  of  Bloomington  has  began  data  collection  on  signalized  intersections  within 
downtown Bloomington along Walnut Street and College Avenue. 

Included  in  your  packet  is  an  existing  turning  movement  count  that  includes  pedestrians  for  the 
intersection  of  11th  Street  and  College  Avenue,  as  well  as  copies  of  accident  summaries  for  the 
past 3 years at this intersection. 

An  additional  turning  movement  count  will  be  performed  during  the  week  of  February  15th  to 
include the afternoon peak (11:00a.m. to 1:00p.m.) in an effort to seek the maximum pedestrian 
count at this intersection. 

Accident  summaries  of  all  10  accidents  that  occurred  at  this  intersection  over  the  past  3  years 
are included as well. 

A  sight  distance  analysis  will  be  performed  prior  to  the  next  meeting,  and  a  summary  of  current 
and future data will be compiled into a report and recommendation regarding the inclusion of a 
`no turn on red' for this intersection. 
 
                                                                                                                

Request:  As  part of an overall analysis of each signalized intersection in  the  downtown  (College 
Avenue  and  Walnut  Street),  the  Engineering  Department  will  continue  to  provide  updates  each 
month on progress completing these studies.

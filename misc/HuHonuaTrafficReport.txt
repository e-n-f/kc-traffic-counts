H Honua Bioenergy Traffic Assessment


I.      INTRODUCTION
The H Honua Bioenergy facilities (H Honua) are located in Pepe`ekeo in the South Hilo region on the
island of Hawai`i, about 10 miles north of Hilo town. The facilities are located off of the privately owned
Sugar Mill Road, about one mile makai of the intersection with Hawai`i Belt Road (Highway 19).

H Honua's mission is to use 100 percent biomass to power a 24-megawatt renewable energy facility
and to help Hawai`i Island, Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI) and the state reach their renewable energy
initiative goals. Full operation of H Honua is anticipated for 2012. H Honua operations are expected to
bring in jobs; about 29 full-time jobs directly related to the facility operations and approximately 120
indirect jobs supporting H Honua.

H Honua submitted a Special Management Area (SMA) permit to appropriate agencies in January 2010
for which it passed the review period. In June, a letter was returned from the State of Hawai`i
Department of Transportation that included a comment requiring a traffic assessment be created
including proposed improvements to the State highway to mitigate the impacts to operations and safety
resulting from the facility's traffic. This letter and attachments is included in Appendix A. Despite having
passed the review period, H Honua decided to do their due diligence and have a traffic assessment
completed to determine the traffic impacts of the proposed project in accordance with the SMA
requirements.

II.     EXISTING (2010) TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

A. Volumes
H Honua Bioenergy facilities are located off of Sugar Mill Road, also known as Pepe`ekeo Mill Road,
makai from the intersection of Highway 19 with Sugar Mill Road (makai leg) and Kaupakuea Homestead
Road (mauka leg). Figure 1 shows the location of H Honua's facilities. Highway 19 is a two-lane,
undivided minor arterial highway oriented in the north-south direction. The makai-bound and mauka-
bound approaches have one lane approaching Highway 19 and are stop sign controlled. To analyze the
peak traffic volumes experienced at this intersection, manual traffic counts were conducted on Tuesday,
September 28, 2010. Manual turning movement traffic counts were conducted for a 12-hour period
from 6:00am ­ 6:00pm at the intersection of Highway 19 and Sugar Mill Road/Kaupakuea Homestead
Road. These counts can be referenced in Appendix A. The weekday AM and PM peak hours at the
project intersection were determined to be 7:00-8:00am and 3:15-4:15pm which is in line with historical
State DOT peak hour times taken in the area.

Traffic volumes fluctuate based on the different days of the week and months of the year. Daily traffic
volumes were monitored along Highway 19 throughout 2008 by the State of Hawai`i Department of
Transportation. The 2008 historical data was used to calculate a seasonal expansion factor for the
counts taken in September on a Tuesday. The 2010 collected peak hour volumes were adjusted by
applying an expansion factor of 1.03. Existing (2010) adjusted peak hour traffic counts at the
intersection are shown in Figure 2. There were minimal pedestrians and bicyclists observed at the
intersection throughout the 12-hour count.

Figure 3 shows the raw 15-minute and hourly total intersection turning movement volumes manually
counted over the 12-hour period. This shows that of the peak periods, the PM peak hour volume was
greater than the AM peak hour volume. After the AM peak period, traffic remained relatively low until
2:00pm when the traffic volume gradually increased to reach the PM peak hour.

Heavy vehicles were also classified during the 12-hour counting period. Heavy vehicles typically
accelerate and decelerate slower than passenger vehicles, requiring more time to make turning
movements. They also have larger turning radii, requiring sufficient roadway and intersection space. For
these reasons, heavy vehicles can significantly impact the operations at an intersection. Heavy vehicles
observed in the field consist of semi-trucks, delivery trucks, buses and passenger vehicles with trailers.
Table 1 shows the existing heavy vehicle percentages calculated for each approach at the project
intersection for the AM peak period between 6:00 ­ 10:00am and the PM peak period from 2:00 ­
6:00pm. These heavy vehicle rates are included in the intersection's operational analysis. Heavy vehicle
percentages were relatively similar for the AM and PM periods with higher rates headed northbound in
the morning and southbound in the afternoon. It should be noted that heavy vehicle rates exiting Sugar
Mill Road in the morning are 7% which shows the existence of heavy vehicles under existing conditions.

B. Operations
Level of service (LOS) is an operational analysis rating system used in traffic engineering to measure the
effectiveness of roadway operating conditions. There are six LOS ranging from A to F. LOS A is defined as
being the least interrupted flow conditions with little or no delays, whereas LOS F is defined as
conditions where extreme delays exist. Guidelines from the Hawai`i Statewide Uniform Design Manual
state that an appropriate LOS for a rural arterial, with posted speeds between 45 and 60 mph, is LOS C
or better. As stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, LOS for a two-way stop controlled (TWSC)
intersection is determined by the measured control delay and is defined for each minor movement, not
for the intersection as a whole. Vehicles traveling along the major, free-flow road, of a TWSC
intersection, proceed through with minimal delay, depending on the obstruction resulting from turning
vehicles. Those vehicles approaching the intersection along the minor movement (side-street) are
controlled by a stop sign and thus experience delay attributable to the volume of vehicles passing along
the free-flow road and the gaps available. LOS of roadway segments is determined using the peak hour
bidirectional volumes and the methodologies of the Florida Department of Transportation LOS
Handbook, which is based on the guidelines as stated in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual and
supported by Hawai`i Department of Transportation as standard traffic engineering practice. This can be
used to gauge capacity along individual roadway segments between intersections.

Existing (2010) LOS was determined for the AM and PM peak hours for the intersection using HCS+
traffic analysis software. As shown in Table 2, Existing (2010) operations are operating at acceptable LOS
during the AM and PM peak hours. Existing (2010) analysis reports are in Appendix B.

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the population of Pepe`ekeo was less than 2,000. In the 2005 County
of Hawai`i General Plan, the land uses in Pepe`ekeo are designated as urban/rural center and industrial.
For the purpose of determining the roadway segment LOS, Pepe`ekeo is classified as a rural developed
area with a population less than 5,000. North and south of the intersection with Sugar Mill
Road/Kaupakuea Homestead Road, Highway 19 operates at an acceptable LOS B for the Existing (2010)
conditions.

III.    FUTURE (2022) WITHOUT PROJECT

A. Volumes
H Honua is expected to be fully operational by 2012. Operational conditions were evaluated for the
horizon 2022, 10 years after H Honua is built out which is an appropriate future design reference for a
project of this size. It can be inferred that an operational analysis of build-year (2012) conditions would
be less than that of future (2022) conditions and therefore a determination of acceptable future
conditions would result in acceptable build year operations. Comparing State of Hawai`i Department of
Transportation historical traffic counts taken along Highway 19 from 2000 and 2009, a cumulative
growth increase of 1.06% per year over the nine year period was calculated. From research into the
State of Hawai`i Office of Environmental Quality Control library, no additional significant developments
are expected in the area that would affect the traffic volumes at the intersection. County-approved
preexisting lots exist in the project area although were not considered credible for construction within
the future analysis year and therefore were not included in future traffic volumes. To account for future
growth along the highway and adjacent roadways, the growth rate of 1.06% was cumulatively applied to
the seasonally adjusted Existing (2010) traffic volumes at the intersection of Highway 19 and Sugar Mill
Road to the Future (2022) horizon year. The Future (2022) Without Project peak hour volumes were
rounded to the nearest five vehicles and are shown in Figure 4.

B. Operations
For the Future (2022) Without Project, the makai-bound approach will continue to operate at LOS B. The
mauka-bound approach at the intersection will operate at an acceptable LOS C. Roadway segmental LOS
along Highway 19 is expected to operate at acceptable LOS C. Future (2022) Without Project analysis
reports are shown in Appendix C.

IV.     FUTURE (2022) WITH PROJECT

A. Volumes
Full operations at H Honua are expected to begin in 2012. Operators will have three shift times:
7:00am ­ 3:00pm, 3:00pm ­ 11:00pm and 11:00pm ­ 7:00am. Security guards will follow the same work
shifts of the operators with one guard on duty per shift. Maintenance and other staff have two shift
times from 7:00am ­ 3:30pm and 3:30pm ­ 12:00am. Comparable ITE Trip Generation rates include
vendors and visitors in calculation of office trips. For Hu Honua, it is assumed that upwards of 5 trips a
day will be made as a result of this generation although most likely will occur outside of peak hours and
therefore area not included in the specific analysis. For the trip generation calculations, it was assumed

                                                    6

that each employee would arrive within the 15 minutes prior to the start of their shift and employees
would leave within 15 minutes of the end of their shift. The anticipated shifts are shown in Table 4.

For the AM peak hour, four operating employees are expected to exit the facilities. During the PM peak
hour, six operating employees are expected to leave the facilities and four maintenance staff will arrive.
Additionally, six fuel delivery trucks are expected to access H Honua per hour during daylight hours.
Delivery trucks are assumed to access Sugar Mill Road from both directions along Highway 19 depending
on the area in which the wood biomass will be delivered from. It is assumed that the trucks entering the
site will leave within an hour of arrival, thus each hour there will be six trucks entering the facilities and
six trucks exiting the facilities. Project related peak hour trips are shown in Table 5.

V.     SHIFT PEAK HOURS
An additional analysis was performed based on the most impacted AM and PM hours due to the change
in work shifts. It was determined that this occurred between 6:45am ­ 7:45am and 2:45pm ­ 3:45pm.
The project generated trips during these times are shown in Table 7.

VI.     INTERSECTION SAFETY

A. Line of Sight
A sufficient, unobstructed, view of an intersecting highway is necessary in a motorists' decision to enter
the intersecting highway or to cross it. According to AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways
and Streets, "if the available sight distance for an entering or crossing vehicle is at least equal to the
appropriate stopping sight distance for the major road, then drivers have sufficient sight distance to
anticipate and avoid collisions." As provided by AASHTO, intersection sight distance can be calculated
using the following equation:

              Intersection Sight Distance = 1.47*Vmajor*tgap
              Vmajor = Design speed of the major road, mph
              tgap = Time gap for the minor road vehicle to enter the major road, seconds


                                                   11
H Honua Bioenergy Traffic Assessment


Table 11 shows the desired and measured intersection sight distances for vehicles making a left or right
turn onto the major road (Highway 19) from the minor road (Sugar Mill Road). Time gap varies between
passenger cars and combination trucks (WB-50) due to the difference in vehicle length, maneuverability
and vehicle load. Additionally, drivers making a right-turn typically accept a shorter gap than those
making a left-turn. The design speed of Highway 19 is assumed to be 55mph, 10mph greater than the
posted approach speeds of 45mph. The design speed calculation is based off of conditions as stated in
NCHRP Report 504: Design Speed, Operating Speed, and Posted Speed Practices.

                                 Table 11: Intersection Sight Distances

                                                    Left turns              Right turns

           Combination truck (WB-50)           930            N/A        850          N/A
           N/A = Existing sight distance not able to be measured in the field.


At the Sugar Mill Road approach to the intersection, the only sight obstructions along the straight
Highway 19 approaches are a gradually lessening grade to the north and rolling hill to the south, both
assumed to be minor. AASHTO assumes that the driver's eye in a passenger vehicle is 3.5 feet above the
roadway surface and in a truck it is 7.6 feet above the roadway surface. Therefore trucks accessing H
Honua (WB-50 design vehicles) will consequently have an increased sight distance compared to that of a
passenger vehicle.

From the perspective of a driver in a passenger vehicle, the sight distance from the minor approach on
Sugar Mill Road was measured to be approximately 625-feet south of the intersection and 750-feet
north of the intersection. Based on the Hawai`i Statewide Uniform Design Manual and AASHTO's A
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, the measured intersection sight distances for a
passenger vehicle entering a 2-lane roadway with a design speed of 55mph on the major road is
sufficient to make safe turning maneuvers. With these restrictions it was inferred that trucks, with a
driver's eye view twice that of a passenger vehicle, would have sufficient line of sight past the required
930-feet.

B. Turning Radius
The largest type of vehicle anticipated to access H Honua is AASHTO's Intermediate Semitrailer WB-50
design vehicle. AASHTO's requirements for the minimum turning path are included in Appendix F. To
ensure that there will be adequate turning space for this type of vehicle along the route to H Honua
from Highway 19, an analysis was performed using AutoTurn, vehicle swept path, turn simulation
software. Appendix G includes the various turning maneuvers of a WB-50 vehicle along the roadway
accessing H Honua. From this analysis, it was determined that there are sufficient radii at the
intersection and along the roadway to accommodate the largest vehicle anticipated to access the H
Honua facilities.

H Honua Bioenergy Traffic Assessment


C. Deceleration and Acceleration Lanes
Existing travel lane widths along Highway 19 at the intersection with Sugar Mill Road are each 12 feet
wide while the shoulders vary from 10 feet to 16 feet wide. Existing vehicles were observed to use the
existing makai shoulder when making right-turns onto Sugar Mill Road even when not followed by a
vehicle. Minimal left turns onto Sugar Mill Road were observed although existing lane and shoulder
clearance exists for through traveling southbound vehicles to go around single vehicles waiting to make
this turn as similarly observed for northbound traveling vehicles. Included as an attachment to the DOT
SMA response letter, included in Appendix A, were Standard Comments, Apply to All Lane Use Actions
Unless Waivered or Modified in Writing. In this reference, it states that access to a State highway facility
shall be by "fully channelized with left-turn and deceleration and acceleration lanes." As noted in the
Hawai`i Statewide Uniform Design Manual for Streets and Highways, deceleration lanes are always
advantageous, particularly on high-speed roads, although acceleration lanes are not always necessary at
stop controlled intersections where entering drivers can wait for an opportunity to merge without
disrupting through traffic.

Based on AASHTO's stopping sight distance and a design speed of 55mph, based on posted approach
speeds of 45mph, a distance of 495 feet is desired for a deceleration lane. For vehicles accelerating from
a stop condition to a design speed of 55mph, the suggested minimum acceleration lane length is 960
feet. There is not adequate existing space to provide lanes of these lengths, due to the existing gulch
and culvert crossing along Highway 19, without significant construction. Existing space available from
the shoulders along Highway 19 adjacent to the study intersection are shown in Table 12.

                              Table 12: Existing Shoulder Lengths Available

            Shoulder Location:                            Approximate Storage Available (ft)

            Makai of Hwy 19/South of Sugar Mill Rd.                       250
            Makai of Hwy 19/North of Sugar Mill Rd.                       175
            Mauka of Hwy 19/South of Sugar Mill Rd.                       300
            Mauka of Hwy 19/North of Sugar Mill Rd.                       200

Restriping of the existing pavement may be possible to include partial deceleration and acceleration
lanes. This would require the turning vehicles to use a portion of the approaching through-lane for
deceleration/acceleration. Due to heavy vehicle's slower acceleration and deceleration times when
making turns, there is larger impedance to through-traveling vehicles. Although with the low traffic
volumes along Highway 19 during the majority of the day, and only six trucks accessing the facility per
hour, there are sufficient gaps in traffic and minimal impact anticipated. Additionally, with no problems
with line-of-sight, there are no concerns with approaching vehicles having an early enough view, and
breaking distance, of these turning vehicles to avoid right-angle or rear-end collisions. Although
sufficient gaps are available, if mitigation is required, minimal acceleration and deceleration lanes
utilizing existing pavement could be provided through restriping which would alleviate any concern
during peak hours and provide safer operations for both passenger and heavy vehicles at the
intersection.

Channelization of at-grade intersections is the separation or regulation of conflicting traffic movements
into definite paths of travel. Where inner edges of pavement for right turns at intersections are designed
to accommodate wide turning vehicles, the pavement area at the intersection may become excessively
large for proper control of traffic. To avoid this condition, channelization is often included. Since existing
conditions are acceptable for proper vehicle turn movements, and design vehicles can adequately make
these movements, no channelization is needed.

VII.    SUMMARY
Access to H Honua is not expected to significantly impact the intersection of Highway 19 and Sugar Mill
Road/Kaupakuea Homestead Road. Existing (2010) intersection and roadway conditions are operating at
acceptable levels of service. There is minimal increase in traffic volumes anticipated resulting in
acceptable Future (2022) Without Project intersection and roadway operations. With the additional
traffic and delivery trucks expected to access the H Honua facilities for Future (2022) With Project, the
intersection is expected to continue to operate at acceptable conditions. An additional analysis was
performed to account for the maximum trips generated during shift changes. Similarly, there are no
impacts anticipated for the Future (2022) Shift With Project conditions. Future conditions were
evaluated without the inclusion of traffic volumes resulting from County-approved preexisting lots. It
can be assumed that with the minimal increase in traffic volume resulting from Hu Honua, even if these
additional lots were considered at build-out, the resulting impact to the intersection from Hu Honua
would be minimal.

Intersection safety analysis included sight distance, turning radii, and deceleration and acceleration
lanes. It was concluded that there is sufficient sight distance for passenger vehicles and WB-50 design
trucks at the project intersection to make safe turning maneuvers. The turning radii at the study
intersection, as well as along Sugar Mill Road was determined to be adequate for the largest sized
vehicle which is the WB-50 intermediate semi-truck. It is not believed necessary to provide deceleration
or acceleration lanes due to the low future volumes and minimal trucks accessing the facilities. If
mitigation is required, there is not sufficient existing pavement to provide the desired lane lengths
although shorter lanes could be marked out on existing pavement.

                       LLC, Pepeekeo, North Hilo, Hawaii, TMK: (3) 2-8-008: 104

        The applicant proposes to improve and convert the former Hilo Coast Processing power plant
        from coal-fired to a biomass (wood chip)-fired facility. The conversion will require that a
        substantial and continuing movement of fuel be supplied daily to the facility.

        We have the following comments:

        1.     The applicant shall prepare a traffic assessment for our review and approval. The traffic
               assessment should describe the proposed access from the State highway, the types and
               volumes of vehicles that the facility will require, and the impact of the facility's traffic on
               access to the State highway to include traffic safety. The assessment shall include
               proposed improvements to the State highway to mitigate the impacts to operational and
               safety resulting from the facility's traffic.

        2.     The applicant shall coordinate with the Highways Division Hawaii District Engineer for
               debris and mud removal plans and other contingency plans as the District Engineer
               deems necessary.

        3.     Unanticipated traffic impacts resulting from the operation of the converted plant shall be
               remedied by the applicant in a timely manner at the discretion of the Hawaii District
               Engineer.

       4.      Attached are Standard Conditions that are generally applicable.

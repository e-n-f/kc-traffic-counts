                                                                    Traffic Impact & Access Study       i
 
Executive Summary 
This Traffic Impact & Access Study has been prepared 
to evaluate the potential impacts associated with the 
proposed development project at 70 Prospect Street 
in Somerville, Massachusetts.  The proposed 
development project calls for the construction of a 
fivestory building with 14 residential condominium 
units and approximately 1,300 SF of retail space.  The 
project site is not currently vacant, and houses a car 
& truck rental facility.  The existing building will be 
demolished, and a new curb cut on Prospect Street 
will replace three existing curb cuts, two located on 
Webster Avenue and one on Prospect Street. 
This study includes a review of the existing traffic and roadway conditions in the vicinity of the 
project site, as well as a review of the accident history at each study intersection.  This study 
identifies background growth for the local roadway network, estimates the additional vehicular 
traffic generated the proposed development project, and evaluates the expected future 
roadway and intersection operations, both with and without the proposed development project 
in place. 

Summary of Results 
        Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) methodology, the proposed 
        development project is expected to generate six new vehiclestrips during the weekday 
        morning peak hour, and nine new vehicletrips during the weekday afternoon peak 
        hour. 
        The project site is well served by existing public transportation services, and will be even 
        better served in the future with the Green Line extension project bringing transit service 
        to Union Square. 
        The existing crash rate at each study intersection is below the MassDOT District 4 and 
        statewide averages. 
        The proposed driveway on Prospect Street is better located, relative to the existing curb 
        cut location along Prospect Street. 
        Drivers exiting the proposed site drive onto Prospect Street are expected to have 
        sufficient sight distance for safe vehicle operations. 
        The intersection capacity analyses conducted at each study intersection indicate that 
        the projectgenerated traffic is not expected to have any significant impacts on the 
        intersection and roadway operations. 
This study indicates that the existing roadway network can accommodate the additional 
vehicular traffic generated by the proposed development project.  The number of additional 
vehicletrips is expected to be very low, and it is anticipated that the traffic impacts on the local 
roadway network will not be significant.

1. Introduction 
Design Consultants, Inc. (DCI) has prepared this traffic impact and access study to evaluate the 
potential impacts on the local transportation network associated with the proposed 
development project at 70 Prospect Street in Somerville.  DG Realty & Development is proposing 
to construct a fivestory building with 14 residential condominium units and approximately 
1,300 SF of retail space.  The proposed development project will replace the existing building 
and land use, which currently houses a car and truck rental facility.  This study includes a review 
of the existing traffic and roadway conditions in the vicinity of the project site, identifies 
background traffic growth for the study area, estimates additional traffic generated by the 
proposed development project, and evaluates the future traffic operations at the proposed site 
driveway and at the nearby study intersection. 


2. Existing Conditions 

Project Site 
The existing land use at the project site is a car and truck rental facility.  The site is served by 
three existing curb cuts, two along Webster Avenue and one along Prospect Street.  The existing 
curb cut on Prospect Street is located at the stop line for vehicles traveling northbound on 
Prospect Street.  This curb cut is infrequently used, and has a gate that can be opened to 
provide access to and from the site.  One curb cut on Webster Avenue is located approximately 
25 feet from the crosswalk across the southeastern leg of Webster Avenue, and the second 
curb cut is approximately 100 feet further south along Webster Avenue. 

Study Area 
A field inventory of the adjacent roadway system was conducted in December 2012.  This 
inventory included a collection of existing roadway geometry, traffic control, and traffic volumes 
for the intersections in the vicinity of the project site. 
The following study intersections are included in this report: 

        Prospect Street / Webster Avenue / Concord Avenue 
        Prospect Street / Newton Street 
        Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue 
A plan of the existing study area and its relation to the surrounding roadway system is shown on 
Figure 1.  The following is a description of the study area roadways and intersections within the 
study area.

Prospect Street 
Prospect Street is an urban arterial 
that runs northsouth from the 
Cambridge city line to Somerville 
Avenue to Washington Street.  
Prospect Street continues south 
through Cambridge and provides 
access to the larger transportation 
network, such Soldier's Field Road 
and the Massachusetts Turnpike 
(I90).  The proposed project at 70 
Prospect Street is located at the 
Prospect Street / Webster Avenue 
intersection, approximately two 
tenths of a mile north of the 
Cambridge city line.  There is no 
posted speed limit on Prospect Street in the area of the project.  Prospect Street generally 
provides a single travel lane in each direction, with "sharrow" bicycle pavements.  Onstreet is 
permitted on the east side of the roadway, and sidewalks are provided on both sides of the 
roadway.  The onstreet parking is residentonly permit parking, except on Sundays and 
holidays.  The existing land use on Prospect Street is a mix of residential and commercial uses. 
Prospect Street / Webster Avenue / Concord Avenue 
The Prospect Street / Webster Avenue / Concord Avenue intersection is a fivelegged signalized 
intersection.  To the south of this intersection, Prospect Street is a twoway roadway.  To the 
north of this intersection, Prospect Street is a oneway roadway in the northbound direction 
(away from this intersection).  Similarly, to the southeast of this intersection, Webster Avenue 
is a twoway roadway, while on the northwest side, Webster Avenue is a oneway roadway in 
the southeast direction (towards this intersection).  As such, Prospect Street and Webster 
Avenue function as a "oneway pair" that allows vehicles to travel to and from Union Square.  
Concord Avenue is a oneway residential roadway in the westbound direction (away from this 
intersection), and is 26 feet wide.  Onstreet parking is permitted on both side of Concord 
Avenue.  The Prospect Street northbound approach provides a single 12foot wide travel lane, 
and an adjacent 8foot wide parking lane.  The Webster Avenue northwest bound approach 
provides a single 16foot wide travel lane, with a striped 2foot wide shoulder.  The Webster 
Avenue southeast bound approach is 34 feet wide, and provides a 14foot wide shared 
through/rightturn lane, a 15foot wide leftturn lane, and 2foot wide shoulders on both sides 
of the roadway.  Although only a single shared through/rightturn lane is striped on this 
approach, during peak periods, the southeast bound vehicles on Webster Avenue sometimes 
queue in two lanes, thereby acting as separate through and rightturn lanes for a short distance.  
The left turning movement from Webster Avenue southeast bound to Prospect Street 
northbound is separated by a channelizing island, and is under YIELD control.  Sidewalks are 

                                                                                   January 2013
 
                                                                  Traffic Impact & Access Study      4
 
located on both sides of all the roadways at this intersection.  Pedestrian crosswalks are 
provided across both legs of Webster Avenue, across the south leg of Prospect Street, and 
across Concord Avenue.  Pedestrians have an exclusive pedestrian phase (activated with a push 
button) to safely cross at any of these crosswalks.  There is a bus stop located on the northeast 
side of the Webster Avenue northbound approach, which currently serves MBTA bus route 85. 
Prospect Street / Newton Street 
Newton Street intersects Prospect Street at an acute angle approximately 180 feet south of the 
Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue intersection.  Prospect Street is a oneway roadway in the 
northbound direction.  The Prospect Street northbound approach is approximately 36 feet wide 
and provides three travel lanes.  Newton Street is a oneway roadway in the northeast direction 
and is under STOP sign control.  The Newton Street northeast bound approach is approximately 
20 feet wide and provides a single travel lane.  Onstreet parking is permitted on the southeast 
side of Newton Street, though parking is prohibited for a distance of approximately 135 feet 
back from the Newton Street stop line.  Six foot wide sidewalks are provided on both side of 
Prospect Street, and a 4foot wide sidewalk is provided along the northwest side of Newton 
Street.  A crosswalk is provided across Newton Street. 
Prospect Street / Somerville 
Avenue 
This four legged signalized 
intersection is located at the 
eastern end of the Union Square 
area.  The Prospect Street 
northbound approach is a one
way roadway, with vehicles 
traveling northbound.  All other 
roadway approaches at this 
intersection are twoway 
roadways.  The Prospect Street 
northbound approach provides 
three 12foot wide travel lanes: 
an exclusive leftturn lane, a 
shared leftturn/through lane, 
and a shared through/rightturn lane.  A 1foot wide striped shoulder is provided on both sides 
of the Prospect Street northbound approach.  The Prospect Street southbound approach 
consists of two 12foot wide rightturn only lanes, with "sharrow" bicycle pavement markings in 
the rightmost travel lane.  A channelizing median island prevents vehicles on the Prospect 
Street southbound approach from turning left at this intersection.  The Somerville Avenue 
eastbound approach provides a shared leftturn/through lane and a second through lane.  There 
is a short median island to separate the eastbound and westbound traffic on Somerville Avenue.  
At the intersection, each eastbound lane is 13feet wide with a 1foot wide shoulder on each 
side.  There are also "sharrow" bicycle pavement markings on the Somerville Avenue eastbound 
approach.  The Somerville Avenue westbound approach consists of a through lane and a shared 

                                                                                   January 2013

through/rightturn lane, both 13feet wide.  The shared through/rightturn lane is only provided 
for a distance of approximately 90feet back from the stop line.  Further to the east, Somerville 
Avenue provides a single westbound travel lane and striped bicycle lane.  On the south leg of 
Prospect Street there are 6foot wide sidewalks on both sides of the roadway, on the north leg 
of Prospect Street there is a 10foot wide sidewalk on the east side of the roadway and a 9foot 
wide sidewalk on the west side of the roadway.  On the east leg of Somerville Avenue, there is 
an 8foot wide sidewalk on the north side of the roadway and a 13foot wide sidewalk on the 
south side of the roadway.  On the west leg of Somerville Avenue there is a 9foot wide sidewalk 
on the south side of the roadway and a sidewalk that varies from 6 to 10feet wide on the north 
side of the roadway.  There are crosswalks across each leg of the intersection, controlled by an 
exclusive pedestrian phase.  There is a bus stop located on the Prospect Street northbound 
approach to this intersection, which currently serves MBTA bus routes 91 and CT2. 


2. Traffic Volumes 
An Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) was used to record roadway traffic volumes on Prospect 
Street during a 48hour period on Wednesday December 12 ­ Thursday December 13, 2012.  
These counts were not adjusted for seasonal variation as December volumes are indicative or 
slightly higher than average annual conditions, based on the most recent seasonal adjustment 
factors from MassDOT.  In addition to vehicle volumes, the ATRs also collected vehicle speeds 
and vehicle classification data.  The 85th percentile speed is the defined as the speed at or below 
which 85% of the vehicles are traveling.  The ATR data are summarized in Table 1, below.

In addition to the ATR data, manual turning movement counts (including vehicles, bicycles and 
pedestrians) were collected at the study intersections during the AM peak period (79am) and 
the PM peak period (46pm).  These hours typically represent the peak time periods for 
commuter traffic.  The TMC data were collected on Thursday, December 13, 2012.  The existing 
morning and afternoon peak hour traffic volumes at each study intersection are displayed on 
Figure 2.  The complete traffic count data are provided in Appendix A.

3. Public Transportation 
The following identifies current Bus Routes in the immediate vicinity of the project site. 

        MBTA Route 85 ­ connecting Spring Hill to Kendall/MIT in Cambridge via Union Square.  
        This route travels along Webster Avenue adjacent to the project site, and along Prospect 
        Street north of the project site.  Service is generally provided every 3040 minutes 
        during the weekday peak periods, although no service is provided on weekends. 
        MBTA Route CT2 ­ connecting Sullivan Square and Ruggles Station via Union Square, 
        Kendall/MIT in Cambridge, and the Longwood Medical Area.  This route travels along 
        Webster Avenue adjacent to the project site, and along Prospect Street north of the 
        project site.  Service is generally provided every 20 minutes during the weekday 
        morning peak period, and every 25 minutes during the weekday afternoon peak period.  
        No service is currently provided on weekends. 
Detailed route schedules and maps for the above two MBTA bus routes are provided in 
Appendix B.  In addition to the two bus routes identified above, the project site is in close 
proximity to Union Square (less than a quartermile walk), and to Inman Square in Cambridge 
(less than a halfmile walk).  These two local transportation hubs provide access to many more 
MBTA bus routes, including: 

        MBTA Route 86 ­ Sullivan Square Station (Charlestown) to Cleveland Circle (Brighton) 
        MBTA Route 87 ­ Arlington Center (Arlington) to Lechmere Station (Cambridge) 
        MBTA Route 91 ­ Sullivan Square Station (Charlestown) to Central Square (Cambridge) 
        MBTA Route 69 ­ Harvard Square (Cambridge) to Lechmere Station (Cambridge) 
        MBTA Route 83 ­ Rindge Avenue (Cambridge) to Central Square (Cambridge) 

All of these routes terminate or intersect with a major multimodal hub such as Sullivan Station 
(Orange Line), Lechmere Station (Green Line), Harvard Square (Red Line), Central Square (Red 
Line), or Cleveland Circle (Green Line).  With access to these major multimodal transportation 
centers, many options exist for accessing the project site via public transportation. 


4. Safety Analysis 
To identify vehicle crash trends at the study intersections, accident data was obtained from the 
MassDOT for the three latest years on record, 2008 ­ 2010.  Crash rates for intersections are 
calculated based upon the number of crashes at an intersection and the volume of traffic 
travelling through an intersection on a daily basis.  The MassDOT average crash rates are based 
upon the average number of crashes occurring per million vehicles entering signalized and 
unsignalized intersections.  The average crash rates for MassDOT District 4 (which includes the 
City of Somerville) are 0.78 and 0.59 for signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively.  
The MassDOT statewide average crash rates are 0.81 and 0.61 for signalized and unsignalized 
intersections, respectively.  The crash data for all study intersections are summarized in Table 2. 


                                                                                    January 2013

As indicated in Table 2, the crash rate at each study intersection is below the MassDOT District 4 
average, and below the statewide average crash rate.  The MassDOT intersection crash rate 
worksheets are provided in Appendix C. 
While the crash rate at all study intersections are well below the MassDOT average rate, 
particular attention has been given to the Prospect Street / Webster Avenue intersection, due to 
the proximity of the subject site and the complex and irregular intersection geometry.  Over the 
three year period that was analyzed, there were six crashes that were angle type crashes, side
swipe type crashes, or headon collisions.  The aerial image graphic below is meant to illustrate 
concerning vehicular conflict points that occur at this intersection.  There is a significant volume 
of traffic coming from the north on Webster Avenue, particularly in the weekday morning peak 
hour, with approximately 40% of the vehicles turning right onto Prospect Street southbound and 
60% continuing on Webster Avenue.  These movements conflict with vehicles coming from the 
south on Webster Avenue turning onto Concord Avenue and Prospect Street.  It is likely that the 
large turning radii and complex geometry contribute to these types of crashes. 




                                                                        Existing Curb Cut

Also shown on the aerial image are the locations of the existing curb cut on Prospect Street that 
serves the project site (shown in red) and the approximate location of the proposed curb cut 
(shown in green).  The proposed curb cut is located approximately 75 feet further from the 
intersection than the existing curb cut, and thus will be an improvement as vehicles entering 
and exiting the project site will be that much further removed from any of the conflict points at 
the intersection of Prospect Street and Webster Avenue.

6. Future Conditions 

Future Traffic Volumes 
DCI understands that traffic volumes and circulation patterns in and around the Union Square 
area are expected to change dramatically in the relatively near future.  The proposed extension 
of the MBTA Green Line light rail service and the proposed Union Square station will increase 
access to public transportation significantly.  In anticipation of the proposed Green Line 
extension project, the City of Somerville has recently changed the zoning in the Union Square 
area.  Significant commercial development is also expected within the study area.  Furthermore, 
significant changes to the roadway network have been discussed, including changes that would 
make all sections of Prospect Street and Webster Avenue twoway roadways.  However, a 
comprehensive study of the effects of these changes is beyond the scope of this traffic impact 
and access study.  This study focuses on the incremental impacts associated with this relatively 
minor development project. 
To present a relatively conservative analysis of future year 2017 (5 year projection), DCI has 
increased the 2012 peak hour motor vehicle volumes by an annual growth factor of 1%.  This 
background growth rate is consistent with other traffic studies previously completed in 
Somerville.  It is assumed that the existing roadway network and travel patterns remain in all 
future conditions.  The resultant 2017 Future NoBuild peak hour intersection volumes are 
shown in Figure 3. 

ProjectGenerated VehicleTrips 
To estimate the trip generation characteristics of the proposed development project, the 
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (9th edition, 2012) was used.  
This manual provides vehicletrip generation projections for various landuses, based on 
research and data conducted by public agencies, developers, consulting firms, and professional 
associations.  The trips generated by the proposed project were estimated through the use of 
the trip generation rates for ITE Land Use 230 ­ Residential Condominium/Townhouse and ITE 
Land use 826 ­ Specialty Retail Center. 
Table 3 summarizes the proposed trip generation for this development project.  Complete trip 
generation calculations are provided in Appendix D.

As indicated in Table 3, the proposed development project is expected to generate a total of 6 
vehicletrips during the weekday morning peak hour, 9 vehicletrips during the weekday 
afternoon peak hour, and 124 vehicletrips over the course of a typical weekday.  These vehicle
trip projections include a 10% reduction, based on the close proximity to existing and proposed 
public transportation.  As discussed previously, this area is currently well served by MBTA bus 
routes.  Additionally, the Union Square station that is proposed as part of the Green Line 
Extension will be in very close proximity to the proposed development project.  In all likelihood, 
the proportion of trips using public transportation to travel to and from the project site will be 
significantly higher than 10%. 
Further adjustments to the trip generation calculations that were not included in the 
quantitative analysis include passby trips and internal sitetrips.  Passby trips are vehicletrips 
to and from the project site that are made by vehicles already using the roadway.  It is likely that 
some portion of the trips to and from the retail space will be made by people who already drive 
on Prospect Street or Webster Avenue already, and are not new trips to the roadway network.  
Internal site trips are those made within the project site, and do not add any external trips to 
the surrounding transportation network.  An example of an internal trip is someone who lives in 
the building and walks to the retail space on the project site. 
As reductions were not taken for passby trips nor for internal site trips, and only a 10% 
reduction was taken for public transportation, the trip generation calculations provide for a 
conservative analysis.  It is also noted that the vehicletrips expected to be generated from the 
project site are lower than the recorded daily variation of vehicles on Prospect Street. 
Lastly, no credit was taken for the existing vehicle trips traveling to and from car and truck rental 
facility that is currently located on the project site.  As such, many of the "new" trips generated 
by the proposed development project will simply be replacing existing vehicletrips that are 
already using the local roadway network. 
The projectgenerated vehicle trips were then distributed onto the roadway network, using 
existing travel patterns.  The trip distribution use to apply the new vehicletrips to the roadway 
network is displayed in Figure 4.  The new sitegenerated vehicle trips are displayed in Figure 5, 
and the 2017 Future Build Peak Hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 6.

Sight Distance Analysis 
The sight distance was measured at the proposed driveway on Prospect Street in order to 
determine whether exiting vehicles would have adequate sight distance.  The required sight 
distance is a function of perception/reaction time of the approaching motorist and the required 
braking distance, which is based on vehicular speed.  The available sight distance at the 
proposed driveway was recorded in conformance with the procedures established in the 
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on 
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (6th ed., 2011).  The available sight distance was then 
compared to the minimum requirements for two sight distance criteria: Stopping Sight Distance 
(SSD) and Intersection Sight Distance (ISD). 
SSD is the distance required for vehicles on the major road to stop in time to avoid a collision 
with a stationary object.  The SSD was recorded from the edge of the travel way on Prospect 
Street.  This is the point at which an object becomes an obstruction to a moving vehicle.  ISD is 
the distance needed for a vehicle to enter the major roadway from the minor roadway without 
interfering with traffic operations on the major roadway.  ISD is often desirable to improve 
traffic operations and to provide convenience for vehicles exiting the minor roadway, but it is 
not required.  In accordance with the procedure stated in the AASHTO A Policy on Geometric 
Design of Highways and Streets, the ISD was recorded 15 feet back from the edge of the travel 
way on Prospect Street.  This point forms one vertex of the "clear sight triangle".  The sight 
triangle is the area that must be clear from obstructions to provide sufficient ISD for a stopped 
driver on a minor road approach to depart from the intersection and enter the major roadway. 
The recorded 85th percentile speeds of 32 MPH and 26 MPH to northbound and southbound 
traveling vehicles, respectively, were used to determine the minimum sight distance 
requirements.  Table 4 compares the available sight distance, as recorded in the field, to the 
minimum requirements for SSD and ISD.

It is noted that the proposed driveway, located approximately 75 ft south of the Prospect Street 
stop line has clear sight distance to and from the Webster Avenue SouthEast Bound stop line 
(210 ft).  This available sight distance is expected to be sufficient (despite technically being six

feet short of the required minimum SSD), because many vehicles will be accelerating from a full 
stop at the intersection of Prospect Street / Webster Avenue.  While these vehicles are traveling 
slower than the 85th percentile speed of 32 MPH, the minimum required SSD is far lower, and 
will be exceeded by the available sight distance.  The intersection sight distance looking to the 
north is also not expected to be an issue, as gaps in the traffic flow will be created by the traffic 
signal at the Prospect Street / Webster Avenue intersection. 

OffStreet Parking 
A total of 14 offstreet parking spaces are being provided at the project site, one for each of the 
residential condominium units.  However, no offstreet parking spaces are provided for the 
approximately 1,300 SF of retail space on the project site.  It is expected that users of the retail 
portion of the project site will be traveling to and from the site via alternate modes of 
transportation, such public transportation, bicycles, or walking.  As noted earlier in this report, 
2hour onstreet parking is provided on the northeast side of Webster Avenue.  This onstreet 
parking is generally not fully occupied, and would also available for users of the retail portion of 
the proposed development project traveling by automobile. 
 

Intersection Capacity Analysis 
To assess quality of traffic flow, intersection capacity analyses were conducted for the study 
intersections for existing conditions and future conditions with and without the proposed 
development project.  Capacity analyses determines LevelofService (LOS) based upon vehicle 
delays for intersection operating conditions. 
LevelofService is used to denote the different operating conditions for roadways and 
intersections under various traffic volume loads.  LOS designations range from "A" at best with 
little or no delays to "F" at worst with long delays and forced flow conditions.  LOS ratings for an 
intersection are based upon the average delay per approaching vehicle.  The amount of delay is 
dependent upon traffic volumes, roadway characteristics, intersection geometry, and phasing 
and timing of traffic signals.  A LOS ranking of "C" is considered stable flow which is desirable for 
peak design flows in urban areas.  A LOS "D" is considered acceptable during peak periods in 
urban areas. 
Definitions of Levels of Service at signalized and unsignalized intersections are presented in the 
2010 Highway Capacity Manual and the following tables define the relationship between Level 
of Service, control delay, and qualitative traffic flow.  It is noted that the delay thresholds in the 
table below correspond with a volumetocapacity (v/c) ratio of less than 1.0.  For any v/c ratio 
of greater than 1.0, a LOS F is assigned, regardless of the calculated delay.

The delay thresholds that define LOS at unsignalized intersections differ from those at signalized 
intersections, primarily due to different driver expectations.  At unsignalized intersections, the 
LOS is not defined for the intersection as a whole, as a high volume of vehicles on the major 
roadway typically experience no delay, and would heavily skew any weighted average of delays.  
Similar to the thresholds for signalized intersections, the delay thresholds in the table below 
correspond with a volumetocapacity (v/c) ratio of less than 1.0.  For any v/c ratio of greater 
than 1.0, a LOS F is assigned, regardless of the calculated delay

A detailed traffic network for the two peak travel periods was developed to perform the 
capacity analyses, which utilized the Synchro v8 software.  A Level of Service analysis was done 
for the existing 2012 and future 2017 "Build" and "No Build" conditions for the study 
intersections.  A summary of the Level of Service (LOS) is shown in Tables 7 and 8 for the existing 
2012 and future 2017 scenarios for the weekday AM and PM peak hour conditions, respectively.  
The detailed capacity analysis worksheets are contained in Appendix E.

As indicated in Tables 7 and 8, the intersection of Prospect Street / Webster Avenue currently 
operated at an overall LOS F, while the intersection of Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue 
currently operates at an overall LOS E.  These two signalized intersections are expected to 
continue to operate at the same overall LOS in the 2017 Future NoBuild scenario.  The very low 
number of additional vehicletrips added to the roadway network from the project site is not 
expected to have any significant impacts on the traffic operations with respect to vehicle delay 
and queuing. 
It is also noted that the existing signal controllers at the intersections of Prospect Street / 
Webster Avenue and Prospect Street / Somerville Avenue are currently operating in "pretimed" 
mode.  This is either due to nonexistent or nonfunctioning vehicle detection on all intersection 
approaches.  The City of Somerville could significantly improve traffic operations by upgrading 
and/or fixing the existing traffic signal equipment and optimizing traffic signal timings. 
At the unsignalized intersection of Prospect Street / Newton Street, the Newton Street approach 
currently operates at LOS B during both the weekday morning and afternoon peak hours.  It is 
expected to continue to operate at LOS B during all future scenarios. 
At the Prospect Street / Site Driveway intersection, vehicles exiting the project site are 
anticipated to operate at LOS B during both the weekday morning and afternoon peak hours, 
with minimal onsite queuing.  While the Prospect Street northbound queue from the 
intersection with Webster Avenue is expected to extend past the project site driveway during 
both peak hours, the impact to vehicles on Prospect Street southbound stuck behind vehicles 
waiting to turn left into the project site is minimal, due to the very low volume of vehicles 
turning left into the project site (as shown on Figure 5, not more than 3 vehicles during each 
weekday peak hour are expected to turn left from Prospect Street into the project site). 
 


7. Conclusion 
The various traffic operation and safety analyses that have been included in this report all 
indicate that the proposed development project at 70 Prospect Street will have minimal impacts 
to the surrounding roadways and intersections.  The number of additional vehicletrips that will 
be generated at the project site are very low, and can easily be accommodated by the existing 
transportation infrastructure.

* Land Use 826, Specialty Retail Center does not contain any data regarding trips made during the AM 
peak hour of the adjacent street traffic.  To estimate the trips in the AM peak hour of the adjacent street 
traffic, the Shopping Center (Land Use 820) land use was used.  The ratio of the average rate in the AM 
peak hour of the adjacent street traffic (0.96) to the average rate in the PM peak hour of the adjacent 
street traffic (3.71) was applied to the average rate PM peak hour rate of Land Use 826.  The percent 
entering/exiting from Land Use 820 was also used.

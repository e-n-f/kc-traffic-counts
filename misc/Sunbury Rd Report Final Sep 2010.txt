Sunbury Road

I. Introduction and Background
DLZ Ohio, Inc. was retained by Franklin County Engineers to conduct traffic signal timing
analysis at four intersections along Sunbury Road between Allstate Ramp "P" (I-270
Northbound to SR 161 Eastbound off-ramp) and Valley Quail Boulevard South. The Sunbury
Drive study corridor is approximately 0.4 miles long. A location map is shown in Figure 1
below:

Sunbury Road

The study includes analyses of the following signalized intersections:

   1. Sunbury Road @ Allstate Ramp "P" (I-270 Northbound to SR 161 Eastbound Exit
      Ramp)
   2. Sunbury Road @ SR 161 SPUI
   3. Sunbury Road @ Executive Parkway
   4. Sunbury Road @ Valley Quail Boulevard South

Franklin County maintains the Valley Quail Boulevard South intersection while the other
three traffic signals are maintained by ODOT.

II. Purpose and Need
The purpose of this study is to retime the traffic signals and offsets of the existing Sunbury
signal system (Allstate Ramp "P" to Executive Parkway) and add the Valley Quail Boulevard
South intersection into the coordinated system. The coordinated traffic signal timing plans
will be developed for the various traffic conditions and the proposed signal timing
improvements will be evaluated on Sunbury Drive.

Sunbury Road in this area serves many businesses along Executive Parkway and also serves
many residential areas farther north of the study area that is adjacent to Sunbury Road. This
provides for a mixture of traffic going northbound to Executive Parkway and heavy traffic
going southbound to get onto the I-270 and the SR 161 ramps in the morning peak hours, and
vice versa in the evening peak hours.

The proposed signal timing coordination and modifications discussed in this report are
intended to decrease delays and provide a more consistent driving experience along Sunbury
Road.

III. Existing Condition
Sunbury Road has two southbound travel lanes north of Valley Quail Boulevard South. These
two southbound lanes widen into five lanes just north of Executive Parkway and eventually
turn into turn lanes at the SPUI; however, two southbound through lanes carry through the
study area south of Allstate Ramp "P". There are two northbound through lanes just south of
Allstate Ramp "P" which widen into six lanes at the SPUI. Three of these lanes are turn lanes
at the SPUI and one northbound through lane goes into the left-turn lane at Executive
Parkway. The two northbound through lanes are consistent through the study are to north of
Valley Quail Boulevard South.

The speed limit on this section of Sunbury Road is 45 mph. The weekday morning traffic
volume peak period is between 7:15 AM and 8:15 AM, the midday peak is between 12:00 and
1:00 PM, and the afternoon peak is between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Traffic during the
weekend was not analyzed as part of this study since traffic volumes are relatively light
during the weekend days.



                                                                                             2

A. Traffic Volume
Twenty-four hour mechanical traffic counts were collected on Sunbury Road north of
Executive Parkway and north of Valley Quail Boulevard South. The mechanical count
reports and the graphic results are included in Appendix A. Figure 2 shows the weekday
traffic volumes on Sunbury Road.

                     Figure 2: Sunbury Road Traffic Volume Summary




Based on the volume data, three time-of-day programs are proposed. A morning program will
be from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, midday program from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and an afternoon
program from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. From 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM the system will run the
midday program before going to the "free" (not coordinated) mode after 10:00 PM. During
the weekend, the midday program is proposed between 7:00 AM and 10:00 PM.

The volume versus time of day chart above shows typical peaks during the AM and PM peak
hours; however, the lane utilization varies greatly in the southbound lanes north of
Executive Parkway in the morning peak hours. The majority of the traffic is in the outside
through lanes going southbound. The outside through lane (lane #1) eventually goes to
southbound I-270 and the next lane over (lane #2) goes to eastbound SR-161. Figure 3 shows
the lane utilization of the southbound Sunbury Road traffic just north of Executive Parkway
(lane #3 in the figure is combination of the other three southbound lanes).

The turning movement volume counts were collected by Franklin County in November of
2009, with the exception of Valley Quail Boulevard South, which was collected in September
of 2008. The majority of the counts were from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The turning movement
counts are provided in Appendix B.

B. Existing Traffic Signal System
Three of the signals from Allstate Ramp "P" to Executive Parkway are on the radio control
system (Eagle). The intersection of Valley Quail Boulevard South was not in coordination
with the other three signals; however, all of the hardware was installed for interconnect of
these signals. The master controller is at Executive Parkway. All four signalized
intersections have Eagle controllers.

C. Existing Intersection Geometrics
Existing intersection geometric field observations were conducted for each intersection.
Pictures were taken for each approach leg at each signalized intersection. Crash diagrams
were supplied by Franklin County Engineer so that a record of crashes can be established
before any signal timing adjustments were implemented and to see if there are any crash
patterns that could be improved by changes in the signal phasing and/or signal timing.

The analysis of the crash diagrams do not support any changes to the signal phasing, such as
excessive crashes. The existing intersection geometrics and crash diagrams are provided in
Appendix C.

D. Existing Signal Operational Analysis



                                                                                           4
Signal System Timing Upgrade                                                       Sep. 2010
Sunbury Road

The Existing Signal Operational Analysis was conducted for the four studied intersections on an
individual basis. Traffic modeling and analysis software, SIGNAL2000 (TEAPAC), was used
for the signal operation analysis. Three models were designed for three different peak
conditions:
    1. AM Peak model
    2. Mid-day Peak model
    3. PM Peak model

Peak Hour Factors (PHF) and truck percentages were based on the existing traffic counts
taken during the AM, midday and PM peak hours. A minimum of 0.50 PHF was established
in order to not skew the optimized timings due to a very low PHF. In most cases, the PHF
ranged between 0.60 and 0.95 at the four intersections.

SIGNAL2000 uses the methods prescribed in the Highway Capacity Manual to determine the
Level-of-Service (LOS). LOS is defined in terms of delay and is a measure of driver
discomfort and intersection performance with respect to vehicular capacity and quality of
service provided to road users. Delay refers to total average control delay experienced by
motorists at the referenced intersection. The level of service is classified into six different
levels, ranging from A to F. Table 1 shows the definitions of each level.

                 Table 1: Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections

      Level of
                                  Description                           Delay
      Service
        A                       Very low delay                  <10 seconds per vehicle
         B                     Good Progression                10-20 seconds per vehicle
         C                 Limit of acceptable delay           20-35 seconds per vehicle
         D                 Start of traffic breakdown          35-55 seconds per vehicle
         E                        High delay                   55-80 seconds per vehicle
          F         Congested conditions, unacceptable delay    >80 seconds per vehicle



For the existing three coordinated signalized intersections (Allstate Ramp "P" to Executive
Parkway), the cycle lengths were set at 120 seconds between 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Since
the intersection of Sunbury Road and Valley Quail Boulevard is not in the coordinated
system, the cycle lengths vary at this intersection depending on the main street and side-street
traffic demands and the SIGNAL2000 analysis reflects the typical cycle length and splits
observed during the field observations. The cycle length of 120 seconds for the rest of the
intersections was inputted into SIGNAL2000 for the Local Existing Phasing analysis.

In the SIGNAL2000 AM peak hour model, the lane utilization was adjusted for the
southbound through lanes at Executive parkway and at the SPUI to reflect the existing long
southbound queues in the AM peak hour. Likewise, the lane utilization factor was adjusted
for the northbound left-turn lanes on Sunbury Road at Executive Parkway to reflect the
existing northbound left-turn lane utilization observed in the AM and PM peak hours.


                                                                                               5

Table 2 shows the results for the AM, Midday and PM LOS.

Individually, the majority of the intersections operate with acceptable levels of service. The
existing phasing information is provided in Figures 4 through 6.

Due to the intricacies of modeling the Single Point Urban Interchange (SPUI), the Synchro
model was developed independently from the SIGNAL2000 computer models (SIGNAL2000
was not exported to Synchro). As in the SIGNAL2000 analysis, peak hour factors, truck
percentages, lane utilizations, and existing timings were inputted into the Existing timing
Synchro models. From observations in the field, it was noted that in the AM peak hour, the
southbound traffic that is going on the I-270 southbound on-ramp at the SPUI queues up all
the way to the Valley Quail Boulevard South intersection (1200 feet). During the morning
and afternoon peak hours, traffic in the northbound left-turn lanes on Sunbury Road at
Executive Parkway queues into the SPUI. Due to the long queues affecting upstream
intersections of the corridor, the SimTraffic micro-simulation model was used to compare to
the traffic conditions as observed in the field. In the SimTraffic model, the "Mandatory
Distance" and "Positioning Distance" parameters were adjusted in order to model the
southbound queue backup experienced in the field. For all the Existing and Proposed
Synchro/SimTraffic models, all left-turn protected phases were assumed to be activated, with
the exception of the northbound left-turn phase and the eastbound split phase at the Allstate
Ramp "P" intersection (since the eastbound leg of the intersection has not been developed
yet).

All three of the Existing timing Synchro models (AM, midday, and PM) have the intersection
of Sunbury Road and Valley Quail Boulevard South as an actuated/uncoordinated signal, like
how it was currently operating in the field. The Optimized signal timing has the Valley Quail
Boulevard South intersection coordinated with the other three intersections of the study area,
which is discussed in the next section. The SIGNAL2000 and Synchro7 files and reports are
provided on the attached CD.

IV. Proposed Signal Timings
A. Changes to the Existing Signal Operations
The first step in the optimized timings process is to analyze the intersection traffic signal
timings and phasings using SIGNAL2000.

Minimum green times, vehicle extension times, and loop detector delays were reviewed and
recommendations were made for the corridor signals. These recommended changes are found
in Appendix D.
     The minimum green times are based on typical driver expectation, which will vary
       from region to region. For Sunbury Road, minimum green times were kept essentially
       the same, except at the Allstate Ramp "P", where it was changed from 17 seconds to
       20 seconds in order to match the rest of the corridor.
     Existing vehicle extensions were mostly set at 2.0 seconds on the side streets and on
       Sunbury Road. Vehicle extensions were lengthened to at least 3.0 seconds on the side
       streets so the side streets do not gap out in a middle of a queue. If trucks are in a long
       queue, sometimes a gap of more than two seconds occurs between their vehicle and
       the vehicle in front of them. On the mainline, vehicle extensions were calculated
       based on the 45 MPH speed limit and the time it would take a vehicle from the near
       detection loop to the stop line, which was 4.0 seconds at the Allstate Ramp "P"
       intersection and at Executive Parkway intersection.
     A few vehicle detector delays were recommended to be changed. In the existing
       timings, there are cases where a three or ten second delay is on a left-turn loop, but the
       loop detector is set back on the left-turn lane or no right turns on red are allowed, such
       as at the SPUI. In these cases, the loop delays were recommended to be set to zero
       seconds. Any detector loops in an exclusive right-turn lane is recommended to have a
       delay of eight seconds.

The above signal phasing and timing parameters were inputted into the SIGNAL2000
computer program. The SIGNAL2000 computer program was programmed to pick the best or
least delay signal phasing for the four study intersections, which is called the Local Proposed
Phasing.

The Local Proposed Timings model reflects the optimized cycle lengths and splits with the
four signalized intersections in one system. Therefore, all four intersections in the AM peak
analysis have one cycle length (120 seconds). In the midday analysis, all four intersections
have a 90-second cycle length and in the PM analysis, all four intersections have a 120-
second cycle length. The Local Proposed Timings models do not mean that the proposed
coordinated timings will have these same cycle lengths. Rather, the Local Proposed Timings
models gives the optimized split times and levels of service associated with the individual
intersections. Synchro7 and Simtraffic will be used in the next step to analyze the best cycle
length for the whole system in order to minimize delays and maximize progression.

The Future Timings model reflects the potential signal phasing at the intersection of Sunbury
Road and Allstate Ramp "P". This model assumes the eastbound phase and the northbound
left-turn phase are actuated during every cycle. The Existing Timings and Local Proposed

                                                                                               10

Timings models only assumed the north-south phase and the westbound phase are activated
(2-phase signal), which is essentially how it operates today, unless the pedestrian push button
is activated. The proposed coordinated timings will need to incorporate all four phases at this
intersection.

Table 3 shows the results for the AM, Midday and PM LOS for the Local Proposed Phasing.
Figures 7 through 9 show the local proposed phasing for the four study intersections during
the AM, midday and PM peak hours.

B. Change and Clearance Intervals
The vehicular change and clearance time (yellow + all red) check was done for each approach
of the intersections on Sunbury Road. The yellow and all-red times were calculated based on
the formulas in the ODOT TEM, Section 403-2, which is also the ITE recommended practice.
The yellow times are based on the 45 MPH speed limit on Sunbury Road. At most of the
intersections, the yellow and all-red intervals closely followed the calculated ITE
recommendations. However, for the Valley Quail Boulevard signal, it was recommended to
change the yellow interval on the side street to 3.5 seconds and the all-red interval to 3.0
seconds based on the 25 MPH speed limit. The proposed yellow and all-red intervals were
implemented in the proposed signal timings. Following are the results of the clearance
interval check:

The existing and proposed pedestrian "Walk" and "Flashing Don't Walk" (FDW) times are
provided in Table 5 for each of the studied intersections. The proposed yellow intervals were
subtracted from the pedestrian clearance intervals to obtain the FDW time. The minimum
recommended pedestrian clearance time is calculated based on the following formula:

       Pedestrian Clearance (in sec.) = Crosswalk width in feet / average pedestrian walk
                                        speed in feet per second.

Pedestrian signal heads and push buttons are provided for the east-west directions at the
intersection of Valley Quail Boulevard South, and also on the south side (east-west direction)
at the intersection of Allstate Ramp "P". Proposed pedestrian clearances are provided for a
pedestrian walking speed of 3.5 feet per second. The recommended minimum "Flashing
Don't Walk" time is then changed to the calculated clearance time minus the recommended
yellow interval. When looking at the existing pedestrian timings in the controllers, there were
some intersections where there were pedestrian times inputted when there was no pedestrian
phase allowed at the intersection; this was the case at Allstate Ramp "P" and at Executive
Parkway. Table 5 below summarizes the proposed pedestrian times.

C. Signal System Timings
The proposed vehicle clearance intervals and proposed pedestrian timings were inputted into
Syncho7. The Allstate Ramp "P" has pedestrian pushbuttons to cross Sunbury Road. This
pedestrian pushbutton calls phase 3 (Eastbound phase) which is seldom used since the
eastbound approach is a dead end (planned for future developments). Because of the long
pedestrian clearance interval, it was decided that when the pedestrian pushbutton is activated,
the signal would go out of the coordinated system in order to accommodate the pedestrian
phase. (During the timing observations, no pedestrians were observed near this area.) After a
few cycles, the signal would then be coordination again.

The following is a summary of the Synchro/SimTraffic Optimized signal timings:

                                                                                                  16
Signal System Timing Upgrade                                                      Sep. 2010
Sunbury Road

      The recommended local timing parameters were inputted in the Optimized Synchro
       files, such as the yellow and all-red times, passage time, minimum green times, and
       pedestrian timings.
      Offsets were set to the beginning of the mainline yellow at the request of ODOT
       (instead of the beginning of the mainline green, as it was set up in the existing
       coordination timings).
      At the intersection of Allstate Ramp "P", only two phases were set up in the Synchro
       file (North-South thru phase and the westbound phase). The actual coordinated
       timings that will be inputted into the controller will have signal timings for the other
       phases as well (eastbound phase and northbound left-turn phase).
      Cycle lengths of 100 to 130 seconds were analyzed in each of the peak hour periods,
       AM, midday, and PM. The optimized cycle lengths for the AM and PM peak hours
       were 120 seconds. A shorter cycle length of 110 seconds during the PM peak hour
       had about the same delay as the 120 second cycle length; however the 120 second
       cycle length had wider green band widths on Sunbury Road. A 100 second cycle
       length is best during the midday and off-peak hours.
      At the SR-161 SPUI intersection, a lagging southbound left-turn phase during the AM,
       midday and PM peak hours resulted in less delay in the system overall, and
       particularly better progression in the southbound direction.

The following changes were made to the existing coordination timings:
    1. Set the offset mode to the beginning of mainline yellow.
    2. At the intersection of Sunbury Road and the SR 161 SPUI, change the southbound
        leading left-turn phase to a lagging left-turn phase (currently a protected only phase).
    3. Place the intersection of Sunbury Road at Valley Quail Boulevard South in
        coordination with the other three ODOT signals.
    4. Implement the signal timings as shown in the Optimized Synchro files. The actual
        coordination timings will include timings for northbound left-turn phase and
        eastbound phase at the Allstate Ramp "P" intersection. Also, actual coordination
        timings may differ a second or two from the Synchro timings, particularly the left-turn
        phases at Valley Quail Boulevard may be set longer in the coordination timings to
        capture spikes in the left-turn traffic.

The coordination timings were set for Permissive Mode, which allowed phases 2 and 6
(Sunbury Road) to usually start earlier if the side-street phase was gapped out. However, at
the intersection of Allstate Ramp "P", since phase 3 seldom comes up, the time allotted to this
phase is added onto the end of the north-south coordinated phase. So the split time on
Sunbury Road is extended through phase 3 assuming phase 3 is not activated. This is the
reason why the offset measured in Synchro is a different offset than the one programmed in
the coordination sheets at the Allstate Ramp "P" intersection.

D. Intersection Operational Analyses
Comparisons of the Level of Service and Control Delays from Synchro7 for the studied
intersections are presented for the existing and proposed timings in Table 6. At the
intersection of Valley Quail Boulevard South, the proposed condition shows more delay. This
is due to in the existing condition the intersection was operating freely (out of system) so
cycle lengths vary depending on traffic demand and the signals are self optimizing in nature.

                                                                                              17

           Sunbury Road

           This sometimes results in less signal delay than signals that are in a system with a longer
           cycle length. It is important to note that when traffic signals are placed in coordination, the
           biggest benefit is not seen in individual signal delay, but in the overall delay of the arterial
           through traffic.

           A queue analysis between the existing and optimized coordinated signal timings was
           completed for the critical movements at each intersection. In the AM peak hour, the
           southbound right-turn movement at the SR 161 SPUI queue is reduced from 1,110 feet to 830
           feet. During the PM peak hour, the westbound off-ramp queue at the Allstate Ramp "P"
           intersection is reduced from 815 feet to 270 feet. In both the AM and PM peak hours, longer
           queues are shown for the southbound movement at the Valley Quail Boulevard intersection;
           however, during observations of the after or optimized condition (after the proposed timings
           were implemented), the southbound queues were around 500 feet long in the AM peak hour
           and around 300 feet in the PM peak hour. The longer SimTraffic queue shown in Table 7 is
           due to the longer cycle lengths experienced by placing this signal in coordination with the
           other three signals along Sunbury Road. Before, this traffic signal was operating freely and
           on average had shorter cycle lengths (cycle lengths vary depending on the demand of traffic).
           Shorter cycle lengths tend to give shorter queues in certain situations.

E. Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs)
The green bandwidth lines are used to show the amount of time traffic can travel through the
corridor without stopping. Since the existing conditions do not have the intersection of Valley
Quail Boulevard in coordination, there is no way to measure the green bandwidths for the
existing conditions. The green bandwidths for the 70th percentile of the proposed conditions
are presented below in Table 8.

Table 8: Sunbury Road Green Bandwidths (70th Percentile, in Seconds)

The overall network performance is indicated by measures of effectiveness (MOEs).
Measures of effectiveness for the existing timing and proposed timings were compared for the
three analyses periods in terms of the following parameters:

       Arterial Level of Service
       Control Delay per Vehicle (sec/veh)
       Total Delay (hrs)
       Stops/Vehicle
       Average Speed
       Fuel Economy (mpg)

These MOEs are required to understand the effects of signal timing improvements on Sunbury
Road. The SimTraffic outputs for the MOEs and the time-space diagrams are attached in
Appendix E.

The network traffic signal level of service shows total signal delay for all four intersections,
which included the delays on Sunbury Road and the side streets. This is the total signal delay
(in seconds) that vehicles would experience by traveling through the project area. Figure 10
shows the graphical comparison between the existing and proposed condition for the control
delay per vehicle (sec/veh). The proposed condition shows improvements during all three
peak hour periods.

F. Proposed Signal Timing Plan Implementation Schedule
The time of day schedule is based on the daily fluctuations of traffic volumes, as shown in
Appendix A. The proposed weekday timing plan implementation schedule is shown in Table
10. For weekends, it is recommended to have the signals run the midday program from 7:00
AM to 10:00 PM and run free the other times of the day (10:00 PM to 7:00 AM). The
proposed timing tables for each intersection on Alum Creek are shown in Appendix F.

V. Travel Time Studies
Travel time studies were conducted along Sunbury Road from Allstate Ramp "P" to Valley
Quail Boulevard South in the northbound and southbound direction using a vehicle probed
with travel time study equipment. "Before" travel time studies were performed during the
weekday AM, Midday, and PM periods. The results and the graphs of the travel time studies
are included in Appendix-G.

The initial coordination signal timings were implemented by May 26, 2010. After review of
the coordination timings during the AM, Midday, and PM peak hours, a few adjustments were
made to the PM peak hour offsets and to the northbound left-turn passage time at Executive
Parkway. The extension time was extended to 5.0 seconds so the left-turn phase would not
gap out so much before the northbound traffic from the SPUI would arrive. "After" travel
time studies were then performed in the AM Peak, Midday Peak, and PM Peak hours on June
16, 2010. Table 11 shows the results of the Before and After travel time studies. An
improvement is shown in every situation after the optimized coordination timings were
implemented, especially the southbound movement in the AM peak hour.

Additional travel time studies were performed for certain movements wihtin the project area.
These were the southbound traffic from Valley Quail Boulevard to the right-turn at the SR
161 SPUI in the AM peak hour, the off-ramp traffic from I-270 (at the Allstate Ramp) to
Executive Parkway in the PM peak hour, and the northbound traffic at the SPUI through the
northbound left-turn at Executive Parkway in the AM peak hour. Two of the three
movements showed significant reduction in travel times and delays. The northbound
movment from the SR 161 SPUI through the left-turn movement at Executive Parkway
showed a slight increase in delay; however, this is not the major traffic movement in the
project area during the AM peak hour.

Cost/Benefit Analysis
The optimized signal timings for Sunbury Road resulted in improved measures of
effectiveness (MOE's) according to the travel time studies. Each through movement
experienced an improvement of over 30 percent in the total delay and a decrease of travel
time by 15 to 55 percent. The most significant improvement is the southbound movement in
the AM peak hour, with a decrease of 73 percent of total signal delay.

A cost/benefit analysis was completed that takes into account travel times, stops, signal delay,
emissions and vehicle volumes in the study area. According to the cost/benefit analysis,
this study had a one year 47.1 cost to benefit ratio. This assumes a cost of $2.50 per gallon
of gas and an average hourly value of time per individual of $19.42. Average hourly value of
time was derived from a per capita income of $31,066 (from MORPC 2000 US Census
Results for the Westerville area) times the average vehicle occupancy, and then divided by
250 workdays per year and 8 hours per workday. This resulted to $15.53. This figure was
then factored for inflation by a 2.5% per year inflation rate, which came to be $19.42. Table
13 shows the cost to benefit analysis.

VI. Conclusions
The purpose of this study was to develop coordinated traffic signal timing plans for various
traffic conditions and to evaluate the impact of the signal timing improvements on Sunbury
Road. The intersection of Sunbury Road at Valley Quail Boulevard South was not in
coordination (running free) with the other three signals prior to this study. With the
coordination of all four traffic signals in the study area and the retiming of the
intersection timings and offsets, significant improvements were realized in the reduction
of signal delay and travel times, which also results in fuel savings and reduction of
emissions as well.

It is important to recognize that proper signal system operation is highly dependent on
maintenance of communication and detection equipment. Faulty detection can lead to
unnecessary delays, especially on the main street (Sunbury Road). It is recommended that the
system equipment is checked for proper operation every 90 days to 180 days.

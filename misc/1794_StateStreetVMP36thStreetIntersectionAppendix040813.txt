Introduction
To support the State Street-VMP-36th Street Intersection Concept Design process, a detailed intersection
traffic analysis was conducted for existing (2011/2012) and forecasted (2035) traffic volumes.

The intersection analysis was conducted using Synchro 7 and VISSIM 5.10 software. Synchro was used
to evaluate the existing intersection (no-build) operations and calculate turn lane storage lengths;
however, Synchro cannot accurately model some innovative intersection configurations, such as a
continuous flow intersection. VISSIM, a microscopic traffic modeling program, was used to provide
relative comparisons between the innovative intersection alternatives.

The intersection analysis included the following evaluations:
    Existing intersection (No-Build)
           o Existing (2011/2012) AM, midday and PM peak hour (Synchro)
    Ten preliminary intersection alternatives
           o Existing (2011) PM peak hour (VISSIM)
    Five final intersection alternatives
           o 2035 minimum storage lengths
           o 2035 PM peak hour (VISSIM)
           o Benefit/cost ratio

As described in the Concept Report Narrative, the initial 22 intersection alternatives were reduced to the
following ten preliminary intersection alternatives by the Project Team based on a screening-level
qualitative and fatal-flaw analysis:
      1 ­ No-Build
      3 ­ Conventional
      9 ­ Partial Median U-Turn (MUT)
      13 ­ Full Couplet
      14 ­ Partial Couplet
      15 ­ Quadrant 1 ­ NBLT and SBLT on Anderson and Mercer
      18 ­ Quadrant 4 ­ NBLT and SBTH on Anderson
      19 ­ Quadrant 5 ­ Quadrant 1 and Partial MUT
      20 ­ Partial CFI and Partial MUT
      22 ­ Single Point Urban Interchange

The ten preliminary alternatives were reduced to the following five final alternatives by the Project Team
based on the traffic analysis results, costs and refined qualitative evaluations:
    1 ­ No-Build
    3 ­ Conventional
    9 ­ Partial Median U-Turn (MUT)
    14 ­ Partial Couplet
    20 ­ Partial CFI and Partial MUT

Existing Conditions
Existing Data Collection
Existing 24-hour directional approach vehicle counts, peak hour intersection turning movement counts
and pedestrian and bicycle counts were provided by ACHD. The 24-hour directional approach traffic, AM
peak hour traffic and midday peak hour traffic were collected in May 2012, and the PM peak hour traffic
was collected in July 2011. The pedestrian and bicycle counts were collected in June 2012. Vehicle
speed and classification data was collected by L2 Data collection in May 2012.

Existing (2011/2012) Intersection Operations
The existing AM, midday and PM peak hour intersection turning movement volumes were evaluated with
the existing lane configurations, existing cycle lengths, existing timing splits, existing peak hour factors,
existing heavy vehicle percentages, and protected left-turn phasing at all approaches. A saturation flow
rate of 1,800 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) was used for the AM and midday peak hours and a
saturation flow rate of 1,850 vphpl was used for the PM peak hour per the Synchro models provided by
ACHD. Table 1 summarizes the existing peak hour volumes, intersection lane configuration and
intersection operations.

Analysis Software
Both Synchro 7 and VISSIM 5.10 were required for the traffic analysis. Synchro is a macroscopic
evaluation tool used to evaluate the conventional intersection and, with limited results, evaluate the
innovative intersection alternatives. Synchro's capabilities limit traffic evaluations to isolated
intersections; therefore, a system of intersections that comprise an innovative intersection network cannot
be evaluated as one intersection. In order to evaluate an innovative intersection as a whole, VISSIM was
used for the analysis. VISSIM is a microscopic evaluation tool capable of modeling innovative
intersections with unique lane and signal phasing configurations. It is also a multi-modal modeling
software that allows the user to define different lane utilizations for multiple vehicle types (passenger
cars, heavy vehicles, transit, HOV, etc.).

Synchro 7
Synchro 7 uses the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methods to calculate intersection
performance. The intersection performance is a function of signal timing parameters, turn and through
lanes, traffic volumes and the saturation flow rate, which is a measure of driver aggressiveness.

Although Synchro allows for complex signal timing scenarios with multi-leg intersections, it is limited to
evaluating standard intersection geometry. In the case of a continuous flow intersection (CFI), the left-
turning vehicles are positioned to the left of the opposing through traffic at the main intersection, which
violates Synchro's geometric standards. Therefore, the CFI's operations can only be estimated in
Synchro by placing four additional signalized intersections immediately adjacent to the main intersection,
which introduces unnecessary delay.

Synchro is also not capable of evaluating differing modes or distributing traffic to lanes disproportionately.
Lane utilization factors can be modified to provide only a rough estimate of intersection operations when
disproportionate lane use exists, for example, with transit or HOV lanes.

VISSIM 5.10
VISSIM is a microsimulation program that evaluates intersection and network performance. It is a link-
based modeling software (as opposed to the traditional node-and-link-based modeling software such as
Synchro) that allows an unlimited amount of geometric and operational configurations to be evaluated.
VISSIM also allows the user to define unique mode splits on individual lanes, thereby allowing for the
evaluation of transit and HOV lanes.

Microsimulation models require calibration to replicate local driver behavior. In VISSIM, a saturation flow
rate setting does not exist. The driver behavior parameters can be modified; however, this is not
recommended for calibration purposes. Rather, all models are required to have representative `vehicle
distributions' and `speed distributions' that are specific to the corridor under analysis. The `look-ahead
distance' can also be modified to influence how far ahead traffic will begin to position themselves in the
correct lane to make a turn at an intersection. This provides a `calibration' that is sufficient for concept-
level and future-year traffic analysis.

Vehicle distribution and speed distribution data was collected on the State Street, Veterans Memorial
Parkway and 36th Street approaches. Speed distributions affect driver behavior because each vehicle is
assigned a percentile upon entering the network and will subsequently try to achieve its maximum speed
associated with the speed distribution assigned to the link segment, resulting in a variation of vehicle
speeds within the network. Vehicle distributions affect traffic operations because each vehicle type
(passenger car, van, SUV, WB-60, etc.) is assigned a length and default acceleration/deceleration profile
that is unique for every vehicle type, resulting in unique queuing and queue discharge patterns. Table 3
below summarizes the existing vehicle distributions that were used in VISSIM. Existing speed distribution
data is attached.

VISSIM Modeling
The basic intersection networks and coordinated signal timing parameters were developed in Synchro,
imported into VISSIM and modified where necessary. The modeled intersection network encompassed a
radius of approximately ¼-mile. Results from six one-hour simulations were averaged to determine the
intersection network measures of effectiveness (MOEs). Because the model was not fully-calibrated with
field measured travel time, queue and speed data, the reported MOEs should only be used for relative
comparisons between alternatives.

The HOV/transit lane on State Street was modeled in VISSIM; however, transit routes and stops were not
modeled because their locations were not established prior to the traffic analysis. Based on discussions
with COMPASS, the existing non-single occupancy vehicle (non-SOV) rate is approximately 16 percent
and is expected to remain relatively constant in the future. The non-SOV rate was applied to the existing
and forecasted peak hour traffic volumes on State Street, with a maximum volume of 300 vehicles per
hour on the HOV/transit, which is the estimated maximum utilization of the HOV/transit lane identified by
the State Street TTOP.

Driveways and public street intersections were not modeled.

The following are the key differences between the VISSIM evaluation of the ten preliminary intersection
alternatives and five final intersection alternatives:
     Preliminary Intersection Alternatives
            o Existing (2011) PM peak hour volumes were evaluated.
            o Turn lane storage lengths were assumed to be the same as existing or 300 feet,
               whichever was larger.
     Final Intersection Alternatives
            o Forecasted (2035) PM peak hour volumes were evaluated.
            o Turn lane storage lengths were adjusted to the length needed to accommodate forecasted
               (2035) peak hour traffic.
            o Pedestrian volumes and signal phases at the primary intersection were added.
            o A northbound lane trap at Anderson Street was added to more accurately model
               northbound through lane utilization.
            o For the alternatives with three northbound left-turn lanes (Alternatives 3, 9 and 14), the
               third northbound lane was modeled as an HOV/transit lane as directed by the Project
               Team.

Forecasted (2035) Traffic
Travel Demand Forecasts
ACHD provided average daily and peak hour travel demand model traffic forecasts for years 2015, 2020,
2030, and 2035. The ACHD model is identical to the COMPASS model, which follows the 2035
Communities in Motion (CIM), with the exception of some roadway network modifications. State Street
from 23rd Street to Glenwood Street is widened by 2020 from five lanes to seven lanes. The additional
through lanes on State Street are modeled with approximately half the capacity of the existing lanes to
reflect the utilization rate of the HOV/transit lane. Chinden Boulevard is widened to seven lanes and the
36th Street extension from Hill Road to Bogus Basin Road is included.

Traffic Growth
A review of the forecasted average daily traffic (ADT) demand yielded several unexpected results. The
ADT on 36th Street increases significantly (36 percent) between 2012 and 2015, and is approaching five-
lane roadway thresholds by 2035 (Florida DOT planning-level thresholds); however, the existing three-
lane roadway is not planned to be widening in the future and remains at three lanes in the model. In
addition, the ADT on State Street increases more rapidly between 2015 and 2020 compared to other
approaches (as expected by widening to seven lanes); however, the ADT decreases on State Street
between 2020 and 2030 which is unexpected. Because of the unexpected forecasted ADTs, the
estimated 2035 peak hour intersection turning movement traffic was not consistent with the existing and
historic traffic trends at the intersection.

A review of the historic intersection turning movement traffic showed that growth at the intersection has
remained very small over the past decade and turning movement percentages have remained relatively
stable. Table 5 summarizes the annual and total growth rates for the historical traffic volumes and the
forecasted traffic volumes.

Intersection Turning Movement Traffic
Although the historic traffic growth from 1999 to 2011 has been relatively small, the intersection is
expected to experience growth by 2035 due to capacity improvements on State Street and increasing
forecasted demographics. An increase in total traffic volume of approximately 31.4 percent at the
intersection was proposed to estimate the forecasted design year volume. As shown in Table 5, this
increase is the approximate increase in traffic from existing 2011 traffic counts to the 2035 forecasted

Final Intersection Alternatives
Minimum Turn Lane Storage Lengths
The right-turn and left-turn lane storage lengths were calculated with the forecasted (2035) AM and PM
peak hour turning movement volumes. Using the AASHTO method for signalized intersections, cycle
lengths were assumed and the traffic signal timing splits were calculated in Synchro to estimate the
number of right-turn and left-turn arrivals during the red portions of the cycle. The number of arrivals was
multiplied by an average vehicle spacing of 25 feet to calculate the minimum right-turn and left-turn lane
storage lengths.

The storage lengths were incorporated into the horizontal concept designs and the VISSIM models of the
final intersection alternatives.

Benefit/Cost Ratio
The benefit/cost ratio was calculated to compare the vehicle operations benefits to the project costs. The
benefits consist of savings due to reduced delay and fuel consumption compared to Alternative 1, No-
Build, which is assumed to have a benefit of zero.

The delay cost of $11.40 per hour was based on the Idaho Transportation Department's road user cost
for automobiles. It does not include delay costs for commercial vehicles. The fuel cost was estimated at
$3.82 per gallon, which was the average price per gallon in Idaho at the time of the analysis as reported
by AAA.

For the calculation, the delay and fuel savings were assumed to occur for a total of seven hours during
the weekday, for 250 work days during the year, over a 20-year design life. The 2035 PM peak hour
MOEs were scaled down for the AM and midday by factors equivalent to the existing differences in total
peak hour traffic volumes.

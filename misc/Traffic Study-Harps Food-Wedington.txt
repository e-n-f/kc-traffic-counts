EXECUTIVE   Peters & Associates Engineers, Inc. conducted an assessment of
SUMMARY     traffic conditions in the vicinity of an existing Harps Food Store
            on the north side of Wedington Drive (Highway 16) at Tahoe
            Place, just east of Colorado Drive and just west of Steamboat
            Drive in Fayetteville, Arkansas. As a part of this study, traffic sig-
            nal warrants analysis has been conducted for the intersections of
            Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place and Wedington Drive and
            Colorado Drive. Also addressed are the effects of a traffic signal
            at either of these two intersections to the adjacent signalized inter-
            sections along Wedington Drive.

            As requested by the City of Fayetteville, this study includes a co-
            ordinated signal plan for signals along Wedington Drive at Rupple
            Road, Salem Road, Colorado Drive or Tahoe Place, Shiloh Drive
            and the I-540 southbound ramps. As a part of this traffic study,
            coordinated traffic signal timing plans were developed for the AM
            peak hour and PM peak hour projected traffic conditions in the
            study area. These timing plans include the geometric improve-
            ments and traffic signal modifications required and approved by
            the City of Fayetteville at Wedington Drive and Salem Road and
            the geometric improvements and traffic signal modifications under
            construction by AHTD at Wedington Drive and Shiloh Road and
            Wedington Drive and I-540 Southbound Ramps.

            The AM and PM capacity and level of service (LOS) at each of
            these intersections was also analyzed. The study also addresses
            projected vehicle queues to determine if left-turn vehicle storage
            lane lengths will be sufficient. The capacity and LOS calculations
            included in this traffic study have been based on actual traffic
            counts and the additional traffic for build-out of approved develop-
            ments in the area. Pedestrians crossing Wedington were observed
            and pedestrian volumes are depicted on the vehicle turning move-
            ment counts and are discussed in the study.

            Findings of this study are summarized as follows:

            ·   It was found that traffic signal warrants are currently met for
                the intersection of Wedington Drive at Colorado Drive with
                existing traffic volumes. Furthermore, if a traffic signal is in-

                                                                    Page 1
    stalled at Colorado Drive, there would likely be some diversion
    of southbound left-turn traffic from Tahoe Place and from Sa-
    lem Road that would contribute to the southbound volumes on
    Colorado Drive at Wedington Drive. It was found that traffic
    signal warrants are also projected to be met for the intersection
    of Wedington Drive at Colorado Drive with existing plus di-
    verted traffic volumes from vicinity streets if a traffic signal is
    installed.

·   It was found that traffic signal warrants are not currently met
    for the intersection of Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place with
    existing traffic volumes. However, if a traffic signal is in-
    stalled at Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place, there would likely
    be some diversion of southbound left-turn traffic from Colo-
    rado Drive and from Steamboat Drive that would contribute to
    the southbound volumes on Tahoe Place at Wedington Drive. It
    was found that traffic signal warrants are projected to be met
    for the intersection of Wedington Drive at Tahoe Place with
    existing plus diverted traffic volumes from vicinity streets if a
    traffic signal is installed.

·   The intersections of Wedington Drive and Salem Road and
    Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive are approximately 500
    feet apart. It was found that if a traffic signal is installed at
    Colorado Drive, the projected westbound left-turn vehicle
    queue length at Salem Road does not conflict with the east-
    bound left-turn vehicle queue length at Colorado Drive. Fur-
    thermore, it was found that if a traffic signal is installed Tahoe
    Place, the westbound left-turn vehicle queue length at Salem
    Road does not conflict with the eastbound vehicle queue length
    at Tahoe Place. An eastbound directional left-turn lane with
    170 feet of storage is recommended to be re-marked within the
    existing bi-directional center left-turn lane for Wedington
    Drive at either Colorado Drive or Tahoe Place.

·   Even with the current improvements being constructed at Shi-
    loh Drive and the I-540 southbound ramps, some vehicle
    movements at the study intersections are expected to be capac-
    ity constrained during the AM and PM peak hours once full

                                                       Page 2
    development occurs. However, except at the at the intersec-
    tions of Wedington Drive and Shiloh Drive and Wedington
    Drive and the I-540 southbound ramps, overall intersection
    LOS is projected to be "D" or better.

Recommendations of this study are summarized as follows:

·   Although both the intersection of Wedington Drive and Colo-
    rado Drive and Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place are pro-
    jected to meet traffic signal warrants, it is recommended that a
    fully actuated traffic signal be installed at the intersection of
    Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive because it has higher
    traffic volume and the capacity to serve a greater traffic vol-
    ume than the intersection of Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place
    and it has the potential of serving a broader area north of Wed-
    ington Drive. The Colorado Drive intersection meets traffic
    signal warrants for both existing and projected traffic condi-
    tions. A Performance Index comparison also shows better traf-
    fic operation in the Wedington Drive corridor with a traffic
    signal at Colorado Drive when compared to conditions with a
    traffic signal at Tahoe Place.

·   The recommended traffic signal at the intersection of Weding-
    ton Drive and Colorado Drive should have provisions to be
    coordinated with the existing interconnected traffic signal sys-
    tem along Wedington Drive.

·   Traffic signal control on Wedington Drive must conform to the
    City of Fayetteville and AHTD standards and will require ap-
    proval by the City and AHTD.

INTRODUCTION   Peters & Associates Engineers, Inc. conducted an assessment of traf-
               fic conditions in the vicinity of an existing Harps Food Store on the
               north side of Wedington Drive (Highway 16) at Tahoe Place, just east
               of Colorado Drive and just west of Steamboat Drive in Fayetteville,
               Arkansas. As a part of this study, traffic signal warrants analysis has
               been conducted for the intersection of Wedington Drive and Tahoe
               Place and Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive. Also addressed are

               fic conditions in the vicinity of an existing Harps Food Store on the
               north side of Wedington Drive (Highway 16) at Tahoe Place, just east
               of Colorado Drive and just west of Steamboat Drive in Fayetteville,
               Arkansas. As a part of this study, traffic signal warrants analysis has
               been conducted for the intersections of Wedington Drive and Tahoe
               Place and Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive. Also addressed are
               the effects of a traffic signal at either of these two intersections to the
               adjacent signalized intersections along Wedington Drive.

               As requested by the City of Fayetteville, this study includes a coordi-
               nated signal plan for signals along Wedington Drive at Rupple Road,
               Salem Road, Colorado Drive or Tahoe Place, Shiloh Drive and the I-
               540 southbound ramps. As a part of this traffic study, coordinated
               traffic signal timing plans were developed for the AM peak hour and
               PM peak hour projected traffic conditions in the study area. These
               timing plans include the geometric improvements and traffic signal
               modifications required and approved by the City of Fayetteville at
               Wedington Drive and Salem Road and the geometric improvements
               and traffic signal modifications under construction by AHTD at Wed-
               ington Drive and Shiloh Road and Wedington Drive and I-540
               Southbound Ramps.

               The AM and PM capacity and level of service (LOS) at each of these
               intersections was also analyzed. The study also addresses projected
               vehicle queues to determine if left-turn vehicle storage lane lengths
               will be sufficient. The capacity and LOS calculations included in this
               traffic study have been based on actual traffic counts and the addi-
               tional traffic for build-out of approved developments in the

                                                                        Page 4
area. Pedestrians crossing Wedington were observed and pedestrian
volumes are depicted on the vehicle turning movement counts and
are discussed in the study.

This is a report of methodology and findings relating to a traffic en-
gineering study undertaken to:

·   Evaluate existing traffic conditions in the vicinity of the site.

·   Determine traffic volumes likely to be diverted from the adjacent
    intersections to the intersection of Wedington Drive and Tahoe
    Place if it is traffic signal controlled and to the intersection of
    Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive if it is traffic signal con-
    trolled.

·   Ascertain projected traffic operating conditions at the adjacent
    intersections along Wedington Drive to include re-distributed
    existing traffic volumes (if traffic signal control at Tahoe Place
    or Colorado Drive) and build-out of approved developments in
    the area.

·   Identify the effects on traffic operations resulting from redistrib-
    uted existing traffic in combination with generated traffic associ-
    ated with the build-out of approved developments in the area.

·   Evaluate existing and planned lane geometry at the study inter-
    sections if traffic signal control is installed at Wedington Drive
    and Tahoe Place or Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive.

In the following sections of this report there are presented traffic
data, study methods, findings and recommendations of this traffic
engineering investigation. The traffic engineering study is technical
in nature. Analysis techniques employed are those most commonly
used in the traffic engineering profession for traffic impact analysis.
Certain data and calculations relative to traffic operational analysis
are referenced in the report. Complete calculations and data are in-
cluded in the Appendix of the report.

TRAFFIC VOLUME   Once projected traffic was estimated for the build-out of the
ASSIGNMENTS      approved developments in the area, directional distributions
                 were made to reflect projected left-turns, right-turns and thru
                 vehicle movements at the study intersections.

                 Existing traffic volumes have been combined with the build-
                 out of the approved developments in the area projected traf-
                 fic volumes and the results are depicted on Figure 3,
                 "Projected Traffic Volumes If Traffic Signal Control at
                 Colorado Drive - AM and PM Peak Hours," and Figure 4,
                 "Projected Traffic Volumes If Traffic Signal Control at Ta-
                 hoe Place - AM and PM Peak Hours." Traffic volumes
                 shown on Figure 3 and Figure 4 are the values used in traffic
                 capacity and level of service (LOS) calculations conducted
                 as a part of this study. The effect of existing background
                 traffic (i.e. the adjacent street non-site traffic which exists)
                 and projected traffic associated with build-out of the ap-
                 proved developments in the area has thus been accounted for
                 in this analysis.

                 Pedestrian traffic counts were made during the peak hour
                 turning movement counts. As shown on the detailed count
                 data in the Appendix, pedestrian crossings are extremely low
                 at the study intersections during the AM and PM peak hours
                 and make negligible difference in the capacity and LOS cal-
                 culations.

CAPACITY and                          Generally, the "capacity" of a street is a measure of its
LEVEL OF SERVICE                      ability to accommodate a certain magnitude of moving
                                      vehicles. It is a rate as opposed to a quantity, measured in
                                      terms of vehicles per hour. More specifically, street ca-
                                      pacity refers to the maximum number of vehicles that a
                                      street element (e.g. an intersection) can be expected to
                                      accommodate in a given time period under the prevailing
                                      roadway and traffic conditions.

                                      Level of Service (LOS) ordinarily has a letter designation
                                      relative to the various operating characteristics, ranging
                                      from "A" as the highest quality to "F" representing con-
                                      siderable delay. The various Levels of Service are gener-
                                      ally described as follows:

  A                <10
                                        independently to one another. There is little or no delay.

                                        This LOS is slightly restrictive condition with short traffic delays.

                                        The presense of other vehicles is noticable by the driver.

  C           >20 and <35               service life of the facility. LOS C results from an average delay.
                                        The traffic flow is stable, but more restrictive.
                                        This LOS is noticeably more restrictive, and there are long
  D           >35 and <55               traffic delays. This LOS results in poor driver comfort and in
                                        greater accident probabilities.
                                        At this LOS, the intersection is operating at capacity with little or
  E           >55 and <80               no gaps. There are very long traffic delays and unstable
                                        intersection operation.

                                        At this LOS, there are more vehicles arriving at the approach
  F                >80
                                        than can be discharged. Extreme delays will be encountered.

                   LOS values that are reported for signalized intersections are
                       based on overall control delay for the intersection.

As indicated in Tables 5 and 6, even with the current im-
provements being constructed at Shiloh Drive and the I-540
southbound ramps, some vehicle movements at the study
intersections are expected to be capacity constrained during
the AM and PM peak hours once full development occurs.
However, except at the at the intersection of Wedington
Drive and Shiloh Drive and Wedington Drive and the I-540
southbound ramps, overall intersection LOS is "D" or better.

As a part of this study, for projected traffic conditions, queue
length analysis was conducted for the study intersections.
The intersections of Wedington Drive and Salem Road and
Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive are approximately 500
feet apart. It was found that if a traffic signal is installed at
Colorado Drive, the projected westbound left-turn vehicle
queue length at Salem Road (95th percentile queue length
calculates to 139 feet during the AM peak hour and 271 feet
during the PM peak hour) does not conflict with the east-
bound left-turn vehicle queue length at Colorado Drive (95th
percentile queue length calculates to approximately one ve-
hicle during the AM peak hour and 167 feet during the PM
peak hour with traffic signal control at Colorado Drive).
Furthermore, it was found that if a traffic signal is installed
Tahoe Place, the projected westbound left-turn vehicle queue
length at Salem Road does not conflict with the eastbound
vehicle queue length at Tahoe Place (95th percentile queue
length calculates to approximately one vehicle during the
AM peak hour and 101 feet during the PM peak hour with
traffic signal control at Tahoe Place). An eastbound direc-
tional left-turn lane with 170 feet of storage is recommended
to be re-marked within the existing bi-directional center left-
turn lane for Wedington Drive at either Colorado Drive or
Tahoe Place. The queue length analysis is included in the
Capacity and Level of Service section in the Appendix for
reference.

As requested by the City of Fayetteville, this study includes
a coordinated signal plan for signals along Wedington Drive
at Rupple Road, Salem Road, Colorado Drive or Tahoe
Place, Shiloh Drive and the I-540 southbound ramps. As a
part of this traffic study, coordinated traffic signal timing
plans were developed (using SYNCHRO, Version 6) for the
AM peak hour and PM peak hour projected traffic condi-
tions in the study area. These timing plans include the geo-
metric improvements and traffic signal modifications re-
quired and approved by the City of Fayetteville at Weding-
ton Drive and Salem Road and the geometric improvements
and traffic signal modifications under construction by
AHTD at Wedington Drive and Shiloh Road and Wedington
Drive and I-540 Southbound Ramps.

One available method provided by SYNCHRO to measure
the effectiveness of traffic system operation on a coordinated
traffic signal system is to compare the performance index of
one system scenario to another system scenario. The per-
formance index includes several measures of effectiveness
such as, number of stops per vehicle, average delay per vehi-
cle and average vehicle speed. When compared, a smaller
number indicates better relative performance. When the per-
formance indices are compared for a signal system with a
traffic signal constructed at Wedington Drive and Tahoe
Place vs. Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive, the indices
are equal for the AM peak hour. However, for the PM peak,
the scenario with the traffic signal installed at Wedington
Drive and Colorado Drive provides better traffic signal sys-
tem operation.

TRAFFIC SIGNAL      In evaluating the need for a traffic signal, certain established
WARRANTS ANALYSIS   warrants must be examined by a comprehensive investiga-
                    tion of traffic conditions and physical characteristics of the
                    location. The decision to install a traffic signal at a particu-
                    lar location must be evaluated quantitatively relative to these
                    warrants. Satisfaction of conditions for only one of the war-
                    rants, as specified, is required for signalization. These war-
                    rants, as specified in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
                    Devices (MUTCD), are described in detail in the appendix of
                    this report. They are summarized as follows:

                      Warrant One: Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
                      Warrant Two: Four-Hour Vehicular Volume
                      Warrant Three: Peak Hour
                      Warrant Four: Pedestrian Volume
                      Warrant Five: School Crossing
                      Warrant Six: Coordinated Signal System
                      Warrant Seven: Crash Experience
                      Warrant Eight: Roadway Network



                    SIGNAL WARRANTS RESULTS
                    Traffic signal warrants analysis was made for existing traffic
                    conditions and re-distributed existing traffic conditions for
                    the intersection of intersection of Wedington Drive and
                    Colorado Drive and the intersection of Wedington Drive and
                    Tahoe Place.

                    Existing Traffic Conditions
                    It was found that traffic signal warrants are not currently met
                    for the intersection of Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place
                    with existing traffic volumes. Volumes are not currently
                    sufficient at this intersection to satisfy any warrants. Exist-
                    ing traffic conditions traffic signal warrants analysis results
                    for the intersection of Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place are
                    summarized in Table 7, "Traffic Signal Warrants Results -

                    tions."

It was found that traffic signal warrants are currently met for the
intersection of Wedington Drive at Colorado Drive with existing
traffic volumes. Volumes are currently sufficient at this inter-
section to satisfy Warrant 2. Existing traffic conditions traffic
signal warrants analysis results for the intersection of Wedington
Drive at Colorado Drive are summarized in Table 8, "Traffic
Signal Warrants Results - Wedington Drive at Colorado Drive -
Existing Traffic Conditions."

Re-Distributed Existing Traffic Conditions
If a traffic signal is installed at Wedington Drive and Tahoe
Place, there would likely be some diversion of southbound left-
turn traffic from Colorado Drive and from Steamboat Drive that
would contribute to the southbound volumes on Tahoe Place at
Wedington Drive. It was found that traffic signal warrants are
projected to be met for the intersection of Wedington Drive at
Tahoe Place with existing plus diverted traffic volumes from
vicinity streets if a traffic signal is installed. Volumes are pro-
jected to be sufficient at this intersection to satisfy Warrants 1B,
2 and 3 for this condition. The traffic signal warrants analysis
results for this intersection are summarized in Table 9, "Traffic
Signal Warrants Results - Wedington Drive at Tahoe Place - Re-
Distributed Existing Traffic Conditions."

FINDINGS AND      Findings of this study are summarized as follows:
RECOMMENDATIONS
                  ·   It was found that traffic signal warrants are currently met for
                      the intersection of Wedington Drive at Colorado Drive with
                      existing traffic volumes. Furthermore, if a traffic signal is in-
                      stalled at Colorado Drive, there would likely be some diver-
                      sion of southbound left-turn traffic from Tahoe Place and
                      from Salem Road that would contribute to the southbound
                      volumes on Colorado Drive at Wedington Drive. It was found
                      that traffic signal warrants are also projected to be met for the
                      intersection of Wedington Drive at Colorado Drive with exist-
                      ing plus diverted traffic volumes from vicinity streets if a traf-
                      fic signal is installed.

                  ·   It was found that traffic signal warrants are not currently met
                      for the intersection of Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place with
                      existing traffic volumes. However, if a traffic signal is in-
                      stalled at Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place, there would
                      likely be some diversion of southbound left-turn traffic from
                      Colorado Drive and from Steamboat Drive that would con-
                      tribute to the southbound volumes on Tahoe Place at Weding-
                      ton Drive. It was found that traffic signal warrants are pro-
                      jected to be met for the intersection of Wedington Drive at
                      Tahoe Place with existing plus diverted traffic volumes from
                      vicinity streets if a traffic signal is installed.

                  ·   The intersections of Wedington Drive and Salem Road and
                      Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive are approximately 500
                      feet apart. It was found that if a traffic signal is installed at
                      Colorado Drive, the projected westbound left-turn vehicle
                      queue length at Salem Road does not conflict with the east-
                      bound left-turn vehicle queue length at Colorado Drive. Fur-
                      thermore, it was found that if a traffic signal is installed Ta-
                      hoe Place, the westbound left-turn vehicle queue length at
                      Salem Road does not conflict with the eastbound vehicle
                      queue length at Tahoe Place. An eastbound directional left-
                      turn lane with 170 feet of storage is recommended to be re-
                      marked within the existing bi-directional center left-turn lane
                      for Wedington Drive at either Colorado Drive or Tahoe Place.

                                                                        Page 31
·   Even with the current improvements being constructed at
    Shiloh Drive and the I-540 southbound ramps, some vehicle
    movements at the study intersections are expected to be ca-
    pacity constrained during the AM and PM peak hours once
    full development occurs. However, except at the at the in-
    tersections of Wedington Drive and Shiloh Drive and Wed-
    ington Drive and the I-540 southbound ramps, overall inter-
    section LOS is projected to be "D" or better.

Recommendations of this study are summarized as follows:

·   Although both the intersection of Wedington Drive and
    Colorado Drive and Wedington Drive and Tahoe Place are
    projected to meet traffic signal warrants, it is recommended
    that a fully actuated traffic signal be installed at the inter-
    section of Wedington Drive and Colorado Drive because it
    has higher traffic volume and the capacity to serve a greater
    traffic volume than the intersection of Wedington Drive and
    Tahoe Place and it has the potential of serving a broader
    area north of Wedington Drive. The Colorado Drive inter-
    section meets traffic signal warrants for both existing and
    projected traffic conditions. A Performance Index compari-
    son also shows better traffic operation in the Wedington
    Drive corridor with a traffic signal at Colorado Drive when
    compared to conditions with a traffic signal at Tahoe Place.

·   The recommended traffic signal at the intersection of Wed-
    ington Drive and Colorado Drive should have provisions to
    be coordinated with the existing interconnected traffic sig-
    nal system along Wedington Drive.

·   Traffic signal control on Wedington Drive must conform to
    the City of Fayetteville and AHTD standards and will re-
    quire approval by the City and AHTD.

INTRODUCTION

Project Background
Situated between Lions Park, Frontier Park, The Avenues neighborhood and Moore Haven
Heights neighborhood, 8th Avenue serves a variety of vital functions within and beyond the
Cheyenne Community. As the host of Cheyenne Frontier Days, Frontier Park attracts a regional
crowd, many of whom are visiting Cheyenne for the first time or only visit Cheyenne for that
event, so their perception of the road will be based on how it functions under its heaviest traffic
loadings. Lions Park is a key community asset that provides a gathering place for Cheyenne
residents and hosts city-wide events like Super Day and Fourth of July, so its visitors see 8th
Avenue as a key access route to an important City amenity. For the two neighborhoods, 8th
Avenue serves as both the northern neighborhood boundary and an important link to the arterial
road system, while at the same time it creates a barrier that residents must cross to get to the
parks.
These multiple functions bring challenges. On the one hand, the day-to-day traffic loadings
from the neighborhood are relatively light ­ ranging from 500 vehicles per day (vpd) near Hynds
to 2,500 vpd near Central - and could easily be accommodated by a typical two-lane collector
street, but during Frontier Days and event days at Lions Park the volume swells to 10,000 vpd
or more, and functions more as an arterial than a collector road. Furthermore, Carey Avenue,
which separates Frontier Park and Lions Park and intersects 8th Avenue at a skew angle,
functions as both a park access road and a bypass route for commuters travelling between
downtown and the north end of town, so the intersection of 8th Avenue and Carey creates both
operational and safety concerns for vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians.
In 2010, representatives of the neighborhood submitted a request to the Cheyenne Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO) through the City's Neighborhood Traffic Management Program
(NTMP) to review conditions on 8th Avenue and develop a set of improvements that would
enhance vehicle operations and improve pedestrian safety both along and across the corridor.
To create the vision for 8th Avenue, the Cheyenne Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)
initiated the 8th Avenue Corridor Plan in 2011. The plan has been a collaborative effort involving
the general public, corridor stakeholders, the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT),
FHWA, and the City of Cheyenne. The plan has sought to listen to public values and concerns
and translate those into a conceptual plan. This project is anchored in the principles established
in PlanCheyenne and the application of those principles to this particular location.

Goal and Objectives
The goal of the 8th Avenue Corridor Plan is to create a set of infrastructure improvements that
would enhance pedestrian and bicycle safety along the corridor, provide safer areas to cross the
roadway, revise the roadway laneage to meet the everyday and event loading needs of the
corridor, and improve the 8th Avenue/Carey Avenue intersection to provide a safer and more
efficient intersection for vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle traffic.




                                                                                             Page 1
To support this goal, the project steering committee identified a series of objectives:
1. Involve the public and stakeholders in the planning process.
2. Address needs of all corridor users and travel modes in the plan.
3. Recommend solutions for existing traffic and pedestrian safety issues.
4. Analyze existing and future multimodal intersection operations at the 8th Avenue/Carey
   Avenue intersection and recommend traffic channelization and/or traffic control
   enhancements.
5. Identify capital and maintenance costs and sources of funding for future improvements.
6. Provide an implementation plan for recommended improvements, including project
   prioritization and phasing methods to provide large or small components to match available
   funding

Study Area
Figure 1 depicts the study area and vicinity. The 8th Avenue corridor is approximately 1 mile
long and extends from Hynds Avenue on the west end to Warren Avenue on the east end.

Planning and Public Involvement Process

Project Governance

The project was supervised by a steering committee comprised of representatives of the
following agencies:
    Cheyenne Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)
    Cheyenne MPO Citizen's Advisory Committee
    Cheyenne Frontier Days
    City of Cheyenne
    Federal Highways Administration
    Wyoming Department of Transportation

The steering committee met three times throughout the project to guide the work of the
consultant team, review project information, discuss public and stakeholder involvement efforts,
and collaborate to make decisions about plan direction and recommendations.

8th Avenue Corridor Plan REPORT, 11-192, 1/25/13
Planning Phases

The project work process generally followed the four phases of PlanCheyenne: Snapshot,
Structure, Shape and Build.
The Snapshot phase captured current characteristics of the 8th Avenue corridor, including traffic
crash history, traffic volumes, intersection traffic operations, and bicycle and pedestrian
conditions. The project team assembled corridor mapping, aerial photography and previous
studies and reports related to the area.
The Structure phase brought a collaborative effort to define the vision for the Corridor Study
area. Information gathered during the Snapshot phase and meetings with the project
Stakeholder group and Steering Committee helped frame the vision.
Development of the plan occurred in the Shape phase. Each of the vision elements in the
Structure phase were formed into a series of policies and strategies to be implemented to
eventually bring about the vision.
The Build phase was used to prioritize corridor strategies and identify action steps toward
implementing the plan over time. Potential sources of project funding are identified in this phase.

Public and Stakeholder Involvement

The public and stakeholder involvement process has extended throughout the project,
supporting each of the four phases. Activities were coordinated with the following groups:
Technical Advisory Committee ­ The project team reached out to Cheyenne Frontier Days,
the Cheyenne Parks and Recreation Department and local residents to form a technical
advisory committee (TAC) of 14 individuals to be involved in the project. The project team
sought input from the group early in the project and met again with the TAC to collaborate on
the shared vision for the corridor. The group will meet again prior to project completion.
Cheyenne Frontier Days ­ To gather additional input and feedback on traffic operations and
circulation needs during Cheyenne Frontier Days (CFD), the project team met twice with CFD
staff and also spent time observing traffic and pedestrian flow before, during and after major
events during Frontier Days. The initial meeting provided the project team with insight into how
parking operations and pedestrian and traffic circulation functioned during Frontier Days, and
helped identify key areas of concern that needed to be addressed in the plan. The site
observations allowed the project team to confirm the issues staff had identified, and identify
opportunities and constraints along the corridor during those periods of heavy vehicle and
pedestrian traffic flow. The final meeting allowed CFD staff an opportunity to review and
comment on the preliminary set of improvements that had been identified for the corridor to
ensure that the preferred alternative for the roadway would not hinder traffic operations during
that event.
General Public ­ The general public consisted of citizens interested in the future of the corridor
who attended the public open houses and made comments on the direction and content of the
plan. A total of three open houses were held for the project.
Table 1 provides a summary of all public, stakeholder, and steering committee activities for the
project and the planning phase supported by each.

CFD Site Observations
(7/28/12)

As shown, a significant outreach effort accompanied the Snapshot phase to capture input about
current corridor conditions and receive comments from citizens, Cheyenne Frontier Days and
agencies. This input helped the stakeholder and steering committee groups craft a corridor
vision at meetings held during the Structure phase.
The Shape phase was supported by an additional TAC meeting and a public open house, where
corridor improvement ideas were presented, discussed and refined.
This draft report will be presented and discussed with individuals, stakeholders and agencies
during the Build phase. Plan content will be revised as needed to address comments received
and provide information needed by decision-makers to implement the plan.

1.0      SNAPSHOT
1.1      Roadway Network
The primary roadway network within the study area is depicted on Figure 2 and can be
described as follows:
8th Avenue ­ 8th Avenue is a collector roadway that extends from Hynds Boulevard to Evans
Avenue. From Hynds Boulevard to Carey Avenue it has a three lane cross-section plus on-
street parking, from Carey Avenue to Central Avenue it has a four lane cross-section plus on-
street parking, and from Central Avenue to Evans it has four lanes, a median, left turn lanes and
on-street parking on the south side of the street. The posted speed limit is 30 mph.
Hynds Boulevard ­ Hynds Boulevard is a two-lane, collector roadway that parallels I-25. From
Pershing Boulevard to 2nd Avenue it is one way northbound only with the left lane serving as an
on-ramp to I-25. North of 2nd Avenue it is a two-way street that serves as the east boundary of
The Avenues neighborhood up to 8th Avenue. North of 8th Avenue it serves as the east
boundary of Frontier Park before turning east and becoming Kennedy Road, where it serves as
the north boundary of both Frontier Park and Lions Park and provides access to Central Avenue
(US 85). The posted speed limit is 20 mph between 2nd and 8th Avenues and 30 mph north of
8th Avenue.
Carey Avenue ­ Carey Avenue is a collector roadway that runs northwest to southeast and
connects Kennedy Road with downtown Cheyenne. From Pershing Boulevard north to 2nd
Avenue, Carey is one way northbound, so commuters using Carey as an alternative route
between the north end and downtown (avoiding Central Avenue), often cut over to Snyder
Avenue at 8th Avenue and continue south on Snyder. The posted speed limit is 30 mph through
the study area.
Central Avenue/Warren Avenue ­ Central Avenue/Warren Avenue is a one-way couplet that
serves as the primary route into downtown from the north. The two couplet roads come
together north of 8th Avenue as Central Avenue, then the road splits at the north end of Lions
Park, with Central Avenue continuing to northwest to provide access to I-25, and Yellowstone
Road turning north to provide access to the neighborhoods at the north end of the metro area.
The posted speed limit is 30 mph south of 8th Avenue and 40 mph north of 8th Avenue.
In addition to the above roadways, The Avenues and Moore Haven Heights neighborhoods,
which extend from Hynds Boulevard to Central Avenue and from 8th Avenue to Pershing
Boulevard, generally consists of a grid roadway network, with each street serving as a local
road that provides access to the properties along that block.

1.2      Current Traffic Conditions
1.2.1    Traffic Volumes
Current traffic volumes in the study area are depicted on Figure 3. Daily traffic counts were
compiled from information available at the Cheyenne MPO www.plancheyenne.org website and
AM and PM peak hour traffic counts were also made available by the Cheyenne MPO. Daily
traffic counts were recorded in the area between 2008 and 2011. Peak hour intersection traffic
counts were conducted at Carey Avenue in 2010. Counts during Cheyenne Frontier Days were
collected in 2008. Traffic count information is included in Appendix A.

8th Avenue Corridor Plan REPORT, 11-192, 1/25/13
As shown, traffic volumes on 8th Avenue under typical weekday conditions ranges from 500
vehicles per day (vpd) east of Hynds Boulevard to 3,300 vpd west of Central Avenue, reflecting
the general traffic flow toward Central/Warren from the neighborhood. Carey Avenue traffic is
approximately 4,800 vpd north of 8th Avenue, while south of 8th Avenue both Carey and Snyder
carry between 2,100 and 2,400 vpd, which reflects through traffic destined for downtown using
both of those roads as a part of their commuter route.
Figure 3 also includes traffic volumes on the road system during Cheyenne Frontier Days, and
indicates that 8th Avenue volumes increase to 10,600 vpd east of Carey Avenue and 9,450 vpd
west of 8th Avenue, and Carey Avenue traffic increases to 6,900 vpd. While these volumes are
much greater than typical weekday traffic, they do remain at a level that is generally within the
capacity of two lane roadways--which, with left turn pockets and traffic signals a key
intersections, can accommodate up to 15,000 vpd.

1.2.2    Daily Traffic Operations
Traffic operations within the study area were evaluated according to techniques documented in
the Highway Capacity Manual, (Transportation Research Board, 2000) using existing traffic
volumes, intersection geometry and signal timing. The signal timing information at each of the
existing signalized intersections was provided by the Wyoming Department of Transportation
(WYDOT). Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure of traffic operational conditions
based on roadway capacity and vehicle delay. LOS is described by a letter designation ranging
from A to F, with LOS A representing almost free-flow travel, while LOS F represents congested
conditions. For signalized intersections, LOS is calculated for the entire intersection while LOS
for unsignalized intersections is calculated for movements which must yield the right-of-way.
The agencies involved in the project each provide standards regarding acceptable intersection
LOS. For traffic impact analyses, the City of Cheyenne and WYDOT both consider LOS C or
better operations to be acceptable, and the City of Cheyenne further specifies a minimum
standard of LOS E for left turns entering the major street at unsignalized intersections.
The results of the intersection LOS analysis are depicted on Figure 3. The analysis was
conducted for typical weekday conditions. During Frontier Days, Cheyenne police department
staff provide manual traffic control at the 8th Avenue/Carey Avenue intersection during the
heaviest traffic loadings before and after events at CFD, so an evaluation of those conditions is
not possible using HCM techniques. As shown, all intersections and movements currently
operate at LOS C or better during both the morning and afternoon peak hours. Level of service
worksheets for existing conditions can be found in Appendix B.
One operational issue noted several times in public meetings was that the eastbound left turn
and the westbound right turn at the 8th Avenue/Warren Avenue intersection conflict with each
other; even though each movement can turn into a separate lane on Warren and therefore can
turn at the same time, drivers often believe that one movement must yield to the other and act
accordingly, thereby increasing delays for both movements.
Travel speed data was also collected on 8th Avenue to assess current compliance with the
posted speed limit. The study indicated that 1 in 4 vehicles exceeded the posted speed limit of
30 mph, and the 85th percentile speed (i.e. the travel speed typically used to set roadway speed
limits) is 38 mph, so it would appear that excessive speed is an issue on the corridor.




                                                                                            Page 9
The most frequently received comment during the public meetings for the project concerned the
8th Avenue/Carey Avenue intersection and the need to install a traffic signal to regulate
movements and improve safety. In response, the MPO conducted vehicle and pedestrian traffic
counts at the intersection, and conducted both a Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) signal warrant analysis and an MUTCD all-way stop warrant analysis to determine if
either of those revisions to the traffic control at the intersection are justified.
Table 2 shows the results of the signal warrant evaluation. As the table indicates, current traffic
conditions fail to satisfy the eight hour, four hour and peak hour volume warrants, the
combination of pedestrian and traffic volume fails to satisfy the pedestrian volume warrant, and
the average number of accidents at the intersection over a five year period is lower than the
threshold that would suggest the need for a signal for safety-based reasons. Based on these
results, it would appear that a traffic signal would not be appropriate for the intersection at this
time.

Table 3 shows the results of the all-way stop warrant evaluation based on current traffic,
pedestrian and bicycle volumes, and past accident history at the intersection. As the table
indicates, current traffic conditions fail to satisfy the volume warrant and the accident history at
the intersection does not indicate a pattern of accidents that would be susceptible to correction
by all-way stop control, so all-way stop control would not be appropriate for the intersection at
this time, either.

1.2.3      Frontier Days Traffic Operations
Traffic operations on 8th Avenue take on a much different form during Cheyenne Frontier Days.
The primary parking lots for general admission patrons are accessed from Carey Avenue, the
VIP and handicapped lots are accessed from 8th Avenue, and staff and participant parking is
located along Hynds Avenue. To minimize traffic conflicts, CFD does not allow access into the
general admission lots from northbound Carey Avenue by installing temporary barriers down the
middle of that road, and instead routes traffic west on 8th Avenue, north on Hynds, east on
Kennedy, then south on Carey, so all lot driveways function as right in/right out accesses. CFD
staff also installs barriers to prohibit left turns at Cribbon, Dey and Dillon Avenue, which
improves the eastbound traffic flow on 8th Avenue in front of the park.
Although the Frontier Park lots provide several thousand parking spaces, demand is such that
the park spaces fill on a regular basis, and as a result many patrons park in The Avenues
neighborhood south of 8th Avenue, where on-street parking is free and many residents allow
patrons to park on their property for a fee. This neighborhood parking results in significant
pedestrian traffic crossing 8th Avenue into the Park, particularly between Carey Avenue and
Cribbon Avenue. The Cheyenne police department provides traffic control at the 8th
Avenue/Carey Avenue intersection during peak periods before and after events at the park to
help moderate the flow of pedestrians, eastbound traffic arriving at CFD on 8th Avenue, and
southbound traffic leaving CFD on Carey Avenue, but many other pedestrians cross 8th Avenue
at midblock locations further to the west, often walking between the slow moving vehicles on
that street. Figure 4 shows how event traffic flow operates on 8th Avenue during CFD and
identifies the typical issues that occur then.

1.3        Traffic Safety
Historic traffic accident records were consulted to develop a picture of the reported crashes that
occurred along 8th Avenue between Hynds Boulevard and Warren Avenue over the five year
time period between 2007 and 2011. A total of 53 crashes were recorded during that time
period, with 23 occurring at the Warren Avenue intersection. Table 4 provides a summary of
these intersections and the crashes reported at each. In addition to the total number of crashes,
a rate per Million Entering Vehicles (MEV) is provided. The crash rate provides a means of
comparing intersection safety performance across the corridor and the region.

As shown, the top crash rate intersection found between 2007 and 2011 was the Carey Avenue
intersection at 0.87 crashes/MEV. A preliminary review of the crash history at that intersection
revealed that five out of the 11 crashes involved northbound or southbound traffic (two
southbound collisions with cross traffic on 8th Avenue and three northbound collisions with cross
traffic). The skewed angle of approach for those movements, plus the presence of a
channelized southbound right turn that has no deceleration lane may be a contributing factor to
the accidents there.

1.3.1      Bicycle / Pedestrian Crashes
A total of four crashes involving a pedestrian or bicycle were reported along the corridor
between 2007 and 2011. One pedestrian crash occurred at the Hynds intersection while the
other three occurred at the Carey intersection (two involved pedestrians and one involved a
bicycle). The three accidents involving pedestrians occurred at night, while the bicycle accident
occurred during the day.


1.4        Transit and Non-motorized Travel Modes
8th Avenue accommodates a healthy demand for travel by modes other than auto, primarily
bicycling and walking. The current state of travel by these modes is described as follows.

1.4.1      Transit
Currently, the Cheyenne Transit Program (CTP) operates a fixed-route and ADA
complementary paratransit services throughout the City of Cheyenne. While no CTP routes
travel along the length of 8th Avenue through the study area, the West Route travels southbound
on Carey Avenue and Snyder Avenue, including a stop at the 8th Avenue/Carey Avenue
intersection, and northbound on Evans Avenue and Warren Avenue, with a stop at 8th
Avenue/Warren Avenue. Additionally, the Northwest route crosses the corridor southbound on
Central Avenue and northbound on Warren Avenue, with stops at both 8th/Central and
8th/Warren. CTP's fixed route and paratransit services operate Monday through Friday, 6:00
a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and Saturdays 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Figure 5 shows the bus routes and
stops.

8th Avenue Corridor Plan Open House, 11-192, 2/5/13
During Cheyenne Frontier Days, shuttle buses transport patrons between the remote parking
lots south of Missile Drive on the west side of I-25 and the Frontier Park main entrance between
Cribbon Avenue and Dey Avenue. These buses enter 8th Avenue from Hynds and travel east to
Dey, where CFD staff stops eastbound traffic on 8th Avenue so the buses can turn left into the
bus turnaround area at the main entrance for drop off and pick up. When the buses are loaded,
staff stops eastbound traffic a second time so the bus can turn right onto 8th Avenue and return
to the remote parking area via Hynds Boulevard.

1.4.2     Bicycle Transportation
As shown on Figure 3, between 50 and 80 cyclists use 8th Avenue and Carey Avenue on a daily
basis, making the study area a popular cycling location. Aside from some trails in Lions Park,
the only dedicated bicycle facility in the study area is the Cheyenne Greenway trail on the east
end of the study area, which travels down the east side of Lions Park, crosses 8th Avenue at
Central, then continues east on the south side of 8th Avenue to Evans, where it turns south ends
at Pershing. The trail consists of a well-defined 10-foot concrete path/sidewalk through the park
and east of Warren, but the sidewalk section between Central and Warren has street light poles
and driveway curb cuts within it that make it less than well-defined.
The Greater Cheyenne Greenways Plan (1992) identifies 8th Avenue, Carey Avenue and
Cribbon Avenue as designated bicycle routes. Currently, none of those roadways include
designated bicycle facilities, however, and the Cheyenne Area On-Street Bicycle and
Greenways Plan Update (2012) gives all three a bike quality score of 2 (out of 4), indicating
each could use enhancements to create a more inviting bicycle environment. The Cheyenne
Area On-Street Bicycle and Greenways Plan Update has identified on-street bicycle lanes for
both Carey Avenue and 8th Avenue, has identified Cribbon Avenue as a bicycle boulevard, and
has identified shared lane markings (a.k.a., sharrows) for Snyder Avenue.
Figure 5 shows the bicycle facilities in the study area.

1.4.3     Pedestrian Travel
As shown on Figure 3, between 70 and 100 pedestrians walk along 8th Avenue and Carey
Avenue on a daily basis, and Lions Park is a popular recreation area for residents living in The
Avenues neighborhood, so pedestrian travel is a key component of travel in the study area.
Sidewalks are available on both sides of 8th Avenue, but the south side sidewalk is narrow
(approximately 3.5 feet wide), and in many places tree roots and soil settlement has created an
uneven walking surface that is in need of repair. The north side sidewalk is 10 feet wide and is
in good condition, but during Cheyenne Frontier Days the section along Frontier Park
experiences heavy pedestrian traffic and could benefit from some additional widening.
Furthermore, at the Carey Avenue intersection, the sidewalks from both directions turn north
onto Carey, but then stop at the pillars that define the entrance to Frontier and Lions Park and
do not continue on the other side of them, leaving pedestrians with no option other than to walk
in the roadway around the pillars, then walk on the grass north of there.




                                                                                          Page 15
While a striped crosswalk across 8th Avenue is provided at Dey Avenue near the Cheyenne
Frontier Days main entrance, there are no other formal pedestrian crossing locations along the
corridor. The NTMP application submitted to the City specifically identified the need for a safe
crossing into Lions Park from the south side of the street, citing the City-wide events that take
place there and the use of the park by residents and visitors to the community many of whom
park in the neighborhood on the south side of 8th Avenue due to the limited parking available in
the park itself. This was also a common comment received in the public meetings for the
project.

1.5        Corridor Design Elements
There are three distinct sections of 8th Avenue with differing physical characteristics that adapt
to the changing context of surrounding land use. Such characteristics include curb-to-curb
width, number of travel lanes, number of private accesses, median type and sidewalk provision.
Table 5 provides a summary of physical characteristics of the three segments.

As shown in Table 5, 8th Avenue is narrower between Hynds and Carey Avenue than between
Carey and Central, and along both sections the south sidewalk is very narrow. Furthermore, the
back of the south sidewalk is at the edge of the right-of-way (ROW) on both segments, so any
widening of that facility would need to occur to the north, into the travel way.
Even without widening the south sidewalk, the 53-foot road width between Hynds and Carey is
only wide enough for two 11-foot travel lanes, a 12-foot center turn lane, an 8-foot parking lane
on the south side and an 11-foot parking lane/lot access lane into Frontier Park, and is not wide
enough for bike lanes in addition to those elements. East of Carey, however, a five-foot
sidewalk would leave 58 feet of curb-to-curb width, which is sufficient for a 12-foot center turn
lane, two 11-foot travel lanes, 5-foot bike lanes in each direction, and 7-foot parking lanes on
both sides of the road.

1.6        Aesthetics
Currently, the 8th Avenue cross-section between Hynds and Central is wide, straight, curb-to-
curb asphalt with attached sidewalks. The 8th Avenue/Carey Avenue intersection includes a
brick wall, historic brick columns, and planter beds on the north side of the intersection but the
vegetation surrounding those features overwhelms and hides them. Between Central and
Warren, 8th Avenue has a median with low-lying bushes, plants and mulch.




                                                                                             Page 16
Since 8th Avenue serves as the primary entry route to Frontier Park and Lions Park, the
technical advisory committee expressed interest in constructing improvements between Central
and Carey that would enhance the aesthetic appeal of the roadway and build upon the natural
environment of Lions Park, as well constructing improvements to the Carey Avenue intersection
that would enhance the brick walls and columns at that location and create a sense of arrival at
the parks.

1.7       Future Conditions
In addition to reviewing existing conditions, the Snapshot phase provided a look at anticipated
future conditions in the corridor in order to identify appropriate long term planning strategies to
be included in the plan. The future evaluation focused on future land use and roadway network,
traffic volume forecasts and traffic operations.

1.7.1     Land Use and Roadway Network
The PlanCheyenne process completed by the Cheyenne MPO in 2006 envisioned the future
roadway network and land use throughout the Cheyenne Metropolitan area. The 8th Avenue
corridor, located as it is just north of the downtown area, is already fully built out. While some
changes in land use are anticipated on the east end of the corridor along Central and Warren ­
most notably the redevelopment of the block between 6th and 7th Avenues into a town center ­
the area in general represents an area of stability and therefore is not anticipated to experience
significant changes in land use or increases in density.

1.7.2     Traffic Forecasts
The PlanCheyenne effort included development of a regional travel demand model for the
Cheyenne area. The model, maintained by WYDOT in the TransCAD software platform,
provides Year 2030 traffic forecasts based on the land use assumptions included in
PlanCheyenne. The Cheyenne MPO requested that traffic analyses in this corridor plan be
based upon forecasted Year 2035 traffic conditions, an approximate 23-year planning horizon
relative to current conditions.
Forecasts for the corridor from the travel demand model indicate that traffic volumes are
anticipated to grow by 1.2 percent per year until 2035, a growth rate that is consistent with past
growth in the area. Figure 6 presents the 2035 daily traffic volume forecasts for the study area.
As shown, on a daily basis traffic volumes on 8th Avenue range from 700 vpd east of Hynds to
4,400 vpd west of Central, while Carey Avenue traffic ranges from 2,300 vpd south of 8th
Avenue to 6,500 vpd north of 8th Avenue. During Frontier Days and other event conditions,
traffic on 8th Avenue ranges from 10,000 to 11,200 vpd. All of these traffic forecasts are within
the 15,000 vpd capacity of a two-lane roadway with a center left turn lane.

1.7.3    Traffic Operations
Traffic operations were evaluated at the 8th/Carey, 8th Central and 8th/Warren intersections
under 2035 AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions. The results of the evaluation are shown on
Figure 6. As shown, all movements at the unsignalized 8th/Carey intersection would operate at
LOS C or better during peak hours, the 8th/Central intersection would operate at LOS A during
both peak hours, and the 8th/Warren intersection would operate at LOS B in the morning and
LOS D in the afternoon. The primary issue in the afternoon at 8th/Warren is the capacity
constraints created by the conflicting eastbound left turn and westbound right turn movements;
volumes are high enough for both movements that the westbound right turn operates at LOS F.
Converting the eastbound left turn to a protected only movement and striping the westbound
approach for a though lane, a shared through/right turn lane and a right turn lane would address
the left turn issue and improve operations there to LOS C.
At the 8th/Carey intersection, although all movements operate at adequate levels of service,
concerns have been expressed about the vehicle-pedestrian conflict created by the southbound
right turn pocket, the confusing alignment of the southbound through lane and left turn lane, the
angle of vehicles making a northbound right turn, and the confusion created by the outside
westbound lane becoming a right turn lane at the intersection. To address these concerns, the
intersection was analyzed with a more compressed geometry that consisted of a left turn lane
and a shared through/right turn lane on both 8th Avenue approaches and a single
left/through/right lane on both Carey Avenue approaches. With this geometry, all movements
would continue to operate at LOS C or better during both peak periods.

1.8      Key Planning Considerations
In summary of the Snapshot phase, key planning considerations for the 8th Avenue Corridor are
provided on Figure 7.

8th Avenue Corridor Plan REPORT, 11-192, 1/25/13
2.0        STRUCTURE
The findings of the Snapshot phase provided a foundation for the project team to develop the
framework for a shared corridor vision in cooperation with the project steering committee and
stakeholder group. The groups arrived at a shared corridor vision, which is summarized in this
section in four components: Transit and Non-motorized Transportation; Traffic Safety and
Operations; Beautification; and Implementation.

2.1        Transit and Non-Motorized Transportation
       Ensure adequate and safe pedestrian crossings of 8th Avenue to both Frontier Park and
       Lions Park.
       Provide a safe, accessible and continuous connection along the entire length of the
       corridor with sufficient width to accommodate pedestrian demand.
       Provide sufficient sidewalk width along Frontier Park to accommodate high pedestrian
       traffic volumes during Cheyenne Frontier Days.
       Enhance the greenway system connections between Lions Park and Evans Avenue.
2.2        Traffic Safety & Operations
       Improve the safety and efficiency of traffic movements along 8th Avenue.
       Build a roadway cross section that enhances travel efficiency on a daily basis, yet
       maintains adequate capacity and functionality during Cheyenne Frontier Days and
       during events at Lions Park.
       Construct improvements that help moderate the speed on 8th Avenue to conform to the
       30 mph speed limit.
       Provide peak hour intersection operations at LOS D as a minimum level of service and
       LOS C desired through the Year 2035.
       Provide street lighting where appropriate.
2.3        Beautification
       Enhance the roadway environment within the right-of-way to complement the
       surrounding environment.
       Enhance the gateway features at the Carey Avenue intersection to create a sense of
       arrival to Frontier Park and Lions Park.
       Create a corridor that the surrounding neighborhoods and businesses take pride in.
       Develop strategies for maintenance of public areas.
2.4        Implementation
       Preserve the ability to implement various improvement elements as funding becomes
       available.
       Provide a sustainable and well-maintained streetscape for many years.
       Develop the corridor in a fiscally responsible manner.



                                                                                         Page 21
3.0        SHAPE
The Shape phase adds to the shared corridor vision by recommending strategies and tools that
may be applied to the corridor to fulfill the elements of the vision. Strategies and tools are
identified in three primary areas; Transit and Non-motorized Travel, Traffic Safety and
Operations, and Beautification.

3.1        Transit and Non-motorized Travel
Transit and non-motorized travel strategies and tools are summarized in the following sections.
Table 6 describes strategies and tools to be used at the network level.

          Strategy/Tool                                    Example
Enhance Sidewalks: As stated
in the Cheyenne Metropolitan
Area Pedestrian Plan (2010),
"Sidewalks are the most
fundamental element of the
walking network, as they
provide an area for pedestrian
travel that is separated from
vehicle traffic." Widening the
sidewalks along 8th Avenue to
better accommodate pedestrian
demands will improve
pedestrian safety and enhance
pedestrian travel through the
corridor.
Incorporate the on-street
bicycle network plans: Adding
bike lanes to 8th Avenue and
buffered bike lanes (see photo)
to Carey Avenue has been
identified in the Cheyenne Area
On-Street Bicycle Plan and
Greenway Plan Update (June
2012).

Table 7 identifies strategies and tools specifically targeted toward improving pedestrian
crossings of 8th Avenue.

               Strategy/Tool                                    Example
Improve Visibility at Crossings
High-visibility crosswalks: High
visibility crosswalks have the potential
to improve driver awareness of
pedestrians, as well as increasing use
of the crosswalk by pedestrians, which
would be beneficial for the Greenways
trail crossings at Central and Warren.
A number of treatments may be used
to increase visibility, including colors
(see photo), textured pavement, skip
striping, and in-roadway warning
lights.


Provide Luminaires: Intersection
lighting may be used to illuminate
pedestrian paths and increase visibility
at night. (see photo).




Provide signage and flashing lights
at key crossings: Providing a rapid
rectangular flashing beacon at key
unsignalized intersection crossings will
improve pedestrian safety and enforce
that vehicles must yield to
pedestrians.




                                                                                            Page 23
              Strategy/Tool                  Example
Provide pedestrian refuge islands
at key crossings. Providing a
pedestrian refuge island in the median
allows pedestrians to cross one
direction of traffic and safely wait for a
gap in traffic in the other direction
before completing their crossing




Enhance Street Corners
Provide corner refuge area: Provide
an adequate refuge area for
pedestrians to wait before crossing the
intersection. This could be either
paved or striped

3.2        Traffic Safety and Operations
The project team developed a series of strategies and tools for addressing traffic safety and
operations based on the issues identified in the Snapshot phase. Table 8 outlines strategies
and tools for increasing roadway and improving intersection operations.
Table 8.       Roadway and Intersection Operations ­ Strategies and Tools
               Strategy/Tool                             Description/Example
Intersection Enhancements:
Intersection enhancements can
significantly improve traffic operations at
the 8th/Carey Intersection. Such
enhancements may consist of reducing
approach laneage at the intersection,
correcting geometric and lane alignment
deficiencies, closing Reed Avenue and
possible signalization of the intersection.




Lane Reduction on 8th Avenue:
Reducing the cross-section of 8th Avenue
from four lanes to three between Central
and Carey would provide sufficient
capacity for daily and event traffic
demands, enable left turn pockets to be
constructed to improve safety for
vehicles turning into the neighborhood,
potentially reduce travel speed on that
section, and enable the construction of
on-street bike lanes.



Raised Median on 8th Avenue.
Installing a raised median along 8th
Avenue between Carey and Capitol
Avenues would help reduce travel
speeds on that road segment

3.3        Beautification
The project team developed a series of strategies and tools for addressing beautifications based
on the issues identified in the Snapshot phase. Table 9 outlines strategies and tools for
improving the aesthetics along the 8th Avenue corridor.
Table 9.      Beautification Strategies and Tools
          Strategy/Tool                              Examples / Description
Frontier Park Entry. Widen the
pedestrian space around the
Frontier Park entry point at
Carey Avenue to create a more
inviting environment.




Carey Avenue Entry. Improve
the landscaping around the
pillars and walls that mark the
vehicle entry point to Frontier
Park and Lions Park to create a
better sense of arrival to the
parks



Lions Park Entry. Open up the
Lions Park entry point at Carey
Avenue and revise the sidewalk
and walkway to steer
pedestrians into Lions Park
rather than directing them along
Carey Avenue




                                                                                         Page 26
         Strategy/Tool                           Examples / Description
Median Enhancements. Install
a grass and tree median
between Carey and Capitol on
8th Avenue to create a
landscaped transition between
the neighborhood and Lions
Park.




Maintenance Strategies           Use xeric and low-water plantings
                                 Use long-lasting and low-maintenance materials for
                                 paving, street furnishings, and lights
                                 Consider the development of a Business Improvement
                                 District to help consolidate and fund maintenance of public
                                 areas

4.0      BUILD
The Build phase of the 8th Avenue Corridor Plan provides recommendations for implementing
the strategies and tools outlined in the Shape phase, and highlights opportunities to do so. The
recommendations are organized according to the segments identified in Section 1.5 of
Snapshot section.

4.1      Segment 1: Hynds Boulevard to Carey Avenue
8th Avenue between Hynds Boulevard and Carey Avenue generally does not need revisions to
the existing three-lane roadway cross section, but several pedestrian and bicycle enhancements
have been identified to improve the multi-modal function of the segment. Since this segment
includes main entrance to Cheyenne Frontier Days, a key consideration in these
recommendations is to provide facilities that enhance access and egress to Frontier Park, as
well as maintain the ability of CFD staff to operate their shuttle buses in an efficient manner.

4.1.1    Segment Recommendations
Figure 8 depicts the recommendations for corridor segment 1, between Hynds Boulevard and
Carey Avenue. Consistent with the Shape phase, recommendations are provided in the
categories of transit and nonmotorized travel, traffic operations and safety, and beautification.
Descriptions of the recommendations and opportunities by category are provided as follows.
Transit and Non-motorized Travel ­ No specific transit recommendations are provided for this
or any other segment of 8th Avenue. However, with the Frontier Park main entrance and bus
pullout located along this segment, it is important to maintain flexibility in the roadway cross
section so that Cheyenne Frontier Days can operate their shuttle bus services as they see fit,
and other coach services can continue to use the north curb face for drop-off and pick up during
that event.
Several enhancements to the non-motorized network have been identified for the segment.
First, the north sidewalk would be widened to 12 feet to accommodate the high pedestrian
volumes that use that sidewalk throughout Frontier Days. Second, crosswalks with striped
pedestrian bulbouts on both sides of the road would be constructed on the east leg of the
Cribbon Avenue intersection and the west leg of the Dey Avenue intersection (where a sidewalk
is currently striped) to facilitate pedestrians crossing between the neighborhood and the Frontier
Park main entrance. Both crossings would also include crossing signage to alert vehicles to
their presence and overhead lighting to improve safety when events let out after dark. A cross
walk would also be provided across the east leg of the Hynds Boulevard intersection. Finally,
the roadway cross section is not wide enough to construct bike lanes in each direction, so
bicyclist would need to either use the travel lane or adjacent parking lane when travelling on this
segment. Thus, Share The Road signs would be installed at either end of the segment to alert
vehicles to the presence of bicycles in the travel way.

8th Avenue Corridor Plan REPORT, 11-192, 2/5/13
Traffic Operations and Safety ­ The basic three lane cross section for this segment is retained
in the corridor recommendation. Because the old four-lane striping continues to show through
pavement (a.k.a., "ghosting") the road surface would be milled down and a new asphalt surface
would be installed. A white stripe would be added to define an 8-foot on-street parking lane
along the south side of the road and establish the edge of the 11-foot eastbound travel lane.
The center two-way left turn area would be restriped to provide a 12-foot median with left turn
lanes at each intersection. The white stripe for the north side parking/turn lane would be
relocated to define the outside edge of the 11-foot westbound travel lane, leaving 10-11 feet for
the north side parking/turn lane. Finally, a concrete curb bulb out would be constructed on the
southeast corner of the Snyder Avenue intersection to channelize the northbound right turn
movement further to the west and improve sight lines for that movement. The bulb out would
also provide more room for Frontier Days patrons to dwell before crossing 8th Avenue.
Beautification ­The limited right-of-way provides few opportunities for beatification
enhancements along this segment. In that sense it is important to maintain the row of trees
along the north side of the street when the north sidewalk is widened. Any trees that are
displaced during that widening should be relocated or replaced, if necessary.

4.1.2    Prioritization
A priority has been identified for each recommendation depicted on Figure 8. Because the
nature of the improvements are relatively low-cost and would all be constructed within the
available right-of-way, all have been identified as either near-term improvements or mid-term
improvements. The priorities are based on the urgency of the need being addressed, steering
committee discussion, and public and stakeholder input. The priority information indicates the
`start time' for each recommendation or opportunity. For example, it is recommended that the
roadway re-striping and pedestrian crossing improvements be pursued in the near term timeline,
but the curb bulb out at Snyder could be delayed until the mid-term, if desired.

4.1.3    Alternate Roadway Section
While the improvements in Figure 8 represent relatively low-cost improvements that can be
implemented in the near to mid-term, they may be somewhat ineffective in addressing speeding
issues on 8th Avenue because they lack any raised features within the roadway that alert drivers
to their travel speed. To better address speeding issues, an alternative roadway section for
segment 1 was developed that includes a raised median with grass and trees at the west end of
the corridor between McComb Avenue and the alley between McComb and Hynds Boulevard.
This median could include signage identifying 8th Avenue as an entrance point to the
neighborhood and/or the parks, and provide a sense of arrival to the area. It would be located
such that it does not prohibit left turn access to the alley, nor would it impact CFD bus shuttle
and transit coach operations. Figure 10 shows a conceptual rendering of a median at that
location, which includes an entry sign for The Avenues neighborhood.




                                                                                          Page 30

Medians can also increase both pedestrian and motor vehicle safety on a roadway. They do this
by allowing pedestrians to cross one direction of traffic at a time, allowing them to focus on just
one lane rather than having to anticipate traffic from both directions. Medians also provide a
space to install improved lighting at pedestrian crossing locations, and improved lighting has
been shown to reduce nighttime pedestrian fatalities at crossings by 78 percent. Raised
medians also:

       Reduce motor vehicle crashes by 15 percent.
       Decrease delays (>30%) for motorists.
       Increase capacity (>30%) of roadways.
       Reduce vehicle speeds on the roadway.
       Provide space for landscaping within the right-of-way.
       Reduce the visual impact of the roadway for properties along the street.
       Landscaped medians absorb heat rather than reflect it as pavement does, and thus
       reduce the heat impact of the roadway on the surrounding area.
       Deciduous trees in a median shade the roadway in the summer and further reduce the
       heat impact. Because they lose their leaves, they allow sunlight to melt snow on the
       roadway in the winter.

The alternative also includes an additional signed, striped and lighted pedestrian crossing on
the west side of Dillon Avenue to further facilitate pedestrian travel during Frontier Days. Figure
D-1 in Appendix D shows the alternate roadway section with both additional enhancements.




                                                                                            Page 31
4.2      Segment 2: Carey Avenue to Central Avenue
4.2.1    Segment Recommendations
Figure 11 shows the recommendations for corridor segment 2 between Carey Avenue and
Central Avenue, including the Carey Avenue intersection (Figure 12). Descriptions of the
recommendations and opportunities by the category identified in the Shape section are provided
as follows.
Transit and Non-motorized Travel ­ As with segment 1, no specific transit recommendations
are provided for this segment. A major need identified for this portion of the corridor is widening
the sidewalk on the south side of 8th Avenue, from its current 3.5-foot width to 5 feet, and
providing a pedestrian crossing on the west side of Pioneer Avenue to facilitate pedestrian
travel between the neighborhood and Lions Park. That crossing would include a raised curb
bulb out on the south side of the road, a pedestrian refuge island in the median of 8th Avenue, a
striped pedestrian refuge area in the parking lane on the north side of 8th Avenue, pedestrian-
activated rapid flashing rectangular beacon signage, and overhead lighting (Figure 10 shows a
conceptual rendering of the pedestrian crossing). Finally, bike lanes would be provided in both
directions of 8th Avenue between Central Avenue and Carey Avenue and in both directions of
Carey Avenue south of 8th Avenue, while buffered bike lanes would be provided in both
directions of Carey Avenue north of 8th Avenue. These bicycle facilities would complete those
portions of the Cheyenne Area On-Street Bicycle and Greenways Plan Update.

8th Avenue Corridor Plan REPORT, 11-192, 2/5/13
At the Carey Avenue intersection, concrete curb bulb outs that extend to the edge of the parking
lane would be constructed on the southeast and southwest corner to provide additional dwelling
area for pedestrians and channelize the northbound right turn movement further to the west and
improve sight lines for that movement. Additionally, the southbound channelized right turn
would be removed to provide additional dwelling space for pedestrians, a striped bulbout would
be installed in the parking lane on the northeast corner of the intersection, crosswalks would be
striped across all four intersection approaches, and pedestrian signage and overhead lighting
would be installed to improve visibility and awareness. Finally, rather than terminating at the
pillars, the sidewalk on the northeast corner would end at the entrance path to Lions Park and
the sidewalk on the northwest side would end just north of the entrance path to Frontier Park.

Traffic Operations and Safety ­ There are two significant changes to the roadway on this
segment. The first would be to reduce the laneage on 8th Avenue from four travel lanes to
three. Because of concerns that the same roadway striping "ghosting" issues would occur here
as they have on segment 1, the road surface would be milled down and a new asphalt surface
would be installed. A 7-foot on-street parking lane would be striped along the south side of the
road, followed by a 5-foot bike lane that would establish the outside edge of an 11-foot
eastbound travel lane. A 12-foot median with left turn lanes at each intersection would be
striped in the middle of the roadway, followed by an 11-foot westbound travel lane, a 5-foot bike
lane, and a 7-foot parking lane on the north side of the street.. An additional concrete bulbout
extending out to the edge of the parking lane would be constructed at the new pedestrian
crossing at Pioneer Avenue to reduce the crossing distance at that location.
All of the improvements on the north side of 8th Avenue would be painted, rather than raised
above the travel way, to maintain the flexibility of converting the westbound direction back to two
travel lanes should conditions during Cheyenne Frontier Days or during events at Lions Park
indicate that an additional lane is necessary.
The second significant change for this segment is revisions to the approach laneage at the
Carey Avenue intersection. In addition to installing bulb outs on three corners and removing the
southbound channelized right turn on the fourth, buffered bike lanes would replace the outer
southbound travel lane Carey Avenue, leaving the southbound approach as a single lane. The
8th Avenue lane reduction plus the painted bulbout on the northeast corner would remove the
existing right turn lane, leaving a left turn lane and a shared through/right turn lane on that
approach. Bike lanes plus the concrete bulb out on the southeast corner of the intersection
would remove the informal right turn there and result in a single lane approach northbound.
Additionally, the north end of Reed Avenue would be closed to clarify the southbound laneage
there (Figure 13 shows a rendering of the Reed Avenue closure). The concrete bulbout on the
southwest corner would be constructed in the existing parking lane only, so the eastbound
approach channelization would remain as a left turn lane and shared through/right turn lane.
The end result of these changes would be an intersection with fewer lanes on three of the four
approaches, which should decrease driver confusion and indecision at that location and improve
vehicle and pedestrian safety.




                                                                                            Page 35
Figure 13.     Conceptual Closure of Reed Avenue, south of 8th Avenue (looking south)

It should also be noted that during the initial alternatives development process, two options that
involved significant redevelopment of the Carey Avenue intersection were developed. One
alternative realigned Carey through Frontier Park's Indian Village area so that it formed the
north leg of the Snyder Avenue intersection. A second alternative constructed a roundabout at
the current intersection location. Both alternatives involved the purchase of additional right-of-
way and were anticipated to have significant construction cost and were therefore dropped from
further consideration. Appendix E shows the two conceptual designs.
Carey Avenue Traffic Control. As documented in Section 1.2.2 of this report, during the public
meetings for this project, many comments were received regarding the need to install a traffic
signal to regulate movements and improve safety at the Carey Avenue intersection. However,
current traffic conditions fail to satisfy the eight hour, four hour and peak hour volume warrants,
the combination of pedestrian and traffic volume fails to satisfy the pedestrian volume warrant,
and the average number of accidents at the intersection over a five year period is lower than the
threshold that would suggest the need for a signal for safety-based reasons, so a traffic signal
has not been identified as a near term improvement in the recommended roadway option. It
has, however, been retained in the plan as a potential long-term solution to traffic issues there,
once traffic conditions or accident patterns satisfy MUTCD requirements.




                                                                                            Page 36
Similarly, current traffic conditions fail to satisfy the MUTCD all-way stop volume warrant and
the accident history at the intersection does not indicate a pattern of accidents that would be
susceptible to correction by all-way stop control, so a four-way stop at that location has not been
identified as a near-term solution in the recommended roadway option. However, it, too,
remains as a potential mid-term or long-term solution to traffic issues there once traffic
conditions or accident patterns satisfy MUTCD requirements.
Drainage ­ A key consideration applicable to all recommendations in Segment 2 is the need to
consider drainage needs and improvements along with any transportation improvements. In
particular, widening the sidewalk on the south side of the road would need to occur to the north,
into the existing parking lane, to avoid property impacts. This improvement, along with the curb
bulb outs at the Carey intersection and the new pedestrian crossing at Pioneer would require
relocating the existing storm drain entrances along the south curb line.
Beautification ­ Beautification improvements for the corridor are primarily focused around the
Carey Avenue intersection, where the historic pillars and wall on the north side of the
intersection, the Frontier Park entrance and an entrance to Lions Park provide the opportunity to
create an enhanced gateway to the park area.
At the Frontier Park entrance, the current pathway leading into the park from the intersection is
narrow and the current landscaping is overgrown, which hides the brick pillars and walls and
encroaches upon both the pathway and sign that arches over the entrance. The
recommendations convert the area where the southbound right turn lane was into a pedestrian
plaza and the trees and bushes that hid the walls and overhead sign are replaced with lower
profile plantings, which opens up the corner and enhances the park entry. Figure 14 shows a
conceptual rendering of the improvements.




Figure 14.     Conceptual Improvements to the Frontier Park Entrance at Carey Avenue




                                                                                            Page 37
Similarly, in the median and on both sides of Carey Avenue north of 8th Avenue the current trees
and shrubs have grown to a height where they encroach upon the historic pillars and walls that
frame the roadway. The recommendation replaces those trees and shrub with lower profile
plantings that enhance those features rather than hide them. Additionally, the portion of the
sidewalks that run north along Carey from the intersection (straight into the pillars on both sides
of the street) would be replaced with grass and landscaping, with the west side
sidewalk/pedestrian plaza routed into Frontier Park and the east side sidewalk routed into Lions
Park. Figure 15 shows a conceptual rendering of the improvements to the Carey Avenue
entranceway.




Figure 15.     Conceptual Improvements to the Frontier Park Entrance at Carey Avenue


On the northeast corner of the intersection, an asphalt path leads into Lions Park, but the
existing landscaping does little to suggest the area is an entry point to the park. The
recommendation includes extending the brick wall next to the Carey Avenue pillar east to the
pathway, and constructing a similar wall with a park sign on the other side of the path, so that
the path becomes a featured entry point into the park. Low profile plantings are included at the
base of the walls to provide color and blend into the landscaping along the walls and pillars in
the median and on the west side of Carey in front of Frontier Park. Figure 16 shows a
conceptual rendering of the improvements to the Lions Park corner.




                                                                                            Page 38
Figure 16.     Conceptual Improvements to the Frontier Park Entrance at Carey Avenue

4.2.2    Prioritization
A priority has been identified for each recommendation depicted on Figures 11 and 12.
Because the nature of the improvements are relatively low-cost and would be constructed within
the available right-of-way, all have been identified as either near-term improvements or mid-
term improvements. The priorities are based on the urgency of the need being addressed,
steering committee discussion, and public and stakeholder input. It is recommended that the
roadway re-striping, pedestrian crossing improvements and curb bulb outs be pursued in the
near term timeline, while the Reed Avenue closure and landscaping enhancements to the Carey
intersection could be delayed until the mid-term, if desired.

4.2.3    Alternate Roadway Section
As with segment 1, the improvements identified for segment 2 represent relatively low-cost
improvements that can be implemented in the near to mid-term, but they may be somewhat
ineffective in addressing speeding issues on 8th Avenue because aside from the pedestrian
refuge island at Pioneer, they lack any raised features within the roadway that alert drivers to
their travel speed. To better address speeding issues, an alternative roadway section for
segment 2 was developed that includes several features designed to reduce travel speeds.




                                                                                            Page 39
The first such feature is replacing the striped curb bulbs along the north side of 8th Avenue with
concrete curb bulbs--at the Carey Avenue intersection, at the pedestrian crossing at Pioneer
Avenue and at a new signed and striped pedestrian crossing at Capitol Avenue. Observations
of traffic volumes and patterns during Frontier Days suggest that the roadway would function
adequately with only one lane in that direction under event traffic conditions, and should that be
the case, raised curb bulbs that extend across the parking lane at the above locations would not
only provide a sense of narrowing the roadway to drivers, they would also help alert drivers to
the presence of the pedestrian crossings, both of which should help to reduce travel speeds.
These bulb outs have further benefits in that they increase the pedestrian dwelling area and
improve safety at each crossing.

Second, the alternative section includes a raised median with grass and trees between each
intersection from Capitol Avenue to Carey Avenue. This median would be constructed to
provide left turn lanes at each street, and the median at Capitol Avenue could include signage
identifying 8th Avenue as an entrance point to the neighborhood and/or the parks, providing a
sense of arrival to the area. Figure 17 shows a conceptual rendering of the median at the
Moore Avenue intersection.




Figure 17.     Conceptual Grass and Tree Median west of Moore Avenue




                                                                                           Page 40
In addition to helping to reduce travel speeds, medians can increase both pedestrian and motor
vehicle safety on a roadway. They do this by allowing pedestrians to cross one direction of
traffic at a time, allowing them to focus on just one lane rather than having to anticipate traffic
from both directions. Medians also provide a space to install improved lighting at pedestrian
crossing locations, and improved lighting has been shown to reduce nighttime pedestrian
fatalities at crossings by 78 percent. Raised medians also:

         Reduce motor vehicle crashes by 15 percent.
         Decrease delays (>30%) for motorists.
         Increase capacity (>30%) of roadways.
         Provide space for landscaping within the right-of-way.
         Reduce the visual impact of the roadway for properties along the street.
         Landscaped medians absorb heat rather than reflect it as pavement does, and thus
         reduce the heat impact of the roadway on the surrounding area.
         Deciduous trees in a median shade the roadway in the summer and further reduce the
         heat impact. Because they lose their leaves, they allow sunlight to melt snow on the
         roadway in the winter.

The most significant impact of the median is that it would prevent direct left turn access into the
driveways for four properties between Bent and Pioneer Avenues, two properties between
Pioneer and Moore Avenues, and two properties between Moore and Capitol Avenues.
Vehicles accessing those properties from the east could either U-turn around the median or
enter the neighborhood on 7th Avenue and drive north to 8th Avenue on the first street west of
their property.

The alternative design also includes a signed, striped and lighted pedestrian crossing on the
west side of Capitol Avenue to further facilitate pedestrian travel between the neighborhood and
Lions Park. Figures D-2 and D-3 in Appendix D show the alternative segment and intersection
design.

4.3        Segment 3: Central Avenue to Warren Avenue
4.3.1      Segment Recommendations and Opportunities
Figure 18 shows the recommendations for corridor segment 3 between Central Avenue and
Warren Avenue. Descriptions of the recommendations and opportunities by the category
identified in the Shape section are provided as follows.
Transit and Non-motorized Travel ­ As with segments 1 and 2, no specific transit
recommendations are provided for this segment. The primary non-motorized recommendations
for this segment are related to enhancing the greenways trail connection between Lions Park
and Evans Avenue. Painted and/or textured sidewalks have been identified for the west and
south legs of the 8th Avenue/Central Avenue intersection, and widening the south sidewalk
between Central and Warren has been identified to better establish that segment as a section of
the greenways trail and allow pedestrians and bicyclists to avoid the signage and street light
poles that are embedded in the sidewalk there.

8th Avenue Corridor Plan REPORT, 11-192, 2/4/13
Traffic Operations and Safety ­ The revisions to the south curb line between Central and
Warren Avenues described above would also improve the outside lane alignment for eastbound
vehicle traffic. Additionally, revising the traffic signal phasing at the 8th Avenue/Warren Avenue
intersection to include a protected plus permitted left turn phase (left turn green arrow, followed
by a flashing yellow arrow where vehicles can turn left turn when gaps in the westbound
direction permit it) has been identified to help reduce traffic delays and queuing for that
movement. Adding skip striping to the eastbound left turn movement that channelizes vehicles
into the left-most northbound lane on Warren would also improve intersection performance, as it
would allow some left turning vehicles to move simultaneously with westbound right turns, which
turn into the right-most lane on Warren.
Beautification ­ No beautification improvements have been identified for segment 3. The City
should continue to provide regular maintenance to the landscaping in the existing median on
this segment.

4.3.2    Prioritization
A priority has been identified for each recommendation depicted on Figure 18. Because the
nature of the improvements are relatively low-cost and would all be constructed within the
available right-of-way, all have been identified as near-term improvements. The revisions to the
signal phasing at the Warren intersection should be tied into WYDOT's next signal re-timing
effort in the area.

4.3.3    Long-Term Traffic Signal Revisions
No additional enhancements to the roadway cross section or non-motorized system have been
identified for segment 3. However, as traffic volumes grow, the City should monitor traffic
volumes and delay at the 8th Avenue/Warren Avenue intersection, particularly the eastbound left
turn and westbound right turn. If delays and/or queues become problematic for either
movement, it may become prudent to revise the westbound approach channelization from two
through lanes and a right turn lane to a through lane, a shared through/right turn lane and a right
turn lane, and the traffic signal phasing should be revised to provide a protected only phase for
the eastbound left turn movement. Such improvements should reduce the delays and queuing
in the eastbound and westbound directions to a manageable level.

4.4      Improvement Costs and Potential Funding Sources
4.4.1    Improvement Costs
Table 10 summarizes the anticipated costs associated with the recommended improvements

Because the full plan includes many elements that can be constructed independent of each
other, the option is available to initially construct a smaller subset of improvements that address
the most pressing needs along the corridor, and then construct the remaining items at a later
date, when more funding is secured. Since the NTMP application specifically requested an
improved pedestrian crossing between the neighborhood and Lions Park, and addressing traffic
operations at the Carey intersection were the most common theme from the public involvement
portion of the project, it would appear that those items represent the most pressing needs along
the corridor and should be constructed first. Table 11 summarizes the costs associated with
these Phase 1 improvements, namely:

        Install the pedestrian-activated crosswalk at Pioneer Avenue. Revising the laneage from
        four lanes to three on 8th Avenue would not be a part of the initial improvements, so
        neither the median refuge island nor the concrete bulbout on the south side of the road
        would be a part of the Phase 1 construction; thus, this crossing would only consist of
        painted bulbouts in the parking lane on both sides of the road, crossing striping and the
        pedestrian-activated crossing signs;
        Install a concrete bulbout on the northwest corner of the Carey intersection and close the
        channelized right turn there. This bulbout would be constructed to the final configuration
        identified in the recommended plan, and thus would not require any further modification
        when the remaining recommended improvements are constructed. The bicycle lanes on
        Carey have not been included in the Phase 1 improvements, so the southbound
        approach would still have two lanes (a left turn lane and a through/right turn lane).

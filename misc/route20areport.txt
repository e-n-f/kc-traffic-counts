NYS Route 20A Comprehensive Access Management Plan               Village & Town of Geneseo, NY


I.   INTRODUCTION

      1.1 Background
            One of the greatest threats to safe and efficient travel in a community is the
            cumulative effect of growth and development. Generally, applications for
            development are reviewed on an individual basis as they are submitted. Planning
            boards are confronted with the task of reviewing a proposal in the context of
            the existing conditions without insight into the best overall plan for the area in
            the future. This segmented approach to planning, which is commonplace, leads
            to the proliferation of uncoordinated driveway access. This is often the result of
            insufficient information and coordination between the transportation agency
            and land use/zoning decision makers.

            This project initiates coordination between (NYSDOT), the Village, and the
            Town of Geneseo to work as true partners to protect and preserve the
            investment, capacity, and safety on NYS Route 20A corridor for future
            generations by making each aware of the impacts of its decisions on the other
            agencies and on the roadway.

            This coordination will take the form of an access management plan, which will
            include establishment of a corridor-wide framework within which to review,
            discuss, evaluate, and mitigate proposed development along the corridor. The
            framework will be designed in a way that it will continue to operate long after
            the study is complete.

            With all stakeholders as partners working together, the Village and Town of
            Geneseo accomplished the following objectives:

              A. Cooperatively prepared an access management plan;

              B.   Reviewed and improved cooperation on permit and zoning practices
                   within the study area, using regulatory land use, access design/traffic
                   management techniques and strategies developed through this study
                   (using the Access Management Manual as a resource);

              C. Worked with local officials to identify zoning ordinance language that
                 needs to be updated to carry out the access management plan;

            The expected outcome is a plan which, through its implementation, will
            preserve the functionality of the Route 20A corridor, while supporting the
            economic vitality of the corridor. This outcome can only be obtained by the
            cooperative efforts of the local governments, NYSDOT, and all other
            stakeholders.

      1.2 Study Area
            The study corridor begins at the Route 20A/Main Street intersection, and
            extends east to the North Road intersection. The study corridor also includes
            Volunteer Road, in its entirety, and Main Street, between Route 20A and Park
            Street. Figure 1.1 shows the study area boundary for the study corridor.

            The entire study corridor on Route 20A is approximately 3.8 miles long.
            Thirteen existing intersections are studied in detail as follows:

                  1. Route 20A/Main Street (signalized)
                  2. Route 20A/Crossett Road/Temple Hill Road (unsignalized)
                  3. Route 20A/Groveland Road (unsignalized)
                  4. Route 20A/Center Street (unsignalized)
                  5. Route 20A/Megan Drive/Reservior Road (signalized)
                  6. Route 20A/Millennium Dr (unsignalized)
                  7. Route 20A/Volunteer Road/Wegmans drive (signalized)
                  8. Route 20A/Mobil driveway (unsignalized)
                  9. Route 20A/Morgan View Road (unsignalized)
                  10. Route 20A/Country Club Road (unsignalized)
                  11. Route 20A/North Road (unsignalized)
                  12. Main Street/Park Street (unsignalized)
                  13. Volunteer Road/Lima Road (unsignalized)

            The existing lane geometry at each of the study intersections on the Route 20A
            study corridor are depicted in Figure 1.2.

      1.3 Previous Studies
            Previously, in May 2002 a Land Use and Access Management Plan (LUAMP) was
            prepared by Clark Patterson Associates for the Route 20A corridor. This study
            focused primarily on the segment of Route 20A from Center Street to Morgan
            View Road. Prior to the LUAMP report in 2002, a report was prepared in April
            1999 by Fisher Associates for the Gateway Industrial Park. The report analyzed
            the traffic impacts resulting from the construction of Volunteer Road and
            subsequent land development.

      1.4 Project Coordination
            Public outreach and project coordination was a significant element of the study.
            At the onset of the project, a partnering session between NYSDOT and the
            Route 20A Access Management Steering Committee was held to guide the
            Consultant's effort to establish a common vision for the corridor, with
            supporting goals and objectives to guide the development and focus of the
                                        Final Report                              Page 5 of 33

            access management plan. The main purpose of the partnering session was to
            clearly articulate the purpose of the plan and the problems that need to be
            solved. At this workshop, the basic function of the corridor and its relative
            importance in the overall transportation system was clearly defined. Also,
            general access characteristics and areas with existing access concerns were
            identified. Future access concerns based on planned development was
            discussed. Also all land use changes that are proposed for official revision was
            identified. The dates of the various meetings held to date are listed below in
            Table 1.1.

         1.5 Goals and Objectives
               Workshop sessions were held with the NYSDOT and the Route 20A Access
               Management Steering Committee to define the goals and objectives to be
               accomplished by the study. The following goals were defined by the committee
               as relevant to this study.

               The principal goal of the Route 20A Access Management Study is to develop a
               plan that the local jurisdictions and NYSDOT can implement to make NYS
               Route 20A a safer and more efficient transportation facility for all users over
               the next 20 years. This plan shall respect the character of the Village and Town
               while preserving the quality of life for residents, merchants, and visitors of the
               community.

               In order to achieve this goal, it is important to understand the connection
               between the transportation network and the adjacent land use that it serves.
               The national Access Management Manual1 refers to this relationship as the
               Transportation ­ Land Use Cycle, as shown in the following graphic.

                                                           Arterial
                                                         Improvement

                                   in Quality of
                                                                          Accessibility
                                   Traffic Flow



                              Increased
                                                                                    Increased
                            Traffic Conflict
                                                                                   Land Value

                                                                       Change



               Access management strategies delay or even halt this cycle by maintaining a
               balance between the Land Use Change stage and the Increased Traffic Conflict
               stage. As illustrated in the diagram, increased traffic generation is a direct result
               of Land Use change. Local municipalities have in place official planning
               documents such as Comprehensive Plans, Master Plans, Zoning Ordinances, and
               Subdivision Regulations that govern how and where land should (or should not)
               be developed. To effectively manage the transportation and land use cycle, both
               NYSDOT and the local agencies must address both the transportation system
               and the adjacent land development.

               The intent of the Access Management Plan is to provide a framework for
               assisting NYSDOT, the Village and Town Planning Boards, and the Town Board

            with decision-making regarding access, circulation, and safety for future
            development along the corridor.

            Specific objectives include:
                   Minimize number of access locations
                   Increase access spacing
                   Reduce through traffic conflicts
                   Provide greater accessibility for all users
                   Manage traffic signal and intersection control
                   Provide language in local codes that supports implementation of access
                   management techniques and strategies along the corridor

2.   EXISTING CONDITIONS ­ TRANSPORTATION


      2.1 Roadway Functional Classification and Roadway Attributes
            Route 20A is functionally classified as an urban minor arterial within the Village
            of Geneseo and a rural minor arterial type highway in the Town of Geneseo
            under the jurisdiction of NYSDOT. The posted speed limit is 30 mph inside the
            village, 45 mph from the east village boundary to Country Club Road and 55
            mph to the east of Country Club Road to North Road.

            Volunteer Road, a two-lane roadway under the jurisdiction of the Town of
            Geneseo, provides a connection between Route 20A to the south and Lima
            Road to the north with a posted speed limit of 45 mph. Volunteer Road widens
            on the approach to the signalized Route 20A intersection to provide one
            exclusive left, one thru, and one right turn lane. On the approach to Lima Road,
            the pavement widens to provide one exclusive left and one right turn lane.

            Morgan View Road, a two-lane roadway under the jurisdiction of the Town of
            Geneseo, provides a connection between Route 20A to the north and
            Reservoir Road to the south with a posted speed limit of 40 mph. Morgan View
            Road widens on the approach to the unsignalized Route 20A intersection to
            provide one left and one right turn lane.

      2.2 Data Collection Program
            Weekday PM (4-6pm) peak traffic counts were obtained by SRF & Associates
            (SRF) at the study area intersections listed in section 1.2.

            PM Peak hour volumes at all of the study area intersections were collected on

            counts, due to the differences in days the data was collected. All traffic volumes
            were found to balance within the network within reasonable and expected
            variations. The actual differences in traffic volumes can be attributed to activity
            related to driveways and intersections located in the segments between the
            intersections along NYS Route 20A between the study intersections. The
            existing PM peak hour volumes are depicted in Figure 2.1.

      2.3 Access Density
            Access density is the number of access points, such as driveways and
            intersections, per mile. Table 2.1 shows the existing access density for the
            three sections along Route 20A in the Village and Town of Geneseo. Table 2.2
            compares the accident rate on the three sections.

            The accidents rate in the segment between Center Street and Volunteer Road
            is more than the statewide average. This is can be attributed to the land use in
            the segment and the increased access density. Accidents are discussed further in
            section 2.6

            Figure 2.2 shows the existing access location on the entire Route 20A study
            corridor. The figure also shows the passing and no passing zones in the study
            corridor.

2.5         Level of Service Analysis

            Capacity analysis is a technique used for determining a measure of effectiveness
            for a section of roadway and/or intersection based on the number of vehicles
            during a specific time period. The measure of effectiveness used for the capacity
            analysis is referred to as a Level of Service (LOS). Levels of Service are
            calculated to provide an indication of the amount of delay that a motorist
            experiences while traveling along a roadway or through an intersection. Since
            the most amount of delay to motorists usually occurs at intersections, the
            capacity analysis specifically focuses on intersections.

            Six Levels of Service are defined for analysis purposes. They are assigned letter
            designations, from "A" to "F", with LOS "A" representing operating conditions
            with the least time delay. LOS "F" is the least desirable operating condition
            where longer delays are experienced by motorists. Suggested ranges of service
            capacity and an explanation of Levels of Service are included in the Appendix.

            The standard procedure for capacity analysis of signalized and unsignalized
            intersections is outlined in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000)
            published by the Transportation Research Board Traffic analysis software,
            Synchro 6.0 (Build 614), which is based on procedures and methodologies
            contained in the HCM 2000, was used to analyze operating conditions at study
            area intersections. The procedure yields a Level of Service (LOS) based on the
            HCM 2000 as an indicator of how well intersections operate.

            Existing operating conditions are documented in the field and modeled using
            traffic analysis software. The traffic analysis models are calibrated based on the
            actual field observations.

            Roadway segment and intersection analyses were performed on the critical
            elements that comprise the adjacent street network. Link/arterial analyses are
            provided for the Route 20A arterial section within the study area. The following
            tables (Table 2.3 & 2.4) depict the results of both link and intersection
            analysis. All capacity analysis calculations are included in the Appendices.

            NYS Route 20A @ Crossett Road, Center Street, Millennium Drive, Mobil driveway,
            Morgan View, Country Club Road, North Road
            During the PM peak commuter period, side street approaches at all these intersections
            experience longer delays indicative of LOS F conditions. Through motorists on Route
            20A at most of these intersections experience little delays during the PM peak hour
            period.

            All other study intersections operate at an average LOS "C" or better on all
            approaches during PM peak period under existing conditions.

      2.6 Safety Considerations, Accident History, and Analysis
            Accident reports for the roadways within the limits of this project were
            investigated to assess the safety history. The accidents included in the current
            review occurred during a three year, three months time period from January
            2002 through April 2005.

            During this period, 206 accidents were documented at the intersections and
            roadway sections included in the project. The project accident history was
            further investigated to identify high incident areas and possible trends/causes of
            the accidents. This analysis documented number, location, type, and cause of
            accidents within the project limits. Table 2.5 lists the combined results of the
            type of accidents that occurred mid-block and/or at intersections. Table 2.6
            further separates different types of accidents occurring at each intersection.

            Based on the number of accidents within each segment and at each intersection,
            accident rates were calculated for the segments and intersections and
            compared to the statewide average for similar facilities. The calculated rates and
            comparison to statewide averages are illustrated in Table 2.7. Accident rate
            calculations are included in Appendix. Segmental rates are listed as accidents
            per million vehicle miles (ACC/MVM). Intersection rates are listed as accidents
            per million entering vehicles (ACC/MEV). The shaded cells represent locations
            with accident rates exceeding the statewide average.

            The segments that have rates higher than statewide averages are located in the
            section primarily from Center Street to Volunteer Road; this area has the
            highest access density in the entire corridor.

            Seven intersections experienced accident rates exceeding the statewide
            averages for similar type intersections (Temple Hill St, Center St, Millennium
            Dr, Volunteer Rd, Morgan View Rd, Country Club Rd, and North Rd). Figure

4. EVALUATION PHASE ­ PRELIMINARY PLANNED BUILD-OUT ANALYSIS


      4.1 Existing and Future Traffic Generator

            Existing traffic generators along the Route 20A corridor are made up of a
            multitude of varying land uses. The State University of New York (SUNY)
            College at Geneseo is likely one of the largest contributors of traffic on the
            Route 20A corridor. The section of Route 20A from Main Street to Crossett
            and Groveland Roads consist primarily of residential type land uses. Groveland
            to the Megan/Reservoir intersection is a mix of retail, office and some
            residential land uses. Reservoir to Morgan View Road is primarily retail type
            land uses with some office and residential. The section from Morgan View to
            North Road is a mix of residential, office, and limited retail. Within the
            corridor, two of the larger retail type traffic generators are the WalÌMart
            Supercenter and the Wegman's grocery store plaza.

            In order to determine the potential future traffic demands on the Route 20A
            corridor, a future planning horizon of 2025 was selected for analysis purposes.
            This was derived by using existing data (2005) and using a window of 20 years in
            the future. A 20 year design window was selected because it is consistent with
            standards and practices set forth by New York State Department of
            Transportation (NYSDOT). The future traffic generators along the corridor will
            consist of existing uses that get redeveloped and brand new uses that are
            constructed on vacant parcels within the study area. Redeveloped parcels
            generally have less traffic impact as compared to new development. Therefore,
            this planning analysis level analysis focuses largely on existing parcels within the
            study area that are "likely to be developed" within the year 2025. Figure 4.1
            illustrates the parcels within the study area that are likely to be developed by
            the year 2025.

            The current zoning maps and future land use master plans in the Town and
            Village of Geneseo were reviewed to determine the type of allowable uses for
            each zoning area. The following factors were used to arrive at the assumed land
            use for each of the targeted development parcels, as shown in Figure 4.1:
                     ·     Existing zoning map/future land use master plans,
                     ·     Allowable land uses in zoning codes,
                     ·     Gateway (Build Now) allowable uses,
                     ·     Expected land uses,
                     ·     Examination of recent land use development types/trends

            Table 4.1 below illustrates the assumed land uses and future trip projections
            associated with each of the likely development parcels and areas.

            between Morgan View Road and North Road. The PM peak hour trip
            generation rates were derived based on local trip generation data, as well as
            information contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
            Generation, 7th Edition manual. The size of the parcel was multiplied by the trip
            generation rates to determine the PM peak hour trips. The data was then
            adjusted to account for various factors that affect trip generation, such as:

                     ·     Trip chaining
                     ·     Multi-use trips
                     ·     Pass-by trips

                    ·   Buildable area (decreases due to wetlands, setbacks, green space,
                        etc.)

            All of the above factors effectively decrease the number of new trips that are
            on the study roadways.

            The adjusted trip generation volumes were then distributed through the
            network based on location and land use, and added to existing conditions data
            to arrive at the future 2025 conditions. The planning level analysis results are
            shown and discussed in the following section(s).

            Figures 4.2 and 4.3 indicate the Peak Hour Volumes under 2025 forecasted
            conditions, and the Future 2025 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes.

      4.2 Level of Service Analysis - Intersections

            The following table, Table 4.2, illustrates the future 2025 design year
            intersection level of service results. The table is broken down into two sections:
            2025 No Build and 2025 Build Option. The 2025 No Build column represents
            existing (2005) lane configuration and intersection controls. The 2025 Build
            Option indicates results with possible intersection and roadway improvements
            that could occur within the 20-year design period and would enhance operations
            and safety.

            techniques for improving operations and safety along Route 20A to
            accommodate forecasted traffic volumes.

      4.3 Level of Service Analysis - Roadway Segments

            The following table illustrates the planning level arterial analysis results for the
            future 2025 No Build conditions.

            As shown in the table above, the critical roadway segments analyzed will
            operate with longer delays to motorists than the existing conditions without
            any improvements to Route 20A for the 2025 conditions.

            The LOS results in the 2025 Build scenario improve, as compared to the 2025
            No Build conditions, due to intersection modifications and extension or
            addition of center-turn lane and/or thru lanes on Route 20A between Reservoir
            and Volunteer Road.

            Improvements used for these analysis purposes are not necessarily specific
            recommendations but represent available techniques for improving operations
            and safety along Route 20A to accommodate forecasted traffic volumes.

      4.4 Multi-modal Considerations

            The public transportation system not only provides motorists with a safe and
            efficient route to a destination but also those traveling on foot, wheelchair, or
            bicycle. Especially considering the proximity of the Village and SUNY Geneseo
            to the Route 20A corridor, pedestrian/bicyclist issues need to be evaluated.

            Pedestrian accommodations include features such as sidewalks and crosswalks;
            crosswalks can be located at signalized intersections, unsignalized intersections,
            and mid-block. Existing pedestrian accommodations include:
                1. Sidewalk on the north side of Route 20A from Main St (NYS Route 39)
                   to Temple Hill St
                2. A crosswalk at the intersection of Route 20A with Prospect St on the
                   eastern side.
                3. A sidewalk originates on the south side of Route 20A at the crosswalk
                   with Prospect and continues down Crossett and Groveland; it does not
                   continue eastward.
                4. A sidewalk on the north side of Route 20A between Center St. and
                   Ryan Drive.

            Locations for non-motorist travel improvements were identified and potential
            enhancements were explored. Target areas and potential treatments can be
            found on Figure 4.5 and in the following table:

               All potential improvements are supported by The New York State Highway
               Design Manual (NYS HDM) as well as AASHTO2's Guide for the Planning, Design,
               and Operation of Pedestrian Facilities. Five out of the six target areas identified are
               at unsignalized or uncontrolled intersections. The HDM offers
               recommendations for installing marked crosswalks and other needed pedestrian
               improvements at controlled and uncontrolled locations based on roadway
               characteristics such as number of lanes, vehicular Average Annual Daily Traffic
               (AADT), speed limit, and the presence or absence of a median. Route 20A, has
               an approximate AADT of 19,000 vehicles, the speed limit is 30mph within the
               village and transitions to 45 mph just beyond Millennium Dr at the Village/Town
               boundary. The roadway within the study area varies from a 2-lane road to a 4-
               lane road. Based on these criteria, locations 1-4 are candidate sites for marked
               crosswalks. Adding a pedestrian signal to a future traffic signal at Millennium Dr
               is a natural accommodation. Location 6 is characterized by a 4-lane roadway
               without a median which indicates that marked crosswalks alone are insufficient
               and ought to be accompanied by traffic calming features and/or other substantial
               improvements.

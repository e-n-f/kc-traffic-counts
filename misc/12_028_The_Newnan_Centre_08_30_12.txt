INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the impacts of the additional traffic added by the
proposed development adjacent to the existing Centre for the Performing and Visual Arts on
Lower Fayetteville Road in the City of Newnan, Georgia. The added development will include
the addition of a conference center, park and trails, a future hotel and amphitheater complex.
This added development will share the driveway of the performing arts center on Lower
Fayetteville Road. The development will include:
    x Conference Center - 16,600 sf
    x Hotel - 100 rooms
    x Future Amphitheater - event seating of 1,000
The location of the proposed development and the surrounding roadway network is shown in
Figure 1.

The development proposes to use the existing full access driveway on Lower Fayetteville Road
that will align with Stonebridge Boulevard. In this study, the AM, PM, and evening peak hours
have been analyzed. This study includes the evaluation of the existing and future traffic
operations at the intersections of:
    x Lower Fayetteville Road / Summerlin Boulevard
    x Lower Fayetteville Road / Site Driveway (existing complex access) / Stonebridge
        Boulevard
    x Lower Fayetteville Road / Summer Grove Parkway/ Shenandoah Boulevard
Recommendations to improve traffic operations have been identified, where appropriate.

EXISTING FACILITIES
An inventory was performed of the major roadways in the area surrounding the site. The
following is a brief description of each of these facilities.

Lower Fayetteville Road
Lower Fayetteville Road is an east-west, two-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of 45 mph
in the vicinity of the site.

Stonebridge Boulevard
Stonebridge Boulevard is a north-south, two-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of 25 mph
in the vicinity of the site.

Shenandoah Boulevard
Shenandoah Boulevard is a north-south, two-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of 45 mph
in the vicinity of the site.

Summer Grove Parkway
Summer Grove Parkway is a north-south, two-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of 30 mph
in the vicinity of the site.

Summerlin Boulevard
Summerlin Boulevard is a north-south, two-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 mph in
the vicinity of the site.




                                                                     A&R Engineering Inc.
                                             3
Sight Distance

The AASHTO minimum sight distance requirement for vehicles making a left turn from a side
street is 500' for two-lane, 45 mph roadways. Field observations indicate that there is
approximately 510' of sight distance looking west (left) from the site driveway and 440' of sight
distance looking east (right) from the site driveway. Sight distance is limited when looking right
due to trees and vegetation located outside of the right-of-way.

STUDY METHODOLOGY
In this study, the methodology used for evaluating traffic operations at each of the subject
intersections is based on the criteria set forth in the Transportation Research Board's Special
Report 209: Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 edition (HCM 2000). Synchro software, which
utilizes the HCM 2000 methodology, was used for the analysis. The following is a description
of the methodology employed for the analysis of unsignalized and signalized intersections.

Unsignalized Intersections

For unsignalized intersections at which the side street or minor street is controlled by a stop sign,
the criteria for evaluating traffic operations are the level of service (LOS) for the turning
movements at the intersection and the level of service for the overall intersection. Level of
service is based on the average controlled delay incurred at the intersection. Controlled delay for
unsignalized intersections includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped
delay, and final acceleration delay. Several factors affect the controlled delay for unsignalized
intersections, such as the availability and distribution of gaps in the conflicting traffic stream,
critical gaps, and follow-up time for a vehicle in the queue.

Level of service is assigned a letter designation from A through F. Level of service A indicates
excellent operations with little delay to motorists, while level of service F exists when there are
insufficient gaps of acceptable size to allow vehicles on the side street to cross safely, resulting
in extremely long total delays and long queues. The level of service criteria for two-way stop-
controlled and all-way stop-controlled (unsignalized) intersections is given in Table 1.

Signalized Intersections

For signalized intersections, it is necessary to evaluate both capacity and level of service in order
to evaluate the overall operation of the intersection. The capacity analysis of an intersection is
performed by comparing the volume of traffic using the various lane groups at the intersection to
the capacity of those lane groups. This results in a volume/capacity (v/c) ratio for each lane
group. A v/c ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the volume of traffic has exceeded the capacity
available, resulting in a temporary excess of demand. Although the capacity of the entire
intersection is not defined, a composite v/c ratio for the sum of the critical lane groups within the
intersection is computed. This composite v/c ratio is an indication of the overall intersection
sufficiency.

Level of service for a signalized intersection is defined in terms of average controlled delay per
vehicle, which is composed of initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and
final acceleration delay. The levels of service criteria for signalized intersections, based on
average controlled delay, are shown in Table 2. Level of service A indicates operations with very
low controlled delay, while level of service F describes operations with extremely high average
controlled delay. Level of service E is typically considered to be the limit of acceptable delay,
and level of service F is considered unacceptable by most drivers.

EXISTING TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Existing peak hour traffic counts and intersection geometric data were collected at all the study
intersections to analyze traffic operations. Turning movement counts were collected on Tuesday,
April 10, 2012. All turning movement counts were recorded during the AM and PM peak hours
between 7:00am ­ 9:00am and 4:00pm ­ 6:00pm, respectively. Evening peak hours (7:00pm ­
8:00pm) were derived using 24 hour tube count data on Lower Fayetteville Road. These counts
show the through evening peak hour (7:00pm ­ 8:00pm) traffic on Lower Fayetteville Road
equaling approximately 67.8% of the PM peak hour (5:00pm ­ 6:00pm). The tube count data is
shown, below, in Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C.

The four consecutive 15-minute interval volumes that summed to produce the highest volume at
the intersections were then determined. These volumes make up the peak hour traffic volumes
for the intersections counted. Existing traffic operations were analyzed at the study intersections
in accordance with the HCM methodology. The results of the analyses are shown in Table 3.

The results of the existing conditions analysis indicate that the side street approaches
(northbound and southbound) to the intersection of Lower Fayetteville Rd / Stonebridge Blvd /
Site Driveway (existing complex access) operate at LOS F during the AM, PM, and Evening
peak hours. These delays are caused by the lack of adequate gaps in through traffic on Lower
Fayetteville Road to allow for left turns from the side streets.



                                                                                       A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                                8
Though there are side street delays, these delays are endured by a relatively small amount of
traffic in the existing conditions. Traffic counts indicate that there are only 86 southbound
vehicles in the AM peak hour and 60 southbound vehicles in the PM peak hour, compared to the
1,200 ­ 1,600 vehicles on Lower Fayetteville Road. Furthermore, a queuing analysis (shown in
Table 4) indicates that the current queues do not interfere with the roundabout on Stonebridge
Road or extend past the first internal intersection on the site driveway.

The existing peak hour volumes evaluated are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The existing traffic
control and lane geometry for the intersections are shown in Figure 7.

As shown in Table 5, a total of 8 accidents occurred between years 2010 and 2012 (as of
September) at the intersection of Lower Fayetteville Rd / Stonebridge Blvd.

BASE TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
In order to evaluate future traffic operations in this area prior to the addition of traffic from the
proposed development, a projection was made of future base year traffic volumes. The base
traffic volumes are made up of the existing traffic volumes and expected growth in the area. The
Georgia Department of Transportation recorded average daily traffic volumes at several
locations in the vicinity of the site. Reviewing the growth over the last several years revealed
growth of approximately 1% in the area. This growth factor was applied to the existing traffic
volumes on the roadways in order to estimate the future year traffic volumes prior to the addition
of site-generated traffic.

In addition to the projected growth on the roadway, additional traffic was added to account for
200 currently unoccupied residential lots north of the site, on Stonebridge Crossing. The trip
generation for these trips is shown in Table 6.

                                                    Table 6

As shown in the last line of Table 6, 50% of the entering and exiting site generated trips from
these lots were assigned to the intersection of Lower Fayetteville Rd / Stonebridge Blvd. The
remaining trips were assumed to use another access point on Newnan Crossing Blvd to access
the site. These volumes were used to analyze the future base traffic operations at the study
intersections. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 7.

The results of the base conditions analysis indicate that the intersection of Lower Fayetteville Rd
/ Stonebridge Blvd will continue to operate at LOS F in the AM, PM and evening peak hours for
the northbound and southbound approaches. The added trips from the 200 additional lots are
anticipated to cause a marked increase in delays for the southbound approach on Stonebridge
Blvd. These increases are also mirrored in the projected queue lengths, as shown in Table 8.

The following improvements are identified to improve traffic operation in the base condition at
Lower Fayetteville Road / Stonebridge Boulevard / Site Driveway (existing complex access)
intersection:

    x   Provide right turn lane on the southbound approach from Stonebridge Boulevard onto
        Lower Fayetteville Road. This improvement will allow for additional stacking on the
        southbound approach, which will prevent vehicles from backing into the roundabout.
    x   The only additional improvement that would substantially improve side street delay at
        this intersection is some form of traffic control to give right-of-way to the side street
        approaches (i.e. a roundabout or traffic signal). The intersection does not have enough
        daily traffic on the side street to merit the installation of a roundabout, and the peak hour
        volumes do not meet MUTCD standards for installation of a traffic signal. Therefore, no
        additional improvements are recommended.

The results of the analysis, assuming all recommended improvements identified above have been
implemented, are shown in Table 9.

The recommended Base improvements will allow for small decreases in delays for the
southbound approach, and prevent queues from extending into the roundabout during peak
hours. The calculated Base traffic volumes are shown in Figures 8 and 9.

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
The proposed development will include the following additions:
   x Conference Center - 16,600 sf
   x Hotel - 100 rooms
   x Future Amphitheater - event seating of 1,000

The proposed development will include one full access driveway on Lower Fayetteville Road
that will align with Stonebridge Boulevard. A site plan is shown in Figure 10.

Trip Generation

Trip generation estimates for the project were based on the rates and equations published in the
8th edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation report. This
reference contains traffic volume count data collected at similar facilities nationwide. The trip
generation was based on the following ITE Land Uses: 310 ­ Hotel & 441 ­ Live Theatre.

ITE does not have a separate trip generation rate for a Convention Center facility; therefore, the
site generated traffic was derived from the conditions at the proposed facility. At maximum
occupancy, the convention room will seat 700 persons with theatre style seating and 500 persons
with banquet seating. In order to account for an event that would provide a worst-case scenario
for the site, the trip generation for the AM includes a 70% capacity event (490 people) in which
the attendees enter and exit (1.2 people per car) the facility during the peak hours (using a 70 /
30 directional split). These assumptions are based on information from Shared Parking by the
Urban Land Institute (ULI) which states that "the maximum practical booked occupancy for
conventions and trade shows is about 70 percent of the available exhibit space." This statement
is attributed to references from Developing Sports, Convention, and Performing Arts Centers by
the Urban Land Institute (ULI). ITE Trip Generation rates were used for traffic entering and
exiting the Hotel and Amphitheater.

The trip generation also includes an evaluation of an Evening Peak Hour. This time period
corresponds with the observed exiting peak hour for the Newnan's Centre for Performing and
Visual Arts. Because ITE does not have rates for a period beyond the PM peak for the site's
proposed land uses, the site generated traffic was derived from the conditions at the proposed
facility. For the Hotel land use, ITE rates for the PM peak hour of the adjacent street traffic were
assumed to continue into the evening peak hour. The convention center rates from the PM peak
hour were also used for the evening peak hour analysis to account for an event that coincides
with the performing arts traffic. The amphitheater traffic was based on an assumed trip rate of
0.33 trips per seat (average 3 persons per vehicle at max capacity) and a 70 / 30 directional split.


                                                                          A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                18
24-hour traffic was not calculated for the convention center or amphitheater land uses, and no
pass-by or mixed-use reductions have been assumed as part of this analysis.
The calculated trip generation for the site is shown in Table 11.

The peak hours that were evaluated include the AM peak hour, PM peak hour, and Evening peak
hour. The AM peak hour (7:00am ­ 8:00am) evaluated the morning rush hour with traffic
entering the site for an event at the proposed convention center. The PM peak hour (5:00pm ­
6:00pm) evaluated the afternoon rush hour with traffic exiting the site from an event at the
proposed convention center. Finally, the Evening peak hour (7:00pm ­ 8:00pm) evaluated traffic
from coinciding events ending at the existing performing arts center, proposed convention
center, and proposed amphitheater. All peak hours included typical traffic from the proposed
hotel and some off-peak traffic from the site's other uses.


Trip Distribution

The trip distribution describes how traffic arrives and departs from the site. An overall trip
distribution was developed for the site based on a review of the existing travel patterns in the
area and the locations of major roadways and highways that will serve the development. This
distribution is shown in Figure 11. The site-generated traffic volumes, shown in Table 12, were
assigned to the study area intersections based on this distribution. The AM, PM, and Evening
peak hour new traffic generated by the site volumes are shown in Figures 12 and 13.

The new traffic volumes that will be generated by the proposed development, shown in Figures
12 and 13, were added to the future base year traffic volumes (Figures 8 and 9) in order to
determine the traffic volumes that will be on the roadway network after completion of the
project. The results of the analysis, assuming all Base conditions recommend improvements
identified above have been implemented, are shown in Table 12.

By analyzing an occurrence where events at the performing arts center, convention center, and
amphitheater complex have coinciding exiting traffic in the evening peak hour, the delays on the
site driveway are expected to significantly increase. Furthermore, the intersection delay at lower
Fayetteville Road / Shenandoah Boulevard is anticipated to increase from level-of-service (LOS)
"D" to LOS "E" in the PM peak hour. The result of Future condition queue length is shown in
Table 13.

The following improvements are identified for the Future condition:

   x   At the intersection of Lower Fayetteville Road / Stonebridge Boulevard / Site Driveway,
       the northbound approach will have the required volumes in the peak hour to meet
       MUTCD Warrant 3 (Peak Hour Warrant) for the installation of a traffic signal. Signals
       are not typically installed for only peak hour operations. As an alternative, police officers
       can be utilized for traffic control during particularly large events.
   x   To accommodate potential heavy entering left turn volumes, it is recommended that a
       westbound left turn lane be installed at the site driveway. This will prevent the
       westbound traffic on Lower Fayetteville Road from being blocked by a vehicle waiting
       for a gap to turn left into the site. The addition of an eastbound left turn lane has also
       been analyzed with the improvements.
   x   The recommendation from the Base conditions to include a southbound right turn lane on
       Stonebridge Blvd is also recommended for the future conditions.
   x   The intersection of Lower Fayetteville Road with Shenandoah Boulevard declines from
       LOS `D' to LOS `E' in the PM peak hour after the addition of site generated traffic. In
       order to mitigate this decline, it is recommended that the split signal phasing on
       Shenandoah Blvd and Summer Grove Parkway be replaced with a more efficient timing.
           o The recommendation includes the modification of these approaches to
               accommodate a protected + permissive signal phasing for the northbound and
               southbound left turn movements.
           o This requires that the northbound approach to the intersection from Summer
               Grove Parkway be restriped to have a dedicated left turn lane and a shared
               through / right turn lane.
           o Further improvements (not included in the analysis) would entail an additional
               northbound left turn lane (allowing the two northbound through movements to
               remain). Ideally the northbound and southbound left turns would be offset from
               the through movements (see GDOT "Type B Median Crossover") to improve
               sight distance and safety for left-turning drivers at the intersection.

These recommendations will improve delays and queuing at the study intersections, though not
to LOS D for the site driveway in the evening peak hour. It should be noted that the analyses in
this report account for large coinciding events at the proposed development and will (in
actuality) vary throughout the year due to demand, scheduling, and seasonal factors.

The results of the analysis, assuming all recommended improvements identified above have been
implemented, are shown in Table 14.

Alternative layouts, not covered in the scope of this analysis, could further improve the
operations at the site driveway by adding additional access points to the development. These
access points could relieve congestion at the main driveway by providing other routes for
entering and exiting traffic. Possible locations for these access points include:
    x Access to Highwoods Parkway ­ This access point would require approximately 500 feet
       of additional roadway to extend from the southeast parking area to Highwoods Parkway.
       If provided, this access point would allow drivers to access Lower Fayetteville Road
       Shenandoah Blvd via Summer Grove Parkway, greatly reducing right turn exits from the
       main access on Lower Fayetteville Rd (depending on how willing drivers would be to
       utilize this route).
    x Additional Access to Lower Fayetteville Road (west of the main site driveway) ­ This
       access point would require approximately 350 feet of new roadway to extend from the
       west parking area to Lower Fayetteville Road. This access point would allow drivers
       alternate access to Lower Fayetteville Road, greatly reducing the left turn exits from the
       main access point, which is the main source of delay for this approach.

                                                               26
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the impacts of the additional traffic added by the
proposed development adjacent to the existing Centre for the Performing and Visual Arts on
Lower Fayetteville Road in the City of Newnan, Georgia. The proposed development will
include the addition of a conference center, park and trails, and a future hotel and amphitheater
complex. This added development will share the driveway of the performing arts center on
Lower Fayetteville Road. By analyzing an occurrence where events at the performing arts center,
convention center, and amphitheater complex have coinciding peak traffic, the worst-cast
scenario was analyzed. This scenario shows delays a significant increase on the site driveway.
The following improvements would be recommended to decrease delays during this scenario:

Lower Fayetteville Road / Stonebridge Blvd / Site Driveway
Traffic counts indicate that there are currently 206 vehicles exiting the site during the peak hour,
compared to the 1,200 ­ 1,600 vehicles on Lower Fayetteville Road. After the proposed
development is added, these volumes increase to 827 for the scenario analyzed. These additional
turns cause increased delays and queues for the intersection. The following improvements will
greatly reduce these delays; however, they will still be above what HCM considers acceptable
levels of service.

Signalized Control (permanent) or Police Officer (during peak times)
The northbound approach will have the required volumes in the peak hour to meet MUTCD
Warrant 3 (Peak Hour Warrant) for the installation of a traffic signal. Signals are not typically
installed for only peak hour operations. As an alternative, police officers can be utilized for
traffic control during particularly large events.

Widen Lower Fayetteville Road for Left Turn Lanes
To accommodate potential heavy entering left turn volumes, it is recommended that a westbound
left turn lane be installed at the site driveway. This will prevent the westbound traffic on Lower
Fayetteville Road from being blocked by a vehicle waiting for a gap to turn left into the site. The
addition of an eastbound left turn lane has also been analyzed with the improvements.

Widen Stonebridge Blvd for Right Turn Lane
The recommendation (also from the Base conditions) includes a southbound right turn lane from
Stonebridge Boulevard onto Lower Fayetteville Road. This improvement will allow for
additional stacking on the southbound approach, which will prevent vehicles from backing into
the roundabout.

Sight Distance
The AASHTO minimum sight distance requirement for vehicles making a left turn from a side
street is 500' for two-lane, 45 mph roadways. Field observations indicate that there is


                                                                          A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                30
approximately 510' of sight distance looking west (left) from the site driveway and 440' of sight
distance looking east (right) from the site driveway. Sight distance is limited when looking right
due to trees and vegetation located outside of the right-of-way. It is recommended that some of
these obstructions be removed to improve safety. It should be noted that installation of a signal
would reduce the need for sight distance looking east (right) because of a protected phase that
would stop this approach for the site driveway.

Alternate Site Access Configurations
Alternative layouts, not covered in the scope of this analysis, could further improve the
operations at the site driveway by adding additional access points to the development. These
access points could relieve congestion at the main driveway by providing other routes for
entering and exiting traffic. Possible locations for these access points include:
x Access to Highwoods Parkway ­ This access point would require approximately 500 feet of
    additional roadway to extend from the southeast parking area to Highwoods Parkway. If
    provided, this access point would allow drivers to access Lower Fayetteville Road
    Shenandoah Blvd via Summer Grove Parkway, greatly reducing right turn exits from the
    main access on Lower Fayetteville Rd (depending on how willing drivers would be to utilize
    this route).
x Additional Access to Lower Fayetteville Road (west of the main site driveway) ­ This access
    point would require approximately 350 feet of new roadway to extend from the west parking
    area to Lower Fayetteville Road. This access point would allow drivers alternate access to
    Lower Fayetteville Road, greatly reducing the left turn exits from the main access point,
    which is the main source of delay for this approach.

Lower Fayetteville Road / Summer Grove Parkway /
Shenandoah Boulevard
This intersection's overall level-of-service is expected to declines from LOS `D' to LOS `E' in
the PM peak hour with the added traffic from the proposed development. Most of these declines
are seen as a result of exiting site traffic traveling in the eastbound direction on Lower
Fayetteville Road. In order to mitigate this decline, it is recommended that the split signal
phasing on Shenandoah Blvd and Summer Grove Parkway be replaced with a more efficient
timing.

The recommendation requires that the northbound approach to the intersection from Summer
Grove Parkway be restriped to have a separate dedicated left turn lane (leaving the outside lane
as a shared through / right turn lane). Further improvements would entail an additional
northbound left turn lane (allowing the two northbound through movements to remain). Ideally
the northbound and southbound left turns would be offset from the through movements to
improve sight distance and safety for left-turning drivers at the intersection.

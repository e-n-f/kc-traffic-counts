                             TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
                 Gas Station at North Avenue Intersection with 106th Street
                                  Wauwatosa, Wisconsin


PART A ­ INTRODUCTION
Spring North Corp. has proposed a gas station development on the southwest corner of
the North Avenue intersection at 106th Street in the City of Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. A
traffic impact analysis was conducted by Traffic Analysis & Design, Inc. to determine the
expected weekday morning and evening peak hour operating conditions and
recommendations at the study area intersections for the Year 2012 existing traffic
operating conditions and the Year 2012 build traffic operating conditions. Truck turning
templates were also evaluated as part of the analysis.
This report documents the procedures, findings and conclusions of the traffic impact
analysis. The analysis identifies recommended improvements based on existing
intersection geometrics, traffic volumes and additional traffic expected to be generated by
the proposed redevelopment.

PART B ­ EXISTING ROADWAYS AND TRAFFIC VOLUMES
Exhibit 1 shows the study area location and study area intersections. The study area
roadways are discussed below.
         North Avenue is an east/west six-lane divided main arterial within the limits of
         the study area, with three travel lanes in the westbound direction and two travel
         lanes with an additional parking lane in the eastbound direction. The parking lane
         also operates as a right-turn lane for the side streets and driveways along North
         Avenue. The posted speed limit on North Avenue is 35-mph. The Year 2010
         Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes on North Avenue were 34,100-
         vpd immediately west of 106th Street. Sidewalks exist along both sides of North
         Avenue within the limits of the study area.
         106th Street is a north/south two-lane undivided local street with an additional
         parking lane along each side within the limits of the study area. The posted speed
         limit on 106th Street is 25-mph. There are currently no AADT volumes available
         on 106th Street. Sidewalks are provided along both sides on 106th Street.
Existing Traffic Volumes
Weekday morning (7:00 to 9:00 am) and evening (3:00 to 6:00 pm) peak hour traffic
turning movement counts were conducted for a typical weekday in early-October of 2012
at the North Avenue intersection with 106th Street. Based on these peak hour counts, the
weekday morning and weekday evening peak hours were identified as being 7:30 to 8:30
am and 4:30 to 5:30 pm, respectively. The existing traffic peak hour traffic volumes,
shown on Exhibit 4, were utilized for the traffic operational analysis. The traffic counts
used to determine the peak hour traffic volumes, peak hour factors, and truck percents for
the study area intersection has been included in the appendix of this report.

PART C ­ EXISTING TRAFFIC OPERATING CONDITIONS
The study area intersections were analyzed based on the procedures set forth in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Intersection operation is defined by "level of
service". Level of Service (LOS) is a quantitative measure that refers to the overall
quality of flow at an intersection ranging from very good, represented by LOS `A', to
very poor, represented by LOS `F'. For the purpose of this study, LOS D has been
defined as the acceptable LOS for peak hour operating conditions. Descriptions of the
various levels of service are as follows:
         LOS A is the highest level of service that can be achieved. Under this condition,
         intersection approaches appear quite open, turning movements are easily made,
         and nearly all drivers find freedom of operation. At signalized and unsignalized
         intersections, average delays are less than 10 seconds.
         LOS B represents stable operation. At signalized intersections, average vehicle
         delays are 10 to 20 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 10
         to 15 seconds.
         LOS C still represents stable operation, but periodic backups of a few vehicles
         may develop behind turning vehicles. Most drivers begin to feel restricted, but
         not objectionably so. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays are 20 to
         35 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 15 to 25 seconds.
         LOS D represents increasing traffic restrictions as the intersection approaches
         instability. Delays to approaching vehicles may be substantial during short peaks
         within the peak period, but periodic clearance of long lines occurs, thus
         preventing excessive backups. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays
         are 35 to 55 seconds. At unsignalized intersections, average delays are 25 to 35
         seconds.
         LOS E represents the capacity of the intersection. At signalized intersections,
         average vehicle delays are 55 to 80 seconds. At unsignalized intersections,
         average delays are 35 to 50 seconds.
         LOS F represents jammed conditions where the intersection is over capacity and
         acceptable gaps for unsignalized intersections in the mainline traffic flow are
         minimal. At signalized intersections, average vehicle delays exceed 80 seconds.
         At unsignalized intersections, average delays exceed 50 seconds.
Table 1 shows the results of the weekday morning and evening peak hour operational
analysis at the study area intersections. The existing intersection geometrics shown on
the transportation detail, Exhibit 3, along with the existing weekday morning and evening
peak hour traffic volumes, Exhibit 4, were used for the analysis.

      As shown in Table 1, all traffic turning movements at the study area intersection
      currently operate at LOS D or better conditions during the weekday morning and evening
      peak periods. It is noted that this analysis was completed using traffic volumes without
      the existing credit union in operation.
      Delay & Queuing Analysis
      A delay and queuing analysis was also performed at the North Avenue intersection with
      106th Street during a typical weekday morning and weekday evening peak hour to
      determine if there are currently excessive delays and queuing under today's existing peak
      hour conditions. Table 2 shows the number of vehicles waiting to make a northbound
      left-turn onto North Avenue from 106th Street and the number of seconds of delay those
      vehicles were required to wait in order to make the movement. It is noted that the
      threshold for LOS D is 35 seconds.

      Note: * One vehicle waited 36 seconds. **One vehicle waited 45 seconds.

      As shown in Table 2, all but one vehicle making a northbound left-turn movement at the
      North Avenue intersection with 106th Street were required to wait less than 35 seconds
      (LOS D threshold) during both the weekday morning and weekday evening peak periods.
      In other words, on a typical weekday, only one vehicle had to wait more than 35 seconds
      to turn left onto North Avenue from 106th Street during the morning and evening peak
      hours with those 2 vehicles waiting 36 seconds and 45 seconds, respectively. It was also
      reported that at no point during the typical weekday morning and weekday evening peak

hours did more than one vehicle have to wait to make a northbound left-turn or right-turn
movement under current conditions. The traffic counts showing the exact delays for each
movement have been included in the appendix of this report.

PART D ­ PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
To address any potential future traffic impacts along study area roadways and at the
intersections adjacent to the development, it is necessary to identify the hourly and daily
volume of traffic generated by the proposed development. The expected traffic volumes
generated by the development are based on the size and type of the proposed land use,
and on trip rates as published in the Institute of Transportation Engineer's (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual, 8th Edition, 2009.
Development Description and Site Location
A new gas station development is proposed to be located on the southwest corner of the
North Avenue intersection with 106th Street. The existing site is currently occupied by a
vacant credit union with 4 drive-thru lanes. Exhibit 2 shows the site plan for the
proposed development. The following land use is proposed to occupy the development
site:
              Gas Station with Convenience Store (8 fueling positions).
Access to the gas station is proposed via two new full access driveways, one on 106th
Street immediately south of North Avenue and the other along the adjacent alley located
immediately south of the site. The alley connects 106th and 107th Streets and provides
access to a large parking lot immediately to the south which services the adjacent
commercial users.
On-Site Trip Generation
The expected trip generation for the full build out of the proposed gas station is shown in
Exhibit 5a. Note that approximately 50-percent of the development trips are expected to
be pass-by trips (per the ITE Trip Generation Guidelines).
As shown in Exhibit 5a, the proposed gas station is expected to generate 80 new trips (40
entering/40 exiting) during a typical weekday morning peak hour of which approximately
40 trips are expected to be pass-by trips resulting in 40 driveway trips (20 entering/20
exiting). During the typical weekday evening peak hour, the proposed gas station is
expected to generate 105 new trips (55 entering/50 exiting) of which approximately 50
trips are expected to be pass-by trips resulting in 55 driveway trips (30 entering/25
exiting). On a typical weekday (24-hour period), the proposed gas station is expected to
generate 1,300 new trips of which approximately 650 trips are expected to be pass-by
trips resulting in 650 driveway trips (325 entering/325 exiting) upon full build out of the
development.
In addition, a comparison was completed to show the difference in trips expected
between the previous credit union and the proposed gas station. Since the credit union
was not operational at the time of this study, the previous credit union trips were
determined based on the trip generation rates as published in the ITE Trip Generation
Manual as described above. As shown in Exhibit 5b, the previous credit union is
expected to generate 20 driveway trips (15 entering/5 exiting) during a typical weekday

morning peak hour. During the typical weekday evening peak hour, the previous credit
union is expected to generate 50 driveway trips (25 entering/25 exiting). On a typical
weekday (24-hour period), the previous credit union is expected to generate 280
driveway trips (140 entering/140 exiting).
Exhibit 5c shows the comparison in tabular format with the total additional new trips
shown. As shown in Exhibit 5c the difference in trips expected to be generated by the
proposed gas station include 20 new driveway trips (5 entering/15 exiting) during a
typical weekday morning peak hour and 5 new driveway trips (5 entering/0 exiting)
during a typical weekday evening peak hour. On a typical weekday (24-hour period), the
difference in trips expected to be generated by the proposed gas station is 370 new
driveway trips (185 entering/185 exiting).
Trip Distribution & Assignment
The trip distribution for the proposed development was based on existing traffic patterns
(Analogy Method) and the location of regionally populated areas both inside and outside
the City of Wauwatosa (Gravity Model Method). The trip distributions used are shown
in tabular format on the bottom of Exhibit 5.
              50% to and from the east on North Avenue;
              50% to and from the west on North Avenue.
Traffic generated by the proposed development was assigned to the adjacent roadway
system based on the above directional distribution to determine additional turning
movement traffic at the study area intersections.
Full Build Traffic Volumes
The development new trips (Exhibit 6a) were added to the development pass-by trips
(Exhibit 6b) to identify the development full build out driveway trips shown in Exhibit 6c.
The Year 2012 Build traffic volumes were identified by adding the proposed
development full build out driveway trips (Exhibit 6c) to the Year 2012 existing traffic
volumes (Exhibit 4). The Year 2012 Build traffic volumes are shown in Exhibit 7.

PART E ­ FULL BUILD TRAFFIC OPERATING CONDITIONS
Year 2012 Build (with Development) Operating Conditions
Table 3 shows the results of the weekday morning and evening peak hour operational
analysis at the study area intersections under the Year 2012 Build (with Development)
traffic peak hour operating conditions. The existing intersection geometrics as shown on
the transportation detail, Exhibit 3, along with the Year 2012 Build (with Development)
weekday morning and evening peak hour traffic volumes, Exhibit 7, were used for the
analysis.

      As shown in Table 3, all traffic turning movements at the study area intersection are
      expected to continue to operate at LOS D or better conditions except the northbound left-
      turn movement at the 106th Street intersection with North Avenue which is expected to
      operate unacceptably at LOS E conditions during the weekday evening peak period under
      the Year 2012 Build (with Development) traffic peak hour operating conditions. However,
      it is noted that the HCM model tends to overestimate delays at stop sign controlled
      intersections and that delays at the intersection will likely be less than those reported and
      therefore should operate acceptably under all peak periods. In addition, it should be noted
      that the traffic volumes for this movement under the Year 2012 Build (with Development)
      traffic weekday evening peak hour are expected to be less than the volumes that were
      occurring previously while the credit union was operational.
      All other intersections are expected to operate acceptably under the Year 2012 Build
      (with Development) traffic conditions with the existing geometrics and traffic control.
      Design Year 2012 Build (with Development) Operating Conditions with
      Improvements
      As previously illustrated, one movement at the study area intersections may operate at
      LOS E conditions under the Year 2012 Build (with Development) traffic conditions for
      the weekday evening peak hour as shown in Table 3. The following recommended
      improvements, as shown in Exhibit 8, were evaluated to provide safe and efficient traffic
      operations through the Year 2012 with the development constructed and fully
      operational.
           North Avenue at 106th Street
                       Provide a "No U-Turn" sign in the median for the eastbound movement.
           North Avenue at North Driveway
                       Provide a stop controlled driveway onto 106th Street, immediately south of
                       North Avenue.

Even with the improvements recommended above, the northbound left-turn movement at
the North Avenue intersection with 106th Street may operate at LOS E conditions during
the weekday evening peak hour under the Year 2012 Build (with Development) traffic
conditions. However, it is noted that the HCM model tends to overestimate delays at stop
sign controlled intersections and that delays at the intersection will likely be less than
those reported and therefore should operate acceptably under all peak periods. In
addition, it should be noted that the traffic volumes for this movement under the Year
2012 Build (with Development) traffic weekday evening peak hour are expected to be less
than the volumes that were occurring previously while the credit union was operational.
A queuing analysis was also completed as part of the study. As shown in Exhibit 9, the
expected maximum queue length for the northbound left-turn movement is expected to be
30-feet during the typical weekday evening peak hour. The proposed development
driveway onto 106th Street is located at approximately 30-feet south of the stop line.
Vehicles waiting to exit the site may be required to stop within the site prior to exiting
onto 106th Street. However, based on the site layout, most vehicles patronizing the gas
station are expected to enter the site via the 106th Street driveway and exit the site via the
alley driveway. The only vehicles expected to exit the site at the 106th Street driveway
are the vehicles that would enter along the alley. Therefore, queuing at 106th Street is not
expected to be a problem for the 106th Street driveway location.

PART F ­ TRUCK TURNING TEMPLATES
Truck turning templates were prepared by BMR Design Group, Inc. to show the expected
travel path for tanker trucks delivering fuel to the site. Exhibit 10 shows the expected
travel path for these trucks with the trucks turning south onto 106th Street from North
Avenue, heading west at the alley and then entering the site from the proposed driveway
along the alley. The trucks would then exit the site at the 106th Street driveway, travel
south on 106th Street, again turn west at the alley and continue through the alley to 107th
Street where they would continue north on 107th Street to exit onto North Avenue
heading east. Turning templates showing a northbound left-turn movement and a
northbound right-turn movement onto North Avenue are also shown (even though the
templates are shown at 106th Street, these movements are expected to work at 107th Street
as well). Finally, a turning template showing a truck exiting the site at the driveway
closest to North Avenue is also shown. As this last template shows, trucks exiting the
site at this driveway wouldn't be able to make a left-turn movement without blocking
traffic heading southbound on 106th Street; therefore, trucks exiting at this driveway
would be required to turn south out of the driveway to exit the site as described above.

PART G ­ RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Recommended Improvements
Based on the results of the analysis performed at the study area intersections, the
following improvements, as shown on Exhibit 8, are recommended for the Year 2012
Build (with Development) traffic conditions. Note that LOS D or better conditions were
used to define acceptable peak hour operating conditions at the study area intersections.

    North Avenue at 106th Street
              Provide a "No U-Turn" sign in the median for the eastbound movement.
    North Avenue at North Driveway
              Provide a stop controlled driveway onto 106th Street, immediately south of
              North Avenue.
Even with the improvements recommended above, the northbound left-turn movement at
the North Avenue intersection with 106th Street may operate at LOS E conditions during
the weekday evening peak hour under the Year 2012 Build (with Development) traffic
conditions. However, it is noted that the HCM model tends to overestimate delays at stop
sign controlled intersections and that delays at the intersection will likely be less than
those reported and therefore should operate acceptably under all peak periods. In
addition, it should be noted that the traffic volumes for this movement under the Year
2012 Build (with Development) traffic weekday evening peak hour are expected to be less
than the volumes that were occurring previously while the credit union was operational.
A queuing analysis was also completed as part of the study. As shown in Exhibit 9 the
expected maximum queue length for the northbound left-turn movement is expected to be
30-feet during the typical weekday evening peak hour. The proposed development
driveway onto 106th Street is located at approximately 30-feet south of the stop line.
Vehicles waiting to exit the site may be required to stop within the site prior to exiting
onto 106th Street. However, based on the site layout, most vehicles patronizing the gas
station are expected to enter the site via the 106th Street driveway and exit the site via the
alley driveway. The only vehicles expected to exit the site at the 106th Street driveway
are the vehicles that would enter along the alley. Therefore, queuing at 106th Street is not
expected to be a problem for the 106th Street driveway location.
Conclusion
Safe and efficient traffic operations are expected at the study area intersection with the
recommended geometrics and traffic control improvements under the Year 2012 Build
(with Development) traffic conditions.

Executive Summary

Dewberry Engineers Inc. (Dewberry) and Ramey Kemp & Associates Inc. (RKA) have completed the
Moorefield Bridge Road (Route 863) improvements study for the West Piedmont Planning District
Commission (WPPDC) and the Danville Pittsylvania Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in
cooperation with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), the City of Danville, and
Pittsylvania County. The intent of this study is to define the most advantageous locations for spot
improvements along Moorefield Bridge Road between the intersections with Mount Cross Road (CO RD
750) and Westover Drive (US 51), as well as to determine the need for signalized traffic control. Below is
a summary of the conclusions and recommendations from this study.

    1. Based on the analysis within this report, it is expected that due to the expected growth of this
       area and the existing crash rates, improvements to the existing roadway and associated
       intersections should be identified.

    2. To deal with these deficiencies, three (3) locations for spot improvements have been identified.
       For each location different improvement alternatives were identified. The locations and
       associated improvements are listed below:
       a. Along the curved sections of Moorefield Bridge Road, between River Ridge Road/Pinecrest
            Drive and Red Bud Lane.
            i. Installation of Chevron Warning Signs utilizing Warning Signs W1-1 and W1-8 placed in
                strategic locations.
           ii. Installation of the Warning Signs, as well as pavement widening to add four (4) foot
                paved shoulders on either side.
       b. The intersection of Moorefield Bridge Road and Mount Cross Road.
            i. Addition of 200 foot left turn lanes on the eastbound and westbound approaches and a
                150 foot left turn lane on the northbound approach.
           ii. Construction of a single lane roundabout with widened approaches of each leg.
          iii. Addition of 100 foot left turn lanes on the eastbound, westbound and northbound
                approaches, as well as the installation of a traffic signal.
       c. The intersection of Moorefield Bridge Road and Westover Drive.
            i. Addition of 100 foot left turn lane on the southbound approach.

    3. The alternatives for each location were evaluated using eight (8) criteria to determine the
       preferred alternative for the two spot improvements. The recommended spot improvements
       are listed below for each location.
       a. Location 1: Installation of the Warning Signs, as well as pavement widening to add four (4)
           foot paved shoulders on either side.
       b. Location 2: Addition of 100 foot left turn lanes on the eastbound, westbound and
           northbound approaches, as well as the installation of a traffic signal.
       c. Location 3: Addition of 100 foot left turn lane on the southbound approach.

    4. Through the implementation of these improvements, this segment of Moorefield Bridge Road
       will operate under capacity and with increased safety.

                      MOOREFIELD BRIDGE ROAD ­ PLANNING LEVEL STUDY

I. INTRODUCTION

Dewberry Engineers Inc. (Dewberry) and Ramey Kemp & Associates Inc. (RKA) have completed the
Moorefield Bridge Road (Route 863) improvements study for the West Piedmont Planning District
Commission (WPPDC) and the Danville Pittsylvania Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) in
cooperation with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), the City of Danville, and
Pittsylvania County. The intent of this study is to define the most advantageous locations for spot
improvements along Moorefield Bridge Road between its intersections with Mount Cross Road (County
Road 750) and with Westover Drive (US 51), as well as to determine the need for signalized traffic
control.

This section of Moorefield Road is in both Pittsylvania County and the City of Danville. This road crosses
into Pittsylvania County approximately 300 feet north of the intersection with Westover Drive. (See
Figure 1 for location of roadway section to be analyzed within this report.) This section of roadway was
identified for improvement within the Year 2035 Long Range Transportation Plan prepared by URS on
August 16, 2010. The improvements, listed within the Roadway Vision Plan include constructing a
roadway on a new alignment to allow for better access from Route 863 to US 58 and the Danville
Bypass. This need was identified in conjunction with the proposed Mega Park located along Berry Hill
Road. For the purposes of this study, it is anticipated that Moorefield Bridge Road will remain on its
current alignment.

This study will provide the WPPDC, MPO, and local governments with a planning level document that
details multiple alternatives for improving the safety and capacity of Moorefield Bridge Road for the
Year 2035. In order to determine these alternatives, the following are addressed within this study:

    1.   Identification of Existing Conditions;
    2.   Discussion of Possible Environmental Constraints;
    3.   Review of Existing Traffic Safety;
    4.   Analysis of the No-Build Alternative;
    5.   Statement of Purpose and Need; and
    6.   Improvement Alternatives.

From the improvement alternatives developed within this report, one preferred alternative will be
recommended for future design and construction.

II. EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

A description of each existing road within the study area is provided below.

Moorefield Bridge Road (Route 863) is classified as an Urban Minor Arterial from Westover Drive to
Route 873, and is a Rural Major Collector from Route 873 to Mount Cross Road. The posted speed limit
along this road is 45 miles per hour (MPH). The typical road section includes two 10-foot lanes with no
shoulders. The horizontal and vertical alignments follow the natural terrain with limited passing zones
or no passing zones.

   FINAL REPORT                                                   Moorefield Bridge Road - Planning Level Study




Westover Drive (US 51) is classified as an Urban Minor Arterial with a posted speed limit of 40 MPH.
The typical road section includes a four-lane undivided roadway (two lanes in each direction) with lane
widths of 10 feet. The horizontal alignment is primarily straight, with very subtle horizontal curves. The
vertical alignment generally approximates the adjacent rolling terrain.

Pinecrest Drive/River Ridge Road (Route 873) is a two-lane rural road with a posted speed limit of 45
MPH. The typical road section includes two lanes with a lane width of 10 feet. The shoulders along this
road are limited. The horizontal alignment follows a windy path with multiple horizontal curves.

Mount Cross Road (Route 750) is a Rural Major Collector with a posted speed limit of 45 MPH. The
typical road section includes 11-foot lanes with limited or no shoulder. This road serves as an east-west
route for local traffic to Danville.

Bicycle and pedestrian facilities are not present within the project limits. Review of the West Piedmont
Regional Bicycle Plan, prepared by Kimley-Horn & Associates and revised September 2007, revealed that
Moorefield Bridge Road is not seen as a possible bicycle route. This study, however, will consider how
to accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians so as to conform to the Commonwealth Transportation
Board's (CTB) policy.

Existing Roadway Volumes and Levels of Service

To determine the peak hour volumes within the study area, turning movement counts for the AM and
PM peak periods were conducted by RKA on February 5th and 6th, 2013, and are included in Appendix A
for reference. A review of the traffic counts indicates the AM and PM peak hours occurred at different
times at each intersection. It should be noted that for the purpose of this study, the peak hour volumes
at each intersection were assumed to occur simultaneously. The turning movement counts were taken
at the following intersections:

    1. Moorefield Bridge Road and Westover Drive
    2. Moorefield Bridge Road and River Ridge Road/Pinecrest Drive
    3. Moorefield Bridge Road/Laniers Mill Road and Mount Cross Road

The existing intersection geometry and traffic control devices are presented in Figure 2; and the existing
(2013) traffic volumes are presented in Figure 3.

Using the existing traffic volumes shown in Figure 3, the existing levels of service were determined for
each intersection.

The levels of service for each intersection are shown in Figure 4. As can be seen, all approaches
currently operate at acceptable levels of service and only the northbound (AM and PM peak hour) and
southbound (PM peak hour) approaches at the intersection with Mount Cross Road operate at Level of
Service (LOS) C.

Table 1 also shows the existing LOSs for each intersection.

* Please note that the LOSs are reported in accordance with the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 designations.


The complete LOS analysis for the existing conditions is included in Appendix C for reference.

All analysis was performed utilizing the methodologies as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM). The measurement used to define the performance of an intersection is determined by LOS A
through F. A LOS C or better will be considered an acceptable LOS for this area. See Appendix B for a
more detailed explanation of the methodology and criteria used for the LOS analysis.

Bicycle and Pedestrian

Currently Moorefield Bridge Road (Route 863) does not support bicycle or pedestrian traffic along the
section analyzed within this report. This study will consider the accommodation of bicyclists and
pedestrians along this section of road to adhere to CTB policy. Review of the West Piedmont Regional
Bicycle Plan, revised September 2007, revealed that Moorefield Bridge Road is not a planned bike route.

Environmental Resources

This section describes the potential environmental resources within the proposed project area. Table 2
summarizes potential environmental issues and recommendations on addressing potential impacts to
those resources. Additional environmental resources that are not included in the table may exist within
the proposed project area.

Resources/Issue           Comments
Cultural Resources        A review of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps and aerials
                          identified three cemeteries within the study area. The first is located
                          between Page Road and Westover Drive approximately 150 feet west of
                          Moorefield Bridge Road, the second is located approximately 300 feet south
                          of Red Bud Lane abutting the northbound lane of Moorefield Bridge Road,
                          and the third is located abutting the eastbound lane of Mount Cross Road
                          approximately 1,900 feet east of Moorefield Bridge Road. Further review of
                          these resources should be conducted. We reviewed the Virginia Department
                          of Historic Resources Data Sharing Service (DSS) database online and it noted
                          no known or mapped resources within the project corridor. The absence of
                          mapped resources does not mean resources are not present in the project
                          corridor; the absence could be due to a lack of survey information. A Phase I
                          survey should be conducted once the proposed improvements are
                          identified.

Waters of the United      We reviewed the National Wetland Inventory Geographic Information
States, including         System (GIS) online mapper. It noted 7-10 adjacent Palustrine Open Water
wetlands                  ponds located within the project corridor; note the absence of other wetland
                          types mapped does not mean those resources are not present in the
                          corridor. A Waters of the United States/Wetland delineation should be
                          conducted once an alternative is identified. Review of U.S. Geological Survey
                          (USGS) topographic maps and aerials indicated 3 or 4 locations, including the
                          Sandy River, that likely contain unmapped jurisdictional waters/wetlands.

Water Quality Permits     This roadway appears to follow a topographic ridge and only minor drainage
                          crossing and headwater wetland areas exist. Permitting scenarios will vary
                          depending on verification of wetland and stream locations and the location
                          of construction activities. In comparison to similar projects, impacts
                          generally will fit general permits from both Virginia Department of
                          Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Agricultural and Forest   Most of the project corridor is classified as prime farmland or farmland of
Districts, Prime          statewide importance by the Natural Resources Conservation Services
Farmland and Soil         (NRCS). Coordination with NRCS may be necessary when an alternative is
                          identified.

Threatened and         The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service data base (IPaC) documents the potential

Waterfowl Refuges      critical habitat within the project corridor, and certain actions within the
                       project corridor may also affect downstream species. A search of Virginia's
                       Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), and the Virginia
                       Department of Game and Inland Fisheries databases did not note any
                       mapped observations of SE or State Threatened (ST) species within the
                       project corridor. The absence of mapped species observation does not
                       mean SE or ST species are not present. The absence may be related to the
                       lack of a survey. No wildlife or waterfowl refuges are located within the
                       project corridor. A search of DCR's Biotics Data System was submitted and
                       resulted in no documented State-listed plants or insects in the project area.

Hazardous Materials    A review of the Environmental Protection Agency "Enviro-mapper" and the
                       DEQ website "What's in my Backyard" indicates that there are known
                       hazardous material sites (see Figure 5) within the project limits. Acquisitions
                       of land that contain hazardous material will require, at minimum, a Phase I
                       Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) report. Multiple Phase I ESA reports
                       should be anticipated due to the past and current use of existing properties
                       and observation that many areas are used as trash dump sites. Additionally,
                       acquisition of residential or commercial buildings with lead based paint
                       and/or asbestos-containing building materials and/or Recognized
                       Environmental Condition would be considered an issue for the project, and
                       further investigation would be required.

FEMA                   This project crosses one tributary with a Federal Emergency Management
                       Agency (FEMA) mapped floodplain, the Sandy River. The existing road
                       bridges the Sandy River, and improvements within the floodplain may
                       require a floodplain study and coordination with FEMA if there are impacts
                       to the regulated floodplain or a rise in the 100-year water surface elevation.

Well and Septic        Well and septic locations within the project corridor are not known at this
                       time. A request to the Virginia Department of Health for records of locations
                       should be submitted once an alternative is identified. There is a potential for
                       a complete parcel take if a septic system has to be removed and an
                       alternative field and/or public utilities hook up cannot be provided.

Traffic Safety/Crash Data Analysis

Crash data from the most recent 3-year period (2008 to 2010) for the corridor were provided by VDOT.
After review of the data, the results identified one location along the 2.99-mile segment of Moorefield
Bridge Road where multiple crashes occurred. The segment is identified below:

    1. Along Moorefield Bridge Road, just north of the Bridge over the Dan River and South of Red Bud
       Lane.

During this period, nine reported crashes occurred along the study corridor. Of the nine total reported
crashes, five resulted in property damage only (PDO) and four involved at least one injury. No fatalities
were reported. The locations of each individual accident along this section of roadway are shown in
Figure 6. This figure also indicates whether the crash was a PDO or resulted in an injury. Figure 7
graphically summarizes the Moorefield Bridge Road crash history by year. Appendix E contains the crash
data summary sheet.

                                                Figure 7
                                      Severity of Crashes per Year




As displayed in Figure 7 above, an equal number of crashes occurred each year. The types of crashes,
injury or PDO, were approximately equal as well. In addition to the crash severity and total number, the
types and locations of accidents were also analyzed. Figure 8 graphically shows the type and severity of
the nine crashes that occurred between 2008 and 2010.

                                       Type and Severity of Crashes




As displayed in Figure 8 above, most of the crashes were fixed-object, off-road crashes, including both
injury and PDO cases. Probable causes for the high number of fixed object off road crashes could be
factors such as inadequate signage, pavement markings, and/or roadway design. Potential solutions to
consider are the installation of necessary signs, the removal of obstacles or the installation of guardrail,
and the examination of existing roadway design factors such as superelevation.

As part of the safety analysis, the Moorefield Bridge Road corridor was analyzed at three intersections.
The calculated crash rate for Moorefield Bridge Road between Westover Drive and Route 750 is 171.8
per 100 million (M) vehicle miles traveled. The entire corridor has a slightly lower crash rate compared
to the 2008 Statewide Average crash rate of 185 per 100M vehicle miles traveled.

Intersections were examined based on factors such as traffic control method, lane geometry, and the
number of approaches. According to the crash summary data sheet, only one of the accidents occurred
at the three intersections analyzed within this report.

III. FUTURE NO-BUILD ALTERNATIVE (YEAR 2035)

Utilizing information obtained from the regional traffic model received from VDOT for this area, RKA
projected future no-build traffic volumes. Annual growth rates were approximated for the associated
movements based on 2006 and 2035 average daily traffic data at the following intersections.

Intersection of Moorefield Bridge Road and Westover Drive
Eastbound and westbound through movements on Westover Drive: 1.0%
All remaining movements on Westover Drive and Moorefield Bridge Road: 4.9%

Intersection of Moorefield Bridge Road and River Ridge Road/Pinecrest Drive
Northbound and southbound through movements on Moorefield Bridge Road: 3.7%

All remaining movements on Moorefield Bridge Road, River Ridge Road, and Pinecrest Drive: 1.0%

Intersection of Moorefield Bridge Road/Laniers Mill Road and Mount Cross Road
Eastbound and westbound through movements on Mount Cross Road: 1.7%
Eastbound right-turn movement and westbound left-turn movement on Mount Cross Road, as well as
Northbound left and right-turn movements on Moorefield Bridge Road: 3.7%
All remaining movements on Mount Cross Road, Moorefield Bridge Road, and Lanier Mills Road: 4.1%

From the approximated annual growth rates, the future no-build traffic volumes were determined as
shown in Figure 9. Utilizing these traffic volumes, the future no-build intersection LOS analysis was
completed. As shown in Figure 10, the LOSs for some approaches will deteriorate to unacceptable levels
(LOS D and below) at only one intersection. The LOSs for the no-build alternative are also shown in
Table 3 below.

* Please note that the LOSs are reported in accordance with the HCM designations.


The complete LOS analysis for the future no-build condition is included in Appendix E.

The most severe deterioration is expected to occur at the intersection of Mount Cross Road on the
northbound and southbound approaches. As shown in the table above, the highlighted LOSs are those
that have been reduced to unacceptable levels. At this intersection, the poor service levels result from
the increase in forecasted traffic volumes along Mount Cross Road, reducing the frequency of adequate
gaps in the traffic stream and causing increased delays on the Moorefield Bridge Road approaches
before motorists safely enter the traffic stream. As shown by this analysis, improvements to this
intersection are required if acceptable LOSs are to be achieved in the year 2035.

IV. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND NEED

Considering VDOT Access Management Standards and the results of the existing and forecasted (Year
2035) conditions analysis, the Statement of Purpose and Need for the Moorefield Bridge Road
Evaluation of Improvements Study is based upon addressing the following issues:

    1. LOSs at intersections, within the study limits, are anticipated to fall below acceptable levels
       unless improvements are made based on signal warrants and intersection analysis;
    2. Safety and mobility shall be preserved or increased through implementation of identified spot
       improvements; and
    3. Accommodations for bicyclists and pedestrians should be considered along Moorefield Bridge
       Road to adhere to CTB Policy.

The improvement alternatives will be developed to best satisfy the requirements of the above
guidelines.

V. IMPROVEMENT ALTERNATIVES

Multiple improvement alternatives to this section of Moorefield Bridge Road will be analyzed within this
study. In order to determine which alternative best meets the needs of this section of roadway,
evaluation criteria were developed. Eight factors were rated by importance on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5
being the most important. These items are shown in Table 4 below.

Based on the findings of the future no-build capacity analysis, the Mount Cross Road intersection does
not meet adequate capacity requirements. All other intersections analyzed within this study will still
operate at acceptable levels in the Year 2035 with no improvements. In addition to the capacity
analysis, a review of the crash data was completed and a need for improvements was identified. It is
also understood that there are public concerns regarding the current operation at the intersection of
Westover Drive and Moorefield Bridge Road. Three locations for alternative spot improvements have
been identified along this corridor and are shown in Figure 11.

   FINAL REPORT                                                   Moorefield Bridge Road - Planning Level Study




The alternative improvements shown in Figure 11 are divided into three locations. The first area is along
the curved sections of Moorefield Bridge Road, between River Ridge Road/Pinecrest Drive and Red Bud
Lane. The remaining two locations are at the intersections of Moorefield Bridge Road with Mount Cross
Road and Moorefield Bridge Road with Westover Drive. Through the implementation of these
improvements, the safety and capacity along this stretch of road should be improved. Because the
remaining intersection analyzed within this report will operate at acceptable LOSs in the Year 2035, and
the majority of crashes occur within the section identified above, no other improvements are suggested
along this corridor.

Roadway Spot Improvement Alternatives

As identified in Figure 11, two alternatives for roadway improvements along Moorefield Bridge Road
between River Ridge Road/Pinecrest Drive and Red Bud Lane were developed. Alternative 1 consists of
installing Chevron Warning Signs, specifically Warning Signs W1-2 and W1-8 from the 2009 Edition of
the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), in strategic locations to inform drivers traveling
in either direction of the upcoming horizontal curves. This alternative improvement is shown in Figure
12. With the installation of these signs, the potential for crashes is anticipated to decrease. The
preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately
$22,300 to design and construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix F.

Alternative 2 consists of installing Chevron Warning Signs, as suggested in Alternative 1, as well as
pavement widening to add 4-foot paved shoulders on both sides. The pavement widening will be
limited to the section of road between River Ridge Road/Pinecrest Drive and Red Bud Lane. These
improvements are shown in Figure 13. With the exception of one area, the paved shoulders will be
widened from the existing edge of pavement. The one exception is a section of road located adjacent to
a cemetery, where the alignment of Moorefield Bridge Road will have to be shifted to the northwest to
avoid affecting the cemetery. In conjunction with the realignment and relocation, the vertical alignment
in this area should be lowered to improve sight distance. Also, power utility poles are located along this
stretch of road and will either need to be avoided or relocated. The preliminary estimate of probable
cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately $1,550,800 to design and construct. A
more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix F.

In review of the two alternatives described above, both will increase safety, but only one will help
increase capacity. Using the Evaluation Criteria identified in Table 4, the two alternatives were
compared to determine the preferred alternative. Section VI of this report will show the details of this
comparison and indicate the preferred alternative.

Intersection of Moorefield Bridge and Mount Cross Road Improvement Alternatives

Three alternatives for improvements at the intersection of Moorefield Bridge Road and Mount Cross
Road were developed. Alternative 1 consists of the addition of 200-foot left turn lanes on the
eastbound and westbound approaches and a 150-foot left-turn lane on the northbound approach. As a
result of adding these turn lanes, Mount Cross Road and Moorefield Bridge Road will be widened to the
north and east, respectively. These improvements are shown in Figure 14. Because both roads will be
widened, the existing power utility poles may have to be relocated, thereby adding to the cost of the
improvements. The addition of these turn lanes will reduce delays and improve operation on the stop-
controlled approaches, but the northbound approach of Moorefield Bridge Road is expected to operate
at LOS E and F during the AM and PM peak hours. The southbound approach of Laniers Mill Road is
expected to operate at LOSs D and F. The intersection LOSs are shown in Table 5 below.

The LOSs for the minor road approaches will still be considered unacceptable for this location. The
preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these improvements could cost approximately
$1,470,000 to design and construct. A more detailed breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix H.

Alternative 2 consists of constructing a single-lane roundabout with widened approaches of each leg.
See Figure 15 for an illustration of these improvements and associated LOSs. These improvements will
raise the LOSs to the acceptable range, but will create many conflicts with the existing topography,
existing properties, and existing utilities. In particular, the property located in the southwest quadrant
of this intersection will be significantly affected. Specifically, the existing building located on this
property will have to be removed, potentially requiring additional environmental research and analysis.
The intersection LOSs resulting from these improvements are shown in Table 6 below.

As can be seen in Table 6, the construction of the roundabout will increase delays along the major route,
Mount Cross Road, and reduce the LOS for the eastbound and westbound approaches to LOS C in the
AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates that these
improvements could cost approximately $2,009,000 to design and construct. A more detailed
breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix H.

Alternative 3 consists of the addition of 100-foot left turn lanes on the eastbound, westbound, and
northbound approaches, as well as the installation of a traffic signal. Based on an evaluation of the
MUTCD Traffic Signal Warrants, Warrants 1A (8-Hour Vehicular Volume), 2 (4-Hour Vehicular Volume),
and 3B (Peak Hour) are met. The traffic signal warrant analysis is included in Appendix I for reference.
With the addition of these turn lanes, Mount Cross Road and Moorefield Bridge Road will be widened to
the north and east, respectively. These improvements will create conflicts with the existing power utility
poles, which will need to be relocated adding to the cost of the improvements. Figure 16 shows the
improvements for this alternative. Based on these improvements, the LOSs will be increased to
acceptable levels with no approaches below an LOS B. The intersection LOSs resulting from these
improvements are shown in Table 7 below.

As can be seen in the Table 7 above, the installation of the traffic signal will increase the delay along the
major route, Mount Cross Road, and reduce the LOS for the eastbound and westbound approaches to
LOS B in the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The preliminary estimate of probable cost indicates
that these improvements could cost approximately $1,709,000 to design and construct. A more detailed
breakdown of the cost is included in Appendix H.

In review of the three alternatives described above, all will increase the capacity of the intersection, but
to different levels. Using the Evaluation Criteria identified in Table 4, the three alternatives were
compared to determine the preferred alternative. Section VI of this report shows the details of this
comparison and indicates the preferred alternative.

Intersection of Moorefield Bridge and Westover Drive Improvement Alternatives

It is our understanding that there are public concerns regarding the current operation of this
intersection. Therefore, a traffic signal warrant analysis was performed at the intersection of Westover
Drive and Moorefield Bridge Road as part of this study, although acceptable LOSs are expected. Based
on an evaluation of the MUTCD Traffic Signal Warrants, no Warrants are met at this location. The traffic
signal warrant analysis is included in Appendix L for reference. However, in order to alleviate these
concerns, and separate the anticipated turn movements on Moorefield Bridge Road, Dewberry and RKA
recommend that the southbound approach of Moorefield Bridge Road be widened to provide a 100-foot

                                                                    26

left turn lane. After reviewing the existing site conditions, it was determined that the addition of a left-
turn lane and associated widening to the east be recommended in lieu of a right turn. The right-turn
lane would be widened to the west toward existing buildings that could be within the clear zone once
the turn lane is constructed, thus increasing the mitigation and right-of-way costs.

Along with the close proximity of existing buildings, existing utility poles run along the west side of
Moorefield Bridge Road that would need to be relocated should the right-turn lane be installed, adding
to the cost of the improvements. The recommendation to widen Moorefield Bridge Road to the east for
the construction of a left-turn lane, as shown in Figure 17, was based on the lesser impacts to existing
utilities and right-of-way, which ultimately would shorten the construction schedule. Because both
roads would be widened, any conflicting power utility poles would have to be relocated, adding to the
cost of the improvements. The addition of the turn lane will reduce delays and improve operation on the
stop-controlled approach. The intersection LOSs are shown in Table 8 below.

VI. PREFERRED SPOT IMPROVEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Three locations along this segment of Moorefield Bridge Road have been identified for improvement
based on safety and capacity issues. The first area is along the curved sections of Moorefield Bridge
Road, between River Ridge Road/Pinecrest Drive and Red Bud Lane. The remaining two locations are at
the intersections of Moorefield Bridge Road with Mount Cross Road and Moorefield Bridge Road with
Westover Drive. Two alternative improvements are shown for the first location, three alternative
improvements are shown for the second location, and one alternative is shown for the third location. As
described in the previous section, the alternatives will vary in cost and benefit to the roadway.

Beginning with Location 1, both alternatives will increase safety, but only one will help increase capacity.
Dewberry and RKA recommend that Alternative 2 (Figure 13) be selected as the Preferred Alternative.
This alternative includes the installation of Warning Signs, as well as pavement widening to add 4-foot
paved shoulders on either side. These improvements will not only provide increased safety, but will also
increase the capacity and system performance along this section of road. Even with the higher cost,
these improvements will have long-lasting impacts. This improvement is primarily focused on increasing
the safety along this stretch of road. The alternative improvements at Location 2 are focused on
increasing the capacity and bringing the future no-build levels of service up to the acceptable range.

All three alternatives for Location 2 will increase the capacity of the intersection, but to differing levels
and costs. Dewberry and RKA recommend that Alternative 3 (Figure 16) be selected as the Preferred
Alternative. This alternative includes the addition of 100-foot left-turn lanes on the eastbound,
westbound, and northbound approaches, as well as the installation of a traffic signal. These
improvements will provide the highest increases in capacity and LOSs at this intersection. Also, based
on an evaluation of the MUTCD Traffic Signal Warrants, Warrants 1A (8-Hour Vehicular Volume), 2 (4-
Hour Vehicular Volume), and 3B (Peak Hour) are met at this intersection in the Year 2035. The
alternative improvement at Location 3 is focused on increasing the capacity.

The alternative for Location 3 will increase the capacity and improve the LOSs on Moorefield Bridge
Road at this intersection. This alternative includes the addition of a 100-foot left turn lane on the
southbound approach.

With the implementation of these alternative improvements at the three locations, not only will the
safety along this segment of Moorefield Bridge Road be improved, but each intersection will operate at
an acceptable LOS in the Year 2035.

               LEVEL OF SERVICE METHODS AND CRITERIA
METHODOLOGY AND CRITERIA USED FOR THE LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS

All analyses were completed using the methodology outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)
2010 published by the Transportation Research Board. The computer software package of Synchro
(Version 8) was utilized to perform all signalized and unsignalized analyses at the study intersections
while SIDRA INTERSECTION 5.1 was utilized for roundabout analysis.

The HCM 2010 defines capacity as "the maximum sustainable hourly flow rate at which persons or
vehicles reasonably can be expected to traverse a point or a uniform section of a lane or roadway during
a given time period under prevailing roadway, environmental, traffic, and control conditions". Level of
service (LOS) is a term used to represent different driving conditions, and is defined as "a qualitative
stratification of a performance measure or measures that represent quality of service". Level of service
varies from Level "A" representing free flow to Level "F" where greater vehicle delays are evident. Refer
to the Table below for a summary of levels of service and related average control delay per vehicle for
both signalized and unsignalized intersections as well as roundabouts. Control delay as defined by the
HCM includes "vehicles slowing in advance of an intersection, the time spent stopped on an intersection
approach, the time spent as vehicles move up in the queue, and the time needed for vehicles to
accelerate to their desired speed". As shown in the Table, a control delay of 40 seconds at a signalized
intersection results in a LOS D operation.

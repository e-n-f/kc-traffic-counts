proposed by SummerHill Homes. The Town of Moraga requests your comments on the scope
and content of the environmental information which is germane to your agency's statutory
responsibilities in connection with the proposed project, in accordance with Section 15082(b) of
the CEQA Guidelines. Your agency may opt to use the EIR prepared by our agency when
considering your permit or other approval for the project. The project description and location
are described briefly below. More details about the project and its potential environmental
effects are discussed in the Initial Study, prepared pursuant to Section 15063 of the CEQA
Guidelines. A copy of the Initial Study is being transmitted to public agencies along with this
Notice of Preparation (NOP). Other interested parties may obtain a copy from the Town of
Moraga Planning Department, located at 329 Rheem Boulevard. An electronic copy may be

Project Location
The approximately 14.26-acre project site is located on Camino Ricardo in central Moraga,
approximately 950 feet north of the intersection of Camino Ricardo and Moraga Way. The site is
located on an undeveloped hillside property that was previously cultivated as a walnut orchard.
Laguna Creek and a tributary to the creek cross the eastern end of the site and converge at the
southeast corner of the site.

The property is within Sub-Area 6 of the Moraga Center Specific Plan (MCSP). The Assessor's
Parcel Number (APN) is 255-031-029. The project has a General Plan land use designation of
Residential (3 du/ac) and a zoning designation of 3-DUA (Residential, Three Dwelling Units Per
Acre).

Project Description
SummerHill Homes is proposing to develop the site with a residential subdivision of 28 single-
family homes on the western half of the property. All vehicular access to the proposed
subdivision would be via a single private street accessed from Camino Ricardo at the west end
of the site. This street would terminate at the southern property line, allowing for future
connection to the adjacent parcel to the south, which is also designated for future residential
development in the MCSP.

The proposed two-story homes would range in size from approximately 2,600 square feet to
3,100 square feet, and would be located on lots ranging from 6,203 square feet to 20,640
square feet, with an average size of 10,676 square feet. An 1.82-acre open space easement
would extend across the rear of the lots located on the north side of the internal street. Overall,
the proposed 28 homes would result in a density of about 1.96 dwelling units per gross acre
(du/ac), 14 fewer units than allowed by the zoning.

A portion of the eastern half of the site would be developed with a public park, which would be
flanked by two existing riparian corridors that would be largely left intact. Pedestrian bridges
across the two creeks would be constructed to provide access to the park from the proposed
subdivision and from Moraga Road, located to the east of the site. The eastern half of the site
would also include open space and a bio-retention basin to treat stormwater runoff from the site.
Two additional bio-retention basins would be located at the west end of the site.

The eastern portion of the site would remain as open space, including the park. A total of 8.61
acres of the site would be dedicated as open space.

Probable Environmental Effects
The probable environmental effects include impacts to: (1) aesthetics; (2) agricultural resources;
(3) air quality; (4) biological resources; (5) cultural resources; (6) geology and soils; (7)
                                                                                 September 7, 2012
                                                                                           Page 3

hydrology and water quality; (8) land use and planning; (9) public services; (10) transportation
and traffic; and (11) utilities and service systems. Mitigation measures have been identified in
the Initial Study to reduce potential impacts to air quality, cultural resources, geology and soils,
public services, and utilities and service systems to less-than-significant levels, and these
issues will not be addressed further in the EIR. The EIR will be evaluate the project's potential
impacts on the environment, including cumulative impacts, and analyze alternatives to the
project.

Scoping Meeting
Pursuant to Section 15083 of the CEQA Guidelines, the Town of Moraga will conduct a public
scoping meeting on Wednesday, September 19, 2012 at 7:00 p.m. to receive oral comments
on the scope and content of environmental information to be presented in the EIR. The meeting
will be held at the following location:

       Pavilion, Hacienda de las Flores
       2100 Donald Drive
       Moraga, CA 94556

Introduction
In January 2010 the Town of Moraga adopted the Moraga Center Specific Plan (MCSP), which
provides a detailed planning framework for future development around the Moraga Center,
one of the Town's primary shopping and activity areas. The purpose of the MCSP, consistent
with the aims of the General Plan, is to provide a vehicle for ensuring that this area of the Town
is "planned" in order to address important community needs (such as new growth, housing
needs, and environmental protection), accommodate future demand for services (such as sewer,
water, roads, etc.), anticipate and resolve potential constraints (such as crowded roads), and
establish goals and policies for directing and managing growth. The Town certified an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the MCSP in January 2010 in compliance with the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).1

The proposed residential project evaluated in this Initial Study is the first development within
the MCSP planning area since adoption of the MCSP. The Town has determined that the
proposed development has the potential to result in a significant, adverse impact on the
environment, and will therefore prepare an EIR for the project. This Initial Study will be used to
focus certain resource issues out from further consideration in the EIR. The Initial Study
therefore provides limited analysis of issues that will be addressed in detail in the EIR, and
provides sufficient documentation to provide a basis for eliminating other issues from further
consideration the EIR. Where appropriate, the Initial Study references the MCSP EIR, which is
hereby incorporated by reference.

Overview
SummerHill Homes is proposing to develop a residential subdivision of single-family homes on
an approximately 14.26-acre hillside site located in the center of the Town of Moraga, shown on
Figure 1. The project has a General Plan designation of Residential (3 du/ac) and a zoning
designation of 3-DUA (Residential, Three Dwelling Units Per Acre); it is located within the
planning area of the MCSP. Additional details on the project site are provided in Section 9,
below. An aerial overview of the site is provided on Figure 2.

The proposed project would consist of 28 single-family two-story detached homes ranging in
size from approximately 2,500 square feet to 3,100 square feet. Two of the homes would take
access on Camino Ricardo and the remaining 26 homes would be accessed from a new private
street off of Camino Ricardo, as shown on the proposed Vesting Tentative Map (Figure 3) and
Preliminary Landscaping Plan (Figure 4). This street would terminate at the southern property
line, allowing for future connection to the adjacent parcel to the south, which is also planned for
future residential development in the Moraga Center Specific Plan.

Building lots within the subdivision would range from 6,203square feet to 20,640 square feet,
with an average size of 10,676 square feet. Two lots would have their frontage on Camino
Ricardo, with the remainder arrayed along the private street on the western portion of the
project site. The eastern portion of the site would remain as open space, including a park that
would be dedicated to the Town.

Overall, the proposed 28 homes would result in a density of about 1.96 dwelling units per gross
acre (du/ac), 14 fewer units than allowed by the zoning. The applicant is requesting
preservation of density transfer rights for the unused density allotment.

Architectural Design
In order to minimize grading of the hilly site, building pads would generally occupy about half
or less than half of most lots. In addition, on lots with side slopes, the homes would be
constructed on side-to-side split pads, while lots sloping upward would be developed on front-
to-back upslope pads. The project would have a total of eight side-split lots and nine up-split
lots, with the remaining homes built on flat building pads. As explained in more detail in the
discussion on grading, below, about half of the lots would be separated by retaining walls,
allowing the homes to "step up" the hillside, providing further preservation of the natural
contours of the hillside.

The proposed 28 two-story homes would be offered in three architectural styles: Early
California, Bay Area Traditional, and Arts and Crafts. The homes would be finished with
painted stucco, Hardieboard siding and shingles, vertical siding with timber, and brick and
stone masonry accents. Roofing materials would vary, and would include concrete shake tile,
concrete S-tile, and composition shingle. Large front porches and covered rear porches would
provide massing articulation, while design articulation would be provided by fenestration, trim,
and architectural embellishments.

The project applicant plans to offer three floor plans with three to five bedrooms, ranging in size
from 2,600 square feet to 3,100 square feet of living area, all with attached two-car garages. All
homes would be designed to meet at least 70 points on the Build It Green checklist,
demonstrating energy efficiency and sustainability beyond current code requirements. In
addition, solar photovoltaic panels would be offered as an option to buyers and the roof
massing would be designed accordingly to accommodate such panels. All exterior lighting
would be Dark Sky compliant to minimize light pollution.

Circulation and Parking
All vehicular access to the proposed subdivision would be via the single private street,
identified as Street A on the conceptual site plan. Initially, the street would be accessed solely
from Camino Ricardo at the west end of the site. Once the parcels to the south are developed in
the future with additional residential development, consistent with the Moraga Center Specific
Plan, Street A would provide a secondary connection from the south.

The private street would be located within a 34-foot-wide right-of-way (ROW), including a 28-
foot roadway (two 10-foot travel lanes), an 8-foot parking lane along the north side of the street,
and a 5-foot-wide sidewalk adjacent to the parking lane. The eastern end of the street would
provide a turnaround bulb-out similar to a cul-de-sac with an outside turning radius of 41 feet,
and inside turning radius of 30 feet, which would be sufficient for fire-fighting equipment to
turn around, and would comply with Orinda-Moraga Fire District requirements. The roadway
to the south of the turnaround would terminate with a barricade at the southern property
boundary until the future extension is built.

Open Space
There are two creeks in the vicinity of the project area. Laguna Creek extends along the eastern
boundary of the site and, about 350 feet to the west, the Corliss Tributary bisects the site and
conjoins with Laguna Creek at the southeast corner of the site. The triangular peninsula created
by these two drainages on the eastern portion of the site (comprising Parcel E) is proposed as a
public park that would be improved by the applicant and deeded to the Town. Prior to

approval of the Precise Development Plan and Final Subdivision Map, a development plan for
the park will be formulated in conjunction with input from Moraga residents and direction
from the Planning Commission and Parks and Recreation Commission.

A paved path and pedestrian bridge would provide access from the eastern end of the access
street across the Corliss Tributary to the park. A second pedestrian bridge would span Laguna
Creek and provide access to the Town-owned parcel on the east side of the creek. Public
parking for park patrons would be available at Moraga Commons, on the opposite side of
Moraga Road from the park.

Three bio-retention areas would provide passive open space and on-site treatment of
stormwater runoff from the site: Parcel A (0.2 acres), at the western end of the access street;
Parcel B (0.28 acres), in the southwest corner of the site; and Parcel C (1.64 acres), east of the
proposed homes and west of the Corliss Tributary. An additional 1.82 acres of open space
would be provided as private open space easements along the rear of the ten residential lots
located on the north side of the access street. In total, the project would preserve 8.64 acres of
open space. The riparian corridors flanking Laguna Creek and the Corliss Tributary would be
preserved, and Parcel C would be enhanced with new native riparian plantings.

Landscaping
Street trees would be planted throughout the proposed development within the residential
front yards, as shown on Figure 4. The front yards would be landscaped primarily with
drought-tolerant California native or naturalized plant species that would be hydrozoned to
further maximize water efficiency. The private open space areas on lots 1 through 10 would be
planted with native trees, as shown on the Preliminary Landscape Plan (Figure 4).

Grading, Stormwater, and Wastewater
Substantial grading of the hillside site would be required to accommodate the building pads
and limit street grades to 15 percent or less. The central portion of the site proposed for
development is defined by a prominent knoll that reaches a peak elevation of about 636 feet
above mean sea level (msl) near the northern property line. The northern side of the knoll
closest to the existing residences would be preserved intact through an open space easement
that would extend along the rear halves of Lots 1 through 10. The lower portion of the open
space easement, which would include the highest point on the knoll, would be graded with
natural contours and replanted.

Cuts required for building pads would vary. They would be on the order of 1 to 5 feet in the
lower southwest area of the site. Elsewhere, cuts of around 15 feet would be required, while
cuts of 25 to 32 feet would be required on Lots 5 through 7. Fill would be placed on the lots at
the east end of the development to create the proposed building pads, and would range from
around 10 feet to up to 30 feet on Lot 27.

In addition to internal retaining walls on the split pads, retaining walls of 1 to 4 feet in height
would be employed throughout the site to provide structural support to grade separations and
to help minimize grading. The walls would generally be located along lot separations, but
would also be along the back of the building pads on six of the lots (Lots 3 through 8). One 5-
foot-high retaining wall would separate the rear split pad on Lot 9 from the lower Lot 10.

Soil excavated from the cut slopes would be used as fill material for the eastern portion of the
site, both on Lots 9, 10, and 25 through 28, as well as on the open space Parcel C and the
proposed park (Parcel E). Parcel C would be graded with contoured 3:1 slopes and the
emplaced fill would add between approximately 5 and 40 feet of fill to the existing slope.


                                                                                    Initial Study

The proposed park parcel would be built up from its current elevations ranging from about 506
feet msl to 516 feet msl. The edges of the parcel would slope upward with 3:1 slopes, except
along the northern side near the neighboring residential properties, where the slopes would be
5:1. The majority of the parcel would be graded flat, with a finished elevation of about 520 feet
msl.

On the whole, approximately 101,000 cubic yards of soil would be excavated and approximately
93,000 cubic yards of fill would be placed, resulting in about 8,000 cubic yards of excess soil. The
excess soil would to be exported offsite to a location yet to be determined. Grading would result
in street slopes of up to 15 percent, though the majority of the street would have a gradient of 6
percent or less.

To reduce the finished elevation of the park site and allow for more usable park area, the Town
may allow a larger volume of excess soil to be off-hauled from the site. If the pad elevation were
reduced to about 515 feet, the amount of soil requiring off-site disposal would be approximately
17,000 to 20,000 cubic yards.

Stormwater collection and drainage would occur along the proposed street via catch basins
located within the curbs. Collected stormwater from the western portion of the site would be
discharged into one of two bio-retention parcels located at the west end of the development:
Parcel A (0.2 acre) and Parcel B (0.28 acre). These parcels would provide natural treatment of
stormwater through biofiltration. Treated stormwater would then be discharged into the 24-
inch storm drain that runs under Camino Ricardo. (This line steps up from a 15-inch line to a
24-inch line at the northwest corner of the project site.)

Stormwater collected from the eastern portion of the subdivision would be discharged to Parcel
C, a 1.64-acre bio-retention parcel. Following onsite treatment, stormwater from Parcel C
would be discharged from a 15-inch pipe located in the southeast corner of the site to an outfall
located in the adjacent Corliss Tributary, a tributary of Laguna Creek.

A Home Owners' Association (HOA) would maintain all on-site stormwater lines, as well as the
public open spaces, streets, street lighting, and stormwater treatment facilities. The Moraga
Public Works Department would maintain the public park on Parcel E.

The project would create about 2.85 acres of impervious surfaces, and, under Section C.3 of the
Contra Costa Clean Water Program, would require 6,044 square feet of bioretention/treatment
facilities. The project would provide 11,833 square feet of bio-retention basins on Parcels A, B,
and C, exceeding the C.3 requirements.

An 8-inch sanitary sewer line serving the western portion of the development would extend
underneath the street and connect to an existing 8-inch sewer line in Camino Ricardo. Sewage
flows from the eastern portion of the site would also be discharged into an 8-inch sewer line
running under the street. It would be attached underneath the proposed pedestrian bridge
spanning the Corliss Tributary and then cross the northern edge of the park parcel (Parcel E)
before joining the existing 8-inch sewer line located adjacent to the northeast corner of the
project site. Wastewater treatment disposal in the area is performed by the Central Contra Costa
Sanitary District (CCCSD). The CCCSD has confirmed that it will allow suspension of the sewer
line underneath the downstream side of the bridge.2

     ·   Contra Costa County Library system
     ·   Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
     ·   Central Contra Costa Solid Waste Authority/Allied Waste Services

Population Generation
Based on U.S. Census data, the proposed project would generate a population of 2.59 persons
per dwelling unit, or a total of about 73 residents. This would represent an approximately 0.45-
percent increase in the overall population of the Town of Moraga.

Planning Approvals
Rezoning: The project would require rezoning of the site to a Planned Development (PD)
zoning district.

Subdivision Map: The project would require approval of a Vesting Tentative Subdivision Map
and recording of a Final Subdivision Map, in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act,
California Government Code Sections 66410 et. seq.

Development Plan: The project would require approval of a Conceptual Development Plan,
General Development Plan, and Precise Development Plan pursuant to Title 8, Chapter 8.48 of
the Moraga Municipal Code.

Hillside Development Permit: Section 8.136.050 of the Moraga Municipal Code requires a Hillside
Development Permit for all proposed development on hillside land, defined as land with a
slope of 20 percent or greater (i.e., 5:1 slope or steeper).

Design Review: Pursuant to Title 8, Chapter 8.72, Article 2 of the Moraga Municipal Code, design
review approval would be required prior to issuance of building permits.

Other Approvals
The project would also require grading and building permits from the Contra Costa County
Building Department and a tree removal permit from the Moraga Planning Department.

San Francisco Bay Area Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB): The project would
also require filing of a Notice of Intent (NOI) to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Water
Quality Control Board and preparation of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).
The SWPPP addresses control of stormwater pollution during construction through
implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs).

California Department of Fish & Game (CDFG): Construction of the proposed stormwater
outfall into Corliss Tributary and pedestrian bridges across the tributary and Laguna Creek will
require a Streambed Alteration Agreement pursuant to Section 1603 of the Fish and Game
Code. These project features may also require authorizations from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (Section 404 Fill Permit pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act), U.S. Fish & Wildlife
Service (Section 7 Consultation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act), and the RWQCB
(Section 401 Water Quality Certification pursuant to the Clean Water Act).

9.   Site Description and Surrounding Land Uses:

The proposed project site is located in the Town of Moraga off of Camino Ricardo,
approximately 950 feet north of the intersection of Camino Ricardo and Moraga Way, as shown
on Figure 1. Regional freeway access to the site is from State Route 24 via Moraga Road from
the north, passing through the City of Lafayette (apx. 4 miles), or via Moraga Way from the
northwest, passing through the City of Orinda (apx. 4 miles).

The site is located about 0.8 mile northeast of Gudde Ridge, which is part of the
northwest/southeast-trending Berkeley Hills. Several peaks along the ridge rise to elevations
between approximately 1,100 feet and 1,300 feet msl, and form prominent visual backdrops
from many vantage points within Moraga.

The project site encompasses approximately 14.26 acres of land area on an undeveloped hillside
property previously cultivated as a walnut orchard. The deteriorating trees remain on the site,
surrounded by an understory of ruderal non-native grasses, as shown on Figure 5A. A dense
riparian corridor flanking the Corliss Tributary (Figure 5B) bisects the site in a
northwest/southeast direction, roughly separating the eastern third of the site. Laguna Creek,
also flanked by a riparian corridor, extends along the eastern boundary of the site on property
owned by the Town of Moraga. The Corliss Tributary intersects with Laguna Creek at the
southeast corner of the site. There are no manmade structures on the site except for some
wooden fences surrounding residential properties that encroach into the northeastern portion of
the site. At one of these properties, a sports court constructed by the neighbor also encroaches
into the project property.

The hilly site ranges in elevation from about 506 feet msl in the southeastern corner of the site to
about 630 feet above msl on the central knoll, in the proposed open space easement for Lot 6.
The site is moderately sloped, with most slopes having a gradient on the order of 20 to 25
percent.

The project site is located on a single parcel (APN 255-031-029). The property is currently zoned
3-DUA (Residential, Three Dwelling Units Per Acre) and designated Residential (3 du/ac) in
the Moraga Center Specific Plan, which is the General Plan document applicable to the property.

DETERMINATION:
On the basis of this initial evaluation:


       I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the
       environment, and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

    I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
    environment, there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the
    project have been made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED
NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

       I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an
 X     ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.

        I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or
        "potentially significant unless mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one
        effect 1) has been adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable
legal standards, and 2) has been addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis
as described on the attached sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but
it must analyze only the effects that remain to be addressed.

       I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
       environment, because all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately
       in an earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards, and
(b) have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION,
including revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed upon the proposed project,
nothing further is required.

EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS:



I.     AESTHETICS -- Would the project:
a)     Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?
                                                                       X

Explanation: The project site is partially visible from certain locations along Moraga Road and
Moraga Way, which are designated as Scenic Corridors in the Moraga 2002 General Plan and in
the Moraga Planning and Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 8.132). According to the Moraga Center
Specific Plan Environmental Impact Report (MCSP EIR), new development within 500 feet of a
designated scenic corridor should retain existing topography and vegetation, include adequate
setbacks, enhance scenic views, create gateways with landscaping and signage, and be
compatible with surrounding landscapes and developments through the use of street trees,
orchard tree preservation, and pedestrian lighting. The MCSP EIR identified a significant
adverse impact on scenic vistas from implementation of the MCSP. One of the mitigation
measures identified for this impact required development of additional design guidelines
specifically for development within 500 feet of a designated scenic corridor, but this measure
has yet to be implemented by the Town. Therefore, there is the potential for the proposed
project to have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista.

As required by Section 15064(f)(1) of the CEQA Guidelines, if a lead agency determines that there
is substantial evidence in the record that a project may have a significant effect on the
environment, even if the lead agency is also presented with evidence that the project will not
have a significant effect, the lead agency shall prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
Accordingly, the Town will prepare an EIR for the proposed project and will consider the
project's visual effects in greater detail therein.


b)     Substantially damage scenic resources, including but not
       limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings    X
       within a state scenic highway?

Explanation: The project site contains a large number of trees, including native oaks and other
native trees, as well as many oak trees that were formerly part of a productive orchard.
Although the project is not located within the viewshed of a State scenic highway, it is within
the viewshed of a Scenic Corridor designated by the Town of Moraga.3 A detailed evaluation of
the project's potential impacts on scenic resources will be provided in the EIR.

Explanation: There are no objective standards of significance under CEQA for evaluating visual
impacts, nor are there any widely accepted quantifiable methods for assessing impacts.
Aesthetic impacts are largely subjective in nature, and may be viewed quite differently by
different people. Furthermore, the significance of a change in visual character will be
substantially affected by the social and visual context in which the change occurs. For example,
the proposed project would occur on a previously undeveloped hillside site supporting a
former tree orchard and crossed by a dense riparian corridor. The project would develop
roughly half of the site with new single-family homes. While this would be a significant change
in visual conditions on the site, it would be in the context of existing single-family homes
flanking the site on the north and to the west of Camino Ricardo. The site's location in the center
of Moraga, which is substantially built out with residential, commercial, and other development
will also be considered.

The MCSP EIR identified a significant, adverse impact on existing visual quality in the planning
area from implementation of the MCSP. The mitigation identified for this impact was the same
as that described above in Section I(a), which has yet to be implemented. Therefore, there is the
potential for the proposed project to have a substantial adverse effect on the existing visual
character of the site and its surroundings. This potential impact will be further evaluated in the
EIR.


d)   Create a new source of substantial light or glare which                                X
     would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the
     area?


Explanation: The proposed project would not result in the introduction of a substantial source
of new glare. The proposed buildings would not be covered in reflective surfaces and the
amount of fenestration would be modest and in line with common residential developments.
While parked cars can provide new sources of daytime glare on sunny days, the amount of
surface parking would be limited as all homes would have two-car garages. There would be no
concentration of parked cars anywhere on the site, and this would not be a substantial source of
glare. Furthermore, the generous planting of street trees proposed along the single street would
serve to substantially block glare from offsite receptors.

The project would introduce new nighttime light sources from interior and exterior lighting of
the proposed homes. Where project buildings are visible during the day from offsite locations,
the interior household lighting would be visible from these locations at night. However,
nighttime lighting of this nature is generally contained by window coverings, fixture shades,
and intervening building surfaces, and does not create nighttime glare. This type of lighting is
also an inherent and widely accepted aspect of any type of occupied human development.
Exterior lighting would be required to be shielded and downward-directed in accordance with

the MCSP Design Guidelines. For these reasons, the project would not introduce a new source
of substantial light with the potential to adversely affect nighttime views in the area.

The project's light and glare impacts would therefore be less than significant, and this issue will
not be addressed further in the EIR.

II. AGRICULTURAL        AND         FOREST
    RESOURCES -- In determining whether impacts
        to agricultural resources are significant environmental
        effects, lead agencies may refer to the California Land
        Evaluation and Site Assessment Model (1997) prepared
        by the California Dept. of Conservation as an optional
        model to use in assessing impacts on agriculture and
        farmland. In determining whether impacts to forest
        resources, including timberland, are significant
        environmental effects, lead agencies may refer to
        information compiled by the California Department of
        Forestry and Fire Protection regarding the State's
        inventory of forest land, including the Forest and Range
        Assessment Project and the Forestry Legacy Assessment
        Project, and forest carbon measurement methodology
        provided in Forest Protocols adopted by the California
        Air Resources Board. Would the project:

a)      Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
        Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland), as shown
        on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping            X
        and Monitoring Program of the California Resources
        Agency, to non-agricultural use?

Explanation: The majority of the approximately 14-acre project property is designated "Unique
Farmland" on the most recent map of important farmland published by the Department of
Conservation (DOC), a department of the California Resources Agency.4 A narrow strip of land
along the site's frontage on Camino Ricardo is designated Prime Farmland. The riparian
corridor flanking the Corliss Tributary is also designated Prime Farmland. The portion of the
site to the east of the tributary is designated Other Land. The DOC's Farmland Mapping and
Monitoring Program (FMMP) updates the maps every two years; the most recent map was
prepared in 2010.

The "Prime Farmland" category is assigned to land that has the best combination of physical
and chemical features capable of sustaining long-term agricultural production. Such land has
the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields.
Agricultural land with this designation must have been used for irrigated agricultural
production at some time during the four years prior to the date on which it was mapped.

"Unique Farmland" is used for the production of the State's leading agricultural crops, but it
has lower quality soils than Prime Farmland. While it is generally irrigated, it can include non-
irrigated orchards or vineyards in suitable climatic zones. Unique Farmland must have been
used for agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to the date on which it
was mapped.

"Other Land" is land not included in any other mapping category. (Other categories include
different types of agricultural land, Urban and Built-Up Land, and Water.) Common examples
of Other Land include low-density rural development; brush, timber, wetland, and riparian
areas not suitable for livestock grazing, confined livestock poultry, or aquaculture facilities;
strip mines; borrow pits; and water bodies smaller than 40 acres. Vacant and non-agricultural
land surrounded on all sides by urban development and greater than 40 acres is mapped as
Other Land.

Much of the project site was previously cultivated as a walnut orchard, but it has not been
actively cultivated for more than 20 years and the trees are in poor condition.5 In addition, the
areas designated as Prime Farmland have not been irrigated. Despite the official designation of
the site as Unique Farmland and Prime Farmland, the DOC maps are sometimes inaccurate or
outdated. Because the walnut orchard has not been cultivated for many years, its designation by
the FMMP can be presumed to be outdated, and the land would likely be redesignated as Other
Land during a future mapping cycle.6

Although the proposed conversion of the project property to residential use would not remove
productive agricultural land from production, due to the DOC's designation of the site as Prime
Farmland and Unique Farmland, the conversion of the site to a non-agricultural use would be a
potentially significant impact. This impact will be evaluated in the EIR.

Explanation: The project site is zoned for residential use; no portion of the site is zoned for
agricultural use, and none of the site lies within a Williamson Act contract area.7

        forest land (as defined in Public Resources Code Section                                                    X

Explanation: The project site is not zoned as forest land or timberland. While the site supports
numerous trees in addition to the decrepit and unproductive walnut trees, they are
concentrated in a riparian corridor that would be preserved and enhanced. The proposed
project would therefore have no impact on forest or timberland.


d)      Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land
        to a non-forest use?                                                                                     X
Explanation: See Item II(c), above.

        due to their location or nature, could result in conversion                                   X
        of Farmland to non-agricultural use or conversion of forest
        land to non-forest use?

Explanation: The project site is not located in an area devoted to or compatible with
agricultural use and does not support viable forest land. The project would not cause
conversion of other farmland to non-agricultural use or forest land to non-forest use.

In summary, the project would have a less-than-significant impact on agricultural and forest
resources. This issue will not be addressed in the EIR.


III. AIR QUALITY                  --     Where available, the
        significance criteria established by the applicable air
        quality management or air pollution control district may
        be relied upon to make the following determinations.

        air quality plan?

Explanation:

Introduction to the Air Quality/GHG Analysis
The air quality analysis presented throughout Section III is based on the air quality impact
assessment guidelines adopted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
in June 2010 and updated in May 2011.8 In March 2012 an Alameda County Superior Court
judge suspended the revised thresholds of significance for air quality and greenhouse gas
impacts promulgated in the BAAQMD's June 2010 CEQA guidelines until such time as the
agency conducts CEQA review of the thresholds. The District has appealed this ruling, with the
outcome yet to be determined.

The State CEQA Guidelines explicitly allow and encourage a lead agency to determine its own
thresholds of significance for evaluating the significance of environmental effects.9 In doing so, a
lead agency may consider thresholds of significance previously adopted or recommended by
other public agencies or recommended by experts, provided the decision of the lead agency to
adopt such thresholds is supported by substantial evidence. Although a lead agency is required
to adopt thresholds of significance intended for general use by ordinance, resolution, rule, or
regulation, with a public review process, in the current instance, the Town of Moraga is
utilizing the thresholds recommended in the BAAQMD's June 2010 CEQA guidelines for the
proposed project, but does not intended to apply them generally to environmental review
projects in the Town. It is expected that, as the primary regulatory agency in the Bay Area with
jurisdiction over air quality, the BAAQMD will again be in a position to recommend thresholds
of significance for air quality and greenhouse gases in the near future. When this occurs, the
Town will resume deferring to the District's recommended thresholds of significance for CEQA
review, as has previously been case with most cities and counties in the nine-county Bay Area
over which BAAQMD has jurisdiction.

There is substantial evidence supporting the Town's decision to rely on BAAQMD's June 2010
CEQA guidelines and thresholds for evaluating the air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG)
impacts of the proposed project. The BAAQMD spent more than a year and a half developing
the June 2010 thresholds of significance, and conducted workshops and public meetings
throughout the process to solicit input and feedback from the public. Draft documents were
available for review on the BAAQMD website throughout the process. A variety of different
options were evaluated during the process. The District drew on its own air quality expertise, as
well as that of the California Air Resources Board, numerous other air pollution control districts
throughout the State, and outside consultants. Other air districts consulted during the process
included the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, Santa Barbara County Air
Pollution Control District, Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District, South Coast Air
Quality Management District, Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, and
the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District.

The thresholds of significance are tied to compliance with the California ambient air quality
standards (CAAQS) and the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), which were
developed pursuant to the State Clean Air Act and federal Clean Air Act, respectively.
Thresholds for toxic air contaminants are based on health risk, and GHG thresholds are based
on achieving GHG reductions mandated by Assembly Bill 32 and former Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger's Executive Order S-3-05. The adopted thresholds were supported by the
California Attorney General and major environmental groups. They were based on scientific
methods, including computer modeling, and utilized emissions data, ambient air pollution data,
population data and growth projections, and health risk data, among other sources. While the
BAAQMD may have been remiss in adopting the thresholds without conducting CEQA review,
there was substantial research, public input, and a solid basis for determining and adopting the
standards. It should also be noted that in setting aside the BAAQMD's June 2010 thresholds, the
Superior Court did not rule or comment on the validity of the thresholds themselves. Absent
guidance from the State Office of Planning and Research or the California Air Resources Board
regarding this issue, the Town of Moraga has determined that the BAAQMD relied on
substantial evidence in adopting the June 2010 thresholds of significance for criteria air
pollutants, GHGs, and toxic air contaminants, which forms the basis for the Town's use of those

thresholds in the analysis presented in Section III, Air Quality, and in Section VII, Greenhouse

Compliance with Air Quality Plan
BAAQMD is the air quality agency with jurisdiction over the Bay Area. It is responsible for
monitoring regional air quality, developing regional clean air plans, and responding to citizen
air quality complaints. BAAQMD is also the agency with permit authority over most types of
stationary sources in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The project site lies within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin (SFBAAB), one of the cleanest
air basins in the State. The nine counties surrounding San Francisco Bay (Alameda, Contra
Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, southwestern Solano, and southern
Sonoma counties) form a regional air basin, sharing common geographical features and weather
patterns, and therefore similar air pollution burdens, which cannot be addressed by counties
acting on their own.

As required by the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) identified criteria pollutants and established the NAAQS to protect the public health and
welfare. There are NAAQS for ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), respirable particulate matter equal to or less than 10 microns (PM10), fine
particulate matter equal to or less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), and lead (Pb). These pollutants are
known as "criteria" air pollutants because standards have been established to meet specific
public health and welfare criteria.

The NAAQS are defined as the maximum acceptable concentration that may be reached, but not
exceeded more than once per year. California has adopted more stringent ambient air quality
standards for most of the criteria air pollutants (CAAQS, or State standards). The pollutants of
greatest concern in the area are ozone and PM10. The Bay Area is currently designated as a
nonattainment area for the State and federal ozone standards, the State respirable particulate
matter (PM10) standard, and the State and federal fine particulate matter (PM2.5) standards. The
Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy and the Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan adopted by BAAQMD
identify a variety of strategies, programs, regulations, and control measures intended to reduce
emissions of air pollutants including ozone and ozone precursors so as to bring the Bay Area
into attainment with the CAAQS and NAAQS. Most of the regulations and control measures
require implementation by BAAQMD or the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and/or
coordination with transit agencies or other public agencies.

If project review is conducted in accordance with the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines, a project is
typically assumed by the Air District to comply with the Clean Air Plan and with the Ozone
Strategy, the applicable air quality plans.10 Since the project is not anticipated to result in any
unavoidable significant air quality impacts, and the air quality analysis presented in this Initial
Study was conducted in accordance with the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines, the proposed project
would not conflict with the Clean Air Plan or Ozone Strategy.

b)   Violate any air quality standard or contribute
     substantially to an existing or projected air quality                    X
     violation?

Explanation: The project would be located in a region that experiences occasional violations of
ozone, PM10, and PM2.5 standards. Construction and operation of new development therefore
has the potential to contribute to these violations. These potential impacts are addressed
separately below.

Operational Impacts
BAAQMD's CEQA Air Quality Guidelines establish new thresholds of significance for
operational emissions of 54 lb./day for ROG, PM2.5, and NOx, and 82 lb./day for PM10. By
comparison, the previous operational thresholds adopted by BAAQMD in 1996 were 80 lb./day
for ROG, PM10, and NOx. There was no previous threshold for PM2.5.

Operational air emissions from the project would be generated primarily from autos driven by
residents and visitors and from delivery and service trucks. Emissions could also be generated
by lawn mowers, gas-powered leaf blowers, barbeques, fireplaces, and other common
residential sources. Evaporative emissions from architectural coatings and consumer
cleaning/maintenance products are other typical emissions from residential uses. Such
emissions have been factored in to the screening criteria discussed below.

BAAQMD's CEQA Guidelines contain operational screening criteria for a variety of land use
development projects. If all of the screening criteria are met by a proposed project, then the
project would not result in the generation of operational-related criteria air pollutants and/or
precursors that exceed the thresholds of significance, and there is no need to perform a detailed
air quality assessment of the project`s air pollutant emissions. However, the screening criteria
should not be used if a project includes emissions from stationary source engines (e.g., back-up
generators) or industrial sources subject to Air District Rules and Regulations.

The screening threshold for operational impacts on air quality from new single-family
residential development is 325 dwelling units; for parks the operational screening threshold is
2,613 acres. As noted above, these screening sizes are related to the indirect mobile- and area-
source emissions associated with the single-family residential land use and city park categories,
and were based on the default assumptions incorporated in the Urban Land Use Emissions
Model (URBEMIS). The proposed 28 homes and approximately 1- to 2-acre park would fall well
below the screening sizes for these uses. Therefore, the proposed project would have a less-
than-significant operational impact on air quality.

Construction Impacts
Construction operations for any sizeable project have the potential to result in short-term but
significant adverse air quality impacts. BAAQMD's CEQA Air Quality Guidelines establish new
thresholds of significance for construction emissions of 54 pounds per day (lb./day) for ROG,
PM2.5, and NOx, and 82 lb./day for PM10. These are the same thresholds applicable to
operational emissions. The PM thresholds apply to exhaust emissions only, not ground
disturbance. However, the Air Quality Guidelines contain screening criteria for construction
projects similar to the operational screening criteria discussed above, and these criteria do factor
in PM emissions from site grading and other ground disturbance. For the single-family

residential land use category, the screening size is 114 dwelling units. For city parks, the
threshold is 67 acres. Projects that fall below these thresholds are considered by BAAQMD to
have less-than-significant construction-phase air pollutant emissions, provided the following
additional conditions are met:
       · All Basic Construction Mitigation Measures would be included in the project design
         and implemented during construction; and
       · Construction-related activities would not include any of the following:
            a. Demolition;
            b. Simultaneous occurrence of more than two construction phases (e.g., paving
               and building construction would occur simultaneously);
            c. Simultaneous construction of more than one land use type (e.g., project would
               develop residential and commercial uses on the same site) (not applicable to
               high density infill development);
            d. Extensive site preparation (i.e., greater than default assumptions used by the
               Urban Land Use Emissions Model [URBEMIS] for grading, cut/fill, or earth
               movement); or
            e. Extensive material transport (e.g., greater than 10,000 cubic yards of soil
               import/export) requiring a considerable amount of haul truck activity.

Although the proposed project would be well under the screening threshold for residential and
park uses, and the project is therefore not expected to generate substantial construction-phase
emissions, absent implementation of the BAAQMD's Basic Construction Mitigation Measures,
the project's effects of construction-generated criteria pollutants would be a potentially
significant impact, based on the criteria discussed above. The BAAQMD screening thresholds
are based on the developed land use type (e.g., residential and park), but factor in associated
emissions from grading and other construction activities. If the amount of exported soil is
increased to reduce the pad elevation of the proposed park and increase the usable park area,
the incremental increase in emissions would still fall within the emissions assumed in the
construction screening thresholds. Furthermore, such emissions would be partially offset by the
reduced need for grading of the park parcel.

Implementation of the controls listed in Mitigation Measure AQ­1, which incorporates the Basic
Construction Mitigation Measures, would reduce the project's construction­related air quality
impacts to a less-than-significant level.

Mitigation Measure AQ­1:      The project applicant shall require the construction contractor to
                              reduce the severity of project construction period dust impacts by
                              complying with the following control measures:

                                  piles, graded areas, and unpaved access roads) shall be

Although operation of the proposed project would not have a significant impact on air quality,
pursuant to BAAQMD thresholds and as demonstrated above, the MCSP EIR identified a
significant impact on air quality from development of the MCSP area as a whole, and identified
mitigation measures to reduce the impact to a less-than-significant level. The following
components of Mitigation 4.G-4 from the MCSP EIR would apply to the proposed project, and
are therefore included as required mitigation for the proposed project. The measures required
by Mitigation 4.G-4 were designed to reduce energy consumption and the air pollutant
emissions associated with generating and consuming energy, including fossil fuels.

        emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
        precursors)?

Explanation: As noted in BAAQMD's CEQA Air Quality Guidelines, air pollution is, by its very
nature, largely a cumulative impact. No single project is sufficient in size to, by itself, result in
nonattainment of ambient air quality standards. Instead, a project's individual emissions
contribute to existing cumulatively significant adverse air quality impacts. According to the Air
Quality Guidelines, if a project's contribution to the cumulative impact is considerable, then the
project's impact on air quality would be considered significant. The Air Quality Guidelines state
that if a project would exceed the identified significance thresholds, its emissions would be
cumulatively considerable.

As discussed in the preceding subsection, the project would not exceed the significance
thresholds and therefore would not have a significant adverse impact on air quality.


d)      Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant                                          X
        concentrations?

Explanation: Health risk from exposure to air pollutants is evaluated based on the potential for
exposure to PM2.5 and toxic air contaminants (TACs), the two emission types that pose the most
significant threat to human health. According to BAAQMD, more than 80 percent of the
inhalation cancer risk from TACs in the Bay Area is from diesel engine emissions.11 TACs are a
set of airborne pollutants that may pose a present or potential hazard to human health, and are
separated into carcinogens and non-carcinogens. State and local regulatory programs are
intended to limit exposure to TACs and the associated health risk. Both TACs and PM2.5 are
emitted by trucks, cars, construction equipment, and other mobile sources. They are also
emitted by stationary sources that require permitting by the BAAQMD, which requires source
controls.

Project impacts related to increased health risk can occur either by introducing a new sensitive
receptor, such as a residential use, in proximity to an existing source of TACs or by introducing
a new source of TACs with the potential to adversely affect existing sensitive receptors in the
project vicinity. The BAAQMD recommends using a 1,000-foot radius around a project site for
purposes of identifying community health risk from siting a new sensitive receptor or a new
source of TACs. A lead agency should enlarge the radius if an unusually large source or sources
of hazardous emissions that might affect a project lies outside the 1,000-foot radius.

The proposed project would introduce a new sensitive receptor to the project site. Sensitive
receptors are people most susceptible to poor air quality, and include children, the elderly, the
infirm, or others with medical conditions susceptible to poor air quality (e.g., asthma,
bronchitis, chronic respiratory disease). Land uses that are generally considered to be sensitive
receptors include residences of all types, schools and school yards, parks and playgrounds,
daycare centers, nursing homes, and medical facilities.

The BAAQMD initiated the Community Air Risk Evaluation (CARE) program in 2004 to
identify communities where significant sources of TACs were located in proximity to sensitive
populations. The BAAQMD strongly recommends that impacted communities develop, adopt,
and implement Community Risk Reduction Plans. Based on the latest CARE maps published by
BAAQMD, the project site is not located in or near an identified Impacted Community. The
nearest such community is in the City of Oakland, approximately 4.5 miles to the southwest.12

The BAAQMD provides screening tools and recommended procedures for evaluating the
potential health risk associated with proposed land use development.13 For new receptor
projects, such as the proposed residential subdivision, lead agencies should review the risks
from nearby roadways, freeways, and stationary sources. In most cases, the screening for cancer
risk described below will also adequately screen for health risks associated with PM2.5.14

Freeway and Roadway Sources of TACs
In conducting a screening analysis for estimating community risk associated with siting a new
sensitive receptor in proximity to a major source of TACs, the BAAQMD recommends that a
lead agency utilize a 1,000-foot radius. If a large source is located outside this radius, the radius
should be enlarged. Permitted sources of TACs include facilities such as oil refineries, gas
stations, dry cleaners, crematories, landfills, wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, and coffee
roasters, among many others. Unpermitted sources, such as freeways and high-volume
roadways, can also be significant emitters of TACs, particularly since diesel engines power most
trucks and some autos. As noted above, diesel engine emissions comprise the majority of TACs
and PM2.5 emitted in the Bay Area.

Highway 24 is considered a significant source of TACs and PM2.5, but this freeway is
approximately 3.5 miles north of the project site, and poses no health risk to the project. Other
major roadways are only considered to have a potential cancer risk or chronic health hazard
risk if they have a traffic volume of at least 10,000 average annual daily traffic (AADT). The
California Environmental Health Tracking Program's database of major roadways was queried
to identify major roadways in the vicinity of the project site.15 There are no major roadways
within the recommended 1,000-foot radius. Although Moraga Road, with approximately 20,000
AADT, lies outside the radius based on the geographic center of the project site, it is within
1,000 feet of the site's eastern boundary. However, this roadway is located more than 1,000 feet
from the nearest proposed residence.

Furthermore, there are two substantial riparian corridors located between Moraga Road and the
proposed residences that are densely vegetated with mature trees. These trees function as a

ambient air some fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emitted from traffic under low wind speeds.
According to BAAQMD, trees can reduce PM2.5 concentrations by over 50 percent at very low
wind speeds. Due to the preceding considerations, traffic on Moraga Road would not present a
significant health risk to the occupants of the proposed project, and there are no other roadways
in the vicinity of the project site with sufficient traffic volumes to pose a health risk to the
project due to hazardous air pollutant emissions.

Stationary Sources of TACs
A Google Earth-based database maintained by the BAAQMD was consulted to identify any
permitted sources of TACs in the project vicinity.16 Two sources were identified within the
recommended 1,000-foot screening radius: (1) Moraga Auto Care, a gas station and auto repair
facility located at 1135 Moraga Way, approximately 860 feet south of the site; and (2) Saint
Mary's College of California, located at 1928 Saint Mary's Road, about 4,200 feet east of the site.
Consultation with BAAQMD staff determined that the first source is a gasoline dispensary and
the second source consists of two diesel-powered emergency power generators.17

The BAAQMD database provides the estimated cancer risk and non-cancer (i.e., chronic or
acute) health risk at these sources. The risk numbers provided in the database were adjusted for
the appropriate distance to the project site using the BAAQMD's Gasoline Dispensing Facility
(GDF) Distance Multiplier Tool18 for the gas station and the District's Diesel Internal
Combustion (IC) Engine Distance Multiplier Tool19 for the diesel generators to derive the
adjusted risk factors shown in Table AQ­1. The risk from the diesel generators at St. Mary's
would be less than shown because a distance of 787 feet was assumed, but the nearest proposed
residence would be about 1,400 feet from the western edge of the campus. In addition, the
cancer and health risks as reported by BAAQMD are based on a very conservative set of
assumptions.20 Furthermore, as noted in BAAQMD guidance, the cancer and health risk
numbers provided in the database of stationary sources do not represent actual impacts. Rather,
they are upper-limit health risk screening values used to determine whether a refined modeling
analysis of health impacts is required.

       Hazard Index.



As shown in Table AQ­1, project residents would be exposed to an aggregate screening-level
additional cancer risk of 1.24 cancers per million persons from the two permitted stationary air
pollutant sources located in the project vicinity. The aggregate non-cancer health risk would be
well under a hazard index of 0.01. The hazard index (HI) is defined as the ratio of the predicted
incremental exposure concentration from the project to a published reference exposure level
(REL) that could cause adverse health effects, as established by the California Office of
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). The BAAQMD considers an excess
cancer risk of more than 10 in one million persons or a non-cancer (i.e., chronic or acute) health
risk greater than a Hazard Index (HI) of 1.0 to be a significant adverse impact. Project residents
would be exposed to increased cancer and health risks well below these thresholds. This would
therefore be a less-than-significant impact. While the vehicles driven by project residents would
also be emitters of TACs and PM2.5, these emissions would be de minimus and would not have
the potential to expose on-site or off-site sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
concentrations.

        of people?

Explanation: The BAAQMD identifies a variety of land uses that may typically generate
objectionable odors, and recommend screening distances of 1 to 2 miles, depending on the use.
Examples of odor-generating land uses include wastewater treatment plants, solid waste
landfills and transfer stations, composting facilities, oil refineries, asphalt batch plants, chemical
manufacturing plants, and coffee roasters, among others. There are no odor-generating
facilities in proximity to the project site.

During construction, diesel-powered vehicles and equipment would generate odors at the site.
However, these odors would be temporary and they would be quickly dispersed through
atmospheric dispersion, and therefore would not be likely to be noticeable beyond the project
boundaries.

Operation of the proposed project would not create objectionable odors affecting a substantial
number of people. Odors generated by residential uses could include temporary fumes from
paints or similar products, emissions from outdoor barbeques, fugitive cooking odors, odors
from fertilizer or pesticide applications, and similar common activities. These odors are highly
temporary, would affect few if any offsite receptors, and would not be especially objectionable.


With implementation of Mitigation Measure AQ­1, the project's construction and operational
impacts on air quality would be less than significant, and this issue will not be discussed further
in the EIR.


IV. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES -- Would the project:
a)      Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or
        through habitat modifications, on any species identified as                        X
        a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or
        regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the
        California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish
        and Wildlife Service?

Explanation: All of the information presented in Section IV is based on a biological constraints
analysis performed by Live Oak Associates, a biological consulting firm.21 The majority of the
project site consists of a former walnut orchard that has not been actively farmed since the
1980s. Two stream channels flanked by dense riparian trees and other vegetation cross the
eastern portion of the site. Laguna Creek and its tributary, Corliss Tributary, are likely to be
considered Waters of the U.S. and State, and therefore subject to regulation by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE), California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), and the
California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB).

Though considered unlikely, there is some potential for several special-status plant species to be
present within or adjacent to the riparian habitat, including round-leaved filaree (California
macrophylla), western leatherwood (Dirca occidentalis), Diablo Helianthella (Helianthella castanea),
and Loma Prieta hoita (Hoita stobilina).

The project site could potentially be used as a migration corridor and dispersal habitat for
California red-legged frog (Rana aurora draytonii) and western pond turtle (Emys marmorata), two
special-status wildlife species. Other potential special-status wildlife species on the site include
San Francisco dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes annectens), American badger (Taxidea
taxus), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), Western red bat (Lasiurus

Special-status bird species may nest on the site and/or forage year-round or during migration,
including bald eagle (Haliacetus leucocephalus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), burrowing owl
(Athene cunicularia), northern harrier (Circus cyaneus), American peregrine falcon (Falco
peregrinus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), long-eared owl (Asio otus), loggerhead shrike
(Lanius ludovicianus), and yellow-headed blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus).

There is some potential for the proposed development to cause a substantial adverse effect on
sensitive habitat and special-status plant and wildlife species, which would be a potentially
significant impact. Potential impacts to biological resources will be addressed in detail in the
EIR.

Explanation: As noted above, there are riparian corridors on the project site and creeks that are
likely to be regulated as Waters of the U.S. and State by the USACE, CDFG, and RWQCB. The
potential for adverse impacts to these habitats will be evaluated in detail in the EIR.

     coastal, etc.) through direct removal, filling, hydrological
     interruption, or other means?

Explanation: As discussed in Section IV(a), there are creeks on the project site that are likely to
be regulated as Waters of the U.S. and State pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. A
wetland delineation will be prepared to determine if, and to what extent, wetlands or other
jurisdictional waters occur on the site. The results, along with an evaluation of potential impacts
to such resources, will be presented in the EIR.


d)   Interfere substantially with the movement of any native

Explanation: Implementation of the proposed project would have the potential to conflict with
the Town of Moraga Tree Preservation Ordinance and a policy in the Moraga Center Specific Plan
encouraging the preservation of orchard trees within the MCSP planning area. Similarly, it
would have the potential to conflict with General Plan Land Use Policy LU5.2: Preservation of
Agricultural Resources, which states: "Strive to preserve the Town's remaining agricultural
resources, such as pear and walnut orchards. Potential conflicts with these and other policies
will be evaluated in detail in the EIR.

V. CULTURAL RESOURCES -- Would the project:

a)      Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of
        a historical resource as defined in §15064.5?                                     X
Explanation: Section 15064.5 defines an historical resource as a resource listed or eligible for
listing in the California Register of Historical Resources or in a local register of historical
resources. California historic resources listed in, or formally determined eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places are automatically listed on the California Register. A lead
agency under CEQA also may determine an object, building, structure, site, area, place, record,
or manuscript to be an historical resource, provided the determination is "supported by
substantial evidence in light of the whole record."22 A lead agency may generally consider a
resource to be historically significant if it meets one or more of the criteria for listing on the
California Register of Historical Resources. Those criteria include the following:
           · the resource is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
             broad patterns of California's history and cultural heritage;
           · the resource is associated with the lives of persons important in our past;
           · the resource embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or
             method of construction, or represents the work of an important creative individual, of
             possesses high artistic values; or

           · the resource has yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in
             prehistory or history.

Following the National Register integrity criteria, California Register regulations specify that
integrity is a quality that applies to historic resources in seven ways: location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.23

A cultural resources evaluation of the project site was performed by Holman & Associates in
June 2012.24 This evaluation consisted of a detailed archival literature review at the Northwest
Information Center at Sonoma State University and performance of a systematic on-site surface
reconnaissance of the project site. In addition, as part of the cultural resources evaluation
conducted for the EIR for the Moraga Center Specific Plan (MCSP), letters were sent on January
10, 2008 to Native American representatives identified by the Native American Heritage
Commission soliciting comments and/or information on any known archaeological resources
or sacred lands within the MCSP area, but no responses had been received by the time the Final
EIR was published 15 months later, on March 26, 2009.

The archival search of historic and cultural resources in the area identified no archaeological
sites on or within a mile of the project site. However, six previously recorded historic resources
were identified in the Town of Moraga in the MCSP EIR, although none of them were within
the MCSP planning area. They included St. Mary's College and the Willow Spring School site.

No indications of cultural resources were encountered during the surface reconnaissance of the
project site conducted by Holman & Associates on May 31st and June 7th, 2012. The archaeologist
concluded that the proposed construction of homes on the steeper western portion of the site
would be very unlikely to adversely affect any cultural resources. The archaeological consultant
made no recommendations for conducting subsurface testing in the proposed development area
or for monitoring the site grading and other ground-disturbing activities. However,
construction of the proposed pedestrian bridges and storm drainage outfall would occur
adjacent to the creeks on the site. Streams and adjacent upland areas were conditions favored by
Native Americans in the area for villages or summer camp sites, and prehistoric sites have been
recorded in similar environmental settings in the Bay Area. Holman & Associates concluded
that the potential for encountering such resources at the project site was not high enough to
require mechanical subsurface testing, but did recommend that a qualified archaeologist inspect
the areas around the stormwater outfall and bridge crossings after clearing and grading has
occurred to inspect it for buried archaeological materials.

If historic resources are present on the site, they could be damaged or destroyed during project
construction, which would be a potentially significant impact. Implementation of Mitigation
Measures CR­1 through CR­3, set forth in Section V(b), below, would reduce potential impacts
to cultural resources to a less-than-significant level.

b)   Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of
     an archaeological resource pursuant to §15064.5?                              X

Explanation: Prior to European contact, the project area was inhabited by the Bay Miwok tribe
of Native Americans. By the 19th century, forced missionization and the epidemic spread of
western diseases had reduced the Bay Miwok population significantly, resulting in the
disappearance of local tribelets, such as the Saclans, who inhabited the area now comprising the
Town of Moraga. Buried Native American artifacts, including remnants of former settlements,
have been encountered throughout the Bay Area, particularly adjacent or in proximity to water
sources, and could potentially be present at the project site.

The MCSP EIR identified a potentially significant impact to archaeological resources from
future development within the MCSP planning area. The mitigation identified in the EIR for
this impact calls for a site survey for archaeological resources prior to development of any
previously undisturbed areas, with additional measures required in the event cultural resources
are encountered. As discussed in the preceding section, a Cultural Resources Evaluation of the
project site was performed by Holman & Associates in June 2012. See Section V(c) for
additional information on the scope of research performed.

As previously noted, an archival search of archaeological resources in the area identified no
archaeological sites on or within a mile of the project site. While no significant deposit or
concentration of archaeological data was identified in the archival research or field
reconnaissance of the proposed project site, this does not preclude the possibility that such
potentially significant deposits may be present on the site's surface or subsurface, and could be
damaged or destroyed during site grading. This would constitute a potentially significant,
adverse impact. Implementation of the following mitigation measures would reduce this
potential impact to a less-than-significant level.

Mitigation Measure CR­1:         Following site clearing and grading in the vicinity of the
                                 proposed pedestrian bridge crossings and stormwater outfall into
                                 the Corliss Tributary, but prior to construction of the proposed
                                 facilities--including any foundation, pier, or support work--the
                                 project sponsor shall retain the services of a qualified
                                 archaeologist to inspect the cleared and graded areas for
                                 evidence of historic or prehistoric cultural resources. If any
                                 potentially significant resources are discovered, all work shall be
                                 immediately halted in the area designated by the archaeologist as
                                 archaeologically sensitive until Mitigation Measure CR­2 has
                                 been fully implemented.

Mitigation Measure CR­2:         If any cultural artifacts are encountered during site grading or
                                 other construction activities, all ground disturbance in the
                                 vicinity shall be halted until a qualified archaeologist can identify
                                 and evaluate the resource(s) and, if necessary, recommend
                                 mitigation measures to document and prevent any significant
                                 adverse effects on the resource(s). The archeological consultant

                                 shall immediately notify the Town of Moraga and the project
                                 sponsor of the encountered archeological deposit. At a minimum,
                                 the additional precautions to be taken if significant cultural
                                 resources are encountered shall include monitoring by an
                                 archaeologist at any time that ground-disturbing activities at a
                                 depth of 12 inches or more are occurring in the immediate
                                 vicinity of the discovered resource and/or in the immediate
                                 vicinity of the riparian habitat on the project site.

Mitigation Measure CR­3:         In the event that any human remains are encountered during site
                                 disturbance, all ground-disturbing work shall cease immediately
                                 and a qualified archaeologist shall notify the Office of the Contra
                                 Costa County Coroner and advise that office as to whether the
                                 remains are likely to be prehistoric or historic period in date. If
                                 determined to be prehistoric, the Coroner's Office will notify the
                                 Native American Heritage Commission of the find, which, in
                                 turn, will then appoint a "Most Likely Descendant" (MLD). The
                                 MLD in consultation with the archaeological consultant and the
                                 project sponsor, will advise and help formulate an appropriate
                                 plan for treatment of the remains, which might include
                                 recordation, removal, and scientific study of the remains and any
                                 associated artifacts. After completion of analysis and preparation
                                 of the report of findings, the remains and associated grave goods
                                 shall be returned to the MLD for reburial.

Mitigation Measure CR­4:         The results of any additional archaeological effort required
                                 through the implementation of Mitigation Measures CR­1
                                 through CR­3 shall be presented in a professional-quality report,
                                 to be submitted to the project sponsor, the Town of Moraga, and
                                 the Northwest Information Center at Sonoma State University in
                                 Rohnert Park. The project sponsor shall fund and implement the
                                 mitigation in accordance with Section 15064.5(c)-(f) of the CEQA
                                 Guidelines and Public Resources Code Section 21083.2.

Mitigation Measures CR­1 through CR­4 are consistent with Mitigation 4.M-2 of the MCSP EIR
and their implementation would fulfill the mitigation requirements established in the MCSP
EIR.


c)   Directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological

Explanation: The MCSP EIR determined that there were no known paleontological resources or
unique geologic features within the MCSP area, but concluded that paleontological resources
could be discovered during grading or excavation activities associated with new development
in the area. Any destruction of unique paleontological resources during earthmoving activities
would be a potentially significant impact. Implementation of the following measure would
reduce this potential impact to a less-than-significant level:

Mitigation Measure CR­4:                If any paleontological resources are encountered during site
                                        grading or other construction activities, all ground disturbance
                                        shall be halted until the services of a qualified paleontologist can
                                        be retained to identify and evaluate the resource(s) and, if
                                        necessary, recommend mitigation measures to document and
                                        prevent any significant adverse effects on the resource(s). The
                                        project sponsor shall immediately notify Town of Moraga
                                        Planning staff and the Town building inspector assigned to the
                                        project upon discovery of paleontological resources. If a fossil
                                        find is confirmed, it shall be recorded with the U.S. Geological
                                        Survey and curated in an appropriate repository, as determined
                                        by the paleontologist.


d)      Disturb any human remains, including those interred
        outside of formal cemeteries?                                                      X
Explanation: See Section V(b).


Upon implementation of Mitigation Measures CR­1 through CR­4, all potential impacts to
cultural and paleontological resources would be reduced to a less-than-significant level.
Cultural and paleontological resources will not be discussed further in the EIR.

various locations throughout the development area. Information is also drawn from a previous
geotechnical investigation of the site in 2004 by ENGEO.26

The project area is not located within an Alquist-Priolo fault zone and no active faults have been
identified or mapped within or in proximity to the site by the California Division of Mines and
Geology (CDMG), the U.S. Geological Survey, or ENGEO.27 There is therefore no potential for
fault rupture at the site.


        ii)   Strong seismic ground shaking?
                                                                                            X

Explanation: The project area is located in the Coast Ranges Province that developed in
response to faulting associated with movement at the plate boundary between the North
American and Pacific Crustal Plates, which resulted in a series of northwest-trending mountain
ranges and intervening valleys. The project site is located within an uplifted range of hills
locally referred to as the East Bay Hills block, bounded on the west by the active Hayward fault
and on the east by the active Calaveras fault.

Published geologic maps indicate that the majority of the site is underlain by sandstone and
mudstone units of the Tertiary Age Lower Mulholland Formation. In general, bedding near the
site is mapped with a northwest strike with dips ranging from about 35 to 64 degrees towards
the northeast.

The closest known active faults to the project site are the Hayward fault, located about 4.2 miles
to the southwest; the Calaveras fault, located about 5.5 miles to the east; and the Concord-Green
Valley fault, located about 9 miles to the northeast. The San Andreas fault, another major fault
system in the region, is located about 22.5 miles southwest of the site. Many earthquakes of low
magnitude occur every year throughout the region, with the majority concentrated along the
San Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras faults.

Similar to most urban locations throughout the Bay Area, the project site is potentially subject to
strong seismic ground shaking during an earthquake on one of the major active earthquake
faults that transect the region. At least five known earthquakes of Richter Magnitude (RM) 6.5--
four of them greater than RM 7.0--have occurred within the San Francisco Bay Area within the
last 150 years. According to a 2007 analysis by the Working Group on California Earthquake
Probabilities, an expert panel co-chaired by U.S. Geological Society seismologists, there is a 63
percent probability that an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater will occur in the San
Francisco Bay Area in the next 24 years, and a 31 percent probability that such an earthquake

     In California, the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act of 1972 (formerly the Special Studies Zoning Act)
     regulates development and construction of buildings intended for human occupation to avoid the hazard of
     surface fault rupture. This Act and supplemental amendments groups faults into the categories of active,
     potentially active, and inactive. Historic and Holocene age faults are considered active, Late Quaternary and
     Quaternary age faults are considered potentially active, and pre-Quaternary age faults are considered inactive.
     These classifications are qualified by the conditions that a fault must be shown to be "sufficiently active" and "well
     defined" by detailed site-specific geotechnical explorations in order to determine that building setbacks might be
     established.

will occur on the Hayward fault. It is therefore likely that a major earthquake will be
experienced at the project site during the life of the project, and such an earthquake would
produce strong seismic ground shaking.

A major earthquake on any of the active faults in the region could result in very strong to
violent ground shaking. The intensity of earthquake ground motion would depend upon the
characteristics of the generating fault, distance of the site to the earthquake epicenter and
rupture zone, magnitude and duration of the earthquake, and site-specific geologic conditions.
The California Geological Survey's Interactive Probabilistic Seismic Hazards Map (2002)
indicates there is a 10-percent probability that seismic ground shaking will produce a peak
horizontal ground acceleration (PHGA) of at least 0.632 at the site within the next 50 years.28

A strong seismic event could cause serious damage to the proposed project putting its
occupants at risk, which would be a potentially significant impact. However, the geotechnical
consultant for the project concluded that proper site preparation, structural design, and
construction techniques would enable the project structures to withstand the maximum
probable ground shaking at the site. Accordingly, the following measures are recommended to
reduce this impact to a less-than-significant level:

        iii) Seismic-related     ground       failure,    including
             liquefaction?                                                                           X

Explanation:

Liquefaction
Liquefaction occurs when clean, loose, saturated, uniformly graded, fine-grained soils are
exposed to strong seismic ground shaking. The soils temporarily lose strength and cohesion due
to buildup of excess pore water pressure during earthquake-induced cyclic loading, resulting in
a loss of ground stability that can cause building foundations to fail. Soil liquefaction may also
damage roads, pavements, pipelines, and underground cables. Soils susceptible to liquefaction
include saturated, loose to medium dense sand and gravel, low-plasticity silt, and some low-
plasticity clay deposits.

Hazard maps produced by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) depict
liquefaction hazards for the entire Bay Area in the event of a significant seismic event.
According to these maps, the proposed project site is in an area expected to have a very low
potential for liquefaction.29 These maps are not site-specific, but do depict general risk within
neighborhoods. However, ENGEO completed a site-specific subsurface investigation of the site
and concluded that the medium stiff to stiff, fine-grained silty to sandy clay comprising the
alluvial soils at the site are not susceptible to liquefaction. Therefore, measures to mitigate
liquefaction are not required.

Seismically-Induced Lurching or Lateral Spreading
Lurch cracking and lateral spreading can occur in weaker soils on slopes and adjacent to open
channels that are subjected to strong ground shaking during an earthquake. This potential can
be mitigated by conventional remedial grading methods. ENGEO concluded that there was
little potential for lurching or lateral spreading at the project site.

Earthquake-Induced Settlement
Settlement of the ground surface can be accelerated and accentuated by earthquakes. During an
earthquake, settlement can occur as a result of the relatively rapid rearrangement, compaction,
and settling of subsurface materials (particularly loose, noncompacted, and variable sandy

1. Introduction
Florida Transportation Engineering, Inc. was retained to provide a comprehensive assessment to identify
needs, and elaborate recommendations for an entrance gate system at Waterstone/South Dade Venture
CDD. This study was initiated following the requests from Alvarez Engineers, Inc the current community
engineering firm as a petition of the residents board directives and neighbor' complaints regarding security
issues. This study included field observations, data collection, traffic engineering analysis, development of
conclusions, and recommendations.

2. Background
The Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD is a 388 gross acres residential community approved since 2001
by the City of Homestead. This community contains over 2,200 households that include two independent
sections (Section and Section ) as well as a charter school serving from kindergarten to middle school.
Today, the City of Homestead ranks among the top fastest growing development areas as a result of the
accelerated population growth. This situation has raised the security concerns and several complaints from
residents and neighbors that have been brought to the attention of the residents' board.

In June 2007, two traffic studies were carried out by Florida Transportation Engineering Inc. within the
community to evaluate and improve the current traffic operations and safety conditions along the road
network in the vicinity of the community, as well as, the traffic concerns for the drop-off/pick-up periods of
the Waterstone Charter School.

Furthermore, based on those studies and advices from the residents, it was determined to evaluate an
entrance gate system at the three main access roads of the community. Therefore, this report analyzes the
feasibility and traffic operation impact of the entrance gate system along the three main access roads of the
Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD.

3. Assessment of Existing Facilities
A Professional Traffic Operations Engineer (PTOE) conducted field reviews of the existing conditions of the
three main entrances during peak hours of 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, on Tuesday May
29, 2007. Observations include assessments of existing geometry conditions, intersection operations, and
traffic patterns.

    3.1. Evaluation of Main Access Roads
    The community has three main accesses for the two independent sections:

         · Through the east, Waterstone Way at SW 137th Avenue (Section).
         · Through the south, Waterstone Way at SW 312th Street/Cambell Road (Section ).
         · Also through the east, Waterstone Boulevard at SW 137th Avenue (Section ).

    All these accesses are two-way stop controlled intersections. Figure 1 shows the geographic location in
    reference to the study area. The current access roads geometry conditions are described in Table 1.

    Furthermore, the cross-sections of the Waterstone Way southern access and the Waterstone
    Boulevard eastern access are transitioned from four-lane divided to two-lane undivided segments.
    Those transitions occur as follows:
         · For Waterstone Way southern access, 100 feet north of SW 312th Street.
         · For Waterstone Boulevard eastern access, 50 feet west of SW 137th Avenue.

    3.2. Data Collection
    Turning Movement Counts (TMCs) were performed during AM and PM peak periods on a typical
    weekday. Results from the raw turning movement count volumes during peak hours are documented in
    Appendix A. Based on the data, critical peak volumes were determined as follows:
         · For the Waterstone Way eastern access, the critical peak hour period is the PM with 356
           vehicles entering the community.
         · For the Waterstone Way southern access, the critical peak hour period is the AM with 480
           vehicles entering the community.
         · For the Waterstone Boulevard eastern access, the critical peak hour period is the PM with 163
           vehicles entering the community.

    Table 2 shows the critical hourly volumes adjusted by the Peak Hour Factor (PHF).

4. Traffic Operation Characteristics
In order to identify the existing traffic operational issues that could affect the gates operation in
Waterstone/South Dade Venture CDD Community, field observations were performed along the main
access roads during the AM/PM peak periods of a typical weekday (March 7, 2008). The following critical
elements that affect the residents' journey and accessing traffic patterns were identified which will assist to


                                                      Page 3
formulate recommendations for an entrance gate system (some of those issues were documented in the
previous studies). Also, Figure 2 shows those critical issues for traffic accessing the community.
    · During the AM peak period most of vehicles were observed exiting the community heading north
      along SW 137th Avenue or heading west along SW 312th Street. On the other hand, during PM peak
      period most of the traffic entering the community was traveling south along SW 137th Avenue or east
      along SW 312th Street
    · During the AM peak, the traffic entering the community was mainly related to arrival activities to
      Waterstone Charter School.
    · During the school peak periods, long queues, delays, traffic conflicts were observed along the
      northbound and southbound of Waterstone Way accessing the school.
    · Queues and delays were experienced by vehicles exiting community at Waterstone Way with SW
      312th Street and Waterstone Boulevard with SW 137th Avenue during the AM peak.
    · Some delays and unsafe maneuvers were observed by vehicles performing eastbound left turn
      movement at the intersection of Waterstone Way with SW 312th Street during the AM and PM peak
      periods.
    · Waterstone Chater School is located at the east side along Waterstone Way few feet north of SW
      312th Street. This school has two driveways with high ingress/egress traffic during school peak
      periods. The future community gate system should be installed north of those driveways avoiding
      impact from the school operations.

5. Proposed Gate System Alternatives
In the current market, two types of gate system were reviewed as candidates: typical gate system and smart
gate system. A review of key features and operation analysis were carried out to compare the two gate
systems, develop conclusions and recommendations.

    5.1. Alternatives Description
    The main features and gate operations of those two gate systems are described as follows respectively.
    Alternative 1: Typical Community Gate System
        Venetian Lakes community was selected as a referenced gated community. The gate system is a
        typical Bar Code Card control access system including main components of electronic access
        barcode card, bar code card reader, magnetic physical barrier and access operator.

        Gate operation process: In this gate, the visitors stop and are processed by a guard that input the
        vehicles and drivers' identification into a database to grant access. Residents also stop to swap
        their access cards to a bar code card reader to grant access.

        Operation data was collected including service time per entry and hourly service rate for
        residents/visitors during AM/PM peak periods and listed in Table 3.

                        Visitor
                                  PM          41.1 sec            88 vphpl

Alternative 2: Smart Community Gate System
    Smart community gate system is becoming more and more popular in applications as parking
    garages, surface lots, communities, university and hospital campuses. The smart system is
    featured with high speed, convenience and security.

    The main components of a smart gate system include Integrated Automatic Vehicle Identification
    (AVI) Reader using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, small radio frequency (RF)
    transponders (windshield mount tags or credit card size transponders), magnetic auto-control
    barriers, license plate capture CCTV, digital video recorder (DVR), electronic automatic ID
    scanning and entry management system software. The specifications of the proposed Smart gate
    system are presented in Appendix B.

    Gate operation: A non restricted soft gate operations with optional processing for visitors where
    drivers are processed automatically through electronic ID scanning and license plate capture
    CCTV. Residents can use windshield mount tags or credit card size transponders which are
    automatically detected and identified by the AVI reader when approaching the detection area.

    Based on recommended value from manufacture, system operation parameters such as service
    time per entry and hourly service rate for residents/visitors during AM/PM peak periods are shown
    in Table 4.

       Note: Average service time for visitors during AM and PM is based on a recommended value of 35 seconds from
       manufacture.

5.2. Alternatives Simulation Analysis
In order to determine the delay time and the percentile of queued vehicles which will be used to design
the entrance storage length, a simulation tool of ARENA version 11.0 was adopted to model the
entrance gate system operation. In ARENA, the following activities were modeled: vehicles arrival at the
gate, vehicles waiting for security check, and vehicles entering the community. The model outputs are
presented in Appendix C.

Based on the data collected for Venetian Lakes community in the previous study, it was noted that the
distribution percentages of two types of arrivals were 85% residents and 15% visitors respectively. In
this study, these values are adopted, and the arrival volumes were distributed between residents and
visitors. Furthermore, an exponential distribution was applied to model the traffic arrival headways




                                                 Page 5
(assuming the number of arrivals following a Poisson distribution). Table 5 shows the ARENA input
parameters.

To model the random process of the service time, a uniform distribution was used for the gate service
time, and the maximum and minimum values were varied ±10% range from the average value. Table
6 presents the service time distribution data.

With all the above inputs, the ARENA model was run and model performance data such as average
delay time, probability of equal or less than three queued vehicles, 90%, 95% and 98% percentile of
queued vehicles were obtained based on a one hour operation averaged over 10 simulation runs.
Table 7 shows a comparison between performance measurements of the two gate systems.

    5.3. Alternatives Evaluation
    According to the gated development requirements in Transportation and Land Development 2nd
    Edition, ITE, 2002, the following recommendations should be met for a gated community:

        · Community with more than 100 number of dwelling units, the minimum gate storage length is
          100 feet.
        · Also, storage distance in advance of the gate needs to be of sufficient length to have a very high
          probability of storing all arriving vehicles. A 98% probability is suggested for gated access for a
          major arterial. Peak 15-minute interval volume expressed in vehicles per hour should be used for
          delay and queue analysis.

    Based on the previous outlines, for the proposed gate system, minimum storage length and the
    probability of storing arriving vehicles were revised with an assumption of 25 feet storage length per
    vehicle. The results are listed in Table 8 for the three gates respectively.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the gate operation analysis performed during the development of this report, the following
conclusions and recommendations were determined. Also, Figure 3 shows the locations of the proposed
gated facilities.

    Waterstone Way at SW 137th Avenue Eastern Entrance:
        A smart gate system is recommended with a minimum design storage length of 125 feet. Figure 4
        presents a design layout of this entrance gate in conformance with the architectural plans. A review
        of the architectural plans shows that the proposed location will provide enough storage capacity.

    Waterstone Way at SW 312th Street Southern Entrance:
        A smart gate system is proposed with a minimum design storage length of 500 feet. Due to the
        long storage needed during the AM school hours, unrestricted operations are recommended for the
        access through this gate during the referenced peak period. Figure 5 presents a design layout of
        this entrance gate in conformance with the architectural plans. A review of the architectural plans
        shows that the proposed location will provide enough storage capacity.

    Waterstone Boulevard at SW 137th Avenue Eastern Entrance:
        A smart gate system is recommended. Figure 6 presents a design layout of this entrance gate in
        conformance with the architectural plans. A review of the architectural plans shows that the
        proposed gate located beyond the recommended 100 feet minimum design storage will provide
        enough capacity.

Available Versions

Barriers may be supplied with the barrier
boom fitted to either the right or left hand
side. In its standard configuration the main-
tenance access door is positioned at the
rear, although on request it can be any one
of the other sides.

The Round Barrier Boom MSB 4

The round boom is made of highly stable
aluminium Ø 3" x 1/18" profile, and finished
with an RAL 9010 white powder coat then
applied with bright red reflective tape strips.

The Octagonal Barrier Boom MSB 5

This boom is extruded from highly stable
aluminium alloy to produce an octagonal
profile of 4" x 21/8" x 1/16" and finished
with an RAL 9010 white powder coat then
applied with bright red reflective tape strips.

The Control Device

Both the MIB 10 and MIB 20 barriers may
only be operated in conjunction with the
respective MLC controllers especially deve-
loped by Magnetic. Refer to the applicable
MF data sheets for relevant details in each
case.

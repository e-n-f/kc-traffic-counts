Subject:             Park Vista Square Development, Left-Turn Analysis

Introduction

This report presents the findings of a traffic study performed to review the
impacts of removing the left-turn restriction along Park Street at Buena Vista
Avenue in Alameda, California upon completion of the proposed Park Vista
Square development located at the northeast corner of Park Street and Buena
Vista Avenue. The City of Alameda currently restricts left-turn movements from
northbound Park Street and also from southbound Park Street to Buena Vista
Avenue Monday through Friday between the hours of 3:30 PM and 6:00 PM.

Purpose and Objectives

Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc., has been retained by the project applicant, to
prepare the traffic analysis to review the impact of removing the left-turn
restriction in both directions on Park Street at Buena Vista Avenue upon
completion of the proposed Park Vista Square development.

The purpose of this study is to document PM intersection operations between the
hours of 3:30 PM and 6:00 PM on a typical weekday. This study will also
review and discuss potential impacts to intersection operations as a result of the
proposed Park Vista Square Development site traffic combined with the removal
of the left-turn restriction at Buena Vista Avenue. The specific objectives of this
study are:

           To conduct existing PM peak hour traffic counts and document existing
           traffic operations during that time;
           To determine the level of service (LOS) at which the study area
           intersection currently operates during the PM peak period;
           To calculate the LOS at which the study area intersection may operate
           during the PM peak period upon completion of the Park Vista Square
           development, and removal of the left-turn restriction in both directions
           on Park Street at Buena Vista Avenue; and
        To evaluate the overall impact to intersection LOS assuming the
        development is built and the left-turn restriction is removed.

Study Area

The study intersection is located on Alameda Island in the City of Alameda,
California. Alameda is adjacent to the City of Oakland with three bridges and
one tunnel connecting traffic between the two cities.

Park Street is a north/south arterial that connects the City of Alameda with the
City of Oakland. Park Street is a four-lane road (two lanes in each direction)
with no dedicated turn lanes at its intersection with Buena Vista Avenue. On-
street parking is permitted along both sides of Park Street.

Buena Vista Avenue is an east/west arterial carrying primarily residential traffic
through the study area. Buena Vista Avenue is a two-lane road (one lane in each
direction) with a dedicated eastbound left-turn lane (turn lane for traffic going
from eastbound Buena Vista Avenue to southbound Park Street) at the study
intersection. On-street parking is permitted along both sides of Buena Vista
Avenue.

Existing Conditions (With Left-Turn Restrictions)

The intersection is currently controlled by a two-phase traffic signal. Left-turn
restrictions are in effect in both directions along Park Street at Buena Vista
Avenue between the hours of 3:30 PM and 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday.
During field observations, a small number of vehicles were observed violating
the left-turn restriction in both the northbound and southbound direction along
Park Street. Vehicles which were observed making left-turn movements from
Park Street during the restricted period were eliminated from the Existing
Conditions (With Left-Turn Restriction) intersection LOS analysis; however,
these vehicles were still documented in the turning movement count data sheets.
A majority of traffic was observed obeying the left-turn restriction.

A turning movement count was conducted between the hours of 3:00 PM and
6:00 PM on Thursday, April 16, 2009 (see Attachment A). The count data
indicated that the intersection peak hour begins at 5:00 PM and ends at 6:00 PM.
A total of 2,793 vehicles passed through the intersection during the PM peak
hour (11 of which were observed making left-turns from Park Street), with
approximately 8 percent of traffic coming from westbound Buena Vista, 22
percent from eastbound Buena Vista, 32 percent from northbound Park Street,
and 38 percent from southbound Park Street.

The traffic counts, lane geometry, and signal phasing were used as inputs into the
level of services (LOS) calculations. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) methodology contained in the Synchro 7.0 software program was used to
calculate the existing LOS with the left-turn restriction. The results indicated
that the Park Street/Buena Vista Avenue intersection currently operates at LOS B
which is generally consistent with the field-observed LOS. The existing LOS
calculation worksheets are attached (Attachment B).

Existing Conditions ­ With Development (Without Left-Turn Restriction)

Project Description

The Park Vista Square Development property (1700-1726 Park Street) is located
on the northeast corner of Park Street and Buena Vista Avenue and the existing
land use of the project area is a vacant lot adjacent to a smog testing station. The
proposed land use for the Park Vista Square Development is 4,900 square feet
(s.f.) of second floor office space and 20,814 s.f. of ground-floor retail space.
Existing vehicular access from Park Street to the project site will be closed.
Vehicular access to the proposed development off-street parking will be provided
only from Buena Vista Avenue. No vehicular access will be provided from Park
Street upon completion of the Park Vista Square Development.

Project Trip Generation, Distribution, and Assignment Estimates

The number of new PM peak-hour trips that the proposed Park Vista Square
Development would generate was calculated using the procedures outlined in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation Handbook. Trip
generation rates, for the applicable land uses, were obtained from Trip
Generation (ITE, 8th Edition) and applied to the size of the project. The proposed
project is estimated to generate approximately 60 PM peak-hour trips (see
Attachment C).

Once the trip generation calculations had been completed, a number of
assumptions needed to be made to determine trip distribution and traffic
assignment. The trip distribution and assignment assumptions were based on
engineering judgment, field observations, and existing travel patterns.

Based on existing travel patterns, the analysis assumes that approximately ninety
percent (90%) of site-generated trips are coming from/going to Park Street and
the remaining ten percent (10%) of trips are assumed to be coming from/going to
the east on Buena Vista Avenue. As shown in the trip assignment figure in
Attachment D, a majority of the outbound site traffic is projected to turn onto
northbound or southbound Park Street, with a small number of vehicles
continuing west on Buena Vista Avenue. A majority of the inbound traffic is

                                         3
projected to come from southbound Park Street, with a small number of vehicles
arriving from northbound Park Street or westbound Buena Vista Avenue.

The trip assignment was added to the existing volumes to represent Existing
Conditions ­ With Development (Without Left-Turn Restrictions) for the PM
peak period. The left-turn volumes on Park Street are projected to increase with
removal of the left-turn prohibition. To estimate the increase in Park Street left-
turn volumes, a comparison of the existing Park Street left-turn volumes to the
existing through volumes was conducted between 3:00 PM and 3:30 PM when
the restriction is not in effect. The results indicate that the left-turns comprise up
to five percent of the existing through volumes on Park Street. Thus, the left-turn
volumes on Park Street were increased by up to five percent of the projected Park
Street through volumes.

The analysis also assumed that the current roadway geometry would remain, and
no modifications to the traffic signal would take place. The results of the LOS
calculations indicate that the intersection is projected to operate at LOS C during
the PM peak hour with the added site traffic combined with the removal of the
left-turn restriction at Buena Vista Avenue (see Attachment E). The average
control delay, which is used to determine the intersection LOS, increases from
17.3 seconds to 20.4 seconds. Although the intersection is projected to go from
an LOS B to an LOS C, the average control delay under project conditions is still
relatively close to the average control delay under existing conditions (see Table
1). The City of Alameda Transportation Commission and Dowling Associates,
Inc. have proposed threshold of significance intersection LOS D for autos
(Transportation Commission Meeting ­ April 22, 2009). The projected
intersection LOS C at Park Street and Buena Vista Avenue falls within the
acceptable range of the proposed threshold criteria.

      Highway Capacity Manual, 4th Edition, Washington DC, 2000, Exhibit 16-2

The eastbound-left approach along Buena Vista Avenue experienced the largest
increase in delay (6.1 seconds). Approach delay is projected to increase along



                                          4
Park Street in the northbound and southbound directions by 2.4 seconds and 4.2
seconds respectively.

Findings and Recommendations

We have drawn the following conclusions based on the analysis and findings
documented above.
      The Park Street/Buena Vista Avenue intersection currently operates at
      acceptable levels of service, LOS B, during the PM peak hour with the
      left-turn restriction on Park Street.
      The addition of traffic from the proposed Park Vista Square
      Development, located at the northeast corner of the intersection, along
      with removal of the left-turn restrictions is not projected to significantly
      degrade intersection operations. The intersection is projected to operate
      at LOS C during the PM peak hour.

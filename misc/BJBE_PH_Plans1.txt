                       SPECIAL USE CRITERIA FOR REQUESTED
                            AMENDMENT TO 0-06-56 BJBE


1. Compatible with Existing Development
   The nature and intensity of the activities involved and the size, placement and design of any
   structures proposed will be so planned that the Special Use will be compatible with the
   existing development and will not impede the normal and orderly development and
   improvement of surrounding property.

           The requested amendment to allow an additional 225 religious school students on
           Sundays only will be compatible with the existing development and will not impede
           normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property in that
           there are no proposed changes in the approved site plan, landscape plan, building
           elevations, or lighting plan, and as concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant:

               (a) The adjacent roadways can accommodate the additional anticipated Sunday
                   school traffic by continuing and supplementing a number of the traffic
                   operations that were recommended when the site was originally improved;
                   and

               (b) The projected parking demand can be accommodated on-site along with the
                   additional office park spaces which are provided by covenant.

2. Lot of Sufficient Size
   The size of the lot will be sufficient for the use proposed.

           Inasmuch as both access and parking can be accommodated, as indicated by
           Petitioner's traffic consultant, the size of the lot will be sufficient for the proposed
           use.

3. Traffic
   The location of the Special Use within the Village will be such that adverse effects on
   surrounding properties will be minimal, particularly regarding the traffic generated by the
   Special Use.

           As concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant, the adjacent roadways can
           accommodate additional anticipated Sunday school traffic by continuing and
           supplementing a number of the traffic operations that were recommended when the
           site was originally approved, such that there will be no adverse effects on surrounding
           properties, particularly regarding the traffic generated by the Special Use as amended.

4. Parking and Access
   Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use and properly located, and the
   entrance and exit drives will be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances.
           As concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant, the entrance and exit drives as
           currently constructed are laid out as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances
           notwithstanding the proposed increase in an additional 225 religious school students
           on Sundays only. It is further concluded by Petitioner's traffic consultant that parking
           areas will be of adequate size for the Special Use as proposed to be amended
           inasmuch as the projected parking demands can be accommodated by on-site parking
           along with additional office park spaces provided by covenant.

5. Effect on Neighborhood
   In all respects the Special Use will not be significantly or materially detrimental to the health,
   safety and welfare of the public or injurious to the other property or improvements in the
   neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values in the surrounding area.

           The Special Use has been in operation since its approval in 2006, and has operated
           with no deleterious effect on the neighborhood or surrounding area. Based upon
           Petitioner's traffic consultant's conclusions that both access and parking demand will
           not be negatively impacted by the proposed modification to the Special Use, the
           Special Use, as amended, will not significantly or materially be detrimental to the
           health, safety, and welfare of the public or injurious to other property or
           improvements in the neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values in
           the surrounding area.

6. Adequate Facilities
   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or
   are being provided.

           The proposed increase in Sunday school students will have no impact whatsoever on
           existing utilities, drainage, or other facilities. As concluded by Petitioner's traffic
           consultant, existing access roads can accommodate the additional anticipated traffic
           by continuing and supplementing a number of the traffic operations which were
           recommended when the site was originally approved. Accordingly, adequate utilities,
           access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being
           provided.

7. Adequate Buffering
   Adequate fencing and/or screening shall be provided to ensure the enjoyment of surrounding
   properties, to provide for the public safety or to screen parking areas and other visually
   incompatible uses.

           The proposed amendment to the Special Use does not require any changes to the
           buffering which was approved and provided pursuant to the original Special Use,
           such that adequate fencing and/or screening is provided to insure enjoyment of
           surrounding properties and to provide for public safety and to screen parking areas
           and other visually and incompatible uses without any modifications thereto.

Amendment to Special Use for the BJBE property
Village of Deerfield


To Whom It May Concern:
Ms. Sandy Robbins of B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim has (BJBE) has asked me to write a letter of
recommendation for the temple and it is with pleasure that I do so.
Ms. Robbins and the temple have rented significant amounts of space from Deerfield Public Schools District
109 since 2006 for religious education classes for both weekday evenings and their Sunday morning program
(the last few years their use was Sunday mornings only). She, her teachers and students have been excellent
partners in using this community space while public school is out of session. They treat our classrooms and
teachers' belongings respectfully. BJBE always had traffic management personnel in place and we did not have
any issues with traffic flow within the site or with the surrounding neighborhood.
I understand that the Deerfield Plan Commission and Village Board are meeting to discuss an Amendment to
Special Use for the BJBE property and I hope you will consider this letter in your considerations.
Sincerely,




Greg Himebaugh
Assistant Superintendent of Finance & Operations

             1201 Lake Cook Road
             Proposed Education Program Consolidation
             Deerfield, Illinois

                SECTION 1 PROJECT CONTEXT AND SUMMARY STATEMENT

GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. (GHA) has investigated the traffic planning and parking
requirements of the above referenced project. Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE)
proposes to expand its current on-site Sunday School program by bringing those students currently
utilizing space at Caruso Middle School back to the site.

Our study findings are discussed below and various recommendations are offered for your consideration.
Exhibits referenced in the text are centrally located in the Technical Addendum at the end of this report.

Briefly summarizing, we believe that the adjacent roadways can accommodate the additional anticipated
Sunday School traffic by continuing and supplementing a number of the Traffic Operations that were
recommended when the Temple site was originally approved. Furthermore, projected parking demands
can be accommodated by BJBE's on-site and agreed to shared parking supply. Key elements to
successfully managing the additional traffic and parking include:

      Continued coordination with adjacent religious schools (Hellenic American Academy and the
      Chicagoland Jewish High School) to minimize overlap of significant activities and special events.
      Peak Traffic for Sunday School occurs when the majority of the adjacent office space is at minimal
      operations.
      Continue to seek agreements to accommodate additional on and off site overflow parking.
      Maintain current one-way flow around BJBE site and seek use of CJHS connection and driveway to
      separate exiting traffic.
      Sunday School and primary worship services are not concurrent.
                                                                              B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim
                                                                                    1201 Lake Cook Road
                                                                                            Deerfield, IL
                          SECTION 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Exhibits 1 and 2 ­ Site Location Map and Site Context

Exhibit 1 identifies the location of Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim (BJBE), which is
comprised of three buildings in the Deerfield Business Center (1141, 1181, and 1201 Lake Cook Road)
and utilizes the 1201 Lake Cook Road address. The Deerfield Business Center is made up of a total of
six buildings located on approximately 10.5-acres at the southwest corner of the Pine Street intersection
with Lake Cook Road in the Village of Deerfield, Illinois.

Approximately 100 feet south of Lake Cook Road, there is an internal intersection that serves the office
development to the west, the Hellenic American Academy located at 1085 Lake Cook Road to the east
and the south leg provides access to both Congregation BJBE and the Chicagoland Jewish High School
(CJHS). All inbound BJBE traffic accesses the site from a point approximately 350 feet south of the
frontage road intersection and circulation around the BJBE buildings is one way clockwise.

Exhibit 2 provides an aerial photo of the surrounding uses for context.

Exhibit 3 ­ Photographic Inventory

Exhibit 3 provides a photo inventory of current operations at the internal Frontage Road intersection as
well as the BJBE entrance and drop off areas.

Exhibit 4 ­ Existing Traffic Volumes

On Sunday April 21, 2013 GHA conducted peak period (7:00 am to 2:00 pm) traffic counts at the
Frontage road intersections with Pine Street, the Deerfield business Center driveways and the BJBE /
CJHS driveway split. Two resultant peak hours were observed associated with the predominant drop-off
/ pick-up movements in lieu of parents staying on-site with their children. The "inbound" peak occurred
from 9:00 to 10:00 am and the "outbound" peak hour occurred from 11:00 am to 12:00 pm. Those traffic
volumes are illustrated in Exhibit 4. While we present and discuss hourly volumes the true peaks of
these two movements are much shorter, with the inbound peak only lasting between 15-20 minutes and
the outbound peak lasting between 25-30 minutes.

Observations were also conducted by GHA at Caruso Middle School on Sunday May 5, 2013 to
quantify the impact of moving the Sunday school program from Caruso to the 1201 Lake Cook site.
Similar, shortened peak periods were observed at Caruso.

No unusual delays occurred during the counts such as foul weather (e.g. heavy snowfall or rain), road
construction, or emergency vehicle activity that would adversely affect the volumes or travel patterns.

Traffic count data summaries can be found in Appendix I.

Exhibit 5 ­ Existing Parking Occupancy

Concurrently with our Sunday traffic observations, GHA conducted hourly parking occupancy counts in
the Deerfield Business Center, the Hellenic American Academy lot and the CJHS parking lot. Exhibit 5
illustrates the parking lot designations as well as summarizes the parking occupancy by hour and the
                                                              Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc. ­ Page 2
                                                                                B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim
                                                                                      1201 Lake Cook Road
                                                                                              Deerfield, IL
peak occupancy during our observation period. As can be seen, while HAA and CJHS had some limited
activities, the Deerfield Business Center was almost vacant and the CJHS parking demand peaked at 80
vehicles on site during the 10-11:00 am hour.

The following tabulates the supplemental parking observations at Caruso School which were conducted
on Sunday May 5, 2013.

Notes: Portions of parking demand associated with athletic field use. Special BJBE program on site in
conjunction with athletic field use resulted in offsite parking on adjacent residential streets. BJBE
demand represents typical operations of ±30 teachers and staff.

                      SECTION 3 PROJECT TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS

Exhibit 6 ­ Building Plan

Included as Exhibit 6 is the April 15, 2013 site plan prepared by Finegold Alexander and Associates,
Inc. (FAA) depicting the planned internal renovations to the 1141 building to accommodate the
additional students that will be relocated from Caruso School.

Exhibit 7 ­ Project Traffic Characteristics

Traffic Generations

Part A of Exhibit 7 tabulates the observed traffic volumes for the current Sunday Peak Periods at BJBE
as observed by GHA on Sunday April 21 2013 as well as the subsequent observations at Caruso School
on Sunday May 5, 2013. Traffic volumes at both locations exhibited distinct "inbound" and "outbound"
peaks which have been tabulated separately. As can be seen, the "inbound" and "outbound" peaks were
observed between 9:00 to 10:00 am and 11:00 am to 12:00 pm respectively. These periods coincide with
the beginning and ending times of the Sunday school program from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm.

The total number of inbound and outbound trips during the two peak hours was utilized to determine an
average trip rate for the total number of attendees at the two sites. We feel that this represents a
conservative approach to projecting traffic volume for a larger group because: 1) parents with children
in multiple age groups / classes would have been counted at both locations, 2) the trips at the Temple
site also include traffic activities associated with other adult oriented programs and worship that occur
concurrently with Sunday School.

Part B. of Exhibit 7 utilizes the above referenced average rate to project traffic volumes out to the
ultimate 700 student capacity of the BJBE campus on Lake Cook Road. The increased student
attendance at BJBE is expected to generate approximately 450 additional trips during each of the peak
                                                             Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc. ­ Page 3
                                                                                B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim
                                                                                      1201 Lake Cook Road
                                                                                              Deerfield, IL
hours. As noted above, this volume is likely overstated, but we believe that it allows us to analyze the
maximum potential impacts of the planned consolidation of the education program.

Trip Distribution

Part C of Exhibit 7 summarizes the observed directional distribution of BJBE traffic. We observed that
slightly more traffic arrived and departed to and from the west along Lake Cook Road and the frontage
road than to and from the east. After years of being prohibited, traffic is now permitted to travel north
and south across Lake Cook Road at Pine Street. Due to the current separated programs, it is possible
that the ultimate distribution could be different as parents make a single stop in Deerfield vs. potentially
two stops due to the current separation of the education program.

                                     SECTION 4 EVALUATION

Exhibits 8 & 9 ­ Sunday School Traffic Assignments

Traffic generated by the proposed consolidation of BJBE Sunday School classes was "assigned" to the
adjacent roadways based on the project characteristics (see Exhibit 7) and the site's access system and is
illustrated in Exhibit 8. BJBE traffic was then combined with the Existing Traffic volumes (see Exhibit
4) to yield the Total Traffic assignment, which is presented, in Exhibit 9.

Exhibit 10 ­ Parking Calculations

The current BJBE site provides approximately 149 parking spaces. There is an agreement with Deerfield
Business Center to utilize an additional 40 and ongoing discussions with CJHS to utilize some of their
189 spaces for overflow.

In GHA's original analyses of parking demands for BJBE, the maximum parking demand on site was
expected to occur on Friday evenings and holidays when the full congregation attends services in the
sanctuary. During the week programs were expected to have a maximum of 100 attendees. Therefore
parking demand for the original development was based on the seating capacity of the Chapel space
(approximately 711).

Using the Place of Worship calculation (1 space per 4 seats) parking demand / requirement was
established at 178 spaces (1 space / 4 seats = 711/4 = 177.75). While not met on-site it was proposed
that BJBE would work with adjacent properties to make arrangements for overflow parking when those
uses are not at peak operations.

Our observed Peak Demand for parking at BJBE on Sunday was 80 spaces. Of the various activities that
occurred at Caruso School, the typical parking demand for Sunday School is approximately 30,
primarily teachers and adult assistants for the education programs. These combined observations result
in an average parking demand of 0.23 spaces per attendee (almost exactly the same as the 1 space per 4
seats of the worship area calculations). While we are aware of no current plan to add significant staff for
the consolidation and expansion of the on-site education program, if parking demand increased at the
average rate of 0.23 spaces per attendee to 700 attendees total an additional 52 spaces would be
required.



                                                               Gewalt Hamilton Associates, Inc. ­ Page 4
                                                                                 B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim
                                                                                       1201 Lake Cook Road
                                                                                               Deerfield, IL
Exhibit 10 includes three separate tables which provide:

Part A ­ Observed parking demand in the study area at BJBE as well as supplemental demand of Sunday
         School programming at Caruso.

Part B ­ Projected additional demand of net increase to 700 students at 0.23 spaces per student average
         as observed.

Part C ­ Future Parking demands in Study area. As can be seen there is only one hour that parking is
         expected to exceed demand of the on-site BJBE supply of 149 spaces. However the anticipated
         demand does not exceed the additional 40 spaces available to BJBE in the Deerfield Business
         Center.

Exhibit 11 ­ Recommended Traffic Operations

Exhibit 11 notes key operational recommendations to allow the existing site and surrounding roadways
to accommodate the anticipated increases in traffic associated with consolidation of the Sunday School
program

1. Continue to seek and utilize cross parking agreements for overflow parking at peak times.
2. Utilize traffic personnel to coordinate internal intersection operations at south end of drop off lane.
3. Utilize CJHS cross access as additional site exit for drop off / pick up maneuvers during peak
   periods
4. Maintain one-way circulation pattern on site
5. Consider alternate drop-off pick up locations if necessary

While we believe our analyses has conservatively considered the maximum traffic and parking impacts
on site, should congestion and parking concerns arise, BJBE could always consider staggered class start
and end times to reduce the intensity of the short traffic peaks.

Note that all of the following recommendations from the original study have been completed:

   Extend the westbound left turn lane from its current length of 150 feet to 300 feet. [CCHD]
   Modify existing traffic signal timing and phasing at the Lake Cook / Pine Street intersection.
   [CCHD]
   Widen the south leg of the frontage road intersection to provide two northbound lanes. [CJHS]
   Coordinate with CJHS to consider a one way (right turn only) connection near the BJBE building
   entrance. [BJBE]
   Consider a second, gated connection between the BJBE and CJHS sites to allow easier cross access
   for shared parking arrangements and provide both sites with an alternate emergency access. [BJBE]

PLANNING & BACKGROUND DATA 
 
Project  Justification  Statement:  The  intersection  of  SR  360/Powder  Spring  Street  and  SR  5/SR  120/  South  Marietta 
Parkway  is  experiencing  significant  delays  during  both  AM  and  PM  peak  hour.  The  addition  of  an  additional 
westbound  right  turn  lane  on  SR  5/SR  120/South  Marietta  Parkway  at  SR  360/Powder  Spring  Street  will  help  to 
alleviate the immediate need for a major intersection reconstruction. 
 
    · The City of Marietta and LAI Engineering prepared the project Justification report to be approved by GDOT. 
 
    · The  City  of  Marietta  initiated  the  intersection  improvement  project  at  SR  360/Powder  Spring  Street  and  SR 
         5/SR  120/South  Marietta  Parkway  to  improve  the  capacity  and  operational  efficiency  at  the  intersection. 
         The  City  also  initiated  the  project  to  improve  the  current  capacity  of  the  two  northbound  left  turning  lanes 
         at SR 5/Atlanta Street and SR 120/South Marietta Parkway as the majority of this traffic makes a westbound 
         right  turn  at  SR  360/Powder  Spring  Street,  through  a  single  right  turn  lane.  Meeting  Minutes  for  the  project 
         kickoff is attached to the document. 
 
    · The  traffic  study  by  LAI  showed  significant  traffic  accessing  the  northbound  SR  5/SR  120/South  Marietta 
         Parkway  from  the  adjacent  intersection  at  SR  5/Atlanta  Street  and  SR  120/South  Marietta  Parkway  and  vice 
         versa.  With  the  existing  and  the  future  projected  traffic,  the  intersection  is  failing  from  the  capacity 
         standpoint.  The  study  intersection  has  also  observed  crashes  at  the  intersection.  Approximately,  36  percent 
         of  the  crashes  at  the  intersection  were  observed  to  be  rearend  along  the  westbound  right  turning  lane 
         during 2011. 
 
    · The  City  of  Marietta  requests  an  additional  westbound  right  turn  lane  on  SR  5/SR  120/South  Marietta 
         Parkway  at  SR  360/Powder  Spring  Street  to  improve  the  capacity  and  eliminate  the  immediate  need  for  a 
         major intersection reconstruction. 
 
    · The  current  length  of  the  proposed  project  is  400  feet  with  the  limits  extending  from  the  existing  CSX  right 
         of  way  to  the  east  and  SR  5/SR  120/S.  Marietta  Parkway  to  the  west.  Location  map  shows  the  approximate 
         limits of the project. 

Description  of  the  proposed  project:  The  project  is  located  in  the  City  of  Marietta  at  the  intersection  of  SR 
360/Powder  Spring  Street  and  SR  5/  SR  120/South  Marietta  Parkway.  The  proposed  project  will  add  an  additional 
westbound  right  turn  lane  on  SR  5/SR  120/South  Marietta  Parkway  at  SR  360/Powder  Spring  Street  to  alleviate  the 
capacity  issues  at  the  intersection.  The  current  length  of  the  proposed  project  is  400  feet  with  a  speed  limit  of  40 
MPH.  The  existing  section  of  the  roadway  has  5  lanes  and  is  functionally  classified  as  an  Urban  Principal  Arterial 
Street. The proposed section of the roadway will provide an additional westbound right turning lane with 200 feet of 
deceleration and 100 of taper length.

ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSION 
 
Alternative selection: 
 
Preferred  Alternative  (Alternative  2):  Addition  of  an  exclusive  right  turning  lane  with  yield  movement  at  the 
intersection.  The  existing  right  turning  lane  will  be  a  protected  right  divided  by  an  island  from  the  yield  movement 
right turning lane. 
         Estimated Property Impacts:  $0.00                                           Estimated Total Cost:               $212,176.66
                 Estimated ROW Cost:  $0.00                                            Estimated CST Time:                     3 Months
Rationale: The intersection of SR 360/Powder Spring Street and SR 5/SR 120/ South Marietta Parkway provided less 
delays and queue lengths with the preferred alternative. 
 
NoBuild Alternative: NoBuild 
         Estimated Property Impacts:  $0.00                                           Estimated Total Cost:                       $0.00
                 Estimated ROW Cost:  $0.00                                            Estimated CST Time:                    0 Months
Rationale:    The  intersection  of  SR  360/Powder  Spring  Street  and  SR  5/SR  120/  South  Marietta  Parkway  is 
experiencing significant delays during both AM and PM peak hour with no improvements. 
 
Alternative 1: Addition of an exclusive right turning lane with protected movement. The existing right turning lane will 
also be transformed into a protected right turning movement. 
         Estimated Property Impacts:  $0.00                                           Estimated Total Cost:               $197,786.12
                 Estimated ROW Cost:  $0.00                                            Estimated CST Time:                     3 Months
Rationale: The intersection of SR 360/Powder Spring Street and SR 5/SR 120/ South Marietta Parkway provided less 
delays and queue lengths, but the preferred alternative provided better results.

Location:

The project is located in the City of Marietta at the intersection of SR 360/Powder Spring Street and SR
5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway.

Reason for Investigation:

The intersection of SR 360/Powder Spring Street and SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway is
experiencing significant delays during AM and PM peak hours. Significant traffic was observed to access
northbound SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway from the adjacent intersection at SR 5/Atlanta Road
and SR 120/South Marietta Parkway. Similarly, significant eastbound SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta
Parkway traffic was observed from southbound SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway. Approximately,
649 vehicles make the westbound right turn at the study intersection through a single right turn lane along
SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway during a typical PM peak hour. Similarly, 783 vehicles make the
southbound left turn at the intersection through dual left turn lanes along SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta
Parkway during a typical AM peak hour.

The study intersection also has a number of documented crashes. Approximately, 36 percent of the
crashes at the intersection observed were rear-ending along the westbound right turning lane in 2011.

With the existing and the future projected traffic, the intersection is failing from the capacity standpoint. It
is believed that adding an additional westbound right turn lane on SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway
at SR 360/Powder Spring Street will help to alleviate the immediate need for a major intersection
reconstruction. Also, the current capacity of the two northbound left turning lanes at SR 5/Atlanta Road
and SR 120/South Marietta Parkway is not fully utilized as the majority of this traffic makes a westbound
right turn at SR 360/Powder Spring Street, through a single right turn lane.

Different alternatives, including a No-Build Alternative have been studied and the results of the capacity
analysis for the study intersection are presented in Capacity Analysis section.

Description of the Intersection:

SR 360/Powder Spring Street: SR 360/Powder Spring Street is a four-lane roadway with exclusive left
turning lanes. According to GDOT Highway System Status Maps, SR 360/Powder Spring Street is
functionally classified as an Urban Minor Arterial Street and runs south of SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta
Parkway. SR 360/Powder Spring Street travels north-south with an average daily traffic of 40,650
vehicles per day. There are two pairs of CSX railroad tracks that run parallel to SR 360/Powder Springs
Street. The railroad runs on an overpass over SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway to the east of the
study intersection. The land uses along this route consists of commercial, restaurants, single-family and
multi-family residential dwellings.

SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway: SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway is a four-lane roadway
with exclusive left turning and right turning lanes. According to GDOT Highway System Status Maps,
SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway is functionally classified as an Urban Principal Arterial Street. SR
5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway travels east-west to the east of the study intersection, and north-south
to the north of the study intersection. The average daily traffic along this section of the roadway is 23,920
vehicles per day and the land uses along this route consists of commercial, restaurants, single-family and
multi-family residential dwellings.

Figure 1 shows the location map of the study intersection.

120/South Marietta Parkway during the same day. The AM and PM peak hour turning movement counts
and 24-hour approach counts are included in Appendix B.

Existing Traffic Control:

The intersection of SR 360/ Powder Spring Street and SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway is currently
operating as a signal control intersection. The existing signal installation is span-wire mounted with LED
signal heads. The signal is a 6-phase fully actuated coordinated operation with pedestrian phases serving
2, 6 and 8 phases of the intersection. The westbound and southbound left-turns at the intersection are
protected only while all other left-turns at the intersection are permissive. The signal operates in
coordination along SR 360/ Powder Spring Street.

Vehicular Speeds:

The posted speed limit on SR 360/Powder Spring Street at the study intersection is 40 miles per hour.

The posted speed limit on SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway within the project limits is 40 miles per

Adjacent Signalized Intersections:

There is an existing signal at the intersection of SR 5/Atlanta Road and SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta
Parkway and is located approximately 560 feet east of SR 360/Powder Spring Street. The next existing
signal is located approximately 1,440 feet north of SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway at the
intersection of SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway and Waverly Way.

Capacity Analysis:

LAI utilized 2012 traffic counts for the purpose of this study. The traffic counts at the intersection were
collected on December 05th 2012. Both AM and PM peak hour turning movement counts and 24-Hr
approach counts were collected at the study intersection. Capacity analysis for three different alternatives
including a No-Build alternative was studied and the results of the analysis along with the description of
each alternative are presented in the following section:

No-Build Alternative

The no-build alternative does not provide any traffic operational improvements at the study intersection.

Alternative 1

Alternative 1 includes addition of an exclusive westbound right turning lane controlled by a traffic signal.
The existing yield controlled westbound right turning lane along with the proposed lane will be controlled

With the existing controller phasing, the eastbound through/left (Phase 4) and westbound through (Phase
8) movements operate together and can create conflict with the proposed westbound right turns that
operate with protected Phase 8. To avoid this traffic conflict, the existing eastbound left turns should be
converted to Protected only to operate under a new Phase 7.

Also, the existing northbound left turns operating as a "permitted" movement will be converted to
"protected only" movement with a new Phase 1. With the two new phases, the signal will operate on an 8-
phase fully actuated coordinated operation with coordination along SR 120/S. Marietta Parkway.

Alternative 2 (Preferred Alternative)

Alternative 2 also includes addition of an exclusive westbound right turning lane, but the additional lane
will be controlled by a yield sign at the intersection. The existing yield controlled westbound right turning
lane will be controlled by a traffic signal and operated on a protected movement with Phase 8 (Westbound
Through) and Phase 5 (Southbound Left).

With the existing controller phasing, the eastbound through/left (Phase 4) and westbound through (Phase
8) movements operate together and can create conflict with the proposed westbound right turns that
operate with protected Phase 8. To avoid this traffic conflict, the existing eastbound left turns should be
converted to Protected Only to operate under a new Phase 7.

LAI utilized Synchro 7.0 to conduct the capacity analysis for Existing (2013), Opening Year (2014), and
Design Year (2034) for No-Build, Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 (Preferred Alternative) conditions at
the study intersection. Future traffic projections were estimated based on one percent (1 %) growth rate
per year from the existing year. Table 2 summarizes the Level of Service (LOS) and average control delay
for existing, opening year and design year traffic conditions. Table 3 summarizes the queue lengths for
the eastbound and westbound traffic along the study intersection.

                                           SR 360/POWDER SPRING STREET & SR 5/SR 120/SOUTH MARIETTA PARKWAY




With the existing lane configuration (No-Build), traffic at SR 360/Powder Spring Street and SR 5/SR
120/South Marietta Parkway operate at LOS E with the average queue length of 723 feet and delay of
67.3 seconds during a typical PM peak hour in 2014.

For Alternative 1 condition, the intersection operates at an LOS D with the average queue length of 418
feet and delay of 39.7 seconds during a typical PM peak hour in opening year (2014). For Alternative 2
condition, the intersection operates at an LOS D with the average queue length of 279 feet and delay of
38.6 seconds during a typical PM peak hour in opening year (2014).

With the addition of exclusive westbound right turn lane operated under yield condition (Alternative 2),
the average controlled delays during PM peak hour in design year (2034) are reduced by 46.9 percent
compared to No-Build condition. Similarly, with Alternative 2 condition, the average controlled delays
during PM peak hour in opening year (2014) are reduced by 42.6 percent compared to No-Build
condition.

Based on the results from the Capacity Analysis as shown in Table 2 and Table 3, Alternative 2 provided
better results compared to No-Build and Alternative 1 conditions.

Also, based on the GDOT Design Policy Manual, the minimum right turn deceleration length required for
the roadway with the posted speed limit of 40 MPH is 150 feet with a taper length of 50 feet. But based
on the current and future traffic conditions at the intersection, the GDOT Construction Detail M-3A will
be adopted for designing the additional right turn lane at the intersection. The GDOT Construction Detail
M-3A requires a minimum storage length of 200 feet and a taper length of 100 feet along SR 5/SR
120/South Marietta Parkway.

Detailed Synchro analysis is included in Appendix E.

Recommendations:

The City of Marietta can improve the overall intersection operations, efficiency and safety by
implementing the following:

   ¾ An additional exclusive right turn lane along westbound SR 5/SR 120/South Marietta Parkway
     with Alternative 2 conditions and a minimum storage length of 200 feet and a taper length of 100
     feet.
   ¾ Installation of sidewalk with ADA ramps at the north east corner of the intersection,
   ¾ Optimize signal timing at the intersection.
   ¾ Improving pedestrian mobility.

1. Background

Introduction
The city of Idanha, Oregon is located along Oregon OR 22 (OR 22) in the North Santiam River
Canyon of the Oregon Cascades, between Salem and Bend and just east of Detroit Lake. The
North Santiam River flows through the southern portion of the city and the river canyon
hillsides frame the city to the north and south. The Willamette National Forest boundary abuts
the city on all sides. Idanha is located within both Marion and Linn counties. The elevation of
Idanha is 1,718 feet.
OR 22 runs east-west through Idanha and functions as the city's primary roadway; the highway
is designated as a statewide freight route and as a segment of a state scenic byway (the West
Cascades Scenic Byway) and a national scenic byway (McKenzie Pass ­ Santiam Pass Scenic
Byway). The portion of the city north of OR 22 includes primarily commercial and government
land uses, including City Hall/library, the post office, and a general store. The portion of the
city south of OR 22 includes primarily residential and industrial uses, such as homes and a
prefabricated wood building manufacturing company. People living south of OR 22 must cross
the highway, often on foot, to access key community facilities. There are also several parcels of
undeveloped land located on both sides of the roadway. Idanha currently does not have public
sewer service, but is actively pursuing the development of a system.
The population of Idanha is approximately 230. Idanha was incorporated as a city in 1949.
Historically, the citizens have been dependent on the timber industry. Since the early 1980s,
changes in technology and environmental regulations have reduced employment opportunities
in the timber industry, affecting the economy in Idanha and the rest of the North Santiam River
Canyon communities. Some recent economic development efforts have focused on the develop-
ment of tourism, given that OR 22 serves as a popular route for recreational travel to Detroit
Lake, Bend, and other Santiam Canyon or central Oregon locations. Other efforts have focused
on business recruitment. OR 22 is one of the key elements for economic development in Idanha,
as it provides access and visibility for area businesses.
Key transportation issues for Idanha have historically focused on OR 22. Major transportation-
related concerns include speeding and pedestrian safety along OR 22, including crossing the
highway at Main Street (near the post office). Additional concerns have included the safety of
school children walking to the school bus stop at the southeast corner of Main Street and OR 22.
Recently, ODOT approved the installation of a flashing yellow signal just west of the Main
Street/OR 22 intersection, in front of the fire station. The signal is activated only under
emergency circumstances. A crosswalk at the Main Street/OR 22 intersection was removed due
to concerns that without other cues to change driver behavior, the crosswalk provided a false
sense of security for pedestrians.

Purpose
The Idanha Transportation Study is intended to recommend solutions to improve the
transportation system in Idanha. The City of Idanha asked the Oregon Department of
Transportation (ODOT) for a study to address the following primary issues:

·    Pedestrian and bicyclist safety, specifically along OR 22 through the city
·    Speeding, specifically along OR 22 through the city
·    Lack of street design along OR 22 that helps to create a "sense of place"
The purpose of the study was to examine alternative roadway treatments along OR 22 and
other transportation solutions that could help address safety concerns while creating a sense of
place through roadway design concepts or transportation solutions.


Study Overview
The Idanha Transportation Study first examines existing and future transportation system
deficiencies in order to develop recommendations for improvements. Most of the study focused
on OR 22, because the highway bisects Idanha and is the primary roadway through the city.
The study included analysis of the following transportation issues:

·    Safety
·    Traffic operations
·    Geometric conditions
·    Access
·    Nonmotorized transportation (e.g., pedestrian and bicycle)
After examination of the existing conditions, it was determined that traffic operations are not
expected to cause unacceptable congestion issues in the study area up to year 2030. Based on
crash history, vehicle crash rates along OR 22 through Idanha are lower than average crash
rates for similar state highways. Geometric issues with the roadway occur in several areas,
including sight distance at the Church Street/OR 22 intersection and shoulder deficiencies
along OR 22.
The primary transportation issues, particularly along OR 22, are:
1. A lack of access control through the main portion of the city
2. Safety issues for walkers and bicyclists, including crossing OR 22
3. Lack of roadway definition, likely leading to speeding and traffic passing on the right
4. Lack of roadway treatments and design that develop a sense of place or encourage travelers
   to slow down
This study provides recommendations to address these issues. Recommendations were grouped
into two phases:
·    Phase 1 addresses safety and nonmotorized concerns in the central city area, including a
     nonmotorized pathway, intersection definition, shoulder improvements to OR 22, and
     gateway treatments.

·    Phase 2 includes longer-term access and development code recommendations to be
     implemented as property in Idanha develops or re-develops.


Study Area
The project study area focuses on the OR 22 corridor through Idanha (approximately between
mileposts 52 and 56) (Figure 1). The study area includes the following boundaries: east to the
end of the industrial area south of OR 22; west to the structure over Boulder Creek; south to the
Marion County line; north to the hillside. Analysis was primarily focused on the following high
priority area: west to vacant parcel past Main Street; east to Church Street; south to encompass
the residential areas on Main Street; north to the hillside.

2. Public Involvement Process

The Idanha Transportation Study was a coordinated approach between ODOT and the City of
Idanha to address City of Idanha transportation concerns, in particular those on the state highway.
Public involvement was a critical element to ensure that community desires, transportation system
needs, and ODOT operations and safety guidance were accurately reflected through the study.


Project Management Team
Public involvement for the Idanha Transportation Study was primarily achieved through the use of
a Project Management Team (PMT) that included representation from a wide range of community
members. The PMT oversaw all steps of the study process. PMT members included City of Idanha
Councilmembers, City of Idanha staff, other Idanha community members (including property
owners along OR 22), ODOT, and consultant staff. The PMT met seven times during the project
(11/22/04, 1/31/05, 2/28/05, 3/28/05, 4/18/05, 5/16/05, and 8/8/05).
The PMT developed the project goals and reviewed all of the proposed alternatives for the project.
The PMT also outlined criteria that shaped the evaluation of alternative concepts for the
transportation system and OR 22 corridor through Idanha.
The PMT ultimately decided that the tradeoffs associated with significant improvements within the
OR 22 right-of-way (e.g., sidewalks, planter strips) were not worth pursuing at this time. The PMT
felt that the decreased access to property, and the property impacts required to ensure truck access
to commercial properties fronting OR 22 that would come along with access control, would be
better addressed in the future as property develops along the corridor. Economic development is
critical for the Idanha community at this time and the PMT was cautious about recommending
alterations to the roadway that were perceived to adversely affect business access and viability.

Public Meeting
A community-wide public Open House meeting was held on 9/19/05 from 4:00 ­ 7:00 p.m. at
Idanha City Hall. The Open House was advertised prior to the meeting by the City of Idanha. The
purpose of the public meeting was to present the Idanha Transportation Study and receive
feedback from the community. The meeting included information regarding project goals, existing
conditions, alternatives analysis, and study recommendations. The Open House materials included
several display boards and a rolling slide presentation. Comment forms were available for
collecting comments. There were ten attendees, including city staff, the project team, and city
councilmembers. The only comments received included concerns related to ensuring that the post
office access is preserved.

Project Goals
The Idanha Transportation Facility Plan Project Management Team agreed at their meeting on
1/31/05 that the Transportation Facility Plan should be consistent with the following goals:
Goals from the Idanha Downtown Master Plan
·    Create a unique image for downtown Idanha, possibly using a design theme.

·    Provide people-friendly amenities such as landscaping, streetlighting, tasteful signage, and
     attractive public spaces.

·    Improve traffic circulation conditions, especially access to OR 22 and bus service.
Project Goals
·    Develop solutions that include attractive gateways to the city and encourage a "sense of place."

·    Work to exceed safety standards for all modes of transportation (vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian).

·    Promote solutions that are compatible with attracting investment and interest in the
     community.

·    Develop a transportation plan that is compatible with the City's Comprehensive Plan.

·    Plan solutions that allow for flexibility in future development.

·    Coordinate with the Mid-Willamette Valley Council of Governments (MWVCOG) and regional
     planning efforts.

4. Existing Land Use & Transportation Inventory

Introduction
This section includes an inventory and description of existing transportation facilities and current
land uses. The examination of existing conditions was used to identify deficiencies and as a baseline
to develop proposed alternatives for transportation solutions in Idanha.
The transportation system inventory revealed no existing operational deficiencies and no specific
crash location issues. However, the inventory did point to access spacing deficiencies, deficient
shoulder widths along OR 22, lack of pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and lack of roadway edge
definition, especially at intersections.
The land use inventory revealed a large amount of vacant/developable land in Idanha in all land
use categories. Some land is not developed to full capacity because pending the development of a
public sewer system, land parcels must accommodate septic systems.

Transportation System Inventory
Data for the transportation system inventory is drawn from a site visit on December 17, 2004;
discussions with City of Idanha staff; Marion County and Linn County Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) information; the Idanha Comprehensive Plan (February 2002); ODOT State Highway
Inventory Reports; and ODOT Digital Video Log information.
The following transportation facility attributes are described:
·    Roadway facilities
·    Pedestrian facilities
·    Bicycle facilities
·    Transit facilities
Figure 2 shows transportation facility characteristics in the study area, including speed limit, stop
control and signals, shoulder widths, and lane widths.


Roadway Characteristics
Ownership

Functional Classification
Functional classification defines a street's role and context within the overall transportation system.
In addition, it defines the desirable roadway width, right-of-way needs, access spacing, and
appropriate type of pedestrian and bicycle facilities.

Arterials. Arterials are the highest classification of street and serve larger volumes of regional
traffic at greater speeds. Arterials serve as the major truck routes and emphasize regional mobility
over access.
OR 22 through Idanha is functionally classified by ODOT as a Rural Principal Arterial. OR 22 is
designated as both a State Freight Route and Scenic Byway. OR 22 is also part of the National
Highway System (NHS). OR 22, which is the only arterial located in Idanha, is the primary street
through the city and is the focus of commercial activity.
Collectors. Collector streets are an intermediate class of street that typically serve as the most direct
link between local roadways and the arterial system. According to the City of Idanha
Comprehensive Plan, the following Collector streets are located in the city of Idanha:

·    Main Street
·    Church Street1
·    Mountain Avenue
·    Blowout Road
Local Streets. Local streets carry lower volumes of traffic than collectors and arterials and provide
direct access to neighborhoods and homes. Local streets generally feed into collector streets. Access
is the most important role of local streets. According to the Idanha Comprehensive Plan, the
following Local streets are located in the city of Idanha:

·    Short (2nd ) Street
·    Riverside Drive2
·    River Road
·    1st Street
·    Evergreen Avenue
·    Douglas Street
·    Blossom Avenue
·    Mt. Jefferson Street

OR 22 Roadway Inventory
Travel Lanes
ODOT Highway Design Manual (HDM) standards applicable to OR 22 through Idanha call for a
width of traveled way of 24 feet.3 OR 22 consists of two travel lanes that are 12 feet wide
throughout the study area, and therefore meets standards for lane widths. Two 16-foot southbound
left turning lanes are present at the intersection of OR 22 and Blowout Road.

1 Church Street is identified as a Local Street in the Idanha Comprehensive Plan (February 2002), but according to City staff and City
Council, it should be classified as an Arterial.
2 Riverside Drive is identified as an Arterial in the Idanha Comprehensive Plan (February 2002), but according to City staff and City
Council, it should be classified as a Local Street ­ it is intended to serve as a public trail leading to a new park facility near the river in the
future.

Speed Limit
Speed limits on OR 22 through the Idanha study area range from 40 miles per hour (mph) in the
central area (the 40 mph zone extends from approximately 1,000 feet east of Church Street to
approximately 1,000 feet west of Main Street) to 55 mph outside of this area.

Intersections
The following public streets intersect with OR 22 in the study area: Blowout Road, Boulder Ridge
Road, Main Street, and Church Street. Each of these streets is stop-controlled at its intersection with
OR 22.

Traffic Control
There are no traffic signals on OR 22 in Idanha. In addition to the stop signs present at street
intersections, the following traffic control devices are located along OR 22 in the Idanha study area.

·    The two travel lanes of OR 22 are divided by a double-yellow line.
·    A blinking yellow caution light is present outside the fire engine garage downtown.
·    Left- and right-hand turning lanes are present at the intersection of OR 22 and Blowout Road.

Parking
Several areas adjacent to OR 22 are used as informal parking areas. These areas have trails leading
down to the North Santiam River and are generally used by anglers and other people wishing to

access the river. It is difficult in many locations, especially near the center of town, to differentiate
between the roadway shoulder and off-street parking areas.

City Roadway Characteristics
City roads within Idanha are all two-way unstriped streets, generally paved, and range in paved
width from approximately 8 feet to 12 feet (Main Street and Church Street). City streets are posted
at 25 mph. Vehicles park on the side/shoulder of the roadways. There are no existing pedestrian or
bicycle facilities along city streets.

Existing Traffic Operations - OR 22
This section describes the operational characteristics of OR 22 in the city of Idanha. It includes
discussions of the data collected, calculation of the 30th highest hour traffic volumes (which
approximate peak-hour traffic, per ODOT recommendations), and existing intersection operations
analysis results.

Collection of Traffic Volumes
Manual turning movement counts were collected for the following unsignalized intersections on
January 11, 2005:

·   OR 22 and Blowout Road: Counted for 2 hours from 4 PM to 6 PM. This intersection is
    unsignalized, with a stop sign on the approach from Blowout Road to OR 22. This intersection is
    located at the far western end of the city. It accesses OR 22 from the north and south. There are
    left turn lanes on OR 22 at this intersection.

·   OR 22 and Main Street: Counted for 16 hours from 5 AM to 9 PM. This intersection is
    unsignalized, with a stop sign on the approach from Main Street to OR 22. Main Street
    approaches from the south. Directly north of Main Street is a private driveway that leads
    directly to the post office. This access to the post office is undefined, and blends with accesses to
    other properties to the east and west. There are no turn lanes at this intersection.

·   OR 22 and Church Street: Counted for 2 hours from 4 PM to 6 PM. This intersection is
    unsignalized, with a stop sign on the approach from Church Street to OR 22. Church Street
    approaches from the south, and forms a "T" intersection with OR 22; there is no approach from
    the north. There are no turn lanes at this intersection.

Applicable Automatic Traffic Recorder Stations
A review of ODOT's permanent Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) stations was conducted to
determine seasonal variation patterns in traffic volumes along OR 22. There are no permanent
stations located within the study area, but one ATR station (Detroit, #24-015) is located one mile
west of the study area at milepost 51.30. This ATR station was approved by ODOT for usage for
this project. Attachment 1 includes a methodology memorandum that details assumptions and
methods for existing and future operations analysis.




IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                     9
Calculation of 30th Highest Hour Design Volumes
The peak-hour turning movement counts collected on January 11, 2005, were seasonally adjusted to
represent the 30th highest hour design volumes using data5 from the Detroit ATR station. The
seasonal adjustment factor was calculated to be 2.20. This is an ODOT required procedure to
achieve a consistent hour of analysis that accounts for traffic volumes collected at different times of
the year. Therefore, although the traffic counts were completed in the winter, the traffic volumes
are adjusted to account for summer volumes, based on comparisons to traffic near Detroit Lake on
OR 22. Traffic count data are provided in Attachment 2.
In addition to the seasonal factor adjustment, trips were added to the intersections along OR 22 to
account for the campground and recreational vehicle park entrance at Church Street, which is used
during the summer months. It was necessary to add these trips to the 30th highest hour traffic
volumes because the traffic counts were collected during a time when the park is not active. The
additional trips were determined by using the 2003 Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual, 7th Edition. Fifteen trips were added (10 in and 5 out) based on ITE Land Use
Code 416 for a Campground/RV Park of similar nature and size.
Next, the design volumes were adjusted along OR 22 to demonstrate a balanced system between
adjacent study intersections. These balanced 30th highest hour turning movement volumes were
input into the operational analysis.

Intersection Operational Analysis
A Synchro model was constructed for the study area based on existing roadway channelization,
field observations, and the balanced 30th highest hour design volumes. This model was used to
assess existing operations along the highway.
The Synchro model uses the methodology in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) to analyze
both signalized and stop-controlled intersections. The model also computes the volume-to-capacity
(V/C) ratio necessary to determine whether the intersection meets the applicable mobility standard
from the Oregon Highway Plan.

Performance Measures
The Oregon Highway Plan outlines specific performance measures to be maintained along ODOT
facilities as part of the mobility standards. These standards are aimed at maintaining mobility along
important roadway sections and vary according to functional classification, location, and role
within the National Highway System.
The following mobility standards are applicable for the study intersections:

·    OR 22, from milepost 52.56 to milepost 54.33 and 55.05 to 55.64: Volume-to-capacity ratio of
     0.70 given its categorization as a Statewide, National Highway System, Freight Route and Inside
     Urban Growth Boundary, Non-MPO (not within a metropolitan planning organization) outside
     of Special Transportation Areas (STAs), where non-freeway speed limit 45 mph.

·    OR 22, from milepost 54.33 to milepost 55.05: Volume-to-capacity ratio of 0.75 given its
     categorization as a Statewide, National Highway System, Freight Route and Inside Urban
     Growth Boundary, Non-MPO outside of STAs where non-freeway speed limit <45 mph.

5 The 2003 seasonal factor tables from the ODOT website were used.

IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                 10
·    Blowout Road, Main Street, and Church Street: Volume-to-capacity ratio of 0.85 given their
     categorization as District/Local Interest Roads and Inside Urban Growth Boundary, Non-MPO
     outside of STAs where non-freeway speed limit <45 mph.

Existing (2005) Operational Analysis
Existing (2005) V/C ratios were computed for all three study intersections based on the balanced
30th highest hour design volumes. Table 2 shows these results and compares them to the applicable
mobility standards. The intersection with the worst peak-hour result was Blowout Road, which was
still far within the accepted mobility standard. The results of the existing (2005) operational analysis
show that each intersection approach meets the applicable roadway mobility standard and operates
very well. All V/C ratios are below 0.20. Figure 3 shows existing traffic turning volumes and
operations analysis results.

Crash Analysis ­ OR 22
Crash History
Vehicle crash data for the section of OR 22 from milepost 52.56 to milepost 55.64 were analyzed for
the years 1999 to 2003, the most recent 5-year crash history available.6 The crash data were analyzed
to determine where, when, how, and how often collisions took place. The following discussion
includes the crash rates and any significant patterns that emerged from this analysis.
A total of six crashes reported for the 5-year period occurred along the study section of OR 22 and
all occurred in 1999 and 2000. Of the total, four crashes resulted in an injury and two resulted in
property damage only. No fatalities were reported.
Five of the six crashes occurred during dry, clear conditions in daylight and the sixth occurred in
cold, icy conditions in daylight. Table 3 shows the roadway conditions during the reported crashes.

The crash types along OR 22 in the past 5 years are evenly split between rear-end and fixed object
crashes. Most of the accidents reported were caused by "driving too fast for conditions." Drugs or
alcohol was the cause of one crash. Table 4 summarizes both the collision type and cause of the
crash.

The crash data were also used to investigate crashes by month, day-of-week, and time-of-day. Four
of the six crashes occurred in July. One crash occurred on each day of the week, except for
Wednesday. Four crashes occurred between the hours of 2:00 PM and 9:00 PM. These crashes
generally coincided with the highest amount of daily traffic, given that the peak-hour counts
showed 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM as the most traveled hour and July as the most traveled month.
Four of the six crashes occurred in a one-mile segment starting on the west city limits and three
were recorded at one location, milepost 52.70. These three crashes involved drivers in vehicles
traveling too fast for the conditions and two involved single vehicles leaving the roadway and
striking a tree, bush, or shrubs. The third crash at this location was a rear-end type collision. This
IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                   12
location is just east of a gentle curve, which likely contributes to the collision occurrences. It also
coincides with the western Idanha city limits, near Blowout Road.
Five crashes occurred on a straight section of roadway. One of the crashes occurred at the
intersection with Main Street. This crash occurred in January 2000 and was a rear-end type crash
involving two vehicles traveling eastbound on OR 22. The driver of the second vehicle was stopped
in traffic, not waiting to make a turn, when the driver of the first vehicle struck the second. The
driver of the first vehicle was recorded as following too closely.

Crash Rates
Crash rates, expressed in "crashes per million vehicle-miles traveled," are used to compare the
crash experience of one roadway segment to another. This rate expresses how many crashes might
be expected of vehicles traveling through a particular section of roadway for a cumulative total of
one million miles.
The study section of OR 22 was analyzed for the entire length of the study section based on
reported crashes between 1999 and 2003, as shown in Table 5.

    From Table IV of 2003 State Crash Rate Tables.


The study section of OR 22 is classified as a Rural Principal Arterial and Idanha is a Rural City.
ODOT has computed a statewide crash rate of 1.28 for principal arterials in rural cities. The overall
study section crash rate of 0.33/year is significantly less than the Rural City, statewide crash rate.

Safety Prioritization Index System (SPIS)
In addition to crash rates, ODOT also assesses roadway safety via the Safety Prioritization Index
System (SPIS). Data for the SPIS system are generated annually, based on the most recently
available 3 years of crash data, and are used to identify hazardous locations along state highways.
They can be used to calculate a relative score that takes into account crash frequency, crash rate,
and crash severity. SPIS scores are computed for tenth-of-a-mile sections. The scores for different
roadway segments can be compared to determine where safety improvement funds might best be
spent. Typically, ODOT places the highest priority locations where SPIS scores fall within the top 10
percent in the entire state.
There were no sites within the study section that appeared in the top 10 percent of the SPIS scoring
between 2001 and 2003.

The safety analysis shows that there was a speeding problem at milepost 52.70 in 1999 and 2000, but
evidence that the problem continued is absent, perhaps due to additional signage that has been
added.

Speeding
Many vehicles observed during the field visit appeared to be exceeding the speed limit in the city
center area. According to Police Chief Gary Will (City of Turner), who participated in enforcement
efforts in Idanha with the Marion County Interagency Traffic Team during summer 2005, 21
speeding citations were issued in 7 hours over the July 4th weekend between the post office and
country store. One of those cited was an Idanha resident. According to Chief Will, approximately 50
percent of drivers were driving at least 5-10 mph over the speed limit. The highest speed recorded
was 25 miles over the speed limit, and the lowest speed recorded and given citation was 16 miles
over the speed limit. The reasons most commonly given Chief Will by speeders included: (1)
drivers did not know they were in a city, and (2) there were no speed limit signs. Chief Will noted
that speeding is a problem statewide in areas without dedicated police forces.

Safety ­ Additional Field Observations and Local Information
The following field observations and local information are related to safety on OR 22 through
Idanha:

·    Sight distance is poor for motorists turning eastbound onto OR 22 from Church Street. In
     general, sight conditions in the vicinity of the intersection of OR 22 and Church Street are poor.
     This is due to a curve and the proximity of the roadway to the Santiam River. Residents feel
     there is poor sight distance along OR 22 near the east end of the city.

·    Recent and faded truck tire marks were observed in the open shoulder area near the city center,
     indicating that vehicles have swerved across the shoulder area of the highway.

·    According to City of Idanha staff, vehicles tend to pass on the right in both directions near the
     city center, but especially in the westbound lane where a large swath of uncontrolled access
     pavement exists.

·    According to City of Idanha staff, crossing OR 22 is dangerous at OR 22 and Main Street.
     Children wait for school buses at the southeast corner of this intersection and often need to
     cross the highway.

Access Conditions ­ OR 22
Attachment 3 catalogues all public and private access points along OR 22 in the city of Idanha, and
also lists all existing approach permits, per ODOT records. Access points include local street
approaches, forest road approaches, commercial and residential driveway approaches, and other
points where there are at-grade vehicular accesses to OR 22. Access point locations along OR 22 in
the study area are shown in Figure 4. In general, there is very little access control in place in the
study area. Accesses do not meet ODOT access spacing standards. There is a 900-foot-wide access
to the highway in the middle of the city. Despite the substandard access control, however, the crash
analysis does not suggest safety issues within the city, and the operations analysis does not identify
operational issues. Operational and safety conditions should be monitored to determine if
congestion or the number of crash incidents worsens.
Access management involves planning the location, design, and operation of driveways, medians
and intersections for the purpose of providing access to land, while simultaneously preserving the
safety and efficiency of a roadway for its users. The concept of access management concentrates on

restricting the number of direct accesses to major surface streets, providing reasonable indirect
access, effectively designing driveways, and enforcing safe and efficient spacing and location of
driveways.
A variety of techniques are available for achieving access control. They include geometric design
considerations (such as medians and channelized islands that prohibit certain turning movements);
consolidation actions (such as joint use of driveways and service roads); and other actions such as
removal and relocation of existing access and the introduction of auxiliary lanes for left and right
turns. Attachment 4 includes a presentation regarding access management and its effect on the
roadway system.

Existing Accesses
There are approximately 61 approaches to OR 22 within Idanha city limits. Of this number:

·    23 are commercial/industrial driveways

·    19 are residential driveways

·    8 are vehicle pullouts (including informal parking areas)

·    5 are public roads

·    3 are Forest Service roads

·    The remaining approaches include a single large swath of uncontrolled highway access in the
     center of the city (which includes City Hall, the Idanha Post Office, a grocery store, a residence,
     and a commercial establishment) and other approaches whose purpose was not identifiable.

Access Spacing Deficiencies
Access management treatments are concerned with preserving adequate mobility and ensuring
adequate safety. The two concerns are directly connected. For example, a series of closely spaced
driveways onto a highway may result in delays for motorists (a mobility problem) due to the
multiple points of merging traffic. At the same time, the likelihood of an accident increases under
these conditions (a safety problem). Access management treatments can often address both
concerns simultaneously. Along OR 22 in the Idanha study area, a combination of insufficient
spacing between existing approaches and a lack of highway access control in the city center area
contributes to a "free-for-all" environment.

Spacing Standards
1999 Oregon Highway Plan (OHP) Criteria
OR 22 in Idanha is functionally classified by ODOT as a Rural Principal Arterial of Statewide
Significance. OR 22 is designated as both a State Freight Route and Scenic Byway and is part of the
National Highway System (NHS). OR 22 is the only arterial located in Idanha and is the focus of
commercial activity.
Division 51 (OAR 734-051-0010 through 734-051-0560) specifies access management spacing
standards for ODOT facilities. The standards are based on the functional classification of the
highway, the general type of land use (i.e., rural, urban), and the posted speed. Spacing standards
relevant to OR 22 inside the city limits of Idanha, where speeds range from 40-55 mph, are shown
in Table 6.

Figure 5 shows access spacing deficiencies within Idanha. Table 7 lists the approaches to OR 22
inside the city limits of Idanha that have substandard access spacing. (For this table, if a space
between two approaches is substandard, both approaches involved are identified as not meeting
the standard.)

*Access milepoint number represents approximate center point of access approach.



In addition to deficient spacing between approaches, access deficiencies also arise when the
driveway or intersection approaches themselves are too wide. In Idanha, an approximately 900-
foot-wide approach to the highway exists along the westbound lane of OR 22 in the city center. The
lack of highway access control in this area creates a situation where vehicles can turn off and pull
onto the highway anywhere within this 900-foot segment. The resulting conditions include:

·     Driver uncertainty ­ without delineated driveways, motorists do not have clear directional cues
      in regard to accessing particular properties.

·     Potential pedestrian/bicycle conflicts ­ pedestrians and bicyclists have no physical buffer to
      protect them from vehicles entering and exiting the highway.




IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                  18
Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
There are few designated pedestrian and bicycle facilities in Idanha. Pedestrian and bicycle issues
include a lack of controlled vehicle access points along OR 22, which can lead to conflicts with
pedestrians and bicyclists as noted above; shoulder width deficiencies; and issues related to
crossing OR 22.

Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities that are accessible and comfortable to use are an essential component of the
transportation system. Pedestrian safety and connectivity is particularly relevant to Idanha. As the
1995 Oregon Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan (OBPP) explains, virtually everyone is a pedestrian at some
point during the day, and therefore almost everyone benefits from accessible facilities. Pedestrians
include children walking to and from school, people using wheelchairs or other forms of mobility
assistance, people walking to lunch, and people walking to and from their vehicles. In addition,
walking meets the commuting, recreational, and social transportation needs for a portion of the
population that do not or choose not to drive. A community's pedestrian system also offers
recreational opportunities for both local and out-of-town users, potentially stimulating economic
growth and tourism.
According to the OBPP, pedestrian facilities are any facilities used by a pedestrian. These types of
facilities include walkways, traffic signals, crosswalks, curb ramps, and other amenities such as
illumination or benches.
There are presently no formal bicycle or pedestrian facilities in the city of Idanha. This is potentially
most problematic in the city center area on OR 22, the focal point of potential pedestrian and bicycle
trips. City center amenities are located on the north side of the highway, whereas Idanha's
residential areas are located south of the highway.

·    Sidewalks/curbs: Sidewalks are located along roadways, are separated from the roadway with a
     curb and/or planting strip, and have a hard, smooth surface, such as concrete. ODOT standard
     sidewalk width is 6 feet along major roadways. Currently there are no sidewalk or curb
     facilities adjacent to OR 22 or along any of the other streets in the Idanha study area.

·    Shared use paths: Shared use paths are used by a variety of non-motorized users, including
     pedestrians, cyclists, skaters, and runners. Shared use paths may be paved or unpaved, and are
     often wider than the average sidewalk (i.e., 10 to 12 feet). Currently there are no shared use
     paths in Idanha. However, the proposed Lyons-Idanha Trail, a shared use facility, is planned to
     be built in the existing greenway south of OR 22 between the highway and the North Santiam
     River.

·    Roadway shoulders: Roadway shoulders serve as pedestrian routes in many rural Oregon
     communities. On roadways with low traffic volumes (i.e., less than 3,000 vehicles per day),
     roadway shoulders are often adequate for pedestrian travel.7 These roadways should have
     shoulders wide enough so that both pedestrians and bicyclists can use them, usually 6 feet or
     greater. Pedestrians seeking to access the downtown core in Idanha currently rely on roadway
     shoulders to accommodate their travel. Both eastbound and westbound shoulders of OR 22
     through Idanha are paved, but vary in width through the study area. In general, foglines have
     faded significantly. The segment of OR 22 including the downtown of Idanha (approximately

7 Average Daily Traffic (ADT) along OR 22 through Idanha was recorded at approximately 3,400 between 1998-2002. (Source: ODOT
Crash Analysis Unit)

IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                                       19
     MP 54.28 to 54.80) has 4-foot shoulders on the north and south sides of the highway, with a
     short segment of 6-foot shoulders on the north side.

·    Crosswalks: There are currently no pedestrian crosswalks in Idanha. There used to be a painted
     crosswalk across OR 22, but it was removed per ODOT policy related to pedestrian safety on
     state highways.

·    Traffic control: OR 22 through Idanha is not stop-controlled and is unsignalized. Currently,
     there are no pedestrian/bicycle traffic control measures in place along OR 22. Public approach
     roadways to OR 22 have stop signs.

·    Informal paths: There are several informal paths located on undeveloped land parallel to OR 22
     in Idanha. Examples of this can be seen alongside eastbound OR 22 just west of Main Street and
     just east of Church Street.

Bicycle Facilities
Bicycles are allowed on all of the roadways in Idanha and the surrounding areas. According to
AASHTO's Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities (1999) and the Oregon Bicycle and Pedestrian
Plan (1995), there are several different types of bicycle facilities. Bicycle facilities are an indicator of
a community's health and attractiveness to residents and visitors, in particular the young and
elderly. Bikeways, such as striped bicycle lanes or signed bikeways, are distinguished as
preferential roadways that have facilities to accommodate bicycles. Shared use paths are facilities
separated from a roadway for use by cyclists, pedestrians, skaters, runners, or others. Shared use
paths were discussed previously in the overview of pedestrian facilities located in the city of
Idanha.
Currently, there are no dedicated (striped) bicycle lanes or signed bikeways in the study area.
The following bicycle facilities are found in Idanha:

·    Shoulder bikeway: Shoulder bikeways are paved roadways that have striped shoulders wide
     enough for bicycle travel. ODOT recommends a 6-foot paved shoulder to adequately provide
     for bicyclists; 4-foot minimum in constrained areas. Roadways with shoulders narrower than 4
     feet are considered shared roadways. Sometimes shoulder bikeways are signed to alert
     motorists to expect bicycle travel along the roadway. As mentioned previously, OR 22 has
     paved shoulders of varying width in the city of Idanha. Consequently, in terms of their
     functionality for bicyclists, some sections of the highway would be considered "shoulder
     bikeway" and others "shared roadway." Many of the paved shoulders along OR 22 are covered
     with gravel from adjacent parking areas and pullouts, detracting from their suitability and
     safety for bicycling.

·    Bicycle parking facilities encourage cyclists to stop at destinations such as businesses and
     public facilities. Secure, well-designed bicycle parking helps prevent theft. Currently, bicycle
     parking is provided outside the grocery store in Idanha.

Pedestrian and Bicyclist Destinations
Major pedestrian and bicycle destinations located in Idanha are as follows:

·     City Hall--Located along OR 22, the Idanha City Hall building provides all city administrative
      services and also contains a city library. There is a rough concrete pathway traversing the front
      of City Hall property.

IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                      20
·    School bus stop--Idanha is part of the Santiam Canyon School District (K-12). Students catch
     school buses at the southeast corner of OR 22 and Main Street. There is a bus shelter at this
     location but there are no pedestrian or bicycle facilities at or to this location.
·    Parks--Idanha City Park is located east of Church Street, on the south side of the river. The
     park does not have any pedestrian or bicycle facilities fronting its property.
·    Shopping--The grocery store in Idanha, located along OR 22, does not have any pedestrian or
     bicycle facilities connecting to its property. The store has a bicycle rack that can accommodate
     approximately 4 or 5 bicycles.

Transit Facilities
Chemeketa Area Regional Transportation System (CARTS)
The CARTS program is a partnership between Marion, Polk, and Yamhill counties. CARTS operates
a regional point-deviated, fixed-route service in south Marion County called the "Canyon
Connect". CARTS does not currently provide service to Idanha. The closest Canyon Connect bus
route stop is at the Gates Park and Ride, roughly 22 miles to the west. CARTS services to rural
Marion County are carried out by Wheels Community Transportation.

Cherriots
The Salem Area Mass Transit District (Cherriots) does not currently provide service to Idanha. The
closest transit stop to Idanha is bus route #6, which stops at Lancaster and Carson in southeast
Salem. Cherriots connects with CARTS/Wheels Community Transit to provide rider flexibility.

Dial-A-Ride Services
Wheels Community Transportation provides dial-a-ride services to all Marion County residents,
including Idanha. Service is available to those individuals in need of transportation for medical
appointments, employment, education purposes, and nutritional shopping. In addition, service is
provided for persons receiving medical assistance in Portland.
Wheels of Joy provides dial-a-ride services to North Santiam area residents, including Idanha,
requiring special assistance transportation to and from medical facilities throughout the region.

Rail Facilities
There are no passenger or freight rail facilities located within the city of Idanha.

City-Identified Transportation System Issues
There are several transportation issues that the City has identified, as listed below.

·    Speeding on OR 22: the City and law enforcement officials (Marion County Interagency Traffic
     Team) have noted that motorists frequently exceed the posted speed limit through the city
     center of Idanha, where the current posted speed is 40 miles per hour. The painting of double-
     yellow center lines has helped some, but speeding remains an issue of concern.

·    Lack of pedestrian and bicycle facilities on OR 22: conditions are unsafe for pedestrians and
     bicyclists traveling from the south side of OR 22 to use services located on the north side of the
     highway in the city center.



IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                  21
·    Poor sight distance on OR 22 at Church Street: the City has noted that poor sight distance
     conditions exist (possibly resulting from a combination of horizontal and vertical grade
     curvature).
·    Highway motorists using shoulders to pass other vehicles: City officials have reported that
     motorists, including large trucks, pass other vehicles on the right on the OR 22 segment through
     the city. This situation is a safety concern for pedestrians using city center services, in particular
     for children waiting for school buses.

Field-Team-Identified Transportation System Issues
Additional general transportation system issues identified during a field visit to Idanha include:

·    Inadequate spacing between highway access approaches;
·    Lack of access control in city center; and
·    Inadequate shoulder widths along segments of OR 22.

Land Use Inventory
The study area covers the heart of the city and includes most lands that abut OR 22. It includes
roughly half of the total acreage in the city. The land use inventory relied on information contained
in the City's Comprehensive Plan (February 2002) and in the City's Development Code, as well as
information from the Marion and Linn county GIS databases.

Existing Land Uses
General existing land uses in Idanha are depicted in Figure 6. Land use districts in the city of
Idanha are as follows:
·    Commercial (C)
·    Commercial-Recreation (C-R)
·    Industrial (I)
·    Light Industrial (LI)
·    Public (P)
·    Residential (R)
·    Restricted Development Overlay (RD)
The City's Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) was established in 1978 and modified in 1993. The land
supply within the Idanha UGB is estimated at 406 acres (including right-of-way and water bodies).
Table 8 summarizes the land supply in Idanha by general land use category; some of the
comprehensive plan categories have been combined for simplicity.

Residential Land Uses
The Comprehensive Plan map designates approximately 200 acres of land as residential, which
includes the Residential (R) zoning designation. Most residential land is outside the study area on
the south side of the Santiam River. Residential land in the study is located south of OR 22 toward
the west end of town clustered along Main Street. A portion of the R-zoned land west of Main
Street has a Restricted-Development (R-D) overlay because there are steep slopes and a flood
hazard that is within roughly 50 feet of the high water line of the North Santiam River. There are a
few R-zoned parcels located north of OR 22 across from Main Street.

      * Includes a 16-acre site that has received approval for the construction of an RV park (T10-R6e-17B T.L.
      1000).


The Residential (R) zoning district allows single family dwellings (including manufactured homes)
and duplexes outright, as well as a broad range of residential-related uses, such as home
businesses, day care, public utilities, and parks. "Transitional" uses, which include churches and
community buildings, are permitted outright when they abut an industrial or commercial property.
Conditional uses include churches, multi-family dwellings, and golf courses, among others.

Commercial Land Uses
Approximately 151 acres of land in Idanha are zoned either Commercial (C) or Commercial
Recreation (CR). The Comprehensive Plan estimates that 85 acres of Commercial land are
developed and 66 acres are vacant, although many "developed" parcels in reality are not developed
entirely to capacity because of the need for on-site septic drainfields. It is unclear from the
Comprehensive Plan whether or not these acreage figures include the Commercial-Recreational
(CR) zoning designation. The CR-zoned land extends from Boulder Creek to the west end of town
along OR 22 and is outside the study area. Most of the C-zoned land is inside the study area.
The CR zone is intended for tourism-oriented uses such as bed and breakfasts, marinas, and
souvenir/gift shops. The C-zoned land is found on both sides of OR 22 starting near its intersection
with Main Street. Both districts have specific development and design standards related to building
orientation, siding materials, and other architectural and siting details. In general the C zone allows
a broader range of retail and office commercial land uses than the CR zone.

Industrial Land Uses
According to the 2002 Idanha Comprehensive Plan, eight of the 35 total Industrial-zoned acres in
Idanha are developed, leaving 27 acres of I-zoned land vacant. Similar to the existing commercial
land use section, it is not clear in the Comprehensive Plan whether this includes acres in the
Industrial (I) as well as the Light Industrial (LI) zone. The Comprehensive Plan includes no specific
information about LI-zoned land.
The majority of the industrial land is located on the east side of Idanha and is in the study area.
Large parcels of I-zoned property abut the north side of OR 22 from near Church Street east to the
city limits. Most of the LI-zoned property is on the opposite side of OR 22, between the road and

IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                                     23
the north bank of the Santiam River. A single parcel of LI-zoned land is located outside the study
are near the west end of Idanha. The I zone allows heavy manufacturing and wood products
facilities. The LI zone allows a more limited set of industrial and commercial uses.

Public Land Uses
Idanha has one Public (P) zoning district, which includes approximately 2 acres of land in the study
area. The P-zoned parcels are located in the southeast part of the city near the residential area
adjacent to the Santiam River. Allowed uses in the P zone include publicly-owned buildings and
facilities, public outdoor recreation facilities, public utility structures and buildings, schools,
hospitals, and civic organizational facilities.

5. Future Transportation and Land Use Conditions

Introduction
Along with examination of existing transportation and land use conditions, it is important that
planning efforts take into account future population, employment, and traffic forecasts. This results
in efficient spending of public dollars; if transportation improvements account for the future, they
are not likely to face the immediate need to be rebuilt. The analysis of future traffic operations for
the Idanha area showed that there are no expected operational deficiencies during the peak hour at
least until 2030, based on the Idanha Comprehensive Plan and ODOT-approved traffic growth
projections. The buildable land analysis showed that there is sufficient land within the City's urban
growth boundary to accommodate estimated land use needs for the next 20 years.
Attachment 5 includes an analysis of the potential for siting a left turn lane at the Main Street/
OR 22 intersection. Although this location does not currently meet Highway Design Manual criteria
for siting a left turn lane, this could change in the future if access spacing is implemented or if
development occurs near the intersection (e.g., the vacant parcel to the southeast). The City of
Idanha should monitor these conditions for triggering re-evaluation of a left turn lane at this
location, and should require new development near this intersection to submit a traffic impact
analysis.

Future Traffic Operations Conditions ­ OR 22
Future operational analysis was conducted to determine if the Idanha area can expect traffic
operations in year 2025 to require roadway improvements. The analysis was completed assuming
that no operational roadway improvements on OR 22 would be made between 2005 and 2025 ("no-
build"). No future operational deficiencies were found at the study area intersections.

Future (2025) No-Build Operational Analysis
Future (2025) no-build V/C ratios were computed for all three study intersections (OR 22/Blowout
Road, OR 22/Main Street, OR 22/Church Street) based on projected 30th highest hour design
volumes. Future volume tables provided by ODOT were used to determine the expected
background traffic growth rate of 2.0 percent per year, which was approved by ODOT. The future
traffic volumes are consistent with the expected employment and population growth as identified
in the Idanha Comprehensive Plan (2002). This growth rate was applied for 20 years to the balanced
2005 30th highest hour design volumes to obtain the 2025 projected design volumes, as shown in
Figure 7.
Table 9 shows these results and compares them to the applicable roadway mobility standards. The
results of the Future (2025) no-build operational analysis show that each intersection approach
meets the applicable mobility standard and continues to operate well. Therefore, there are no
operational improvements required as part of the alternative development process of this project.

Future Land Use Conditions
Future land use conditions in Idanha are based on the land use inventory described in the previous
section, which is based on information contained in the City's Comprehensive Plan (February 2002)
and in the City's Development Code, as well as information from the Marion and Linn county GIS
databases.
The description of future land use conditions focuses on the following issues in the Idanha study
area:

·    Proposed land uses
·    Buildable lands estimate
·    Population and employment forecasts for Idanha
·    Industrial, commercial, and residential lands needs

Proposed Land Uses
According to the Comprehensive Plan, attracting tourism to Idanha depends on developing visitor
services and facilities. The Commercial-Recreation and Light Industrial land use zones were added
to the Comprehensive Plan land use map in 1997 for this purpose.
The City developed a Downtown Master Plan in 1998 that focused on an 88-acre area along OR 22
between Boulder Creek and Church Street. This plan has never been formally adopted, and though
portions of it are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan long-range concept for the city, there are
elements of the Downtown Master Plan that are not supported by the City (e.g., closing off Main
Street from OR 22).
The vision for the Downtown Master Plan includes "...architectural features that complement the
natural landscape...and a healthy balance between a wide diversity of activities and land uses." In
terms of land use, one of the goals for the downtown is to "...develop as a multi-purpose center by
permitting a diversity of uses...that will serve the needs of local residents, visitors and
recreationists."
The Downtown Master Plan recommends that the city create an attractive place for OR 22 traffic to
stop and shop, while providing services for local residents, allowing a mix of commercial,
industrial, and residential development (the latter two with categories limitations). It should be
noted that the City has requested that all planning improvements for the Idanha Transportation


IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                         26
Study be done in accordance with their Comprehensive Plan, rather than with the
recommendations of the Downtown Master Plan.

Buildable Lands
The buildable lands inventory (BLI) and analysis was summarized from the 2002 Idanha
Comprehensive Plan for the area within Idanha city limits. The BLI determines whether there is
sufficient land in the city's UGB to accommodate estimated housing needs for 20 years. A land
needs assessment is included in the next section. According to the City, certain factors limit the
availability of developable lands within the UGB. These include reliance on septic systems for
wastewater treatment/lack of a sewer system, steep slopes which limit septic approval, flood
hazards, wetlands, and riparian corridors. Table 10 shows the gross vacant acres by general land
use category.

 Note: The actual land use map includes more specific land
 use designations.
 * An additional 16-acres are committed to an RV park.



Population and Employment Forecasts
The Oregon Blue Book lists the 2002 population of Idanha as 232. In 1996, the City Council adopted
the population projections as shown in Table 11, which reflect an overall 0.75 percent increase
between 1995 and 2015. The population forecast for 2015 is 337 persons, based on a 1994 population
forecast prepared by Portland State University. This figure has been accepted by Marion County for
their growth management forecasts. According to the Idanha Comprehensive Plan, population growth
is linked to available employment opportunities. Timber has historically been the backbone of
Idanha's economy. Since the 1980s, the closure of remaining local mills has led to declining
population.
The City has projected for three different population categories, "full-time", "part-time" and
"visitors," which make up "total" population. A 2.0 percent growth rate was used to ascertain the
"part-time" and "visitors" population, based on a projected population growth rate for the 1996
Upper North Santiam Canyon Regional Sewer System Feasibility Study. The rationale for this was
that the North Santiam Canyon region is attempting to increase tourism, which would lead to a
larger overall seasonal population and greater demand on any proposed sewer system. The City's
Comprehensive Plan allows for this with land along the river designated for "Commercial
Recreation" uses.

Industrial, Commercial, and Residential Land Needs
The future land needs assessment for industrial, commercial, and residential uses is based upon
trends and projections for population growth, economic development, and the calculation of
acreage of land needed to support that population. The 2002 Idanha Comprehensive Plan includes
"Land Needs Assessments" for these land use categories.

Industrial Land Needs
A modest level of growth in the industrial sector is projected for Idanha. Given that the availability
of utility infrastructure and transportation facilities is limited in Idanha, the Comprehensive Plan
envisions small tracts of industrial land for small manufacturing and production facilities that are
compatible with these systems. The following Industrial lands needs assessment is based on the
City's 2015 "full-time" projected population of 337 persons. As shown in the following table, the
projected need for industrial land to meet the needs of the projected growth in permanent
population is less than 2 acres.

The Comprehensive Plan was updated in 1997 to include a Light Industrial zoning district to allow
for less intense industrial operations that can be conducted within enclosed spaces. Uses in this
zone are subject to strict design standards that would be compatible with adjacent commercial and
residential areas.

There are 66 acres of Commercial land available in Idanha. The commercial land needs assessment
reveals that at this time, the City does not need any more Commercial zoned land. In 1997, the City
added a Commercial-Recreation zone that consists of acreage on the west side of town along the
Santiam River. The purpose of this zone is to allow a broader range of tourism-oriented uses with
corresponding design standards to permit more commercial and recreation development.

Residential Land Needs
Approximately 200 acres within the Urban Growth Boundary are designated Residential on the
Idanha Comprehensive Plan map. It is estimated that 40 acres are developed. The remaining 160
acres are vacant. The City's Residential designation permits both single-family and multi-family
residential development. The amount of land indicated on Table 15 that is available for
development is based upon the 1996 Comprehensive Plan designations. According to the table, the
City has a surplus of 104 acres of Residential land for both single-family and multi-family
residential development. The existing supply of Residential land within the Urban Growth
Boundary is sufficient to accommodate the projected number of housing units for 2015.

6 Analysis of Options

Framework for Options Analysis
The analysis of options or concepts for the Idanha Transportation Study was a collaborative,
iterative process that involved extensive input from PMT members. Concepts were developed
based on deficiencies revealed in the analysis of existing and future transportation conditions, and
refined through PMT evaluation and discussion.

Transportation Issues
Based on examination of existing and future transportation conditions, field visits, and discussions
with the PMT, the following primary transportation issues were identified in Idanha:

·    Speeding on OR 22

·    Lack of pedestrian and bicycle facilities, particularly along OR 22

·    Lack of roadway edge definition

·    Lack of roadway design or treatments indicating a "sense of place"

·    Perception of unsafe pedestrian and bicyclist conditions along OR 22, including crossing OR 22,
     especially near Main Street

·    Children accessing and waiting at the bus shelter near Main Street/OR 22

·    Lack of defined access points through the middle of town and inadequate access spacing

·    Lack of internal roadway circulation network south of OR 22

·    Inadequate shoulder widths on OR 22

·    Sight distance discomfort at OR 22/Church Street
It is worth noting that examination of existing and future (no-build) transportation conditions
revealed no significant crash or traffic operations issues.

Local Values and Concept Development
The analysis of options primarily focused on the central portion of Idanha, along the OR 22 corridor
between the western edge of the vacant parcel located southwest of the Main Street/OR 22
intersection and the Church Street/OR 22 intersection. This portion of the OR 22 corridor is notable
for its lack of access control. Because it is the focal point of town--it includes City Hall, the post
office, and the general store--it is the location with the most pedestrian traffic. It is most logical to
concentrate on this portion of town first, because of its importance to the community and because
many of the transportation issues were noted within this area.
Based on the identified issues, the analysis of transportation options began with a focus on
discouraging speeding and improving the pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the center of town,
including implementing access management. Any formal pedestrian facility along OR 22 (such as a
IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                  31
sidewalk) would require access control due to basic design principles (a pedestrian facility cannot
function if it is allowing free access), and any significant improvement within ODOT right-of-way
would need to work toward meeting accepted ODOT standards for access spacing and control.
As the study continued, the PMT focused on options and concepts for facilities that would improve
pedestrian and bicycle safety without affecting access, as well as roadway and transportation
elements that would reflect a sense of community character for Idanha (e.g., gateways) to
communicate a sense of place. These improvements would also discourage speeding.
The PMT discussed concepts in terms of the project goals set at the beginning of the project.
However, it soon became apparent that in addition to the community values expressed through the
project goals, other parameters were also important for Idanha.
Primary concerns for the community as expressed through the PMT, especially with regard to the
transportation system, included (1) a perception of safety issues ­ specifically, speeding and
pedestrian safety along OR 22; and (2) a lack of streetscape or roadway treatments that
communicated a "sense of place" for Idanha.
Community goals related to the evaluation of alternatives included a strong desire to maintain
economic development opportunities, especially in the central portion of the city. The benefits of
enhancing the OR 22 corridor (for example, adding sidewalks) were not deemed worth the cost of
the changed access to businesses or frontage property, since these changes were believed to have
adverse impacts on economic vitality and development.
Other issues included the strong desire to maintain OR 22 access at Main Street and at Church
Street, a need for OR 22 frontage properties to accommodate WB-67 trucks (semi trucks with 53-foot
box trailers), and the need to accommodate snow removal and other impacts of snowfall.

Concept Development
ODOT Access Spacing Standards
Development of concepts for the OR 22 corridor began with a review of ODOT recommended
access spacing standards. Figures 8 and 9 show how accesses would need to be configured to meet
ODOT access spacing standards, given the retention of Main Street and Church Street as access
points. As shown, per strict ODOT standards, all accesses would need to be closed between Main
Street and Church Street. This would mean that all properties would need to be accessed via
frontage roads or linked property connections. The figures also show how a roadway section could
look given this type of access configuration.
The PMT believed that strict adherence to the ODOT spacing standards was impractical for the
community, given that the accesses to some of the primary economy generators in Idanha are
located within this segment, including the Torman Company on the south side of OR 22 and the
general store located north of OR 22. Later on, conceptual drawings were made that examined how
WB-67 trucks would access existing land uses along OR 22 given access only at Main Street and
Church Street. The truck wheel paths showed that all of the properties located between Main Street
and the existing grocery store would have to be used as a truck turn-around area, which appeared
to be an unreasonable solution. Therefore, the next iteration of concepts examined the possibility of
seeking deviations to ODOT spacing standards.

Potential Access Control Locations
The next iteration of concept development was predicated on a good faith effort to work toward
meeting ODOT access spacing standards. Again, access configuration assumed the retention of
Main Street and Church Street as access points. Figure 10 shows this revised access control
configuration. Deviations were shown located east of Main Street (entrances to Torman Company
on the south and grocery store on the north) and located west of Main Street (entrances to City Hall
on the north and vacant parcel on the south). The figure also shows how a roadway section could
be designed given this type of access configuration.
The proposed access configuration and roadway section were then examined with regard to how
vehicles would physically access the properties and resultant property impacts.

Potential Access Concepts
The next iterations of concept development were based on the access spacing and roadway section
discussed previously under Potential Access Control Locations. Access configuration assumed the
retention of Main Street and Church Street as access points. Specific attention was given to how
WB-67 trucks could access existing properties from the proposed access points, given existing
building locations and property lines. Accesses that can accommodate WB-67 trucks can
accommodate virtually any other type of vehicle because the wheelbase path is so wide. The
grocery store and Torman Company are serviced by WB-67 trucks, and the PMT believed it was
important for the properties fronting OR 22 to retain direct serviceability by these vehicles.
The resultant concepts explored truck access options at the different access locations between Main
Street and Church Street. Figures 11-13 show different options for truck access and circulation at the
proposed access points. The figures show rough sketches of right-of-way, building locations, and
truck wheel paths to demonstrate land impacts.
Figure 11 shows circulation north of OR 22 to access the existing grocery store. In this concept,
trucks turn into the grocery store driveway, drive behind the store, travel along a shared property
connection, and exit at Main Street. The concept shows distinct property impacts to the east and
west of the grocery store. The intersection at Main Street is modified so that vehicles would square
up with OR 22 for a safe turn. Advantages of this concept are that it would allow for parking on the
east side of the store building or allow for a public parking lot. Primary disadvantages include land
impacts to several parcels, which could preclude future development; a need for hillside retention
behind the store to allow for truck access; potential impacts to the existing septic system; and the
mixing of cars and trucks through a shared access across private property.
Figure 12 also shows circulation north of OR 22 to access the existing grocery store. In this concept,
trucks turn into the grocery store driveway, but the land to the east of the store has been acquired
for a truck turn-around area/parking lot. The concept directly impacts those parcels to the east of
the store, but does not affect any parcels to the west of the store. Advantages of this concept are that
it uses a conventional layout and consolidates truck maneuvers; trucks enter and exit the access
with good sight distance; and trucks are kept off a shared property access. Primary disadvantages
include land impacts; potential conflicts with other vehicles using a shared private property
connection; and issues with truck delivery once other properties along OR 22 develop.
Figure 13 shows circulation south of OR 22 to access Torman Company (industrial land uses). In
this concept, trucks turn south to access the site and, potentially, would use a gated access located
further east if necessary. Smaller vehicles accessing the commercial land between Main Street and

maneuver. Advantages of this concept are consolidated truck entrance and exit. Primary
disadvantages include potential conflicts with vehicles accessing commercial land.

Conclusions
After reviewing the concepts, the PMT concluded that at this time, a "do nothing" alternative was
preferable to OR 22 right-of-way improvements and resultant access control. The primary concern
was potential adverse impacts to the economic health of the community.
Although currently the access control characteristics in Idanha do not appear to be affecting safety
and operations, as Idanha develops, access control should be addressed to ensure functionality and
safety of the roadway for residents, visitors, and the traveling public. At some time in the future,
the installation of curbs and sidewalks and the associated access control would be an effective way
to address the goals of better defining the roadway, creating designated bicycle and pedestrian
space, and creating a sense of place, therefore mitigating speeding issues.
The recommendations discussed in detail below include Phase 1, which focuses on near-term
pedestrian improvements, and Phase 2, which focuses on longer-term transportation strategies as
property in Idanha develops. Some of the concepts explored during this study should be revisited
in the future.

Issues and Assets
Transportation Issues
The primary transportation issues in Idanha include:

·    Lack of roadway design or treatments indicating a "sense of place," which contributes to
     speeding on OR 22

·    Lack of pedestrian and bicycle facilities, particularly along OR 22

·    Speeding on OR 22

·    Inadequate shoulder widths on OR 22

·    Lack of roadway edge definition, which contributes to speeding and passing on the right on OR
     22

·    Perception of unsafe pedestrian and bicyclist conditions along OR 22, including crossing OR 22,
     especially near Main Street

·    Children accessing and waiting at the bus shelter near Main Street

·    Lack of defined access points through the middle of town and inadequate access spacing, which
     contributes to multiple, unpredictable turning movements, which may in the future be an issue
     regarding safety and operations

·    Lack of internal circulation south of OR 22, which could cause congestion issues in the future as
     land develops

·    Sight distance issues at OR 22/Church Street

·    Lack of dedicated enforcement staff or techniques to mitigate speeding

Assets
The Idanha community has many assets that can be used to advance plans to enact positive changes
to the transportation system. Some of these include:

·    Dedicated City staff, with an understanding of the grant application process
·    Active and engaged City leadership
·    Interested citizens, who are willing to hear all sides of an issue prior to making a decision and
     who are interested in bettering the community
·    Spectacular setting along the North Santiam River on a Scenic Byway
·    Frontage along OR 22
·    Existing businesses

The following recommendations are intended to address the issues and build on the assets of
Idanha. Recommendations are presented as Phase 1 recommendations, which are intended to focus
on the immediate strategies for transportation improvement and were approved through PMT
consensus, and Phase 2 recommendations, which are intended to provide longer-term strategies
that should be implemented as property in Idanha, particularly fronting the OR 22 corridor,
develops and/or redevelops in the future.


Phase 1 Recommendations
Figure 14 shows Phase 1 recommendations for the Idanha transportation system. Idanha should
pursue grant funding for these recommendations. Most of the Phase 1 recommendations focus on
the central portion of Idanha, between the western edge of the vacant parcel of land southwest of
Main Street/OR 22 and Church Street, because that segment of roadway functions as the primary
roadway for Idanha and serves as the city center and focal point for pedestrian activity. Pedestrians
cross the highway from the southern residential areas off of Main Street and Church Street. Phase 1
recommendations include the following elements:

·    Add gateways. Gateways into communities serve as visual markers for residents and visitors
     alike. They signal arrival and entry points to a community. Many times gateways reflect unique
     local history and conjure positive memories for community residents. Per discussion with the
     PMT, landscaped gateways are recommended for both ends of the central portion of Idanha
     (shown on Figure 14). The gateways are intended to help convey the character and "sense of
     place" of Idanha, which is also expected to slow traffic though town. Idanha should pursue
     grant funding for these improvements, located within the ODOT right-of-way. Examples of
     different gateway treatments are shown below. A combination of landscaping, signage, and
     perhaps local art is appropriate for Idanha. Design of the gateways should include a public
     process that involves the community.




            Landscape Treatment               Lighting Treatment             Architectural Treatment
     Examples of Gateway Treatments

     ·    Develop multiuse trail south of OR 22. Idanha should immediately pursue the
          development of a multiuse pedestrian and bicycle trail located south of OR 22 east of Main
          Street (along the Riverside Drive right-of-way). The development of a multiuse trail located
          just south of and parallel to OR 22 should be included as a condition of development of the
          land parcels immediately southwest of the OR 22/Main Street intersection. These trails are
          identified as recommendations in the North Santiam Canyon Alternative Transportation Link
          Feasibility Study ­ Canyon Journeys (2005) regional trail plan, and would connect with the
          regional Santiam Canyon trail system.

IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                      36
·    Define intersection at OR 22/Main Street. The location and width of Main Street at OR 22
     should be defined. Concrete ramps (east side) and striping (west side) will indicate to
     pedestrians the proper location to cross OR 22, and alert motorists to a location where
     pedestrians may be crossing. A crosswalk should be added across Main Street (south leg of
     intersection).

·    Enhance existing off-street internal pedestrian connection (City Hall to post office). Idanha
     should improve the existing off-street pedestrian connection between City Hall and the post
     office to keep walkers off OR 22. This would be accomplished through asphalt overlay to ensure
     the path is free of obstacles for walkers (e.g., potholes).

·    Widen foglines. Foglines should be painted wider than usual (8 inches) to help define the edge
     of the roadway through central Idanha. This will potentially deter passing on the right, and also
     visually makes the roadway lanes feel narrower (even if they are not), which can slow traffic.

·    Widen shoulders where possible. Idanha should coordinate with ODOT to widen shoulders
     along OR 22 to ODOT standards (8 feet for pedestrian usage) where feasible between Main
     Street and Church Street. This could be accomplished during a pavement overlay.

·    Enhance school bus shelter. In coordination with the Santiam Canyon School District, Idanha
     should enhance the existing school bus shelter to ensure a safe, well defined, and all-weather
     location for children to wait for the bus. Children and parents should also be educated to catch
     the bus on its way east (on the south side) to avoid crossing OR 22 to catch the bus on its return
     trip west.

·    Mitigate sight distance issues at Church Street. Due to roadway geometry (roadway curve,
     proximity to North Santiam River, and a boulder), there is poor sight distance at Church Street
     for those traveling from Church Street onto OR 22. There are no recorded safety issues at this
     location in the past 5 years. Warning signage along westbound OR 22 indicating traffic entering
     the roadway should be installed to alert drivers about vehicles entering the highway from
     Church Street.

·    Enact maintenance agreements. Idanha and ODOT should enact a maintenance agreement that
     addresses: (1) snow removal to ensure clear sight distance and snow placement and (2) periodic
     sweeping of shoulders to ensure lack of obstructions (such as gravel) to bicyclists or pedestrians
     in the roadway shoulder.

·    Encourage private property treatments. Idanha should encourage property owners along OR
     22 to define entrances to their residences, businesses, etc. or frontages through "soft" and
     portable barriers, such as pots of flowers. The City could examine making "seed" funds
     available for private property enhancements along the OR 22 corridor for economic
     development purposes. These enhancements are likely to have the side effect of slowing traffic
     through town by creating driver interest.

·    Enhance utility pole aesthetics. Treatments such as lighting or decorative flags/banners hung
     from utility poles should be explored. Any utility pole flags or banners need to be permitted
     through ODOT.

·    Purchase radar readerboard and establish a volunteer readerboard operating committee.
     Idanha should pursue a traffic safety/enforcement grant to purchase a radar readerboard,
     which is posted along the side of the road to show drivers their speeds. This tool would help to
     slow drivers. A post-mounted or trailer readerboard could be purchased. Operation would
IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                 37
       require battery recharging; a post-mounted readerboard lasts for less than a day between
       recharges and is less expensive, and a trailer readerboard lasts for 3 days between recharges and
       is slightly more expensive. The volunteer committee should be tasked with recharging and
       moving the readerboard at bi-weekly intervals.

·      Pursue dedicated patrol staff for Idanha. Idanha should pursue funding to secure dedicated
       patrol staff for 16 hours a week. Dedicated patrol staff could be funded through safety and
       enforcement grants or coordination with Marion and Linn counties. Idanha could also examine
       the development of a minor traffic violations court system, or coordination with County courts.
       When speeders are assessed fines, 100 percent of the fine would go to Idanha with a city court,
       and 50 percent of the fine would go to Idanha with a County court system. This would likely
       cover much of the cost of a part-time patrol person once up-front costs (equipment) were
       covered by grant dollars.

Phase 1 - Planning Level Cost Estimates
A planning level cost estimate was conducted that included elements from the Phase 1
Recommendations listed above. The cost estimates are rough estimates, and are only to be used for
planning purposes. Table 16 shows a range of costs for several individual elements, as well as a
cumulative total. The range of costs reflects the level of available design information.

    Install two gateways including signs and landscaped areas at either end of the central city.

    School Bus Shelter:
                                                                                                            $3,500 to $5,000
    Install all-weather bus shelter.

    Mitigate Sight Distance Issue at Church Street:
                                                                                                                $500 to $800
    Install warning signage to alert drivers to traffic entering OR 22 from Church Street.
    RADAR readerboard:
    Purchase RADAR speed readerboard for placement along OR 22 to discourage speeding                       $2,500 to $4,000
    through Idanha.
    Infrastructure Improvements:                                                                         $95,000 to $225,000
           - Off-Street Pedestrian Connection: An asphalt trail connecting Idanha City Hall with
             the post office. Approximate trail dimensions: 200 feet x 6 feet.

           - Intersection Definition at OR 22 & Main Street intersection: Install concrete curb
             ramps on east side of intersection; paint on west side. Add new stop bar and
             crosswalk striping across Main Street.

           - Widen Foglines: 8-inch striping on the outer edge of travel lane along OR 22 through
             the project area.

           - Additional Project Related Costs: Costs include mobilization, traffic control, surveying
             and contingency amounts.

                                                                                             TOTAL      $105,000 to $239,000




IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                                     38
Estimates for individual work items are based on costs from the 2005 bid tabulation from the ODOT
Procurement Office, and other previous projects. Several Phase 1 elements were combined under a
general "infrastructure improvements" heading to reflect the similar implementation characteristics
of each of the included elements. The range of costs is greater for this group of elements to reflect
the potential for discovery of factors which may impact the cost of the elements. The range of costs
shown for the "infrastructure improvements" element assumes savings could be achieved through
implementation of the improvements during a single construction project. This would save cost
associated with labor and time.
Costs associated with project mobilization and staging were assumed to be higher than comparable
projects due to the distance of Idanha to ODOT maintenance facilities and construction equipment.
Costs for developing the Phase 1 multiuse trails (part of the Santiam Canyon trail system) can be
found in the North Santiam Canyon Alternative Transportation Link Feasibility Study ­ Canyon Journeys
(2005) regional trail plan.

Funding Options
A variety of local, state, and federal funding/grant sources can be used to improve the
transportation system and implement some of the Phase 1 recommendations.
Local funding sources include the City of Idanha, private property owners or developers, the Mid-
Willamette Valley Council of Governments, and Marion County or Linn County. Other local
funding sources could include grants and private funds.
Table 17 summarizes potential public funding sources for pedestrian, bicycle, and roadway
improvements in Idanha.

Phase 2 Recommendations
Phase 2 recommendations should be re-examined and implemented as future development occurs
in Idanha, particularly along OR 22. Phase 2 recommendations include the following elements.

·    Implement Access Control. Access control is an issue in Idanha, including access spacing and
     lack of access definition. However, the safety and operations analysis did not reveal problems
     along OR 22 in Idanha at this time and the City was concerned about potential adverse
     economic impacts resulting from access modifications. The PMT recommended that access
     control be addressed in the future, as property develops along OR 22. Access control will be
     more effective and beneficial to the community if there is cooperation among landowners and
     citizens regarding access plans and goals for the city.


     As land along OR 22 develops, access control will become more important from a safety
     perspective for both motorists and pedestrians/bicyclists. More turning movements equates to
     more conflict opportunities between vehicles and pedestrians/bicyclists. As development
     occurs, lack of access control could also affect highway operations.
     Developing properties fronting OR 22 would need to go through a site planning process, which
     should require accommodations for shared private driveways, as well as internal circulation
     between private properties, including backage or frontage roads/parking lot connections. All
     developments, including those located between Main Street and Church Street, will likely need
     to apply to ODOT for access to the highway. ODOT access spacing would not permit additional
     access between Main Street and Church Street; however, additional access could be requested
     using a deviation process. In addition, if a pedestrian/bicycle trail is to be located along OR 22,
     access control will need to be addressed during the design of that facility.
     General potential access locations are included in the section of this report entitled "Analysis of
     Options." Access control should be implemented through the development of pedestrian
     facilities, alternate access (off side streets) where feasible, and consolidation of driveways where
     feasible. New access points to OR 22 should be spaced according to ODOT standards.

·    Re-Examine a New Left Turn Lane at OR 22/Main Street. As properties develop along OR 22,
     and as access control is implemented, the warrant for a left turn lane at OR 22/Main Street
     should be re-examined. Although currently the location does not merit a left turn lane, as traffic
     patterns are altered through access control, turning movements that currently are not limited
     through town would be concentrated at this intersection and could result in an increase in left
     turn movements. In addition, any development to the southeast of the intersection (currently
     vacant land) or additional development to the northeast of the intersection could potentially
     trigger need for a left turn lane at this location.




IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                   41
·    Implement Development Code Strategies. The development code should include strategies for
     preservation and improvement of the transportation system as properties develop or redevelop.
     The development code should include requirements for shared driveways and joint access
     where feasible, internal circulation, and cross access (e.g., via parking lots) where feasible, as
     well as encouragement of frontage or backage roads for new development. A criterion for
     internal pedestrian circulation should be added to the site plan review process. Section 8
     includes more discussion related to recommended development code changes. All significant
     developments, particularly those fronting OR 22 or located on vacant land to the southeast of
     the Main Street/OR 22 intersection, should be required to submit a traffic impact analysis to
     ensure that the development accounts for any traffic mitigation that might be necessary to
     protect the function and safety of the roadway system.


·    Extend 2nd Street West to OR 22. As the vacant parcel southwest of Main Street/OR 22
     develops, 2nd Street should be extended westward to an intersection with OR 22 at the accepted
     ODOT spacing standard from Main Street. The extension should complement the proposed
     development. This will enhance internal circulation in the city and provide alternate access to
     the future land uses developing in the area. A backage road concept should be explored with
     the developer to serve any new commercial development in that parcel.


·    Enhance Lighting at OR 22 and Main Street. Lighting should be enhanced at the OR 22/Main
     Street intersection to improve visibility of pedestrians and bicyclists.


·    Examine Remote Activation for Blinking Signal at Fire Station. Idanha should coordinate
     with ODOT about the potential for remote activation of the blinking signal outside the Idanha
     fire station. The remote activation would be intended for the volunteer fire fighter force.


·    Continue Dialogue among City Residents, Property Owners, and ODOT. City property
     owners and citizens should continue dialogue with each other and with ODOT regarding future
     plans for the OR 22 through Idanha.

8 Idanha Development Code Review

Introduction
This review of Idanha development ordinances evaluates the ability of the City's ordinances to
support access management of OR 22 and city redevelopment. The review included items such as
determining opportunities and constraints to connecting properties through off-street connections
(e.g., parking lots), promoting internal circulation, and allowing for future development of
properties in Idanha.
Development ordinances in the City of Idanha Zoning & Developmental Codes (ZDC) were
reviewed, focusing on the zones adjacent to OR 22 in the study area (except for CR), as well as the
development standards that apply in these zones or to OR 2 in the study area. These included the
following chapters of the ZDC:
Redevelopment
·    Chapter 9
·    Chapter 10, Site Plan Review
·    Chapter 17, C ZONE (Commercial)
·    Chapter 19, LI ZONE (Light Industrial)
·    Chapter 20, I ZONE (Industrial)
Access and Connections, Internal Circulation
·    Chapter 12, General Zoning And Development
·    Chapter 14, Off-Street Parking and Loading


Redevelopment along OR 22
Chapter 10, Site Plan Review
Site plan review is the process by which development applications are reviewed and approved. A
variety of objectives are associated with site plan review, but in general the purpose is to ensure
that development is compatible with the surrounding built and natural environment, and to resolve
potential conflicts between proposed projects and adjacent uses. Site plan review is required for all
new development, excluding single-family detached dwellings, duplex dwellings, and commercial
and industrial site alterations or building remodels that do not exceed 25 percent of the total square
footage of the structure or site. Site plan review requires applicants to include a site analysis as well
as a site development plan showing proposed landscaping, drainage, building elevations, vehicle
and pedestrian facilities, and vehicle circulation. Chapter 10 also includes site plan review criteria
which address the issue of compatibility.

Considerations
Site plan review is an important process for local governments. It does not preclude future
development. Rather, it ensures that future development is compatible and meets certain

IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                  43
requirements laid out by the City. Therefore, we recommend that the City maintain the existing site
plan review process and requirements as currently adopted in Chapter 10, as well as ensuring that
traffic impact analyses are submitted for all relevant new developments and redevelopments.
In terms of ensuring that internal circulation can be provided, Section 10.050 includes a criterion
that one of the considerations in reviewing and approving the required site development plan is
traffic safety, internal circulation, and parking.
In addition, this chapter contains no requirement addressing internal pedestrian circulation. This is
a safety and convenience issue, and relevant to the redevelopment of OR 22. A criterion addressing
on-site pedestrian circulation should be included as a site plan review criterion. While pedestrian
circulation is required to be illustrated on the site plan, it is not one of the site plan review criteria in
Section 10.050.

Chapters 17, 19, and 20 C, LI, and I Zones
In general, these zones contain no specific standards addressing connected parking lots or internal
circulation and do not present barriers or conflicts to implementing such measures if the City
chooses to do so.

Chapter 17, C ZONE (Commercial)
The Commercial district allows for a broad range of commercial uses and standards common to
downtowns as well as some more auto-oriented uses such as garages. The zone allows building
heights up to 50 feet, or 70 feet with a variance and a maximum front yard setback of 5 feet. In
addition to dimensional standards, section 17.060 contains development standards that govern the
look and orientation of a building, requiring ground floor windows, siding materials, and
orientation to the street.

Considerations
To encourage dwellings downtown, the City may want to consider creating a "downtown" zone as
well as a more auto-oriented zone. In addition, it may be appropriate to allow residential use above
commercial or other uses in the C zone.

Chapter 19, LI ZONE (Light Industrial)
The LI zone allows a small range industrial uses that have minimal impacts, including auto sales,
storage units, and car washes. The development standards for this zone are fairly minimal,
requiring a minimum front yard setback of 5 feet and no maximum setback. The maximum height
is 50 feet, but semi-public buildings may reach 70 feet.

Considerations
This zone covers a great deal of the OR 22 frontage in the study area. The City may want to
consider re-zoning some of this area to C or CR zones in order to facilitate downtown
redevelopment.

Chapter 20, I ZONE (Light Industrial)
Both commercial and Industrial uses are allowed in the high intensity I zone. This zone has special
setbacks for buildings exceeding 35 feet in height, buildings adjacent to residential zoned property
(30 feet), and buildings located on the same lot must be set back at least 10 feet from one another.

Considerations
This zone has a great deal of the OR 22 frontage in the study area. Since it is in such close proximity
to residential areas, The City may want to consider re-zoning some of this area to C or R zones in
order to facilitate downtown redevelopment.


Access and Connections/Internal Circulation
Chapter 12, General Zoning and Development
Access issues are addressed in Chapter 12 of the Idanha Development Code, specifically in
Section 2.070, Property Access Requirements. The section requires that all dwellings be located on
lots with direct access to a public street or pre-existing private driveway. The section also states that
permission must be obtained from ODOT for access to OR 22. This is a very minimal section to
address access issues. In addition, Chapter 12 prohibits parking lots in "front yard setbacks" and
"landscaped areas."
City staff have expressed interest in the possibility of developing a connected parking lot system to
facilitate vehicle circulation behind (or in front of, when affected by topography) future retail
establishments in order to reduce the reliance on OR 22 for local street connectivity. While the
City's current rules regarding parking lot design do not prohibit connected parking lots, they could
be amended to include specific standards for connected parking lots.
This approach to parking lot design and vehicle circulation has been used in other Oregon
communities including Hermiston and Tualatin. In most communities, connected parking lots are
encouraged rather than required. However, even if they are not required, it is important that the
development code contains a section in the access management section to require or encourage
connected parking lots.

Considerations
The City may want to consider adding a provision in Section 12.070 encouraging or requiring
"cross easements" for parking lots to connect behind buildings and further diminish the need to
access OR 22. In addition, this section should include internal pedestrian circulation standards.
There are examples of "cross easement" provisions in the following development codes:

·    City of Hermiston Zoning Code, Section 157.150, Transportation Improvements, Standards,
     And Procedures

·    City of Tualatin Development Code, Section 73.400, Access
The City should maintain the requirement of prohibiting parking in front yards and landscaped
areas.

Chapter 14, Off-Street Parking and Loading
This section of the Idanha Development Code includes requirements about the number of required
off-street parking spaces for a broad range of uses. Joint use parking is allowed, meaning that two
uses with non-overlapping hours may both count the same parking spaces toward the minimum
requirements, thus diminishing the total number. The chapter also outlines requirements for
parking lot circulation and landscaping. The chapter also contains internal vehicle circulation
standards, including driveway width.

IDANHA_TRANS_STUDY_092105.DOC                                                                  45
Considerations
If internal pedestrian circulation standards are adopted, this chapter should contain a cross-
reference to them. The requirements of this section do not present barriers to the redevelopment of
OR 22, or to the connection of properties through cross easements. If required, parking lot
perimeter landscaping could present a barrier to parking lot connectivity. However, the only
requirement for such landscaping is in Section 14.080,(B) Screening, and it is only required when
parking areas are adjacent to a residential zone.


Development Code Conclusions
The Idanha Development Code does not create barriers to connecting properties or to allowing
internal circulation, and it does not preclude future development. However, the code does not
present opportunities to achieve these objectives either. In order to implement a long-term access
management strategy, such as connecting properties at the rear through cross easements or through
frontage roads, the City should review Attachment 6, which includes sample code text from the
cities of Hermiston and Tualatin and consider making appropriate changes to the code
In addition, as part of any redevelopment strategy, reasonable zoning should be in place. Much of
the study area frontage along OR 22 is zoned LI or I for industrial uses. These areas are adjacent to
or near most of the residential development and commercial zoning, and it might make sense for
some of this area to be rezoned to reflect the economic shifts that have taken place over time.
Finally, for the purpose of pedestrian safety and convenience, on-site pedestrian circulation
standards should be developed and adopted the next time the City amends the Development Code.

This technical memorandum outlines the process for estimating the 30th highest volumes,
forecasting future traffic volumes and performing the traffic analysis for the Idanha
Transportation Facility Plan. If possible, we would like to receive comments January 20,
2005 as our schedule is to produce a transportation facility improvements memorandum by
February 21, 2005.

30th Highest Traffic Volume Methodology
There are three intersections that will be analyzed in this study and they are all unsignalized.
The intersections are:
·   OR 22 & Blowout Road
·   OR 22 & Main Street
·   OR 22 & Church Street

The traffic counts will show major vehicle classification (car, light. Medium and heavy trucks
along with pedestrian and bicycle data) and were collected on January 11, 2005. At OR 22
& Main Street, a 16 hour count was taken. At OR 22 & Blowout Road and OR 22 & Church
Street, two hour counts were taken between 4 and 6 p.m. The volumes between the OR 22
& Main Street and OR 22 & Church Street intersections will be balanced before proceeding
to the 30th highest hour steps to account for the close proximity between the intersections.
There is no automated traffic recorder (ATR) site stationed within the City of Lafayette. In
order to factor the traffic counts to the 30th highest hour volumes, the seasonal factor from
the nearest location will be used. This location is the Detroit ATR site #24-015, located along
OR 22, 0.14 mile east of the eastern city limits of Detroit.
The procedure used to create 30th highest hour volumes (30 HHV) will utilize the same
steps outlined in the pdf file located on the weblink below; which is to divide the count period
seasonal factor by the peak period seasonal factor to get the 30 HHV seasonal factor. Once
the peak hour volumes (from the traffic count) are determined, the 30 HHV seasonal factor
will be applied to get 30th highest hour volumes.

Traffic Forecast Methodology
To forecast traffic volumes, we will use the 2023 future volume table located on the weblink
below.
(http://www.odot.state.or.us/tddtpau/SysAnalysis.html#DataRes)
To arrive at the 20-year design year, the volumes will be extrapolated an additional two
years to create 2025 conditions. Only forecasts with R-squared values greater than 0.75 will
be used for the growth rates. Since none of the data from within Idanha city limits has an R-
squared value above 0.75, the rates will be taken from a location along OR 22, about 10
miles east of Idanha. The Table 1 shows the growth rate that will be used for this analysis.
The rate was calculated using linear interpolation.

Left Turn Lane Siting Criteria
ATTACHMENT 5. Left Turn Lane Siting Criteria
The following addresses the concern for the addition of a left turn lane at the intersection
of Main Street and OR 22.
According to the 2003 English Highway Design Manual (HDM) - Appendix F, the
following steps guide the left turn lane evaluation process:
    1) A left turn lane should be installed, if criteria 1 (Volume), or 2 (Crash) or 3
       (Special Cases) are met, unless a subsequent evaluation eliminate it as an option,
       And;
    2) The Region Traffic Engineer must approve all left turn lanes on state highways
       regardless of funding source, And;
    3) The State Traffic Engineer shall review and approve all proposed left turn lanes
       at signalized intersection locations on the State Highway System to ensure
       proper signal operation, prior to design and construction, And;
    4) Complies with Access Management Spacing Standards, And;
    5) Conforms to applicable local, regional and state plans.

Criterion 1 ­ Vehicular Volume
According to the HDM (Appendix F), this left-turn lane criterion is not met when there
are zero to ten left turn vehicles per hour. The existing (2005) 30th Highest Hour design
volumes at Main Street/OR 22 show that no more than ten vehicles during the peak
hour are expected to turn left from either direction at the Main Street intersection, which
is lower than the threshold to indicate need for a left turn lane. The future (2025) 30th
Highest Hour design volumes at Main Street/OR 22 show that approximately 15
vehicles are expected to turn left at Main Street during a peak hour, which is also lower
than the threshold to indicated need for a left turn lane. These volumes do not meet left-
turn lane criteria as outlined in Appendix F.
Therefore, the Main Street/OR 22 intersection does not meet Criterion 1 ­ Vehicular
Volume. 1

Criterion 2 ­ Crash Experience
Analysis of the five-year crash history through Idanha, and in particular at the OR
22/Main Street intersection, do not indicate a consistent pattern of crashes at the
intersection. One crash occurred at the intersection in the past five years in January 2000.


1
  It should be noted that because the access is poorly defined on the northern side of OR 22 just east of the
OR 22/Main Street intersection, the left turn lane analysis does not account for left turns into the grocery
store or adjacent properties If in the future an access management strategy is implemented in Idanha, the
intersection should be re-counted and re-examined to see if the changes in roadway access and design
would cause the roadway to meet left turn lane criteria. The left turn lane analysis also does not account for
any future high-traffic generators located on vacant land near the OR 22/Main Street intersection (e.g.
vacant parcel to the southwest). Any future development near this intersection should be required to submit
a Traffic Impact Analysis prior to development.
The crash history also does not suggest a condition susceptible to correction with a left
turn lane.
Other treatments ­ such as the addition of pedestrian and bicycle facilities and
landscaping ­ could improve the speed issues on this stretch of roadway by creating a
visual narrowing of the roadway and providing a sense of place, and therefore interest,
to drivers, potentially resulting in slower speeds.
Crash analysis does not appear to indicate a safety need for a left-turn lane at the OR
22/Main Street intersection, and does not meet Criterion 2 ­ Crash Experience.

Criterion 3 ­ Special Cases
The HDM, Appendix F outlines some special cases when a left-turn lane could be
considered for a state highway. The following discussion outlines the special cases and
addresses the ways in which the Main Street/OR 22 intersection meets or does not meet
the criteria:
   (1) Railroad crossings ­ This criterion is not applicable at this location.
   (2) Passing lane ­ This criterion is not applicable at this location.
   (3) Geometric/safety concerns ­ This criterion is not applicable at this location.
   (4) Non-traversable median ­ This criterion is not applicable at this location.
   (5) Signalized intersection ­ This criterion is not applicable at this location.
The special cases outlined in Appendix F do not relate to the Main Street/OR 22
intersection in Idanha, and the intersection does not meet Criterion 3 ­ Special Cases.

Section 157.150 TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS, STANDARDS, AND PROCEDURES.

(G) Access management. The following access management provisions shall apply to all
development and subdivisions subject to the Development Standards of 157.160 et seq.:

          (1) Development shall preserve the flow of traffic in terms of safety, capacity, functional
classification, and level of services. Access management policies set forth in the city TSP and the
Oregon Highway Plan will apply to any proposals for new access or change of existing access.

          (2) Residential driveways shall be located to optimize intersection operation and, where
possible, to access off the street with the lowest functional classification. For example, if a house is
located on the corner of a local street and a minor collector, the driveway shall access from the local
street as long as it can be located a sufficient distance from the intersection.

        (3) Properties that front on collector or arterial streets are encouraged to share an access
with neighboring properties.

       (4) Access to state highways is regulated by the Oregon Department of Transportation
(ODOT) as described in the Oregon Highway Plan. Umatilla County regulates access to county
roads.

         (5) A system of joint use driveways, sidewalks, and cross access easements shall be
established for commercial and office developments wherever feasible and shall incorporate the
following:

           (a) A design speed of 10 M.P.H. and a maximum width of 20 feet to accommodate

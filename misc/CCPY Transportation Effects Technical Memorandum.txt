1.1      Project Description
1.1.1 Project Purpose
The purpose of the CCPY Corridor Transit Improvements Project is to advance the proposed
transit improvements for the CCPY Corridor into design and construction utilizing federal grants
appropriated for these transit improvements. As required by the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA), the potential effects on transportation conditions and social, cultural, and natural
environments in the corridor will be evaluated and documented. This process will meet the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other federal and state
policies.

1.1.2 Background
The CCPY Corridor is a five-mile long corridor that extends from the Braddock Road Metrorail
station in the City of Alexandria to the Pentagon in Arlington County. Metrorail Blue and Yellow
lines and Jefferson Davis Highway, a segment of heavily-traveled U.S. Route 1, form the
transportation backbone of the corridor.
In 2003, the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT), Arlington County,
and the City of Alexandria completed the CCPY Corridor Transit Alternatives Analysis (AA). In
the AA, transit modes, which included bus rapid transit (BRT), light rail transit (LRT), and
Metrorail, and alignment options were analyzed. The costs and benefits of each alternative were
also assessed.
Following the completion of the AA, DRPT, in collaboration with Arlington County and the City of
Alexandria, undertook the CCPY Corridor Interim Transit Improvements Study that formulated
implementation strategies targeting the period from 2007 to 2014. As part of the study, an
environmental scan and station area planning were conducted. At the conclusion of this study,
a high-capacity, branded bus transit service using both mixed traffic operations and exclusive
transitways was recommended. This service, while supporting growing transit demand from
existing and new developments, would not preclude longer-term transit system improvement
options that have been envisioned for the CCPY corridor, including BRT, LRT, and the addition
of a Metrorail station.

1.1.4 Environmental Documentation
Both Alexandria and Arlington have secured considerable funding for the design and
construction of the planned transit improvements, including several federal grants. In order to
utilize the federal grants appropriated for transitways, the project sponsors must undertake
environmental analyses to satisfy NEPA. Since the proposed transit improvements are planned
largely in existing right-of-way and would require little or no construction, significant
environmental effects are not anticipated. Based on consultation with FTA staff, the project
sponsors will prepare a Documented Categorical Exclusion as the appropriate NEPA document.
The studies will include an Air Quality analysis, a Noise and Vibration analysis, a Traffic
analysis, a Historic and Archaeological Analysis, a water resources analysis, and a Phase I
ESA. The studies will document the level of potential impact associated with the project and
identify any mitigation measures necessary to reduce or eliminate impacts.
There are a number of activities within this project corridor that are either currently being
constructed by others or planned to be constructed by others. Figure 1-1 shows the CCPY
planned alignment and areas where construction is underway or planned by others.
Construction activities by others include new roadways, bridges, and intersection improvements.
Current and proposed projects planned or constructed by others are not evaluated as part of
this project, and any potential impacts to known or potential hazardous materials sites are not
included in this current study. Evaluations of potential environmental impacts associated with
those other improvements are assumed to be part of separate environmental documents being
prepared by the agencies sponsoring those improvements.

1.2      Project Alignment and Planned Improvements
The planned alignment for the CCPY Corridor Transit Improvements Project begins at the
Braddock Road Metrorail Station and ends near the Pentagon in Arlington County. The
alignment passes through 38 intersections. The planned transit alignment, stops, and location of
exclusive right-of-way are shown in Figure 1-1. The planned CCPY Corridor Alignment has
been separated into six segments that are identified from south to north. The segments are
described below:
Segment A - Alexandria Route 1 South
Segment A begins at the Braddock Road Metrorail Station and heads east on Madison Street to
North Fayette Street. The planned alignment turns north on Fayette Street and then east on 1st
Street before turning north again on North Henry Street and crossing the realigned Monroe
Avenue Bridge. The planned alignment in Segment A runs entirely in mixed traffic on existing
roadway.
Segment B - Alexandria Route 1
Segment B runs north along Route 1 from the realigned Monroe Avenue Bridge to East Glebe
Road. The planned alignment in Segment B runs entirely in exclusive transit lanes either in a
median busway or along the east and west curbsides of Route 1 to East Glebe Road, where it
transitions to mixed traffic. 1

 The 2030 analysis is based upon a median alignment in Segment B as the proposed action. The City of Alexandria
has not made a definitive decision about the alignment in Segment B; thus, the 2015 analysis examines the effects of
both alignments.

Segment C - Alexandria Potomac Yard
Segment C travels east on East Glebe Road from Route 1 through the planned Potomac Yard
Town Center to Potomac Avenue. It then turns north along Potomac Avenue to the
Alexandria/Arlington line. The planned alignment in Segment C runs entirely in mixed traffic.
Segment D - Arlington Potomac Yard
Segment D begins at the Alexandria/Arlington border running in mixed traffic north on Potomac
Avenue. It transitions to exclusive lanes as it turns west on South Glebe Road, running on the
northern side of the roadway in right-of-way donated as part of the planned development of
Potomac Yard. The alignment turns north on Jefferson Davis Highway and merges with South
Crystal Drive, running on the east side of the roadway to the intersection of South Crystal Drive
and 26th Street South.
Segment E- Arlington Crystal City
Segment E begins at 26th Street South and South Crystal Drive running west before turning
north on South Clark Street to 20th Street South. At 20th Street South, the planned alignment
turns east and then north on South Bell Street to the Crystal City Metrorail Station at 18th Street
South. This segment runs entirely in exclusive curbside lanes.

Segment F - Arlington Pentagon
Segment F begins at the Crystal City Metrorail Station and travels north on South Bell/South
Clark Street before turning west on 12th Street. At South Eads Street, the alignment splits into
two branches serving the Pentagon and Pentagon City. The first branch turns north on South
Eads Street to the Pentagon Transit Center. The second branch continues west on 12th Street
South to the Pentagon City Metrorail Station. The planned alignment in Segment F runs in
exclusive curbside lanes until the intersection of 12th Street and South Eads Street, where it
transitions to running in mixed traffic. .

2.0 TRANSIT OPERATIONS AND PROJECT TRANSIT
    SERVICE
This section of the memo documents assumptions underlying the analysis of transit operations
and effects of the proposed transit service.

2.1      No-Build Scenarios
For the transit network, the No-Build model for both 2015 and 2030 will include the existing and
planned route structure for Metrobus and DASH service, as shown in Appendix A. The
operations plan for the 2015 and 2030 No-Build scenarios matches the levels of transit service
assumed for the Build scenarios. In the No-Build case, Metrobus Routes 9E and 9S are the
trunk routes operating in mixed traffic along the project corridor. They serve the same
destinations as the Build scenarios, with a net service frequency of 32 buses per hour. In the
2015 No-Build scenario, 9S service is extended to the Potomac Yard shopping center via the
new Four Mile Run Bridge, and in the 2030 No-Build scenario 9S service is extended to the new
Alexandria Town Center and the proposed new Metrorail station.

2.2      Build Scenarios
The operations plan for the 2015 and 2030 Build scenarios is taken from the CC/PY
Implementation Strategy, Mid-Term Peak Service Plan. The plan describes three transit lines
that would use the busway, producing a net service frequency of 32 buses per hour. The three

refer to Appendix A: Existing and Proposed Bus Routes). The "blue" line extends from Braddock
Road Metrorail Station to the Pentagon at 5-minute peak headways, the "red" line extends from
future Alexandria Town Center to the Pentagon at 5-minute peak headways, and the "orange"
line extends from the future Alexandria Town Center to Pentagon City at 10-minute peak
headways.

The configuration of the Build transit network is essentially the same as the No-Build with the
major exception being that the core transit service has dedicated lanes along much of the
alignment with passenger stations and amenities to facilitate use of the service.
The Alternatives Analysis, completed in 2004, included a forecast of travel demand for the
proposed transit service. As part of the Implementation Strategy, completed in 2005, this
forecast was validated. Due to ongoing economic trends and recently released plans for military
base relocations and closures, several changes are expected along the corridor. Some of these
projected changes are reflected in the most recent updates to the MWCOG regional forecasts,
and ridership projections for the study corridor were validated against the new data.2
As discussed in Appendix B, Assessment of Phase I Operations Plans, ridership estimates that
were utilized in the development of the operating plan for the Crystal City/Potomac Yard Transit
Implementation Plan were based on model runs conducted during the original corridor

  The projected effects of recent Base Relocation and Closure (BRAC) plans by the federal government were not fully incorporated
into the analysis/validation process. First, the analysis is based on the WMCOG Round 7.0 Cooperative Forecast, which did not
contain all of the BRAC changes. Second, neither the timing of BRAC plans nor the County's plans for redevelopment of the
affected areas were known at the time of this transportation analysis.

Alternatives Analysis. This ridership modeling was based on MWCOG's Round 6.3 Population
and Employment forecasts. Since the completion of the original ridership estimates MWCOG
has adopted the new Round 7.0 regional population and employment forecasts. As part of the
current analysis, the project team ran three tests to determine whether changes in population,
employment, and travel behavior between the two forecast rounds would result in changes to
the ridership estimates significant enough to warrant changes in the operating plan. The tests
show that changes in projections would effect the previously prepared operating plan within a
range of about 10 percent, a range that validates the operating plan.

2.3       Assumed Physical Improvements
The Build scenarios would be accompanied by minor physical changes in the corridor, including
busway construction, street paving and resurfacing, upgrades to pedestrian facilities,
adjustments to traffic patterns, and additional traffic and pedestrian signals. Table 2-1 details
the improvements by corridor segment. The City of Alexandria is currently considering the
option of curbside or median bus lanes along Segment B (approximately 0.7 miles of Route 1)
and is working with communities to determine bus lane operations.

2.4       Transit Effects
Corridor travel times and bus throughput were simulated corridor-wide to develop a general
indication as to the performance of the transit improvements. As described below in Section 3,
Traffic Modeling, the consultant team developed a simulation model that reflects the planned
Build and No-Build transit networks along with projected future traffic levels along the project
corridor. In the No-Build case, increasing vehicular traffic would affect the performance of transit
service along the entire corridor. In the Build scenarios, transit service will perform better--with
reduced travel time for passengers, and thus more overall passenger capacity--because of the
segments with dedicated bus lanes. Table 2-2 shows results for transit performance across the
entire corridor. Details on corridor-wide travel times are shown in Appendix E. At the
recommendation of City of Alexandria staff, for Segment B the study team simulated both
curbside and median bus lanes in the 2015 analysis, and median lanes in the 2030 analysis.

*The Build Alternative simulations include the options of curbside bus lanes and median bus lanes on Segment B, located in the City
of Alexandria.


Transit Effects by Segment
As described below, the corridor simulation shows that along some study segments, transit
travel time will be affected due to provision of exclusive bus lanes. Projected travel times
decrease along Segments D and E, increase along Segment B (in the curb-running case), and
are comparable to the No Build scenario for Segments A, B (in the median-running case), C,
and F. Details on travel times by segment are shown in Tables 2-3 and 2-4, and in Appendix E.
         Segment A  Travel time for Segment A is not affected by exclusive busway as buses
          will travel in the mixed flow of traffic. Travel times will be similar for the No-Build and
          Build conditions in 2015, and again similar in 2030.
         Segment B  For curbside bus operation under 2015 scenario, Segment B shows an
          increase in travel time by 2 minutes 11 seconds in the northbound direction and 4
          minutes 13 seconds in the southbound direction during the a.m. peak hour. During the
          p.m. peak hour, Segment B shows increases in travel time by 4 minutes 4 seconds in
          northbound and 2 minutes 48 seconds in the southbound direction. These increases in
          travel time are due to provision of exclusive bus phases for curbside operation. The bus
          phase is engaged after all other phases are complete, leading to accumulated delay time
          for buses.
          In 2015 and 2030, median bus operation shows minor increases in travel time over the
          No-Build condition in both a.m. and p.m. peaks. In this segment, there is no need for
          exclusive bus phases because buses are running on the same signal phase as
          northbound and southbound Route 1 traffic. Additionally, a separate bus phase is
          provided for northbound right turns at Route 1 and South Glebe Road, which will add
          additional travel time. Therefore, overall there is slight increase in travel time in
          northbound direction.
         Segment C  Travel time for Segment C is not affected by exclusive busway as buses
          will travel in the mixed flow of traffic. Travel times will be similar for the No-Build and
          Build conditions in 2015, and again similar in 2030.

        Segment D - Due to provision of exclusive busway lanes in Segment D, travel times
         decrease significantly. In the 2015 scenarios, northbound travel will decrease by 1
         minute 22 seconds in the a.m. peak hour and 2 minutes 36 seconds in the p.m. peak
         hour.
         In the 2030 scenario, Segment D shows a decrease in travel time by 1 minute 2 seconds
         in the a.m. and slight increase in travel time during p.m. peak hour. This segment
         involves one additional signal phase for buses for northbound left turns at South Glebe
         Road and Potomac Avenue. Elsewhere along Segment D, the buses will run parallel to
         Crystal Drive and will therefore have less interference with other signalized intersections.

        Segment E  Due to provision of exclusive busway lanes in Segment E, travel times
         decrease significantly. The signal phase for buses at South Clark Street and 23rd Street
         South will run in parallel with the north-south phase on Route 1 resulting in additional
         green time for the buses as compared No-Build scenario.
         Travel time in the southbound direction will decrease by 4 minutes 9 seconds during the
         a.m. peak hour, and decrease by 9 minutes 32 seconds in the p.m. peak hour. This is
         the most congested segment in the 2015 No-Build scenario, mainly during the p.m. peak
         hour. The southbound approach at South Clark Street and 23rd Street South shows long
         queues in the 2015 No-Build Condition.
         In the 2030 scenario, Segment E shows decrease in travel time by 2 minutes 41
         seconds in the a.m. peak hour and 6 minutes 25 seconds in p.m. peak hour.
        Segment F  Future bus routing differs somewhat along this segment between No-Build
         and Build conditions, thus it is difficult to provide a balanced comparison of transit travel
         times for Segment F. In general, travel times will be comparable for the Build and No-
         Build conditions. During the a.m. peak hour, travel times for the Build conditions will be
         from 15 to 25 seconds longer than for the No-Build conditions; during the p.m. peak hour
         travel times for the Build conditions will be from 5 to 30 seconds shorter than for the No-
         Build conditions.

3.0 TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
The traffic analysis for the corridor includes data collection for existing traffic conditions,
projections of future conditions, and modeling of traffic operations. Results of the analysis
include an assessment of traffic delays and levels of service at 14 key intersections, shown in
Figure 3-1.

3.1      Existing Conditions
The Study Team conducted an extensive data collection effort to gain an understanding of
existing conditions in the study area. In addition to collecting data for the quantitative
assessment of existing conditions, the study team conducted field evaluations throughout the
study area during peak and off-peak hours to further assist in the assessment of existing
conditions. This section of the report summarizes the data collected for the study.
Traffic Volumes
In order to evaluate existing traffic conditions throughout the study area, the study team
collected turning movement counts at the following intersections in the City of Alexandria:
    1.        Route 1 and Evans Lane
    2.        Route 1 and E. Glebe Road
    3.        Route 1 and E. Custis Avenue
    4.        N. Henry Street and 1st Street
Additionally, the study team collected intersection counts at key locations throughout the study
area from recent studies conducted by the City of Alexandria and Arlington County. Most of the
counts were taken during the months of February, March, and April of 2005 and 2006. No traffic
was counted during holiday weeks or while public schools and universities were not in session.
Several of the key intersections will be constructed or reconfigured between the base year and
the model year as part of Potomac Yard development. Intersection 7 (Crystal Drive and Route 1
at 31st Street South), intersection 8 (South Glebe Road and Potomac Avenue), and intersection
13 are under construction and not open for traffic at the time of this analysis. Intersection 3
(South Bell Street at 15th Street South), intersection 10 (Route 1 at East Glebe Road),
intersection 11 (Route 1 at Swann Avenue), and intersection 12 (Route 1 at East Custis Street)
are currently three-legged intersections that are assumed reconfigured as four-legged
intersections in the future year analysis.

The turning movement traffic counts on all study intersections were treated as raw volumes.
Because of existing public and private parking locations throughout the study area, there were
minor discrepancies in the overall balance of traffic volumes. In order to improve the modeling of
existing traffic conditions, the study team applied standard traffic engineering techniques to
adjust the turning movement volumes at intersections where minor unjustified imbalances were
found.
Appendix F presents raw vehicular and pedestrian volumes. Appendix F presents balanced a.m.
and p.m. peak hour turning movements at key intersections for existing and future conditions.

Speed and Travel Times
In order to gain an understanding of driving patterns and to gather information needed to
develop the traffic model, the study team collected information on speed and travel times on key
corridors (May 16 to May 18, 2006).
Study team data collectors drove the Jefferson Davis Highway, Crystal Drive, South Bell Street,
and South Clark Street several times in each direction during both a.m. and p.m. peak hours,
and recorded the elapsed travel times at predetermined travel points and the distance between
the selected travel points. For the travel time runs, the data collectors traveled at the same
speeds as most of the vehicles traversing the study area. Appendix C contains detailed travel
time information for key roadway segments in the study area during a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

Modeling of Existing Conditions
Simulation modeling is used in transportation engineering as an analysis tool to assess existing
conditions and evaluate future alternatives over a specific period of time. The computerized
transportation model attempts to simulate traffic conditions along the described roadway links
coded into the model. The model parameters can be used to evaluate each intersection,
roadway link, and the entire study area. For this analysis, the study team developed simulation
models for the existing a.m. and p.m. peak hours in VISSIM. VISSIM is a stochastic
microscopic simulation program capable of modeling individual vehicle interactions on complex
roadway networks. VISSIM uses inputs such as lane assignments and geometries, intersection
turning movement volumes, vehicle speeds, percentages of vehicles by type, and pre-timed
and/or actuated signal timing to produce output that contains measures of effectiveness
commonly used in the traffic engineering profession, including total delay, stopped delay, and
queue lengths. The VISSIM models used in this study cover all roadway segments along the
planned transit alignment.
The base existing a.m. and p.m. peak hour models were completed in SYNCHRO traffic
software and then entered into the VISSIM model. The study team used current information on
corridor travel time and speeds to develop and calibrate the existing conditions models.
SYNCHRO was used to assist in the development of a model that accurately replicates signal
timings for all study area intersections.
The existing peak hour VISSIM models were simulated five consecutive times with randomly
selected seed values. Calibration tables were completed comparing the results from the
existing VISSIM simulation models to the measured travel times. As shown in Appendix C,
there is some segment by segment variability between simulated and field-observed travel
times. For the corridor as a whole, the existing conditions model shows simulated travel times
within 20 percent of the travel times observed in the field, which is an acceptable range for
simulation of complex urban arterial streets.

Existing Levels of Service
The Consultant used the VISSIM software results to calculate levels of service (LOS) and the
delay per vehicle for the intersections in the study area. The LOS evaluation uses a six-letter
grade scale (A to F) to rank the overall traffic handling ability of an intersection or a network
based on delay per vehicle. Appendix C contains detailed definitions of different levels of
service and their associated delays for both signalized and unsignalized intersections. LOS A
indicates free-flow traffic operations with minimal delays. LOS F represents failing conditions
with long delays.
During the a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour, most of the intersections in the study area are
operating at LOS D or better except Army Drive and South Eads Street intersection which
operates at LOS E during the p.m. peak hour.

3.2       No-Build Scenarios
Once the existing conditions are calibrated, the next step in preparing the simulation is to
develop No-Build traffic scenarios for the analysis years. Four important features of the No-
Build scenarios are:
         Operation of traffic signals,
         Planned geometric changes to existing intersections,
         Assumed transit network, and
         Traffic projections.
Traffic signals will be optimized using Synchro software for the future years. Several
intersections, particularly in the Alexandria portion of Potomac Yard, will be reconfigured from
"T" intersections to 4-legged intersections by 2015, and will be represented as such in the No-
Build model. As described above in Section 2.1, the operations plan for the 2015 and 2030 No-
Build scenarios matches the levels of transit service assumed for the Build scenarios.
The study team developed projections for traffic growth in the corridor using current MWCOG
traffic network assignment information. FTA staff has indicated that for the CE level of NEPA
documentation, analysis that focuses on intersection delays and levels of service would be
sufficient to measure the impacts of the transit improvements on traffic conditions. It would not
be necessary, therefore, to develop a customized traffic assignment model to approximate the
potential alternate paths for traffic in the corridor.
Based on the MWCOG traffic network, the project team developed growth factors and applied
them to current intersection turning movement counts to approximate 2015 and 2030 conditions.
The initial step included determining available trip assignment data relevant to the 14 key
intersections under study. This was accomplished by identifying each of the 14 intersections on
MWCOG trip assignment maps and determining how the MWCOG network relates nodes to the
subject intersections. Links associated with each relevant node were analyzed based on total
volumes.
Once the total volume for each node was determined for each analysis year, a rate of growth for
that node could be calculated. This was completed for both the AM and PK peak periods.
Projections from Wells Associates TIA studies are available for several intersections for 2016,
and these have been used in place of the 2015 projections where available. Projections of
turning movement volumes are detailed in Appendix D.

3.3      Build Scenarios
Once the No-Build scenario is coded in the simulation model, the Build scenarios are
developed. For the purposes of this analysis, the Build scenarios will include the following types
of model assumptions:
        Current alignment plans for the first phase of busway in Arlington;
        Alternative median-running and curb-running scenarios in new dedicated lanes along
         Route 1 in Alexandria;
        Changes to lane configurations and parking/loading locations for street segments along
         the busway where lanes will be dedicated for transit;
        Minor geometric changes at the 14 key intersections as a result of the proposed busway;
         and
        Adjustments to traffic signals to accommodate the transit alignment.
Simulations of Build scenarios will add bus lanes to No-Build simulations in VISSIM and reflect
other physical changes in the corridor as described above in Section 2.3. Comparisons
between the Build and the No-Build will focus on the differences resulting from operational
changes and roadway reconfigurations.
Even though the Build scenario will improve transit service and thereby increase corridor
ridership, the levels of vehicular traffic along the transit route will be assumed equal for the Build
as compared to the No-Build scenario. By using the No-Build traffic projections, we are
simulating the worst traffic situations and impacts on both transit and traffic operations for the
Build scenarios.
In reality, there would be some elasticity in the way drivers would choose routes where the
number of lanes has been reduced to accommodate exclusive transit lanes. Furthermore, it is
conservative to assume that the No-Build turning movements will be the same as the Build
movements: where the Build lane configuration removes travel lanes, the "No-Build equals
Build" assumption probably overstates the real volumes at many of the intersections.
The adopted MWCOG travel demand model does not reflect the street network within the study
corridor. If the study team coded the entire busway into the model, the reduction in auto traffic
volume would be marginal, but it is anticipated that vehicular traffic volumes (excluding buses)
over the 5-mile corridor would be reduced slightly as improved bus service would absorb a
portion of auto drivers.

3.4      Traffic Effects
Results of the simulation modeling show that there would be minor increases in traffic delay at
several intersections in the corridor along with decreases in delay at other intersections due to
implementation of the proposed transit service and busway. A few of the intersections studied
would be performing at very poor LOS by the analysis years 2015 and 2030, but the proposed
action would not degrade performance at these locations.
Tables 3-2 and 3-3 show the projected LOS for each of the 14 intersections studied. Detailed
tables that include forecast delay times at each intersection are included as part of Appendix E.
It is important to note that signal timings for the entire corridor were optimized separately for the
2015 and 2030 forecast years. While this procedure complicates direct comparisons of delay or
LOS at one intersection for 2015 and 2030, it minimizes overall delay for each scenario.

Traffic Effects by Segment
The effects of the planned transit service on vehicular traffic vary somewhat according to
location along the study corridor. At intersections (Segments A, C, and D) where buses will
transition between mixed traffic and exclusive lanes, additional signal phases for buses
contribute to minor increases in traffic delays as compared to the No Build scenario. Traffic
delays along Route 1 (Segment B) are not significantly affected by the introduction of exclusive
bus lanes, and delays are slightly worse for curbside transit lanes as compared with a median
busway. At congested intersections along Segment E exclusive lanes for buses help to
channelize automobile flow and reduce traffic delays over the No Build scenario. Already
congested conditions at intersections in Segment F will be comparable or slightly worse with the
introduction of transit lanes. Specific effects observed through the VISSIM simulation are
described below by segment based on intersection LOS results.
           Segment A  At intersections 13 and 14, delay and LOS vary little between the No-Build
            and Build scenarios. Under the median busway scenario at intersection 13, there would
            be a minor increase in delays in the 2015 a.m. and p.m. peak periods due to the signal
            phasing necessary to allow buses to enter and exit the median busway.
           Segment B  Along Route 1 at intersections 11 and 12, delay and LOS vary little
            between the No-Build and Build scenarios. Delays under the curbside bus lanes


Crystal City/Potomac Yard Corridor Transit Improvements Project                                                      Page 18
Transportation Effects Technical Memorandum                                                                     December 2006
         scenario would be slightly greater (and LOS is expected to be slightly worse) than for the
         median busway for the 2015 a.m. and p.m. peak periods.
        Segment C  At intersections 9 and 10, delay and LOS vary somewhat between the No-
         Build and Build scenarios. At intersection 10 buses transition to and from dedicated bus
         lanes on Route 1, requiring additional signal phases for both median busway and
         curbside bus lanes. In the 2015 a.m. peak period, average vehicle delays increase from
         17 seconds under the No-Build to 49 and 43 seconds respectively for the curb-running
         and median bus lanes. Likewise in the 2030 a.m. peak, delays increase from 23 seconds
         in the No-Build to 54 seconds in the Build scenario. Delays are less significant in the
         p.m. peak hour, with no notable change between No-Build and Build in 2015 and a slight
         increase (from 29 to 38 seconds) in 2030. Intersection 9, which is not directly along the
         transit corridor, exhibits the same general effects.
        Segment D  At intersections 7 and 8, delay increases slightly (with corresponding
         downgrading of LOS) between the No-Build and Build scenarios. Intersection 8, which is
         currently under construction, will be designed to accommodate a signal phase
         specifically for transit vehicles as they move between Potomac Avenue and the busway
         along South Glebe Road. Projected 2015 traffic delays would increase from about 5
         seconds per vehicle in the No-Build case to about 20 seconds in the Build cases; in
         2030 the difference between No-Build and Build delay is insignificant.
         At intersection 7 (Route 1/Crystal Drive and 33rd Street South) projected delays are at
         their highest in the 2015 p.m. peak hour, at about 60 seconds, but the level of delay is
         essentially the same for No-Build versus Build. In the 2015 a.m. peak, delays increase
         from 19 seconds for the No-Build case to about 36 seconds for both Build scenarios.
         Increases in delay between the 2030 No-Build and Build cases are insignificant.
        Segment E  Intersection 6 (South Clark Street and 23rd Street South) operates with
         about 70 seconds of delay per vehicle in the 2015 a.m. and p.m. peak No-Build cases,
         but actually improves in the Build cases to about 33 seconds of delay in the a.m. peak
         and 55 seconds in the p.m. peak period. In the 2030 scenarios there is also
         improvement from No-Build to Build, but the p.m. peak delays are very high: 172
         seconds per vehicle for the No-Build and 127 seconds for the Build.
         Intersection 5 shows slight increases in vehicle delay for the Build scenario in the 2015
         and 2030 a.m. peak and decreases in delay for the 2015 and 2030 p.m. peak.
         Intersection 4 shows slight increases in vehicle delay for the Build scenario in 2015 for
         both a.m. and p.m. peak hours, and similar slight increases for both peak hours in 2030.
        Segment F  Intersection 3, which will be reconfigured to allow transit vehicles to
         connect more directly to South Bell Street, shows no significant increases in delay for
         the Build scenarios.
         Intersection 2 shows slight increases in vehicle delay for the Build scenario in 2015 for
         both a.m. and p.m. peak hours, an insignificant difference between No-Build and Build in
         the 2030 a.m. peak, and a more pronounced increase (from 13 to 40 seconds) in the
         2030 p.m. peak hour. An additional signal phase is required at this intersection to allow
         buses to make a southbound left turn in the outside lanes from South Eads Street to 12th
         Street South. Intersection 1 uniformly operates at Level of Service E. For both No-Build
         and Build scenarios and for both model years, projected delay is 60 to 70 seconds per
         vehicle.

4.0 PEDESTRIAN EFFECTS
4.1      Existing and No-Build Conditions
Conditions for pedestrians vary widely along the project corridor. In general, streets where
existing bus service operates have sidewalks on both sides, and there are crosswalks at
existing intersections. Other pedestrian amenities include countdown timers at signalized
intersections and high visibility striping at crosswalks.
Many parts of the corridor are experiencing rapid change, with development being constructed
or in design along the planned transit alignment. Typically, the development projects include
generous sidewalks and landscaped areas that improve the pedestrian environment. Roadway
projects that are being planned for the corridor--for example along Route 1 and Potomac
Avenue in Alexandria and along Potomac Avenue, Crystal Drive, and 12th Street South in
Arlington--will include ample sidewalks, crossings, refuge areas, and landscaping to encourage
and better accommodate pedestrian trips.
Effects of the proposed transit improvements on pedestrian circulation are evaluated as part of
the modeling exercise. Pedestrian characteristics were studied specifically at 6 of the key
intersections:
     Arlington: 18th Street (#4), 23rd Street (#6), and South Glebe Rd./Potomac Ave. (#8)
     Alexandria: East Glebe Rd./Route 1 (#10), Custis Ave. (#12), and 1st St./N. Henry (#14)

4.2      Pedestrian Effects by Segment
Along the transit corridor, particularly near station stops, pedestrian improvements will include
restriped crosswalks, adequate sidewalks and ramps, and pedestrian countdown timers at
signals. Proposed stops along the busway are larger than typical bus stops, therefore they will
provide a safer and more comfortable waiting experience for transit patrons. All of these
improvements will lead to an enhanced pedestrian environment where transit passengers and
local pedestrian traffic will have improved access to buildings and amenities along the planned
transit route.
        Segment A  Here existing conditions are characterized by a pedestrian-scale
         environment on local streets. Even so, pedestrian counts at First Street and North Henry
         Street (intersection #14) show that current pedestrian traffic at this intersection is very
         light. The planned transit service and stop amenities, combined with sidewalk
         improvements around the stops, will help to make this portion of the corridor more
         desirable for pedestrians.
        Segment B  Conditions for pedestrians will improve with the planned transit investment.
         Planned reconstruction of Route 1 (part of a separate project) will include expanded
         sidewalks and crosswalks. The new configuration will provide for generous pedestrian
         refuge areas within the median of Route 1, and these refuge areas would be constructed
         with either a median busway or curb-side bus lanes.
         At Custis Avenue and Route 1 (intersection #12), the current light pedestrian activity is
         mostly along the west sidewalk of Route 1, with very few pedestrians crossing Route 1.
         With the planned service improvements and a new transit stop near Custis Avenue,
         pedestrian traffic will likely increase at this location.
         Pedestrian safety would likely improve with the planned improvements. The Build
         scenario includes passenger station stops and facilities which will draw attention to
         pedestrian activity along Route 1, whereas for the No-Build alternative, transit service

         would be comparable in intensity, but would lack the physical facilities to increase
         comfort and visibility for transit users.
        Segment C  In this segment, roadway reconfiguration and ongoing development will
         combine to improve pedestrian conditions. The transit project will include sidewalk
         expansion and ramps near station stops.
         At East Glebe Road and Route 1 (intersection #10) the planned transit improvements
         will include a special signal phase to aid movement of buses to and from the bus lanes.
        Segment D  In this segment, the existing pedestrian pathway along South Glebe Road,
         Route 1, and Crystal Drive will be relocated to the north and east of the planned busway.
         At intersections, crosswalks will be improved to provide high visibility pavement
         markings and pedestrian countdown signals will be installed at signalized intersections.
         The area (typically about 8 feet wide) between the busway and general travel lanes will
         serve as a pedestrian refuge area.
         At South Glebe Road and Potomac Avenue (intersection #8), bus traffic will require its
         own signal phase. Pedestrian phases at this intersection will correspond with the through
         automobile movements; the transit-only green phase will be accompanied by red signals
         for pedestrians.
        Segment E  Pedestrian conditions along this segment reflect the intensified land uses
         of central Crystal City. Sidewalks, high-visibility crosswalks, and pedestrian countdown
         timers exist at most intersections in this segment.
         South Clark Street at 23rd Street South (intersection #6) exhibits a complex traffic pattern
         and moderate pedestrian volumes. A tunnel beneath Route 1 and South Clark Street
         provides an alternative to the long Route 1 crossing distance. The planned station stop
         at the north leg of this intersection will include widened sidewalks and improved access
         to crosswalks and the pedestrian tunnel, improving access and safety for pedestrians.
         The planned service is expected to reinforce the importance of the Crystal City Metrorail
         station as a transfer hub for transit, with the result that pedestrian traffic at South
         Clark/South Bell Streets and 18th Street South (intersection #4) will likely intensify. For
         this reason, sidewalks and crosswalks will be adjusted where necessary to facilitate
         access between bus station stops and the Metrorail station. Traffic signals at this
         intersection will be adjusted to allow a pedestrians-only phase, allowing pedestrians to
         cross in all four directions while all traffic stops.
        Segment F  Pedestrian conditions along this segment vary somewhat. South Bell
         Street reflects the intensified land uses of central Crystal City. Sidewalks, high-visibility
         crosswalks, and pedestrian countdown timers exist at many intersections in this
         segment, but there are gaps in the pedestrian infrastructure at South Eads Street, and
         along 12th Street South. Planned station stops in these areas would include
         improvements to adjacent sidewalks and street crossings that would increase safety and
         comfort for transit users and other pedestrians.

5.0 PARKING AND ACCESS EFFECTS
5.1      Existing and No-Build Conditions
The study corridor is marked by urban land uses of commercial and residential character. In
general, residents, customers, and employees in the area have automobile access to buildings
by means of on- and off-street parking, though the supply of on-street parking is constrained by

Crystal City/Potomac Yard Corridor Transit Improvements Project                               Page 21
Transportation Effects Technical Memorandum                                              December 2006
traffic patterns, existing bus stops and taxi stands, and fire lane areas. Several buildings along
the corridor have loading and unloading areas adjacent to the project alignment. Truck access
at these areas affects traffic flow at widely varying intervals.

5.2      Parking and Access Effects by Segment
Effects on parking and access are documented below for each segment of the study corridor.
        Segment A The only measurable effect along this segment would be displacement of
         up to 10 on-street parking spaces along North Fayette Street with development of
         improved bus stops at this location.
        Segment B  While there is no on-street parking along this portion of Route 1, building
         access would affect or be affected by the planned transit improvements. Curb-side bus
         lanes could affect access to as many as ten businesses along the west side of Route 1
         between Howell Avenue and East Glebe Road. At these locations, design of the bus
         lanes, lane markings, and mountable lane barriers will ensure continued access to
         existing driveways. However, depending upon the design solution, the effects of
         continual access will be noted either in increased delays for traffic along Route 1 or
         slower travel times for buses. Deliveries may be restricted to off-peak times.
         The median busway would have no effect on access to businesses along Route 1, and
         may in fact improve access by transferring all bus traffic away from the curb areas near
         the existing access points.
        Segment C  No effects to parking or building access are expected along this segment.
        Segment D  Arlington County has mitigated parking and access effects in this segment
         through development plans. For example, new buildings in the southern portion of this
         segment (Potomac Avenue and South Glebe Road) will have off-street parking and off-
         street access points. Along the northern portion of this segment (Crystal Drive) new on-
         street parking spaces are part of the reconstructed street cross-section. Access to
         existing buildings on the west side of Crystal Drive is maintained, and there is a planned
         access point across the busway at the One Potomac Yard building near 26th Street
         South that will allow service to the building without long-term interruption of bus traffic.
        Segment E  This portion of the corridor is characterized by several areas of existing on-
         street parking and several existing loading areas. To provide sufficient width for two bus
         lanes, one lane for general traffic, and one parking lane, on-street parking will be
         displaced along the east side of South Clark Street between 26th and 23rd Streets South,
         as well as along a small portion of the west side of South Clark Street to accommodate a
         proposed station stop. North of 23rd Street South, the existing end-in parking (about 30
         spaces) will be converted to parallel parking (about 15 spaces) to provide sufficient width
         for two bus lanes and one lane of general traffic. Between 20th Street and 18th Street
         South, no effects on existing parking are anticipated.
         Each of the loading areas along this segment will be maintained as they currently exist.
         The busway will be delineated by pavement markings, and clearances along the busway
         will be enforced to restrict parked delivery vehicles to acceptable loading areas.
         Deliveries may be restricted to off-peak times.
        Segment F  This portion of the corridor is characterized by areas of existing on-street
         parking, off-street parking access points, and existing loading areas. To provide
         sufficient width for two bus lanes, and two lanes for general traffic, on-street parking will
         be displaced along the north and south sides of 12th Street South between South Bell

         Street and South Hayes Street. Existing on-street parking along both sides of South
         Eads Street will also be displaced for approximately one block to the north and south of
         12th Street South to accommodate two bus lanes, two lanes for general traffic, and a left
         turn pocket.
         Buses currently use the curb lanes along South Bell Street immediately north of the
         Crystal City Metrorail station as layover areas. With the planned transit improvements,
         layover will take place elsewhere, likely to the west along 18th Street South or South
         Hayes Street. Each of the loading areas along this segment will be maintained as they
         currently exist. The busway will be delineated by pavement markings, and clearances
         along the busway will be enforced to restrict parked delivery vehicles to acceptable
         loading areas. Deliveries may be restricted to off-peak times.

Transit Operations Plan Validation
                          Transit Operations Plan Validation
             Based on New Round 7.0 Population and Employment Forecasts
                                Summary of Analyses


Introduction

The ridership estimates that were utilized in the development of the operating plan for the Potomac
Yard/Crystal City Transit Implementation Plan were based on model runs completed by HNTB for the
original corridor Alternatives Analysis. This ridership modeling was based on MWCOG's Round 6.3
Population and Employment forecasts. Since the completion of the original ridership estimates MWCOG
has adopted a new set of regional population and employment forecasts, known as Round 7.0.

As one of the first steps in completing the Documented Categorical Exclusion for the full set of transit
improvements within the Potomac Yard/Crystal City corridor, a check of the potential impacts to the
Implementation Plan (Phase 1) operating plan resulting from changes in corridor population and
employment between Rounds 6.3 and 7.0 was completed.

Three analyses were completed to determine if changes in population and employment between the two
Rounds would result in significant changes in the ridership estimates and would thus warrant changes in
the operating plan developed as part of the Implementation Plan. If the analyses show that no changes in
the operating plan are required, the operating plan completed in the last project phase would remain valid
for the impacts analysis completed for the Documented Categorical Exclusion. The three analyses either
comparing Rounds 6.3 and 7.0 or utilizing data from trip tables based on the Round 7.0 forecasts are
outlined below in Sections 1 through 3.

1.     Comparison of Change in Population and Employment between 6.3 and 7.0 (Attachment 1)

This analysis compared population and employment changes between Rounds 6.3 and 7.0 and then
used assumptions regarding the percent of the population making trips and mode split to translate
population and employment changes into a change in corridor transit trips. This analysis was done for
future years 2015 and 2030. This analysis showed that there was not a significant enough change
in trips (based on changes in population and employment) to warrant modification of the
operating plan. A detailed description of the process used in this analysis is included as Attachment 1.

2.     Analysis of Round 7.0 Trip Table Productions and Attractions (Attachment 2)

This analysis utilized a total person trip table based on MWCOG Round 7.0 population and employment
forecasts to calculate total person trips, production and attraction mode splits, and productions from the
project area and attractions into the project area. Specifically, total productions from each traffic analysis
zone (TAZ) in the project area to one of four concentric rings around the project area were developed.
(The concentric rings outside the project area comprised all of the TAZs within a ring a specific distance
from the project area  for instance the first ring incorporates all TAZs between 0 miles from the outer
edge of the project area to 2 miles from the edge of the project area. The second ring encompasses all
TAZs between 2 and 5 miles from the edge of the project area, the third ring 5-10 miles, and the fourth
ring is everything beyond 10 miles from the edge of the project area). A transit mode split for productions
from the project area was also calculated and applied to total project area productions in order to
calculate project area transit productions. These productions were factored down to peak hour transit trips
and the peak hour load at the peak load point and compared to the ridership estimates used to develop
the Phase 1 operating plan. This comparison was used to assess whether modifications to the Phase 1
operating plan were required. A similar analysis was completed for attractions. The analysis showed
that there were not significant enough changes in peak hour ridership and loadings at the peak
load point to warrant a change in the Phase 1 operating plan. Detailed descriptions of the process
used in both analyses are included as Attachment 2.

3.     Analysis of Growth in Trips between Round 6.3 and Round 7.0 Trip Tables (Attachment 3)

This analysis utilized a growth rate in trips between a trip table based on the Round 6.3 population and
employment forecasts and a trip table based on the Round 7.0 population and employment forecasts.
The growth rate calculated was then applied to the ridership estimates utilized in the Phase 1 analysis,
which came from the original corridor Alternatives Analysis, to develop a daily ridership number based on
Round 7.0 trips. This daily ridership number was factored down to get the number of passengers on
board buses at the peak load point in the peak hour and in the peak direction. The number of trips and
headways required to meet this peak hour demand at the peak load point were then calculated and
compared to the original service plan developed in Phase 1. The analysis showed that there were not
enough changes in peak hour ridership and loadings at the peak load point to warrant a change in
the Phase 1 Operating Plan. A detailed description of the process used in this analysis is included as
Attachment 3.

                             Phase 1 Operations Plan Check
           Comparison of Round 6.3 and 7.0 Population and Employment Forecasts


Analysis Purpose: To determine whether the change in forecasted population and employment between
Rounds 6.3 and 7.0 would require modifications to the operations and service plan developed in Phase 1
of the project.

Key Findings: There are changes in population and employment but these changes do not generate
enough change in the number of trips to warrant modifications to the service plan developed in Phase 1.

Analysis Process

1.       Phase 1 Ridership Numbers  Based on Original Corridor Alternatives Analysis Model
         Runs:
         2015      27,925
         2030      32,143

2.       Process Step 1: Calculate change in riders based on changes in Population and Employment
         between Round 6.3 and Round 7.0. In this step, the change in population within project area
         TAZs (which represent origins in the analysis) was used to determine the additional trips that
         would result from a change in project area population. The first step was to apply a factor to
         reflect the percent of the total population change that would actually be making a trip (the
         factoring assumed that 85% of the population within the project area would actually make a trip
         on any given day). This change in population was further factored down to reflect transit mode
         split (mode split was obtained from the Dulles Corridor Travel Demand Forecasting Technical
         Report). Employment, which represents attractions into the project area, was also factored down
         based on mode split (also obtained from the Dulles Corridor Travel Demand analysis). The
         calculations are outlined below:

         Project Area Population change (origins) (6.3 vs. 7.0)  Translation to Ridership

           Year         Change        Percent Making Trip         Origin Mode Split     Change in Riders

           2015        -15,810                  27%                        -4,269
           2030        -23,198                  32%                        -7,423

         Total ridership change:
         2015 -3,622
         2030 -4,021

3.       Process Step 2: Calculate New Daily Ridership. New daily ridership was calculated by
         subtracting the ridership declines developed in step 1 above from the total daily ridership
         numbers used in the first phase of the project. The results are shown below.

         2015      24,303 (27,925  3,622)
         2030      28,122 (32,143  4,021)

4.       Process Step 3: Convert Daily Ridership to Peak Load Point Estimate. This process step
         translates the new total daily ridership calculated in the previous steps into a peak load estimate,
         for use in assessing whether modifications to the phase 1 operations plan are required. The
         calculation is based on three different factoring steps. The first step is to calculate the percent of
         total daily ridership that occurs in the peak hour (estimated at 12.6%). The next step is to further
         factor this peak hour ridership by calculating the percent of peak hour ridership that is traveling in
         the peak direction (estimated at 60%). The final calculation is a calculation of the total peak
         direction ridership that is on the vehicle at the peak load point (this was estimated at 90% of peak
         hour/peak direction ridership). The specific calculations are as follows:

         Analysis Year 2015

             Peak hour Ridership (12.6% * 24,303) = 3,062
             Peak hour/peak direction ridership (60% * 3,062) = 1,837
             Peak direction peak load point (90% * 1,837) = 1,654 (estimated downward from 1,900 in
              previous study)

         Analysis Year 2030

             Peak hour Ridership (12.6% * 28,122) = 3,543
             Peak hour/peak direction ridership (60% * 3,062) = 2,126
             Peak direction peak load point (90% * 1,837) = 1,913 (peak load point was not estimated for
              2030 in the original study)

5.       Process Step 4: Demand based Service Plan comparison. This step compares the original
         ridership estimates from the Service Implementation Plan (Phase 1) to the new ridership
         calculations outlined above to determine required changes, if any, in the original operations plan.
         The analysis is outlined below.

             Phase 1 service plan - # of trips per hour and headways
                 o 1,900 (passengers at peak load point during peak hour)/60 (acceptable vehicle
                     loading) = 32 trips in the peak hour
                 o Headways = 60 minutes/32 trips = 1.9 minutes

             New 2015 service plan - # of trips per hour and headways
                 o 1,654 (passengers at peak load point during peak hour)/ (acceptable vehicle loading)
                    = 28 trips in the peak hour
                 o Headways = 60 minutes/28 trips = 2.1 minutes

6.       Analysis Final Result: No changes in service plan are required based on this analysis.

Calculation of change in Population and Employment Round 6.3 vs. Round 7.0


The tables outlined below show the changes in forecasted population and employment between Rounds
6.3 and 7.0, for the corridor, for the base year of 2005, the full build year of 2015, and the horizon year of
2030. The rate of growth is also shown for three time periods, 2005 to 2015, 2015 to 2030, and 2005 to
2030.

Note that population is projected to be higher and increase faster between years in Round 7.0 than
estimated in Round 6.3. Likewise, employment is also projected to increase faster, though overall
employment numbers will be lower. These observations are illustrated in the graphs following the tables.

                                                                             Rate of Growth

                                        Analysis of Round 7.0 Trip Table

Analysis Purpose: Utilize trip data from a trip table generated based on Round 7.0 population and
employment forecasts to determine if the Phase 1 operating plan, based on ridership estimates generated
using the Round 6.3 forecasts, remains valid.

Key Findings: The analysis of trips from the project area (productions) based on a trip table generated
using the 7.0 forecasts shows that there is a small difference in the number of peak hour trips required to
meet peak hour demand in 2015, but that the difference is small enough that changes in the operating
plan are not warranted.

Analysis Process

1.       Process Step 1: Calculate productions from the project area by analysis year and by destination
         concentric ring. In this step the Round 7.0 trip table was used to identify trip productions from the
         project area to each of three concentric rings that are based on distance from the outer edge of
         the project area. The first ring represents all of the TAZs in a ring from the edge of the project
         area to 2 miles from the outer edge of the project area. The second ring represents all of the
         TAZs between 2 and 5 miles from the outer edge of the project area and the third ring represents
         all of the TAZs between 5 and 10 miles from the outer edge of the project area. Project area
         productions were identified for the years 2005, 2015, and 2030.

         All project steps are shown in Worksheet 1, below.

2.       Process Step 2: Calculate the non-auto mode split for productions for each analysis year and
         each concentric ring. In addition to total productions from the project area, project area
         productions by mode were also extracted from the Round 7.0 trip table. With this data, the non-
         auto mode split was calculated for productions from the project area for each analysis year and
         concentric ring.

3.       Process Step 3: Calculate project area non-auto trip productions based on total trips and non-
         auto mode split. In this step the non-auto mode split calculated in the previous step was applied
         to total project area trip productions in order to calculate non-auto project area productions.

4.       Process Step 4: Calculate project area peak hour non-auto productions based on factoring down
         of total daily non-auto project area productions. In this step the total daily non-auto productions
         calculated in the previous steps were factored down to calculate non-auto peak hour productions.
         This factoring assumed non-auto peak hour productions were 12.6% of total daily non-auto
         productions.

5.       Process Step 5: Calculate percent of non-auto productions that are traveling in the peak
         direction. This step accounts for the fact that not all productions within the project area will travel
         in the peak direction. However, because the majority of major destinations are north of the project
         area (Pentagon, remainder of Arlington, downtown Washington), which represents the morning
         peak direction, this factoring assumes that 90% of peak hour non-auto productions travel in the
         peak direction.

6.       Process Step 6: Calculate percent of peak direction trips that are on bus at peak load point. This
         step is the final factoring to take into account that not all riders getting on a bus in the peak
         direction will still be on at the bus at the peak load point (some riders make shorter trips and get
         off at stops before the bus is at its fullest).

Transit Operations Plan Validation
7.       Process Step 7: Calculate trip requirements and headways. This step calculates the number of
         trips required to meet demand, based on an acceptable load of 60 passengers per bus.

8.       Process Step 8: Follow same process for attractions to determine peak load in the non-peak
         direction. This process is outlined in Worksheet #2 below.

9.       Analysis Final Result: No changes in service plan are required based on this analysis.


Note:    The analysis of productions contained in Worksheet #1 below assumes that all project area
         productions in the peak direction utilize the new service. An alternative approach is included in
         Worksheet #3. The analysis approach used in Worksheet #3 is the same as followed in
         Worksheet #1, except that a further assumption regarding the percent of non-auto project area
         productions that board the new corridor premium service as opposed to other transit services in
         the corridor was used. The assumption was that the share of non-auto trips that use the premium
         service was assumed to be 75% of all non-auto trips. With regard to the comparison to the Phase
         1 Operations Plan, the result of this alternative analysis shows that 24 trips (2.45 minute
         headway) would be required to meet demand at the peak load point in 2015, versus the 32 trips
         based on the analysis contained in Worksheet 1 and the 32 trips contained in the Phase 1
         analysis.

                      Analysis of Trip Growth Rates between Round 6.3 and 7.0
                                             Trip Tables


Analysis Purpose: To determine whether the growth rate in project area trips between trip tables based
on Round 6.3 to Round 7.0 population and employment forecasts respectively, when applied to the
predicted daily ridership utilized in Phase 1, would warrant modifications to the Phase 1 operations and
service plan?

Key Finding: No significant changes in service plan are required based on the analysis outlined below.

Analysis Process

1.       Available Data:

         Total Person Trips, for Round 6.3 and Round 7.0 population and employment forecasts, for each
         TAZ within the project area. These are trips within the project area, out of the project area, and
         into the project area. Trips in and out of the project area are between the project area and a
         series of concentric rings, with each ring representing a distance from the outer edge of the
         project area (ring 1 represented all TAZs between the outer edge of the project area and 2 miles
         from the outer edge of the project area; Ring 2 encompasses all TAZs between 2 and 5 miles and
         ring 3 represents all TAZs between 5 miles and 10 miles. The data was available for the analysis
         year 2030.

2.       Process Step 1: In this step the percent increase in total person trips between Round 6.3 and
         Round 7.0 was calculated. The percent increase in all total person trips between Round 6.3 and
         Round 7.0 was 1.5 percent, a slight bump that would not influence the service operation plan.
         However, more detailed examination revealed that total person trips within the project corridor
         would increase by 11.8 percent, a more relevant number and one more likely to affect service
         operations. Therefore this percentage increase

3.       Process Step 2: In this step, the calculated growth rate from the previous step was applied to the
         total daily ridership utilized in the Phase 1 study. This ridership data came from the original
         Corridor Alternatives Analysis. The calculation is shown below:

         Phase 1 Ridership                       Increased by growth rate
         2015 27,925                             29,572 (5.9% increase   the 2030 11.8% increase  no data
                                                 for 2015 was available for the Round 6.3 dataset)

         2030      32,143                        35,936 (11.8% increase)


4.       Process Step 3: This step involved converting daily ridership calculated in the previous step into
         peak hour loadings at the peak load point. The method to calculate the peak load point is based
         on a series of factors that translates total daily ridership into peak hour ridership and then into
         loadings at the peak load point. The first step is the calculation of the percent of total daily
         ridership that occurs in the peak hour (12.6%). In the second step, the percent of this peak hour
         ridership that is traveling in the peak direction is then calculated (60%). Finally, the last factor,
         which represents the percent of peak hour, peak direction riders who are on the bus at the peak
         load point, is applied (90%). The results for 2015 and 2030 are outlined below.

         2030               2,445

5.       Process Step 4: In this step the required service levels to meet the demand at the peak load
         point calculated in the previous step were developed. Based on the peak load point loads for
         2015 calculated in this analysis, 33 trips would be required in the peak hour, based on an
         acceptable load of 60 persons per vehicle. This translates into a headway of 1.8 minutes (in the
         Phase 1 study, trip requirements and headways were calculated for 2015 only). This compares
         to 32 required trips at a 1.9 minute headway developed in the Phase 1 analysis for 2015.

6.       Final Result: No changes in the Phase 1 service plan is required based on the analysis
         contained in this attachment.

Background
The Documented CE must present the effects of proposed transit service on traffic
operations within the project corridor.
The traffic analysis focuses on effects at 14 key intersections along the corridor. The
major products of the traffic simulation will be estimates of delays and/or levels of
service (LOS) at each key intersection for the baseline and "build" scenarios in 2015 and
2030.
For most of the key intersections, current count data is available. At a few of the
intersections--specifically those that are scheduled to be reconfigured during the next
several years--"data" consists of projected turning movements for 2010.


Methodology
This memo outlines the steps taken to complete two tasks of analyzing the traffic
volumes within the project corridor and analyzing the turning movements that occur at
intersections along the corridor.
The DMJM Harris ITS group is developing a model of the current traffic conditions in the
corridor that will be used mainly for calibration. Once the model accurately reflects
current conditions, it may be adjusted to approximate conditions in 2015 and 2030.
The 2005 model makes use of existing turning movement counts and signal timing data,
all of which are available at ten of the key intersections. At the four remaining
intersections:
        33rd Street/Crystal Drive/Route 1,
        South Glebe Rd./Potomac Ave.,
        Route1/Swann Ave., and
        Route 1/Potomac Ave.,
all of which are either under construction or to be reconfigured during development of
Potomac Yard, projections from traffic impact studies will be used in place of actual
counts.
Making use of the network assignment information provided by AECOM Consult, DMJM
Harris will adjust the 2010 turning movement projections at these locations to reflect
2005 traffic levels. This will require calculation of 2005 to 2010 growth factors for
relevant roadway links and applying them (in reverse) to the 2010 projections.
2015 and 2030 build conditions
Again, using the traffic network assignment information, DMJM Harris will develop
growth factors for 2005 to 2010, 2010 to 2020, and 2020 to 2030 for all of the roadway
links in the corridor that are adjacent to the key nodes or intersections. In collaboration,
the project team will consider the changes in traffic volumes along the links and apply
appropriate growth factors to the intersection turning movements to approximate 2015
and 2030 conditions.

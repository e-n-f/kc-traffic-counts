EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the findings of a traffic review conducted for Somerset Coral Gables
University Baptist Church (UBC) campus located at 624 Anastasia Avenue, Coral Gables,
Florida. The site currently operates as a private school, day care, religious educational center
and church. On January 24, 2012, the City of Coral Gables approved Conditional Use and Site
Plan Applications for the operation of a public charter school at the UBC campus with an
increase in student enrollment from 110 students to 260 students. The new charter school
opened for the fall semester in August 2012. The continued operation of this charter school was
contingent on maintaining specific traffic operating conditions as specified in the Declaration of
Restrictive Covenants approved on August 14, 2012. This traffic review was prepared in
accordance to provisions contained in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants. The review
provides an evaluation of the post opening Traffic Operatiions Plan at the UBC campus and
assesses compliance with traffic stipulations contained in the restrictive covenants.

The results of the analyses conducted for this traffic review indicate that traffic operations at the
UBC campus, with current enrollment of 260 students, are in substantial compliance with the
stipulations contained in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants. Specifically, it has been
determined that the following conditions are in compliance:

    1. No charter school associated vehicles shall backup or accumulate, or park on any
       surrounding rights-of-way/streets as a result of student arrivals/dismissals and/or any
       other school related operations, functions or activities.
    2. All street intersections analyzed as part of the Applicant's submitted traffic study shall
       meet the respective levels of service identified in the report.

Based on the findings from the Post Opening Traffic Review, it is our considered opinion that
the two (2) shifts for arrivals/dismissals are adequate to accommodate the current enrollment of
260 students at the UBC Campus. It is further concluded that the Traffic Operations Plan that
was previously reviewed by RS&H and approved by the City Commission is adequate for the
current enrollment of 260 students.

1.0    INTRODUCTION

This report documents the findings of a traffic review conducted for Somerset Coral Gables
University Baptist Church (UBC) campus located at 624 Anastasia Avenue, Coral Gables,
Florida (shown in Figure 1). The site currently operates as a private school, day care, religious
educational center and church. On January 24, 2012, the City of Coral Gables approved
Conditional Use and Site Plan Applications for the operation of a public charter school at the
UBC campus with an increase in student enrollment from 110 students to 260 students. The
new charter school opened for the fall semester in August 2012. The continued operation of
this charter school was contingent on maintaining specific traffic operating conditions as
specified in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants approved on August 14, 2012. This traffic
review was prepared in accordance to provisions contained in the Declaration of Restrictive
Covenants. The review provides an evaluation of the post opening Traffic Operations Plan at
the UBC campus and assesses compliance with traffic stipulations contained in the restrictive
covenants.

2.0    METHODOLOGY FOR TRAFFIC REVIEW

The traffic operations review was conducted consistent with the methodology followed for the
Applicant's Traffic Impact Study & Accumulation Assessment dated October 5, 2011. The
review included the following:

      1. Recording all vehicles entering and exiting the campus on two typical school days
         (Tuesday, September 25, 2012 and Wednesday, October 10, 2012) during arrival and
         dismissal periods (7:30 AM ­ 9:30 AM and 1:30 PM ­ 3:30PM, respectively).
      2. On the same days and times as the vehicle counts identified in Item-1, recording vehicle
         accumulation data consistent with the methodology followed for the surrogate school,
         Doral Academy, in the Applicant's Traffic Study & Accumulation Assessment dated
         October 5, 2011. This survey also recorded parked vehicles during this time. This data
         was used to determine the maximum accumulation for the arrival and dismissal shifts.
      3. Recording turning movement volumes at the intersection of Segovia Street and
         Anastasia Avenue on a typical weekday (September 25, 2012) during school arrival
         (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and dismissal (1:30 PM to 3:30 PM) periods. This data was used
         to conduct level of service (LOS) analysis for this intersection.
      4. Observing and recording the Traffic Operating Plan for the school including the efficiency
         of the "platooning" for student arrival/dismissal shifts; management of pedestrian
         activities; and the frequency and operations of the traffic contingency plans.




                                                                                                 3

3.0      TRAFFIC OPERATIONS PLAN

The traffic operations plan applicable at the time of this study were:

          Total school enrolment = 260
          School arrivals: Two arrival shifts at 8:00 AM and 8:30 AM as detailed in Table 1.
          School dismissals: Two dismissal shifts at 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM as detailed in Table 2.
          Traffic Circulation Plan: One-way clockwise traffic circulation as detailed in Figure 2. In
          addition to the circulation pattern shown in Figure 2, vehicles were prohibited from
          entering the school campus directly making the following consecutive movements:
          eastbound left turn from Riviera Drive onto Cardena Street followed by right turn at the
          school entry. During the two site traffic reviews, this restriction was manually enforced
          during arrival and dismissal periods.

4.0   DATA COLLECTION

The following sections describe information gathered from field reviews at the school campus
conduced during school arrival (7:30 AM to 9:30 AM) and dismissal (1:30 PM to 3:30 PM)
periods on September 25, 2012 and October 10, 2012.

4.1 Traffic Circulation Plan
On site field observations confirmed that operations at the school campus were organized in
accordance with the traffic circulation plan presented in Figure 2. Approximately 5 to 9 school
staff members were posted at the designated pick-up/drop-off area to assist in ushering
students in and out of vehicles in a safe and efficient manner (see Figure 2). Furthermore,
additional staff was posted at strategic points to guide and assist drivers and to enforce
compliance with the traffic circulation plan (see Figure 2). One staff member was posted at the
campus entry point to manually restrict any direct access to the campus for left turning traffic
coming from Riviera Drive. Traffic cones were also placed along Cardena Street at the exit point
from the school campus to restrict exiting traffic to right-turns only onto Cardena Street.
Additional cones were placed on Cardena Street at its intersection with Anastasia Avenue.
These cones were deployed in a manner to prohibit traffic entering Cardena Street from
Anastasia Avenue and enforcing the one-way traffic circulation plan. The traffic circulation plan
was maintained throughout the school arrival and dismissal periods.

4.2 Accumulation Assessment
An accumulation assessment study was conducted to evaluate queuing activities on the school
campus during arrival and dismissal periods. The study was conducted following the Miami-
Dade County methodology, consistent with the procedures followed by Richard Garcia and
Associates, Inc. in preparing the related Traffic Impact Study and Accumulation Assessment
Report, dated October 5, 2011. The data collected for the accumulation assessment was
recorded in one-minute time increments. During each one-minute interval, a record was made
of the accumulated queue within the stacking area (and beyond, if applicable). The data
recorded from the accumulation study is documented under Appendix A. Table 3 provides a
summary of the maximum queues recorded during the study. As shown in Table 3, the
maximum queues recorded for September 15, 2012 were 17 vehicles during the AM arrival
period and 10 vehicles during the PM dismissal period. The maximum queues recorded on
October 5, 2012 were 16 vehicles during the AM arrival period and 9 vehicles during the PM
dismissal period. These observed maximum queues lengths were well within the available
stacking space (approximately 29 vehicles) on the site. As a result, no queue overflows were
observed on Cardena Street. At no time was it necessary to exercise any contingency plan to
accommodate traffic within the school campus. Further, no vehicles were observed parked on
any surrounding streets as a result of any school related activities.

Platooning of vehicles within the traffic area was observed and noted during the arrival and
dismissal periods. Throughout the majority of the AM arrival period, reasonable platoons were
achieved. On the other hand, during the PM peak period, platoons were rarely achievable.
Notwithstanding, the lack of platoons did not result in any traffic queues spilling onto the
adjacent streets.
                                                                                               7 
 
   


  In gathering information for the accumulation assessment study, data was also collected for
  vehicles approaching the school entry point after making a left-turn maneuver from Riviera Drive
  onto Cardena Street. These results are reported alongside the accumulation data in Appendix
  A. The data shows a maximum of 10 vehicles attempting this maneuver during the 2-hour AM
  arrival period and 14 vehicles during the 2-hour PM dismissal period. These volumes represent
  approximately 4% of the traffic entering the school during arrival and dismissal periods. These
  very low volumes suggest that there is good compliance from parents/guardians with regards to
  the restriction imposed on this movement during arrival and dismissal periods.

      Note: On-site stacking capacity = 29 vehicles



  4.3 Traffic Counts
  Turning movement counts were collected at the intersection of Segovia Street and Anastasia
  Avenue on Tuesday, September 25, 2012 from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 1:30 PM to 3:30
  PM. The counts were collected in 15 minute increments. Appendix B contains detailed
  tabulations from the traffic count. Table 4 provides a summary of the traffic counts for the AM
  and PM peak hours.

5.0   LEVEL OF SERVICE

The peak hour traffic counts reported in Table 4 were used for conducting intersection level of
service (LOS) analyses. The LOS analyses were performed in accordance with the Highway
Capacity Manual, 2000 Edition. Computations were executed using Synchro, Version 7
software. Signal timings used for the analyses were per data gathered from Miami-Dade
County (see Appendix C). Detailed output sheets from the level of service analyses are
contained under Appendix D and results are summarized in Table 5.

Results from the level of service analyses indicate that all movements at the intersection of
Segovia Street and Anastasia Avenue operate at LOS C or better during both AM and PM peak
periods with the current enrollment of 260 students. The overall intersection operates at LOS B
during the AM peak and LOS A during the PM peak. These operating conditions are well within
the acceptable LOS D standard. Additionally, no extensive queues are shown on any of the
approaches at the intersection. These results are consistent with observations made during
field reviews at the site.

6.0   COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT:               POST     OPENING      REVIEW      vs.   APPLICANT'S
      TRAFFIC STUDY

The accumulation assessment from the UBC Campus post opening review reported a maximum
measured queue of 17 vehicles in the AM peak and 10 vehicles in the PM peak. These
accumulations resulted from the school's current enrollment of 260 students and utilizing two
arrival and dismissal shifts. In comparison, the Accumulation Assessment submitted by the
Applicant assumed three arrival and three dismissal shifts. Per the Applicant's Phase I
assessment with 260 enrolled students, the projected accumulations were 3.82 passenger
vehicles in the AM peak and 16.26 vehicles during the PM peak period.

In the level of service analyses for the post opening review, it was determined that all
movements at the intersection of Segovia Street and Anastasia Avenue operate at LOS C or
better during both AM and PM peak periods with the current enrollment of 260 students. The
overall intersection operates at LOS B during the AM peak and LOS A during the PM peak. In
comparison, in the traffic study performed by the Applicant it was estimated that this intersection
would operate at LOS D following the opening of the new charter school. This comparative
assessment indicates that the LOS determined from the post opening review is better than the
LOS estimated from the Applicant's Traffic Study.
                                                                                                  9 
 
 


7.0      CONCLUSIONS

The analyses conducted for this traffic review indicate that traffic operations at the UBC
Somerset campus, with current enrollment of 260 students, are in substantial compliance with
the stipulations contained in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants. Specifically, it has been
determined that the following conditions are in compliance:

      1. No charter school associated vehicles shall backup or accumulate, or park on any
         surrounding right-of-way/streets as a result of student arrivals/dismissals and/or any
         other school related operations, functions or activities.
      2. All street intersections analyzed as part of the Applicant's submitted traffic study shall
         meet the respective levels of service identified in the report.

Based on the findings from the Post Opening Traffic Review, it is our considered opinion that
the two (2) shifts for arrivals/dismissals are adequate to accommodate the current enrollment of
260 students at the UBC Campus. It is further concluded that the Traffic Operations Plan that
was previously reviewed by RS&H and approved by the City Commission is adequate for the
current enrollment of 260 students.

The UBC Traffic Operations Plan currently restricts direct access to the school for vehicles
making a left turn from Riviera Drive during assembly and dismissal periods. This restriction is
currently manually enforced by school staff. It was observed that the manual enforcement can
lead to congestion along Cardena Street as staff members often spend an extended time period
talking with the offending drivers while access is blocked for other road users on Cardena
Street. To alleviate this issues, it is recommended that drivers violating this turn restriction be
allowed to enter the school campus. Thereafter, staff members can have necessary
discussions with the offending drivers when their vehicles are safely on Campus and not
obstructing other road users along Cardena Street.

Consideration was also given to the option of installing eastbound left turn restriction signs at
the intersection of Rivera Drive and Cardena Street in order to address the issue regarding
drivers trying to directly enter the Campus after make a left turn from Rivera Drive.
Implementation of the left turn restriction signs is not recommended for the following reasons:

          The turn restriction signs would unduly impact road users that are not affiliated with
          operations at the UBC Campus.
          The left turn restriction at Cardena Street may encourage additional traffic use along
          Palmarito Street as it would be a most convenient detour route due it its proximity to the
          site. Palmarito Street is a narrow alleyway and any potential increase in traffic may
          result in safety concerns along the alleyway.

 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND DISMISSED

 In-Street Segment Alternatives Dismissed

 Alignment Option 1: Promenade and Beach Street

 Description of Alternative. Alignment Alternative Option 1 would use more of the historic State Belt
 Railroad alignment than any other of the alternatives. See Figure A-1 for an illustration of the
 alignment option.

 Westbound. This alignment alternative would begin from the existing streetcar tracks at Jefferson
 Street and Jones Street within the historic State Belt Railroad alignment, and continue westbound on
 Jefferson Street in a single-track configuration. The alignment option would continue within the
 historic State Belt Railroad alignment along the Promenade, past the Maritime Museum, through the
 Fort Mason Tunnel, to a terminal at Fort Mason.

 Eastbound. In the eastbound direction, this alignment alternative would travel through the Fort Mason
 Tunnel, and then transition on the east side of the tunnel from the historic State Belt Railroad
 alignment at Van Ness Avenue southward to Beach Street via one of the transition segment options,
 through NPS property, in a single track configuration. Alignment Option 1 would continue east on
 Beach Street, crossing the Hyde Street cable car line at grade, and then rejoin the existing F-line tracks
 at Beach Street and Jones Street.

 Turnback. A "turnback" track would be included on Leavenworth Street between Jefferson Street and
 Beach Street, to allow streetcars to turn back in the event of blockage without affecting streetcars at the
 F-line terminal on Jones Street.

 Configuration. Portions of the alternative alignment would be configured to operate either in exclusive
 or semi-exclusive trackway or in mixed traffic.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. Option 1 was not consistent with park management
 objectives because it would use the waterfront Promenade for its alignment, thereby creating significant
 affects to the NHLD by splitting the district and introducing new visual elements to the NHLD, as well as
 creating streetcar conflict with existing high pedestrian and bicycle traffic on the Promenade. The
 Promenade/Bay Trail through Aquatic Park is also subject to storm wave over wash. This alternative was
 ultimately dismissed due to both infeasibility and its conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

 Alignment Option 2: Victorian Park and Beach Street

 Description of Alternative. Alignment Option 2 is similar to Alignment Option 1 as far as Jefferson
 Street and Hyde Street in the westbound direction (see Figure A-1).

 Westbound. At Jefferson Street and Hyde Street, instead of continuing on the Promenade, this
 alternative alignment would leave the historic State Belt Railroad alignment, turn southward and
 continue at an angle through Victorian Park, reaching Beach Street approximately mid way between
 Larkin Street and Polk Street, where it would turn westward onto Beach Street. From this point, the
 alignment would be double track on Beach Street. The double track alignment would continue

 between Beach Street and the east portal of the Fort Mason Tunnel through NPS property parallel to
 Van Ness Avenue via one of the transition segment options, switching to single track for the Fort
 Mason Tunnel, and continuing to a terminal at Fort Mason.

 Eastbound. In the eastbound direction, the alignment would travel through the Fort Mason Tunnel
 and then transition from the historic State Belt Railroad alignment at Van Ness Avenue southward to
 Beach Street in a double-track configuration via one of the transition segment options. The alignment
 would continue east on Beach Street, crossing the Hyde Street cable car line at grade, and then rejoin
 the existing streetcar tracks at Beach Street and Jones Street.

 Turnback. A turnback switch would be provided at the point where the westbound track through
 Victorian Park meets the eastbound track on Beach Street midway between Larkin Street and Polk
 Street.

 Configuration. Portions of the alignment would be configured to operate either in semi-exclusive
 trackway, or in mixed traffic.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This option resulted in adverse affects to the National
 Historic Landmark District, by introducing new visual elements to the NHLD. This alignment did not
 meet park preservation criteria including: the potential to cause a physical effect on Aquatic Park
 National Historic Landmark District; potential for visual, noise or other impacts to historic and
 cultural facilities; and the potential to require the use of parkland for a non-park use since the
 alignment would cut through Victorian Park. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to its
 conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

 Alignment Option 4: North Point via Tunnel

 Description of Alternative. Alignment Option 4 is a streetcar alternative, see Figure A-2. This
 alignment option would provide more avoidance of the park property than Alignment Options 1, 2
 and 3. Additionally, this alignment option differs from Alignment Options 1, 2 and 3 in that it would be
 configured to operate in both directions on North Point Street between Jones Street and Van Ness
 Avenue and would operate in the Van Ness Avenue ROW between North Point Street and the tunnel.

 Westbound. This alignment option would begin at Jefferson Street and Jones Street, and turn south
 onto Jones Street, parallel to the existing F-Line terminal track. The track would continue south on
 Jones Street to North Point Street, and the alignment option then would turn west onto North Point
 Street. Because of the existing F-line terminal on Jones Street, this alignment option would require two
 southbound tracks on Jones Street to allow the Fort Mason streetcars to bypass streetcars at the F-line
 terminal, and because of track geometry limitations. This alignment option would also require two
 separate station platforms on Jones Street between Jefferson and Beach Streets, because of the parallel
 tracks. One platform would be for streetcars terminating at Jones Street and would be located at the
 curbside on the west side of Jones Street. The second platform would be for streetcars continuing
 through to Fort Mason. This platform would be located towards the middle of Jones Street.

 The alignment option would then curve west onto North Point Street. The alignment then would
 continue in a double track configuration on North Point Street to Van Ness Avenue, where the
 alignment would turn north on Van Ness Avenue. The alignment along Van Ness Avenue switches to
 single track close to the tunnel portal, and continues through the tunnel to a terminal at Fort Mason.

 Eastbound. From the terminal at Fort Mason, this alignment option would begin as single track
 through the tunnel, then switch, double track east of the tunnel portal and would use the same path
 travelling westbound as far as Jones Street and Beach Street, where the eastbound track turns east onto
 Beach Street to rejoin the existing streetcar tracks. Portions of the alignment that are in public street
 ROW could be configured to operate either in semi-exclusive trackway, or in mixed traffic.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. The San Francisco MTA Office of Health and Safety
 requested the elimination of Alignment Option 4: North Point via Tunnel from further consideration.
 San Francisco MTA stated that operation of the historic streetcar on Van Ness Avenue between North
 Point Street and the Fort Mason Tunnel would be "unacceptably hazardous" for a number of reasons,
 including conflicts with bicycle traffic and other transit operations, historic streetcar capability with
 regard to street grade, special trackwork and trackwork curvature, loading platforms and operating in
 mixed traffic (SFMTA 2006). This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to infeasibility.

 Alignment Option 4A: North Point via Bay

 Description of Alternative. Alignment Option 4A is a streetcar alternative that responds to a comment
 card submitted at the May 9, 2006 Public Scoping Meeting that suggested using Bay Street in order to
 minimize impacts to parkland (see Figure A-2). It is similar to Alignment Option 4 as far as North Point
 Street and Van Ness Avenue, but differs in that it would not use the Fort Mason Tunnel between Van
 Ness Avenue and Fort Mason, but instead would use Bay Street.

 Westbound. This alignment alternative is the same alignment as Alignment Option 4 east of Van Ness
 Avenue (as described above). From North Point Street and Van Ness Avenue the double track
 alignment would turn south on Van Ness Avenue to Bay Street, west on Bay Street to Laguna Street,
 north on Laguna Street to Marina Boulevard, to a terminal at Fort Mason.

 Eastbound. This alignment option would be double track in configuration, therefore in the eastbound
 direction, this alignment would use the same path travelling westbound as far as Jones Street and
 Beach Street, where the eastbound track would then turn east onto Beach Street to rejoin the existing
 F-Line streetcar tracks. Portions of the alignment that are in public street ROW would be configured
 to operate either in semi-exclusive trackway, or in mixed traffic.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative received a very low rating for operability.
 This alternative posed potential for conflict with major bike or pedestrian flows, and did not directly
 serve NPS facilities. There was also concern with streetcars stacking up at Jones Street before
 continuing on to Fort Mason Center. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to both infeasibility
 and its conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

Alignment Option 5: Motor Coach via Bay

Description of Alternative. Alignment Option 5 is a motor coach alternative that would be an extension
of the current Muni 10-Townsend local bus line (see Figure A-2). The 10-Townsend currently operates
from the Caltrain Terminal to North Point Street and Van Ness Avenue via Transbay Terminal, and the
Sansome/Battery couplet. The buses operate on North Point Street from the Embarcadero to Van Ness
Avenue, and terminate on Van Ness Avenue north of North Point Street.

Westbound. This alignment would extend the westbound (inbound) 10-Townsend via Van Ness
Avenue, Bay Street and Buchanan Street to Fort Mason.

Eastbound. In the eastbound direction, the alignment option would travel from Fort Mason onto
Marina Boulevard, Laguna Street, Bay Street, Van Ness Avenue, and rejoin the existing 10-Townsend
route at Van Ness Avenue and North Point Street.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. Option 5 was dismissed during the initial stages of the
Feasibility Study because it did not respond to the purpose of the project of providing a mass transit
rail connection. This alternative scored low in the alternatives screening for its ability to connect NPS
sites directly to traffic generators along the northern waterfront cultural and recreation corridor and
would not connect directly to the current historic streetcar. The motor coach alternatives would also
be associated with higher air quality impacts which made this alternative less desirable. Another
concern with the 10-Townsend is that its schedule is more limited than the F-line, it ends service at
8:00 p.m. There was also a concern that expanding service on the 10-Townsend to match F-Line
service would be too costly because transfers from the F-line to the 10 required out of direction
movement that would cause drops in ridership and many tourists would not know where to go to
make this transfer. Lastly, SFMTA's Transit Effectiveness Project recommendations propose
discontinuing the 10-Townsend in the future. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to both
infeasibility and its conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

Alignment Option 5A: Motor Coach via Tunnel

Description of Alternative. Alignment Option 5A is a motor coach alternative that would be an
extension of the current 10-Townsend local bus line from the current terminal at Van Ness Avenue
and North Point Street, similar to Alignment Option 5, except that if would operate via the Fort Mason
Tunnel between Van Ness Avenue and Fort Mason instead of Bay Street. Figure A-3 illustrates
Alignment Option 5A. This alignment option would require the installation of two special systems 
the first would be a ventilation system in the tunnel that could evacuate the motor coach exhaust to a
safe level and maintain the air quality. The second would be a signal system that would control access
to the tunnel for buses so that only buses going in one direction could enter the tunnel at a time, and
also provide spacing between buses in the same direction. This type of signaling system is common in
rail applications, but is not a standard item for motor coach operations.

Westbound. This alternative would extend the westbound (inbound) 10-Townsend via Van Ness
Avenue continuing northward and through the Fort Mason tunnel, terminating at Fort Mason.

Eastbound. In the eastbound direction, the alignment option would be configured to operate in the
reverse of the westbound route, as described above.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative was rated low in the alternatives
screening for its ability to connect NPS sites directly to traffic generators along the northern
waterfront cultural and recreation corridor and would not connect directly to the current historic
streetcar. This alternative was also rated low for operability. Another concern with the 10-Townsend is
that it ends service at 8:00 p.m. Lastly, SFMTA's Transit Effectiveness Project recommendations
propose discontinuing the 10-Townsend in the future. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to
both infeasibility and its conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

Alignment Option 6: Trolley Coach via Tunnel

Description of Alternative. Alignment Option 6 is a trolley coach alternative that consists of a new
trolley coach line connecting to the current F-line at Jones Street and Beach Street, see Figure A-3.
This alignment option requires the construction of new overhead trolley coach wire, except where the
alignment uses existing trolley coach wire on North Point Street between Columbus Avenue and Van
Ness Avenue. Like the Alignment Option 5A, this alignment option would also require a signal system
that would control access to the tunnel for buses so that only buses going in one direction could enter
the tunnel at a time, and also provide spacing between buses in the same direction.

Westbound. In the westbound direction, the line would operate from the current terminal of the F-line
at Jones and Beach Streets via Jones Street, Jefferson Street, Leavenworth Street, North Point Street,
and Van Ness Avenue to the Fort Mason Tunnel, and then to a terminal at Fort Mason.

Eastbound. In the eastbound direction, the line would operate the reverse of the westbound route
(described above) to North Point Street and Leavenworth Street, and then continue on North Point
Street to Jones Street, then via Jones Street to the terminal at Beach Street.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative did not meet the purpose of the project
of providing a mass transit rail connection. It did not meet the purpose and need criteria for its ability
to connect NPS sites directly to traffic generators along the northern waterfront cultural and
recreation corridor and it does not connect directly to the current historic streetcar, nor would it
increase ridership to NPS sites or improve connectivity for transit-dependent residents. This
alternative was ultimately dismissed due to both infeasibility and its conflict with the purpose and need
of the project.

Alignment Option 6A: Trolley Coach via Bay

Description of Alternative. Alignment Option 6A is a trolley coach alignment that consists of a new
trolley coach line connecting to the current F-line, see Figure A-3.

Westbound. This alignment option is similar to Alignment Option 6 east of Van Ness Avenue, but
reaches Fort Mason via Van Ness Avenue, Bay Street, Buchanan Street and Marina Boulevard instead
of via the Fort Mason Tunnel.

Eastbound. In the eastbound direction, it would operate via Marina Boulevard, Laguna Street, Bay
Street, Van Ness Avenue, and rejoin the existing route at Van Ness Avenue via North Point Street to
Jones Street, then via Jones Street to a terminal at Beach Street.

 Streets and the Van Ness Avenue portal of the Fort Mason Tunnel, in an area known as the
 "transition."

 Transition Segment #E-3A (1)

 Description of Alternative. Transition Segment Option #E-3A(1) would stretch from the Fort Mason
 tunnel east portal to Polk Street in an inverted S-curve shape. The design proposes a double-track
 alignment with an interlocked track at the entrance to the Fort Mason tunnel (Figure A-4). This
 option would accommodate a dual-side platform station, which would be located parallel to the
 existing retaining wall on the Van Ness Avenue. The existing retaining wall would not be impacted due
 to the placement of the platforms and the alignment, (unlike Transition Segment Option #2); however,
 some modifications might be necessary. Under this alignment, the existing bocce court on NPS
 property (at the western end of Beach Street) would have to be removed and relocated to
 accommodate the streetcar tracks.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. The transition segment #E-3A (1), developed for the
 Feasibility Study, was refined in consultation with the project's TAC and other stakeholders.
 Transition Segment #E-3A (1) and Transition Segment #E-3A(2) were combined, renamed the
 Transition Segment Area and are now part of the proposed project.

 Transition Segment #E-3A (2)

 Description of Alternative. Transition Segment Option #E-3A(2) would stretch from the Fort Mason
 tunnel east portal to Polk Street in an inverted S-curve shape. The design proposes a double-track
 alignment with an interlocked track at the entrance to the Fort Mason tunnel, similar to Option 1
 (Figure A-4). This option would accommodate a dual-side platform station, which would be located
 parallel to the existing retaining wall on Van Ness Avenue, north of Option 1 platforms. The existing
 retaining wall would be substantially impacted due to the platform and alignment design, compared to
 Transition Segment Option #2. However, the existing bocce court on NPS property (at the western
 end of Beach Street) would not be removed and relocated.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. The transition segment #E-3A (2), developed for the
 Feasibility Study, was refined in consultation with the project's TAC and other stakeholders.
 Transition Segment #E-3A (1) and Transition Segment #E-3A(2) were combined, renamed the
 Transition Segment Area and are now part of the proposed project.

 Aquatic Park Transition Segment B2

 Development of Alternative. This alternative was developed following revisions to the #E-3A (1)
 and (2). California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regulations precluded locating the switch (the
 transition between double tracks and single tracks) in the sidewalk area due to the high volume of
 bikes in the area. SFMTA staff suggested that the optimal location would be on the east side of Van
 Ness Avenue not in the street ROW or in the sidewalk area. SFMTA staff recommended that the
 westbound platform near Van Ness Avenue be moved to the far side of the walkway so that the
 platform would be closer to the end of the double track. The NPS preferred to transition the single
 track east of Van Ness Avenue to avoid intersecting the Bay Trail.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. The Transition Option B2 design located the switch on
 the west side of Van Ness Avenue, the westbound platform was sited inside the contributing area of
 the Aquatic Park NHLD and the tracks intersected with the Bay Trail creating such unsafe conditions
 for pedestrians and bicycles that a detour of the bay trail was required. Option B2 was not promoted
 by members of the public or agencies. It did not conform to SFMTA or San Francisco Maritime NHP
 management objectives and was not supported by the TAC for technical reasons.


 Turnaround Segment Alternatives Dismissed

 Turnaround Option 1: Fort Mason Loop

 Description of Alternative. The turnaround option, as shown on Figure A-5, would be in the Fort
 Mason Center parking lot, east of the Fort Mason gates. The turnaround option would operate in a
 counter-clockwise loop and would bisect the parking control gates as well as cross over the historic
 trackwork (known as the Ladder Tracks). The turnaround option would have a minimal footprint, in
 comparison to Turnaround Option 2 and would include a spur track for layovers and storage. The
 turnaround option includes two platforms: a boarding platform to the east of the storage track, which
 would be sized for one streetcar, and a passenger drop-off platform on the eastern side of the loop
 which could accommodate two streetcars.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative presented potential for conflict with
 automobiles, bicycle or pedestrian flows and had the potential to affect existing park facilities and
 operations. It was also vulnerable to delay and had potential for interference with traffic flow/patterns
 in an already congested area. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to both infeasibility and its
 conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

 Turnaround Option 2: Fort Mason Short Loop

 Description of Alternative. This Option would be a loop north of the existing trackway, in the current
 Fort Mason parking lot, but shorter than Option 1, with less room available for cars. One platform
 would be provided. A storage track would be created extending west from the loop, adjacent to the
 Guardhouse.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This option lacks an outbound drop off platform and a
 layover area. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to operational concerns.

 Turnaround Option 4: East-West Loop

 Description of Alternative. The turnaround option consists of a large counter-clockwise loop within
 Fort Mason Center parking lot on NPS property, as shown on Figure A-5. The turnaround option
 would have one platform and a storage track, which would extend to Laguna Street on the historic
 State Belt Railroad alignment. In contrast to most of the other turnaround options, the platform would
 be oriented east-west instead of north-south.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative was rated low because of technical
 problems and failure to meet park management objectives because of high potential for visual, noise,
 or other adverse impacts on NHLD; potential for conflict with automobile, bicycles or pedestrian
 flow; and the utility of turnaround track after extension. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due
 to both infeasibility and its conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

 Turnaround Option 5: North Wye

 Description of Alternative. This turnaround option is named for its ("wye") shaped track north of the
 main running track, as shown in Figure A-5. The turnaround option would be in the Fort Mason gates
 on NPS property, and has a minimal footprint that would avoid the historic ladder tracks, but would
 offer no storage capability. There would be two platforms  one on the historic State Belt Railroad
 alignment close to Laguna Street for boarding and the other south of the historic ladder tracks for
 alighting.

 Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative was eliminated from further
 consideration because the "wye" turnaround options do not meet SFMTA's operational requirements.
 Adequate car capacity was a concern with this alternative. Additionally, compared to the terminal loop
 options, the "wye" configurations would have higher costs associated with the track switch
 maintenance, and require the streetcars to move through the switches six times (versus two times with
 a loop option). The increase in movements through the switches would also increase the probability
 for track switch failure or overhead contact system failure (SFMTA 2009b). This alternative also lacks
 layover or storage tracks. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to infeasibility.

 Turnaround Option 6: North Wye  Two Tracks

 Description of Alternative. This turnaround option is named for its "wye" shaped track north of the
 main running track, and additional storage track to the south, as shown on Figure A-5. The turnaround
 option would be in NPS property and would avoid the historic ladder tracks. There would be three
 platforms associated with this turnaround option: one on the historic State Belt Railroad alignment,
 adjacent to Laguna Street for boarding, one south of the historic State Belt Railroad alignment,
 adjacent to Laguna Street for boarding, and one on the northern tip of the "wye" shaped track for
 alighting. The existing retaining wall on the southern side will need to be moved to accommodate the
 third track. The turnaround option would require a retaining wall and additional earth-moving
 activities to accommodate the second track. This option differs from Turnaround Option 5 in that it
 would allow for an extra car at the terminal.

(SFMTA 2009b). This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to infeasibility.

Turnaround Option 7: South Wye

Description of Alternative. This turnaround option is named for its "wye" shaped track to the south
of the main running track, as shown on Figure A-6. The turnaround option would be on NPS property
and would not have a storage track. There would be two platforms, one on the historic State Belt
Railroad alignment adjacent to Laguna Street for alighting; the other would be on the southern tip of
the "wye" shaped track for boarding. This option would require a curved retaining wall across the
existing Bay Trail. Considerable earth moving and grade change would be required.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative was eliminated from further
consideration because the "wye" turnaround options do not meet SFMTA's operational requirements.
Additionally, compared to the terminal loop options, the "wye" configurations would have higher

switches six times (versus two times with a loop option). The increase in movements through the
switches would also increase the probability for track switch failure or overhead contact system failure
(SFMTA 2009b). This option also lacks a layover area, storage tracks, and does not have enough room
if a car needed to be towed. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to infeasibility.

Turnaround Option 9: Fort Mason Gate Loop

Description of Alternative. This turnaround option is a counter-clockwise loop using the Gas House
Cove parking lot for both directions and going through the Fort Mason gates, as shown on Figure A-6.
This turnaround option would not be on NPS property but would offer storage capability for a
streetcar through a double-track design on the northern side of the loop. There would be one platform
on the northern side of the loop for boarding and alighting.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative was rated low for failing to meet the
following park management criteria: sensitivity of resources; potential for conflict with automobile,
bicycle or pedestrian flows; affect on existing park facilities and operations. In addition it was rated
low for loss of parking as it would cut through a large section of parking spaces at Fort Mason and
public safety. This option is lacking a second platform for loading or needs a layover area. This
alternative was ultimately dismissed due to both infeasibility and its conflict with the purpose and need
of the project.

Turnaround Option 10: Safeway Loop

Description of Alternative. This turnaround is a clockwise loop around the Safeway block within city
street ROWs (Laguna Street, North Point Street, Buchanan Street, and Marina Boulevard), as shown
on Figure A-6. This turnaround option does not include a storage track. Two platforms would be on
the NPS property on the historic State Belt Railroad alignment, adjacent to Laguna Street. This option
would require the installation of a rail-to-rail crossing at the intersection of Marina Boulevard and
Laguna Street.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This option did not provide direct access to Fort Mason.
Potential problems with this alternative included traffic delays caused by Safeway delivery trucks on
North Point Street behind Safeway and by mail delivery trucks blocking Buchanan Street. This
alternative was dismissed based on a low rating in the screening process. This option lacks storage
tracks. This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to both infeasibility and its conflict with the
purpose and need of the project.

Turnaround Option 11: Marina Loop

Description of Alternative. This turnaround option was initially presented at the public scoping
meeting as Turnaround Option 2. The turnaround option would be a counter-clockwise loop using
Gas House Cove parking lot (outbound), with inbound track on south side of Marina Boulevard
(Figure A-7). The turnaround option would include a double track storage track on the northern side
of the loop. There would be two platforms  one on the northern side of the loop and one on the south
side of the loop near the corner of Marina Boulevard and Laguna Street. This design option would
require the installation of switches and rail to rail crossings at the intersection of Marina Boulevard
and Laguna Street; it would also require a signal at the intersection of Marina Boulevard and Buchanan
Street, for the streetcars to exit the Gas House Cove parking lot.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative was dismissed based on a low rating
because it failed to meet park management objectives. This option resulted in adverse affects to the
National Historic Landmark District, by introducing new visual elements to the NHLD. This
alternative also had public safety concerns, loss of parking and low public support. This alternative was
ultimately dismissed due to its conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

Turnaround Option 12: Small Marina Loop

Description of Alternative. This turnaround option is a clockwise loop that would use the northern
side of Marina Boulevard for outbound direction, with a loop in Gas House Cove parking lot, as
shown on Figure A-7. This turnaround option would not be on NPS property. A storage track would
be to the north of the platform. The turnaround option would require the installation of switches at
the intersection of Marina Boulevard and Laguna Street, and would require streetcars to run reverse to
the street traffic on Marina Boulevard for a short segment, protected by all-way red signals.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative received a low rating in the screening
process. This alternative also had public safety concerns, loss of parking and low public support. In
addition, having only one platform in this option presents a problem with streetcar layover. This
alternative was ultimately dismissed due to its conflict with the purpose and need of the project.

Fort Mason Turnaround: Modified North Wye  Two Tracks  Option RL

Description of Alternative. This turnaround option is a slightly modified version of Turnaround
Option 6: North Wye  Two Tracks (see Figure A-7). The turnaround option would be a "wye" shaped
track to the north of running track, with a separate double-sided runaround or storage track to the
south of the main track. Compared to Turnaround Option 6, the retaining wall would be in a different
location stretching south of the tracks. The platform configuration for this turnaround option is less
confusing for passengers than Turnaround Option 6. This turnaround option would be on NPS
property and designed to avoid the historic ladder tracks. It requires some earth-moving to expand the
ROW to accommodate a second track. It could also affect the Bay Trail.

Reasons for Dismissal from Further Study. This alternative was eliminated from further
consideration because the "wye" turnaround options do not meet SFMTA's operational requirements.
Additionally, compared to the terminal loop options, the "wye" configurations would have higher
costs associated with the track switch maintenance, and require the streetcars to move through the
switches six times (versus two times with a loop option). The increase in movements through the
switches would also increase the probability for track switch failure or overhead contact system failure
(SFMTA 2009b). This alternative was ultimately dismissed due to infeasibility.

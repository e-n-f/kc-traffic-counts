Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed mixed-
use development located at 101 Lytton Avenue in Palo Alto, California. The project consists of
51,479 s.f. of office space, 1,499 s.f. of retail/café use, and 6 residential apartment units. The
project would replace an existing service station, which is not in operation. Access to the proposed
project is provided via Alma Street.
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the City of Palo Alto, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
Congestion Management Program (CMP), and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
The traffic analysis is based on peak hour levels of service for six signalized intersections and two
unsignalized intersections. The traffic analysis also includes an evaluation of peak-hour signal
warrants for the unsignalized intersections. Traffic conditions at the study intersections were
analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The AM peak hour of traffic is
generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00
PM. It is during these periods that the most congested traffic conditions occur on an average day.

Project Trip Generation & Distribution
Project trip generation was estimated by applying to the size and uses of the development the
appropriate trip generation rates published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in
Trip Generation, 8th Edition. A pass-by trip reduction of 43 percent (based on ITE rates) was
applied to the AM and PM peak hour trip generation estimates for the cafe use. Pass-by-trips are
trips that would already be on the adjacent roadways (and are therefore already counted in the no
project traffic) but would turn into the site while passing by. Per VTA TIA guidelines, a 3 percent
mixed-use trip reduction was applied to account for internalization of trips due to the interaction
between the office and retail uses. Since the project site also will be located near the Palo Alto
Caltrain Station, a transit reduction of 3 percent was applied to the office component. After
applying the appropriate trip reductions (passby, mixed use, and transit), the project would
generate 892 net new daily trips, with 162 net new trips occurring during the AM peak hour and
167 net new trips occurring during the PM peak hour. The directional distribution of site-generated
traffic to and from the project area was developed based on a select zone analysis from the Valley
Transportation Authority Travel Demand Forecast Model, existing travel patterns on the
surrounding roadway system, and the locations of complementary land uses.




                                                                                   iii | Page

Existing Plus Project Intersection Signalized Levels of Service
The results show that, measured against City of Palo Alto and Valley Transportation Authority
Congestion Management Program level of service standards, all of the signalized study
intersections would continue to operate adequately with the addition of project traffic. The level of
service results for the study intersections under existing plus project conditions are summarized in
Table ES 1.

Cumulative Signalized Intersection Levels of Service
The results show that, measured against City of Palo Alto and Valley Transportation Authority
Congestion Management Program level of service standards, all of the signalized study
intersections would continue to operate adequately under cumulative conditions with the addition
of project traffic. The level of service results for the study intersections under existing plus project
conditions are summarized in Table ES 1.


Unsignalized Intersections
Under existing conditions, vehicles southbound on Alma Street making a left turn onto University
Avenue (north ramp) must do so from the left-most through lane. Under existing conditions, there
are approximately 37 PM peak hour vehicles that perform this movement. With the proposed
project, the demand would increase to 56 PM peak hour vehicles. Left turn movements from
through lanes should be avoided when feasible because of the increased likelihood of rear end
collisions.
       Recommendation: The proposed project would add a significant number of southbound left
       turns at the intersection of Alma Street/University Avenue (north ramp). Left turns are
       currently made from the left-most through lane. The project should make a fair share
       contribution toward the installation of a southbound left turn pocket at this location.
The intersection of Alma Street/University Avenue (south ramp) would expereince LOS F on the
minor street approach and meet the peak hour traffic signal warrant under existing, near term
cumulative, and far term cumulative conditions with or without project traffic. In these situations,
Cities may consider the installation of a traffic signal appropriate. However, there are many other
criteria the City of Palo Alto may consider before committing to a traffic signal at this location,
including (but not limited to) the avalibility of alternate routes and the proximety of nearby traffic
signals.
       Recommendation: If the City decides to install a traffic signal at the intersection of Alma
       Street/University Avenue (south ramp), a fair share contribution from the project applicant
       towards the traffic signal would be appropriate.

Site Access and Circulation
This section describes the site access and circulation of the proposed project. This review is based
on a project site plan prepared by Korth Sunseri Hagey Architects dated April 20, 2011. Overall, it
is anticipated that the project's garage access would operate acceptably and would be typical of
that of a development in an urban setting with structured parking. However, the review produced
the following recommendations:

         Truck access and loading would not be provided onsite because of the project's onsite
         parking structure. Provisions for truck loading for deliveries or garbage collection are not


                                                                                        iv | Page 
101 Lytton Avenue ­ Traffic Analysis Report                                                      May 13, 2011 


        shown on the current plan. Prior to final design, the truck access and loading should be
        reviewed by City staff for adequacy.

        Landscaping is not shown on the current plan. Although there are no sight distance
        conflicts shown on the current plan, the project's driveway should be reviewed by City staff
        prior to final design to insure the proposed project driveway's sight lines are free and clear
        of obstructions. In addition, the garage driveway design should be reviewed in detail to
        make sure that vehicles exiting the site can see pedestrians. It may be necessary to have
        a warning light and audible pedestrian signal device.

        Prior to final design, City staff should review the onsite circulation in the project's parking
        structure to insure that the drive aisle widths are sufficient to accommodate project traffic.
        In addition, staff should evaluate the need for mirrors (particularly at the site's first 90
        degree turn) to provide adequate sight distance onsite.

replace an existing service station, which is not in operation. Access to the proposed project is
provided via Alma Street. The project site and the surrounding study area are shown on Figure 1.

Scope of Study
This study was conducted for the purpose of identifying the potential traffic impacts related to the
proposed development. The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the
standards set forth by the City of Palo Alto, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
Congestion Management Program (CMP), and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
The traffic analysis is based on peak hour levels of service for six signalized intersections and two
unsignalized intersections. The study intersection locations were selected based on the anticipated
travel patterns of project traffic and the operating levels of the nearby intersections. The traffic
analysis also includes an evaluation of peak-hour signal warrants for the unsignalized intersections.
The study intersections are identified below.

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours
of traffic. The AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak
hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the most congested
traffic conditions occur on an average day.
Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following scenarios:
   Scenario 1:    Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes are based on traffic counts provided
                  by city staff and new manual turning movement counts.


                                                                                       7 | Page

   Scenario 2:    Existing plus Project Conditions. Existing traffic volumes with the project
                  (hereafter called existing plus project traffic volumes) were estimated by adding to
                  existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the project. Project
                  conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in order to determine
                  potential project impacts.

   Scenario 3:    Near Term Cumulative Conditions. Near term cumulative no project traffic
                  volumes assume a horizon year of 2013. Year 2013 traffic volumes were
                  calculated by applying a 1.4 percent growth factor to existing traffic volumes. The
                  growth factor was derived from an analysis of the City's traffic model. Near term
                  cumulative with project traffic volumes were estimated by adding to near term
                  cumulative no project traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the
                  project.

   Scenario 4:    Far Term Cumulative Conditions. Far term cumulative no project traffic volumes
                  were developed for target year 2025. The 1.4 percent growth factor was also
                  utilized in determining 2025 traffic volumes. Far term cumulative with project
                  traffic volumes were estimated by adding to far term cumulative no project traffic
                  volumes the additional traffic generated by the project.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario
described above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and
the applicable level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from new traffic counts, the City of Palo Alto, and
field observations. The following data were collected from these sources:

    existing traffic volumes
    existing lane configurations
    signal timing and phasing (for signalized intersections)
    the City of Palo Alto travel demand forecast model volumes

Level of Service Standards and Analysis Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of
Service is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow
conditions with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The
various analysis methods are described below.

Signalized Intersections
All of the signalized study intersections are located in the City of Palo Alto and are therefore subject
to the City of Palo Alto level of service standards. The City of Palo Alto evaluates level of service at
signalized intersections based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) level of service
methodology using TRAFFIX software. This method evaluates signalized intersection operations on
the basis of average control delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX also is
the CMP-designated intersection level of service methodology, the City employs the CMP default
values for the analysis parameters. The City of Palo Alto level of service standard for signalized
intersections is LOS D or better. Table 1 shows the level of service definitions for signalized
intersections. One of the study intersections is a CMP intersection and, therefore, also is analyzed
according to the CMP requirements. The CMP level of service methodology is the same as that
used by the City of Palo Alto, except that the CMP level of service standard for signalized
intersections is LOS E or better.

                                                                                        9 | Page

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the green
     A      phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to the very        10.0 or less
            low vehicle delay.

            Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle
     B      lengths. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average            10.1 to 20.0
            vehicle delay.

            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number
     C                                                                                               20.1 to 35.0
            of vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the intersection
            without stopping.

            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may
            result from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle
     D                                                                                               35.1 to 55.0
            lenghts, or high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and
            individual cycle failures are noticeable.

            This is considred to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
     E      generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume-         55.1 to 80.0
            to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occure frequently.

            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
            often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
     F                                                                                            greater than 80.0
            capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also
            be major contributing causes of such delay levels.

Unsignalized Intersections
Level of service at unsignalized intersections was based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual
(2000 HCM) method. TRAFFIX software is used to apply the 2000 HCM operations method for
evaluation of conditions at unsignalized intersections. This method is applicable for both two-way
and all-way stop-controlled intersections. The delay and corresponding level of service at
unsignalized, stop-controlled intersections is presented in Table 2. For two-way and four-way stop
controlled intersections, the reported LOS represents the average delay of all intersection
movements.

Signal Warrant Methodology
The level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is supplemented with an assessment of
the need for signalization of the intersections. This assessment is made on the basis of signal
warrant criteria adopted by Caltrans. For this study, the need for signalization is assessed on the
basis of the operating conditions at the intersections (i.e., level of service) and on the peak-hour
volume signal warrant ­ warrant #3 ­ described in the 2010 California Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD). This method provides an indication of whether traffic conditions and
peak-hour traffic levels are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal.

Intersection Queuing
The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand movements at intersections.
Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the
probability of "n" vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:
Probability (X=n) =       n e ­ (
                             n!
Where:
         Probability (X=n) = probability of "n" vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         Average number of vehicles in queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
         per hour)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate
the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement;
(2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length,
assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the
existing or planned available storage capacity for the movement.

2.
Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities near the
site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via US 101.
    US 101 is a north/south freeway that extends from San Francisco through San Mateo and
    Santa Clara Counties. In Palo Alto, US 101 is eight lanes wide, including two HOV lanes (one
    in each direction). University Avenue provides access to and/or from US 101.
    El Camino Real is a major six-lane arterial extending from Daly City in the north to Santa Clara
    in the south. In the vicinity of the project site, El Camino Real is six lanes divided by a median.
    El Camino Real provides access to the project via Alma Street and University Avenue.
Local access to the site is provided by Lytton Avenue, Alma Street, University Avenue, Middlefield
Road, and Sand Hill Road. These roadways are described below.
    Lytton Avenue is a two-lane, east-west, roadway that extends from Alma Street to Seneca
    Street to the east where it becomes Palo Alto Avenue. Lytton Avenue is the southern border of
    the project site and provides access to residential and commercial uses.
    Alma Street is primarily a four-lane, north-south, roadway that extends from San Antonio Road
    to Lytton Avenue. It continues north of Lytton Avenue as a two-lane roadway and terminates at
    its intersection with Oak Grove Avenue. Alma Street provides direct access to the project site,
    as well as residential and commercial uses.
    University Avenue is a four-lane, east-west, roadway that extends from Bayfront Expressway
    to US 101. It continues west of US 101 as a two-lane roadway to El Camino Real where it
    becomes Palm Drive. University Avenue is located south of the project site and provides
    access to residential and commercial-retail areas.
    Middlefield Road is a four-lane, north-south, roadway that extends from Mountain View to
    Redwood City. Middlefield Road is located east of the project site and provides access to
    residential and commercial-retail areas.
    Sand Hill Road is primarily a four-lane, east-west, roadway that extends from El Camino Real
    to just west of Whiskey Hill Road where it becomes Portola Road. Sand Hill Road is located
    west of the project site and provides access to residential and commercial-retail areas.

                                                                                       13 | Page

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Bicycle facilities are divided into three classes. Class I bikeways are separate bike paths that are
physically separated from motor vehicles and offer two-way bicycle travel on a separate path. Class
II bikeways are striped bike lanes on roadways that are marked by signage and pavement
markings. Class III bikeways are bike routes and only have signs to help guide bicyclists on
recommended routes to certain locations.
The Mid-Peninsula Bicycle Map describes the existing bicycle network in the City of Palo Alto. The
existing bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the project site are described below and shown on Figure
2.

       Alma Street ­ existing Class II bicycle lanes from Lytton Avenue to Ravenswood Avenue.

       Lytton Avenue ­ existing Class II bicycle lanes from Alma Street to Middlefield Road.

       University Avenue ­ existing Class II bicycle lanes from Middlefield Road to US 101.

       Sand Hill Road ­ existing Class II bicycle lanes from just west of I-280 to its termination at El
       Camino Real.

       Bryant Street ­ existing bicycle boulevard, which is a low volume and low speed street with
       preferential treatments for bicyclists.

In addition, short off street bike paths are provided through nearby El Camino Park, Stanford
Shopping Center, and the Embarcadero Bike Path.

Pedestrian facilities in the project area consist primarily of sidewalks along the streets near the
project site. Sidewalks and crosswalks are found along virtually all previously-described local
roadways in the study area. These sidewalks would be adequate to facilitate pedestrian access to
and from the project site and nearby transit stops.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing traffic volumes were obtained from new manual turning movement counts at all study
intersections, except at the intersection of El Camino Real and Palo Alto Avenue/Sandhill Road.
This is a CMP intersection and the traffic count was obtained from the Congestion Management
Program. The existing peak hour intersection volume is shown on Figure 5. The traffic count data
are included in Appendix A.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in
Table 3. The results show that, measured against City of Palo Alto and CMP standards, the
signalized study intersections currently operate at acceptable levels of service during both the AM
and PM peak hours. The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix B.

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and
to confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify
any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to intersection level of service, and (2)
to identify any locations where the level of service calculation does not accurately reflect level of
service in the field.
Overall the study intersections operated adequately during both the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic, and the level of service analysis appears to accurately reflect actual existing traffic
conditions. However, field observations showed that some operational problems currently occur at
the following location near the project site:

        El Camino Real and Palo Alto Avenue. During the AM and PM peak hours, vehicle
        queues from the southbound left turn pocket on El Camino Real routinely spill into the
        through lane and occasionally extend past the signalized intersection of El Camino
        Real/Cambridge Avenue to the north. During the AM peak hour, vehicles making a
        southbound left turn at El Camino Real/Palo Alto Avenue typically require two to three
        signal cycles to clear the intersection. During the PM peak hour, vehicles making a
        southbound left turn at El Camino Real/Palo Alto Avenue typically require one to two signal
        cycles to clear the intersection.

        Alma Street and Homer Avenue. During the PM peak hour, vehicle queues on Homer
        Avenue occasionally spill back to High Street to the east. However, the vehicle queues are
        able to clear the intersection in one signal cycle.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes traffic conditions with the project. It begins with a description of the
significance criteria used to establish what constitutes a project impact. A description of the
transportation system under existing plus project conditions and the method by which project traffic
is estimated is then described. Existing plus project conditions are represented by existing traffic
conditions with the addition of traffic generated by the project.

Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria
used to determine an impact on intersections is based on the City of Palo Alto level of service
standards and the Congestion Management Program (CMP) level of service standards.

City of Palo Alto Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized
intersection in the City of Palo Alto if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       no project conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under project conditions, or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under no project
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four or more seconds and the demand-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
       increase by .01 or more.
An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
delay for critical movements (i.e. the change in average delay for critical movements is negative). In
this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.

CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of Palo Alto,
except that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or
better. A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection conditions to LOS E or better.

Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the
site is estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate
is made of the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip
assignment, the project trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections. These procedures
are described below.

Trip Generation
Project trip generation was estimated by applying to the size and uses of the development the
appropriate trip generation rates published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in Trip
Generation, 8th Edition. The project trip generation estimates are presented below in Table 4. The
trip generation estimates presented in this report do not reflect reductions related to the project's
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program, which is being prepared by the applicant. In
this respect, the project trip generation estimates are conservative.
A pass-by trip reduction of 43 percent (based on ITE rates for High Turnover Restaurants) was
applied to the AM and PM peak hour trip generation estimates for the cafe use. Trip generation for
these types of uses typically are adjusted to account for pass-by-trips during the AM and PM peak
periods of traffic. Pass-by-trips are trips that would already be on the adjacent roadways (and are
therefore already counted in the no project traffic) but would turn into the site while passing by.
Justification for applying the pass-by-trip reduction is founded on the observation that a significant
portion of the cafe traffic is not actually generated by the cafe development, but is already part of
the ambient traffic levels. Pass-by-trips were therefore excluded from the AM and PM peak hour
traffic projections at offsite intersections, but were assigned to the site's planned driveway.

Per VTA guidelines, a 3 percent mixed-use trip reduction was applied to account for internalization
of trips due to the interaction between the office and retail uses. Since the project site also will be
located near the Palo Alto Caltrain Station, a transit reduction of 3 percent was applied to the office
component.

After applying the appropriate trip reductions (passby, mixed use, and transit), the project would
generate 892 net new daily trips, with 162 net new trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 167
net new trips occurring during the PM peak hour.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The directional distribution of site-generated traffic to and from the project area was developed
based on a select zone analysis from the Valley Transportation Authority Travel Demand Forecast
Model, existing travel patterns on the surrounding roadway system, and the locations of
complementary land uses. The peak hour trips generated by the proposed use were assigned to
the roadway system in accordance with the distribution pattern discussed above. Figure 6 shows
the project trip distribution and assignment.

Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
Project trips, as represented in the above project trip assignment, were added to existing traffic
volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes. The existing plus project traffic volumes are
shown on Figure 7.

Existing Plus Project Intersection Levels of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are
summarized in Table 5. The results show that, measured against the City of Palo Alto and CMP
level of service standards, all of the intersections would continue to operate at acceptable levels of
service (LOS D or better) during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic. The intersection level of
service calculation sheets are included in Appendix B.
It should be noted that, at some study intersections, the average delay under existing plus project
conditions is shown to be lower than under existing conditions. This occurs because the
intersection delay is a weighted average of all intersection movements. The addition of project
traffic to movements with delays lower than the average intersection delay (such as right turns) can
reduce the average delay for the entire intersection.

Cumulative Conditions
This chapter presents a summary of the traffic conditions that would occur under near term and far
term cumulative conditions both with and without the proposed project. Near term cumulative
conditions reflect a horizon year of 2013. Far term cumulative conditions reflect a horizon year of
2025.

Roadway Network and Traffic Volumes
The intersection lane configurations under near term and far term cumulative conditions were
assumed to be the same as described under existing conditions.
Traffic volumes under near term and far term cumulative no project conditions were estimated by
applying to the existing volumes an annual growth rate of 1.4 percent to the target years. The 1.4
percent growth rate was derived from an analysis of the City's traffic model. The near term
cumulative growth was based on a projection out to the year 2013, which is an estimated date of
project occupancy. The far term cumulative growth was based on a projection out to the year 2025.
The project trip estimates were then added to both cumulative no project traffic volumes to derive
near term and far term cumulative with project traffic volumes. Figures 8 and 9 show the
intersection turning-movement volumes under near term cumulative conditions both without and
with project trips, respectively. Figures 10 and 11 show the intersection turning-movement volumes
under far term cumulative conditions both without and with project trips, respectively.

Intersection Levels of Service Under Cumulative Conditions
The level of service results for the study intersections under all cumulative conditions are
summarized in Table 6. The results show that, measured against City of Palo Alto and CMP level of
service standards, all of the study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service under
both near and far term cumulative conditions. The intersection level of service calculations are
included in Appendix B.
It should be noted that, at some study intersections, the average delay under cumulative plus
project conditions is shown to be lower than under no project conditions. This occurs because the
intersection delay is a weighted average of all intersection movements. The addition of project
traffic to movements with delays lower than the average intersection delay (such as right turns) can

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents other transportation issues associated with the project. These include an
analysis of:

    Operations analysis ­ vehicle queuing and storage
    Unsignalized intersections
    Potential impacts to transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities
    Site access and circulation

Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses
in this chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods
employed by the traffic engineering community. Although operational issues are not considered
CEQA impacts, they do describe traffic conditions that are relevant to describing the project
environment.

Operations Analysis
The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand turning-movements at
intersections where more than 25 project trips were added. Vehicle queues were estimated using a
Poisson probability distribution. The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability
distribution is used to estimate the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles for a
particular movement; (2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into
a queue length, assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is
compared to the existing or planned available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis
thus provides a basis for estimating future storage requirements at intersections.
The vehicle queuing estimates and a tabulated summary of the findings for the study intersections
are provided in Tables 7 and 8. The analysis indicates that the estimated maximum vehicle queues
for the westbound right turn and southbound left turn lane at Alma Street and Lytton Avenue would
exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity under project and cumulative conditions during AM
and PM peak hours. It should be noted that the identified deficient movements also are deficient
under existing conditions, and vehicle storage inadequacy is not considered a significant project
impact.

Alma Street and Lytton Avenue ­ Westbound Right turn
Under existing conditions, there is approximately 90 feet of storage capacity for the westbound right
turn lane at the intersection of Alma Street and Lytton Avenue. The storage capacity is measured
as the distance between the intersection crosswalk and the taper of the right turn pocket. Beyond
this, vehicles would queue into the through lane. Under existing, near term cumulative no project,
and far term cumulative no project conditions, the calculated 95th percentile queue would be 75 feet
during the AM peak hour. During the PM peak hour, calculated 95th percentile queue would be 175
feet during existing and near term cumulative no project and 200 feet during far term cumulative no
project. The project would add 25 feet (or one vehicle) to the 95th percentile queue relative to
existing conditions during the AM peak hour. The project would add 25 feet (or one vehicle) to the
95th percentile queue relative to near term cumulative no project conditions during the AM and PM
peak hours. The project would add 50 feet (or two vehicles) to the 95th percentile queue relative to
far term cumulative no project conditions during the AM peak hour.
While the westbound right turn movement at the intersection of Alma Street and Lytton Avenue
would not accommodate the 95th -percentile queue under project or cumulative project conditions,
the project contribution to the 95th percentile queue would be one or two vehicles. By definition, the
95th percentile queue only occurs one out of every 20 traffic signal cycles, and the 95th percentile
queue only occurs for a very brief period at the end of the signal cycle (an estimated 5 and 10
seconds). Because (1) the subject movement is a right turn with relatively low delays and (2) Lytton
Avenue is the minor street approach with no through movement at its intersection with Alma Street
(i.e. nearly all vehicles are stopping at this approach and vehicles spilling into the adjacent left turn
lane are not interfering with higher speed through traffic), no improvements are typically required.
However, the final determination will be made by City staff.

Alma Street and Lytton Avenue ­ Southbound Left turn
Under existing conditions, there is approximately 135 feet of storage capacity for the southbound
left turn lane at the intersection of Alma Street and Lytton Avenue. The storage capacity is
measured as the distance between the intersection crosswalk and the taper of the left turn pocket.
Beyond this, vehicles would queue into the through lane. Under existing, near term cumulative no
project, and far term cumulative no project, the calculated 95th percentile queue would be between
175 feet and 200 feet. The project would add up to 25 feet (or one vehicle) to the 95th percentile
queue relative to existing and cumulative conditions during the AM and PM peak hours.
While the southbound left turn movement at the intersection of Alma Street and Lytton Avenue
would not accommodate the 95th -percentile queue under project or cumulative project conditions,
the project contribution to the 95th percentile queue would only be one vehicle. As part of the
proposed development, the City and project developer will be making modifications to the striping
on Alma Street between Everett Avenue and Lytton Avenue. Preliminary plans prepared by City
staff show the extension of the subject left turn pocket as a two way center left turn lane back to
Everett Avenue. This extension would accommodate the maximum 95th percentile queue.

   Unsignalized Intersection Analysis
   This section discusses traffic conditions at the unsignalized study intersections. Unlike signalized
   intersections, which typically represent constraint points for the roadway network, unsignalized
   intersections rarely limit the potential capacity of a roadway. The determination of appropriate
   improvements to unsignalized intersections typically includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis
   of movement delay, movement traffic volumes, and intersection safety. For this reason,
   improvements to unsignalized intersections are frequently determined on the basis of professional
   judgment. Per the City of Palo Alto, as part of this analysis, operations at the following unsignalized
   intersections were evaluated.

              Alma Street and University Avenue (North Ramp)
              Alma Street and University Avenue (South Ramp)

   Level of Service Analysis
   The levels of service for the Alma Street and University Avenue intersections under existing,
   existing plus project, and cumulative conditions are shown in Table 9. The delay and LOS for the
   intersections are reported as an overall average of all intersection movements. Based on this
   analysis, both of the intersections would operate at a level of service of D or better under all
   conditions. The intersection LOS calculation sheets are shown in Appendix B. However, the
   westbound left turn movement at the south ramp intersection would operate at LOS E or F during
   both the AM and PM peak hours. The proposed project would not add any traffic to this movement.

Traffic Signal Warrants
For stop-controlled intersections, an assessment was made of the need for signalization of the
intersection. This assessment was made on the basis of the Peak-hour Volume Signal Warrant,
Warrant #3 described in the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2010. This
method makes no evaluation of intersection level of service, but simply provides an indication
whether peak-hour traffic volumes are, or would be sufficient to justify installation of a traffic signal.
The signal warrant check summary is shown in Table 10. The signal warrant analysis sheets are
included in Appendix C. The analysis shows that the peak hour volume warrant would be satisfied
at the unsignalized study intersection of Alma Street and University Avenue (south ramp) during the
AM peak hour far term cumulative scenario and during the PM peak hour for all scenarios. This
intersection would meet warrants with or without traffic from the proposed development project.

Sight Distance Analysis
The unsignalized study intersections should be free and clear of any obstructions to optimize sight
distance, thereby ensuring that exiting vehicles can see pedestrians on the sidewalk and other
vehicles traveling on the adjacent roadways. Landscaping and parking should not conflict with a
driver's ability to locate a gap in traffic. Adequate corner sight distance (sight distance triangles)
should be provided at all intersections in accordance with Caltrans standards. Sight distance
triangles should be measured approximately 10 feet back from the traveled way.
Each intersection was evaluated in the field to determine whether the sight distance would be
adequate. Based on field review, it was determined that none of the existing unsignalized
intersections currently experience sight distance issues.

Turn Pocket Analysis
Under existing conditions, vehicles southbound on Alma Street making a left turn onto University
Avenue (north ramp) must do so from the left-most through lane. Under existing conditions, there
are approximately 37 PM peak hour vehicles that perform this movement. With the proposed
project, the demand would increase to 56 PM peak hour vehicles. Left turn movements from
through lanes should be avoided when feasible because of the increased likelihood of rear end
collisions. The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (Report 348) recommends that,
in most cases, left turn pockets should be provided on high volume roadways where more than 12
peak hour left turns would occur.
Currently, all vehicles arrive at the subject intersection southbound via one approach lane from the
Lytton Avenue/Alma Street intersection. The existing and future traffic volume on Alma Street south
of Lytton Avenue does not require two southbound through lanes. For this reason, it is
recommended that the left-most through lane be re-striped to accommodate a southbound left turn
pocket at the intersection of Alma Street and University Avenue (north ramp). Preliminary plans
prepared by City staff show that the subject left turn pocket could be accommodated in conjunction
with the removal of the left most through lane.



                                                                                                        39 | Page 
101 Lytton Avenue ­ Traffic Analysis Report                                                     May 13, 2011 


     Recommendation: The proposed project would add a significant number of southbound left
     turns at the intersection of Alma Street/University Avenue (north ramp). Left turns are
     currently made from the left-most through lane. The project should make a fair share
     contribution toward the installation of a southbound left turn pocket at this location.

Unsignalized Intersection Conclusions
After review of the vehicle delays, signal warrant analyses, and sight distance analyses, it is
Hexagon's opinion that the intersection of Alma Street/University Avenue (north ramp) would
operate acceptably with the addition of the previously recommended left turn pocket. The
intersection of Alma Street/University Avenue (south ramp) experiences LOS F on the minor street
approach and meets the peak-hour traffic signal warrant under existing, near term cumulative, and
far term cumulative conditions with or without project traffic. In these situations, the City may
consider the installation of a traffic signal. However, there are other criteria the City of Palo Alto
may consider before committing to a traffic signal at this location, including (but not limited to) the
availability of alternate routes and the close proximity of other nearby traffic signals.
     Recommendation: If the City decides to install a traffic signal at the intersection of Alma
     Street/University Avenue (south ramp), a fair share contribution from the project applicant
     towards the traffic signal would be appropriate.

Project Impacts on Bicycle, Pedestrians, & Transit
It is reasonable to assume that bicycle trips will comprise approximately 2 percent of the travel
mode share to the site during the peak commute periods. This would equate to 3 or 4 new bicycle
trips during each of the AM and PM peak hours. This volume of bicycle trips is not expected to
exceed the bicycle-carrying capacity of streets surrounding the site, and the increase in bicycle trips
is not expected to require new off-site bicycle facilities.
It is reasonable to assume that pedestrian trips will comprise no more than 10 percent of the travel
mode share to the site during the peak commute periods (this is considerably higher than normal
because of the location of the project near downtown and the fact that the project contains a Café
use). This would equate to 16 or 17 new pedestrian trips during each of the AM and PM peak
hours. This volume of pedestrian trips is not expected to exceed the carrying capacity of the
existing sidewalks and crosswalks along the site frontage or on the streets surrounding the site.
Assuming a transit mode share of 5 percent, the new development would add 8 or 9 new transit
trips during each of the AM and PM peak hours. It is expected that these additional riders could be
accommodated by Caltain and VTA's existing bus service.

Site Access and Circulation
This section describes the site access and circulation of the proposed project. This review is based
on a project site plan prepared by Korth Sunseri Hagey Architects dated April 20, 2011. The project
site plan is shown on Figure 12.

Site Access
Site access was evaluated to determine the adequacy of the site's driveway with regard to the
following: corner sight distance, traffic volume, average delays, vehicle queuing, and truck access.
At the outset of the project, potential access was evaluated at the project's frontage on Lytton
Avenue. Based on this initial evaluation, it was determined that, during peak hours, the project
access would be blocked by westbound vehicle queues on Lytton Avenue from the existing traffic
signal at Alma Street. On Lytton Avenue, the project frontage extends approximately 110 feet west
of the existing Alma Street/Lytton Avenue intersection limit line. The 95th percentile queues on
Lytton Avenue during peak hours exceed 200 feet.



                                                                                      40 | Page 
101 Lytton Avenue ­ Traffic Analysis Report                                                   May 13, 2011 


Should the project driveway on Lytton Avenue be blocked by vehicle queues, left turning vehicles
into the site would queue in the existing through lane on eastbound Lytton Avenue. This could
result in vehicles spilling back into the signalized intersection Alma Street/Lytton Avenue during
peak hours, thereby blocking the intersection (see Figure 13). Because of the operational problems
associated with this driveway location, it was determined that the best access to the project site
would be from Alma Street, as far from the signalized intersection at Lytton Avenue as possible.
Thus, the existing project access is currently proposed from Alma Street approximately 165 feet
north of Lytton Avenue. In conjunction with the proposed project driveway, the project will re-stripe
Alma Street to provide a two-way center left turn lane to facilitate left turn access into the site.
The project driveway is proposed to be approximately 25 feet wide, have two lanes, and
accommodate inbound and outbound vehicles. The driveway would start at-grade with Alma Street
and travel below ground at a 15% grade. The driveway would have approximately 80 feet of
queuing storage space onsite, beyond which queued vehicles would block access to proposed
parking spaces.
During the AM peak hour, the driveway is projected to have 141 inbound vehicles (about one every
25 seconds) and 62 outbound vehicles (about one every 58 seconds). During the PM peak hour,
the driveway would have 54 inbound vehicles (about one every 66 seconds) and 139 outbound
vehicles (about one every 26 seconds). The average delay for a vehicle exiting the site would be
22 seconds during the AM peak hour and 51 seconds during the PM peak hour. During off peak
hours, the vehicle delays at the project driveway would be much lower. The 95th percentile
outbound queue would be 2 vehicles (50 feet) during the AM peak hour and 5 vehicles (125 feet)
during the PM peak hour. Thus, for short periods in the PM peak hour, it is possible that vehicles
exiting the site would sometimes block a few onsite parking spaces.
Access to the site would be assisted by breaks in traffic on Alma Street created by the nearby traffic
signal at Lytton Avenue/Alma Street. In the event that a vehicle making a left turn out of the site
incurred a long delay attempting to make a left turn out of the site, the driver might choose to make
a right turn onto Alma Street and make a right turn on Everett Street to circle around the block.
Such maneuvers are common in downtown settings during commute periods. Overall, it is
anticipated that the project's garage access would operate acceptably and would be typical of that
of a development in an urban setting with structured parking.
Truck access and loading would not be provided onsite because of the project's onsite parking
structure. Provisions for truck loading for deliveries or garbage collection are not shown on the
current plan.
     Recommendation: Prior to final design, the truck access and loading should be reviewed by
     City staff for adequacy.
Adequate corner sight distance should be provided at the project's driveway to insure that drivers
can see approaching vehicles on Alma Avenue. Sight distance is typically measured approximately
10 feet back from the traveled way. Landscaping is not shown on the current plan.
     Recommendation: Although there are no sight distance conflicts shown on the current plan,
     the project's driveway should be reviewed by City staff prior to final design to insure the
     proposed project driveway's sight lines are free and clear of obstructions. In addition, the
     garage driveway design should be reviewed in detail to make sure that vehicles exiting the
     site can see pedestrians. It may be necessary to have a warning light and audible pedestrian
     signal device.

On-Site Circulation
The onsite circulation was reviewed in accordance with generally accepted traffic engineering
standards. Generally, the proposed plan would provide one main drive aisle that would lead to an
underground parking structure. Parking is shown at 90 degrees to the main drive aisle. Once
vehicles entered the site, they would be required to make a 90 degree turn to access the main


                                                                                    42 | Page

101 Lytton Avenue ­ Traffic Analysis Report                                                       May 13, 2011 



parking areas. While the drive aisle width appears to meet industry standards, the project may
consider widening the first 90 degree turn onsite so that two approaching vehicles from opposite
directions can see each other. Another option would be to provide a large mirror at the turn so that
drivers can make adjustments to their turn paths as they approach the turn. Parking in the
underground structure is not shown on the current plan and therefore was not reviewed.
     Recommendation: Prior to final design, City staff should review the onsite circulation in the
     project's parking structure to insure that the drive aisle widths are sufficient to accommodate
     project traffic. In addition, staff should evaluate the need for mirrors (particularly at the site's
     first 90 degree turn) to provide adequate sight distance onsite.

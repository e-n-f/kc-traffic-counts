                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   Mulryan Engineering, P.C. has prepared a traffic engineering analysis of the roadway network
   surrounding the site of the proposed residential development located at 100 Clover Drive. The
   site is in the Villages of Great Neck and Great Neck Estates. These Villages are located within
   the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, New York.

   The property located at 100 Clover Drive is currently developed with a single family home. The
   adjoining property to the north is undeveloped. The overall project site is slightly over 3-acres.

   The proposed project will redevelop the existing single family home located at 100 Clover Drive
   and construct 11-single family homes along a private roadway and cul-de-sac. The private
   roadway will intersect with Clover Drive west of Middle Neck Road. Clover Drive provides one
   lane in each direction. Traffic flow on Clover Drive is restricted to one-way westbound, west of
   the site.

   The analysis includes a review of several alternative developments of the subject site.

   The private roadway and cul-de-sac have been designed in accordance with standard engineering
   practices. The private roadway will provide two-way traffic flow via one 13-foot lane in each
   direction. Pedestrian access is provided via a five foot sidewalk. The home located at 100 Clover
   Drive will continue to have access on Clover Drive. The other homes will have individual
   driveways connecting to the private roadway.

   Parking is provided for each of the 12-single family homes. Each home will have a private
   driveway leading to an attached two car garage. The number of parking spaces provided meets
   the requirements of the Village of Great Neck and Great Neck Estates.

   A growth rate of 2.0 % per year was applied to the existing traffic volumes for a period of two
   years to determine the future no build traffic volumes.

   The Highway Capacity Analysis shows that the traffic generated by the proposed development
   will have no perceptible impact on the level of service at the study intersections. Based on our
   traffic engineering analysis contained within, the proposed development will have no adverse
   impact to the surrounding roadway network.

   Mitigation measures concerning Clover Drive and the intersection of Clover Drive and Middle
   Neck Road are provided herein to address existing capacity and safety issues.


                                                 -1-
                                     INTRODUCTION
   Mulryan Engineering, P.C. has prepared a traffic engineering analysis of the roadway
network surrounding the site of the proposed residential development.

   The overall project site is slightly over 3-acres fronting on Clover Drive. The property located at
100 Clover Drive is currently developed with a single family home. The adjoining property to the
north is undeveloped. These two properties combine to form the project site.

   The proposed project will redevelop the existing single family home located at 100 Clover Drive
and construct 11-single family homes along a private roadway and cul-de-sac. The private roadway
will intersect with Clover Drive west of Middle Neck Road. Clover Drive provides one lane in each
direction. Traffic flow on Clover Drive is restricted to one-way westbound, west of the site.

   The site access design requires the review and approval of the Village of Great Neck Estates.
The site access, roadway and cul-de-sac have been designed in accordance with standard
engineering practices. The project is located with the Village of Great Neck and the Village of
Great Neck Estates.

   This study identifies the changes in traffic movements along the adjacent roadway network
which will occur as a result of the proposed development and identifies the potential impact of
the future build condition on the adjacent street system. The study also analyzes the potential
impact of several alternative developments.

NYSMUTCD No. NYW7-4.

   The Hidden Driveway sign is not listed in the National Manual or

in the New York State Supplement.

   A third warning sign is posted to the west of the
suject site. The waring sign indicates a Slippery When
Wet condition exist. The Slippery When Wet sign is
designated in the Manual of Uniform on Traffic
Control Devices for Streets and Highways as
MUTCD No. W8-5.

SURROUNDING LAND USES
   The subject site abuts an apartment building to the north and single family residential
properties to the east and west. The Pupil Personnel Services, Adult Learning Center and SEAL
Academy are located to the south of the site at 105 Clover Drive. The site is located to the west
of Middle Neck Road.

   The Pupil Personnel Services, Adult Learning Center and SEAL Academy operate from the
school complex located at 105 Clover Drive. Pupil Personnel Services provides services for
students with special needs. The Adult Learning Center provides a variety of educational
opportunities for adults to improve basic skills, earn a high school diploma, prepare for college
entrance, or learn English as a Second Language. The Center also provides programs for adults
with special needs. The SEAL Academy is an alternative high school program serving students
in grades 9-12 and is located at Clover Drive. The SEAL Academy provides small class sizes for



                                               -7-
students who have not been consistently successful in larger educational settings. The average
class size is 1-3 students.

    The traffic and pedestrian activities at the school complex were observed during the turning
movement counts as well as throughout the day during the parking study conducted on Clover
Drive from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. It was observed that a majority of the vehicles in the parking lot
left at approximately 1:00 pm. The pedestrians leaving the site were observed travelling from
the school complex towards Middle Neck Road. The Nassau County twenty-four hour traffic
volume data collected on Middle Neck Road indicates that the volume of traffic on Middle Neck
Road at this time is approximately 10-percent less than the traffic volumes during the morning
and evening peak hours.

PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
    The area is served by the Long Island Railroad and two
Nassau County Bus routes. The Great Neck train station is
located along the Port Washington train line with service to Port
Washington and Penn Station in Manhattan.

    Bus stops for the N58 bus line are located at each of the
study intersections along Middle Neck Road.

PARKING STUDY
    A parking study was conducted on Clover Drive. The study was conducted on Wednesday,
March 9th, Saturday, March 12th, and Sunday, March 6, 2011. Counts were conducted each hour
from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm on Wednesday and 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on Saturday. Overnight spot
counts were also conducted during the week and on Saturday. On Sunday a spot count was
collected at 4:00 pm. The study recorded the number of vehicles parked along Clover Drive from
Middle Neck Road to Hilltop Drive.
The counts were divided into the following four sections:

    Area No. 1: North side of Clover Drive: Middle Neck Road to Young Israel
    Area No. 2: South side of Clover Drive: Middle Neck Road to School Complex
    Area No. 3: North side of Clover Drive: Young Israel to Hilltop Drive
    Area No. 4: South side of Clover Drive: School Complex to Hilltop Drive



                                              -8-
   The following provides the parking capacity of each area defined by an 8-foot wide by 25-
foot long parallel parking space. Clover Drive is approximately 1,200-feet long from Middle
Neck Road to Hilltop Drive. The capacity shown does not consider the No Parking restrictions
as vehicles were observed stopping and standing in these area and were included in the parking
counts.

   Area No. 1: Parking Capacity 5-vehicles
   Area No. 2: Parking Capacity 5-vehicles
   Area No. 3: Parking Capacity 35-vehicles
   Area No. 4: Parking Capacity 20-vehicles

   Total Capacity is 65-vehicles using an 8-foot by 25-foot parking space. This capacity
increases to 84-vehicles using an 8-foot by 20-foot parking space. For the purposes of this report
the larger area parking spaces were used in the parking study summary tables provided in the
technical appendix.

   The number of vehicles parked on Clover Drive during the week from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm
ranged from 4 to 6-vehicles. On Saturday the number of vehicles parked on Clover Drive ranged
from 2 to 4-vehicles. On Sunday at 4:00 pm 31-vehicles were parked along Clover Drive. The
parking lot of the school was near capacity during the spot count on Sunday.

   Vehicles parking in close proximity to existing driveways hinder visibility for motorists
exiting their driveways onto Clover Drive.

PARKING GENERATION
   The development of the subject site will generate a certain number of parked vehicles. The
number of parked vehicles generated by the proposed development was based on the standard
calculations compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the 4th Edition
Parking Generation, 2010. This is often referred to as the Parking Generation Manual and is
considered the industry standard for traffic engineering studies.




                                                -9-
   The parking generation of the proposed development was calculated using the ITE Land Use
Code 210. The independent variable used in the calculation is the "dwelling units". This land use
code represents Single-Family Detached Housing.

   Based on the ITE parking generation data, the proposed 12-homes are anticipated to generate
22-parked vehicles during peak demand.

   The sites included in the ITE data set shows a peak parking generation rate of 1.83-vehicles
per dwelling unit. The homes included within the study had between one and four bedrooms,
with a mean value of 2.7 and mode and median values two and three bedrooms, respectively.

   In order to provide a conservative analysis the peak parking generation rate of 1.83-vehicles
per dwelling unit was divided by the average number of bedrooms to obtain a parking generation
rate per bedroom.

   Adjusting the ITE data to reflect the proposed four bedroom homes would result in an
anticipated parking demand of 33-parked vehicle during peak demand.

   The plans prepared for the proposed project provides for a total of 66-parking spaces. The
proposed site provides ample parking to accommodate the anticipated demand. Any on street
parking generated by the site would be accommodated on the internal private roadway.

ACCIDENT ANALYSIS
   Motor vehicle accident history reports pertaining to the adjacent roadway network were
obtained from the Nassau County Police Department. The reports document motor vehicle
accidents that took place along the roadway network and at the study intersections.

   The Nassau County Police Department reports span a 36-month period beginning on
January 1, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2010.

   The following tables provide a detailed description of each accident organized by location;
including the Nassau County Police Accident Number, the Severity of the Accident, the Type of
Collision, Contributing Factors, Lighting Conditions, Road Surface Conditions and Weather
Conditions.

   Approximately 37% of the accidents that occurred at the intersection of Middle Neck Road
and Old Mill Road involved pedestrians travelling northbound and vehicles travelling eastbound
making a right turn movement. Over 70% of these accidents occurred in 2009. Several of the
accident reports reported cloudy weather indicating that rain water or darkness (overcast
conditions) may have been a factor in these accidents. A detailed accident summary of each
accident is located within the technical appendix.

    This group publishes various policies on highway design such as "A Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Streets". This is often referred to as the AASHTO Green Book and is
considered the industry standard for highway design projects. The following information is
provided in the 2004 Edition:

        Chapter 3-Elements of Design

        The alignment of a highway or street produces a great impact on the environment, the
    fabric of the community, and the highway user. The alignment is comprised of a variety



                                                 - 15 -
   of elements joined together to create a facility that serves the traffic in a safe and efficient
   manner, consistent with the facility's intended function. Each alignment element should
   complement others to produce a consistent, safe and efficient design.

        The design of highways and streets within particular functional classes is treated
   separately in later chapters. Common to all classes of highways and streets are several
   principal elements of design. These include sight distance, superelevation, travel way
   widening, grades, horizontal and vertical alignments, and other elements of geometric
   design. These alignment elements are discussed in this chapter, and, as appropriate, in
   later chapters pertaining to specific highway functional classes.

   AASHTO groups streets and highways into specific functional classification groups
according to the character of service they are intended to provide. The functional classification
groups are:

   1.   Principal Arterials;
   2.   Minor Arterials;
   3.   Collector Roadways; and
   4.   Local Roadways

        Chapter 5-Local Roads and Streets

        A local road or street serves primarily to provide access to farms, residences,
   businesses, or other abutting properties. A local urban street is a public roadway for
   vehicular travel including public transit and refers to and includes the entire area within
   the right-of-way.    The street also serves pedestrian and bicycle traffic and usually
   accommodates public utility facilities within the right-of-way. A very low-volume local
   road is a road that is functionally classified as a local road and has a design average daily
   traffic volume of 400 vehicles per day or less.

        Safety is an important factor in all roadway improvements. However, it may not be
   practical to provide an obstacle-free roadside on local roads and streets. Every effort
   should be made to provide as much clear roadside as is practical. This becomes more
   important as speeds increase. Flatter slopes, guardrail, and warning signs all help to
   achieve roadside safety.



                                                - 16 -
       It may not be cost-effective to design local roads and streets that carry less than 400
   vehicles per day using the same criteria applicable to higher volume roads or to make
   extensive traffic operational or safety improvements to such very low-volume roads.
   AASHTO is currently evaluating alternative design criteria for local roads that carry less
   than 400 vehicles per day based on a safety risk assessment.

   Clover Drive is classified as a local roadway. The recorded average daily traffic on
Clover Drive is 257 vehicles per day. The volume of traffic on Clover Drive is less than
400 vehicles per day.

   In order to address design criteria for local roadways AASHTO published Guidelines for
Geometric Design of Very Low-Volume Local Roads (ADT400), 2001. Figure S1 in the
technical appendix illustrated the required stopping sight and intersection sight distances for
Arterial, Collector and Local Roads with ADT equal or less than 400 vehicles per day.

   The required sight distance calculations are posted on the classification of the roadway
and the posted speed limit of the recorded 85th percentile travel speed on each approach.

   The posted speed limit along Clover Drive is 25mph. The 85th percentile travel speed is 32.9
mph in the westbound direction and 26.6 mph in the eastbound direction.

   The intersection sight distance was measured in the field using a measuring stick marked at
3.5-feet (used to set the eye height of the observer), a sight target markers at 3.5-feet standing a
total of 4.0-feet (creating a target area) and a measuring wheel. The sight target for the stopping
sight distance was set to 2.0-feet.

   The stopping sight distance travelling eastbound was measured as 167-feet. Travelling
westbound the stopping sight distance was measures as 185-feet.

   The intersection sight distance to the west of the driveway is unobstructed.




                                               - 17 -
   Observations of the intersection sight distance to the east of the proposed intersection were
made at the following distances: 100, 150, 175, 200 and 225-feet.

   At distances up to 175-feet the entire sight target area is visible (object height ranging from
3.5 to 4.0-feet observed at an eye height of 3.5-feet). At a distance of 200-feet the upper portion
of the target area was visible. At a distance of 225-feet the sight target was not visible.

   At a distance of approximately 190-feet the lower portion of the target area becomes
obscured by the vertical curve.

   Sight Distance along Clover Drive is limited due a vertical curve. The roadway drops from
east to west. The elevation to the west of the site then rises towards Hilltop Drive. The
properties to the west of the site are located at the low point in the vertical curve.

   This condition limits stopping sight distance for vehicles travelling along Clover Drive. It
also restricts the intersection sight distance for residents turning onto Clover Drive.

   The finding of our sight distance analysis show that the proposed roadway meets the
recommended guidelines provided by the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), Guidelines for Geometric Design of Very Low-Volume
Local Roads (ADT400), 2001.

   In order to enhance safety for pedestrians and motorist on Clover Drive the applicant is
proposing to install warning signs.       Warning signs are a recognized measure in achieving
roadside safety, as stated in Chapter 5 of the AASHTO A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets, 2004.

SIDEWALK AND CROSSWALKS
   Crosswalks are provided at Old Mill Road, Clover Drive and Linden Boulevard. Sidewalks
are provided at the corners. Crosswalks and sidewalk are not provided at the intersection of
Clover Drive at North Clover Drive. Crosswalks are not provided at the intersection of Clover
Drive and Hilltop Drive.




                                                 - 18 -
   Crosswalks are also provided at the intersections of Middle Neck Road at Wooleys Lane,
Allenwood Road and Embassy Court.

   An asphalt sidewalk starts at the intersection of Clover Drive and Hilltop Drive. The
sidewalk starts in front of 2-Hilltop Drive along the south/east side of Clover Drive. A metal
fence runs along the curb/retaining wall separating the sidewalk from the roadway to the east of
Hilltop Drive. There are existing street trees in close proximity to the sidewalk in this section.
The asphalt sidewalk transitions into a concrete sidewalk in proximity to 88-Clover Drive. The
concrete sidewalk continues east along the school property. The concrete sidewalk changes back
to an asphalt sidewalk in proximity to the school building. The sidewalk shifts to the south and
appears to be located on the school property. This section of sidewalk is several feet higher in
elevation than Clover Drive. This section of sidewalk leads to the concrete walkway in front of
the school. The walkway is located on the west side of the school driveway. Concrete sidewalk is
provided along Clover Drive to the east of the school driveway and continues to Middle Neck
Road along the south side of Clover Drive. Concrete sidewalk is provided along the Young
Israel property along the north side of Clover drive.

   The roadway network was patrolled by a police vehicle on a regular basis. The police vehicle
circulated through the area every 15 to 20 minutes. No fire trucks or ambulances were observed
on the roadway network during the counts.

EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES
   Manual turning movement counts were collected during the weekday morning and evening
peak hours at the study intersections. Counts were also collected on Saturday afternoon. The
peak hours of commuter traffic on Middle Neck Road are consistent with the peak hours studied.
The peak hour turning movement volumes are provided within the Technical Appendix. The
turning movement data was collected during the following time periods:


              In the morning from           7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.
              In the evening from           4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
              On Saturday from             10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
              On Sunday from               11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

   The results of these traffic counts were analyzed to determine the distinct hour during each of
the time periods surveyed when traffic experiences its highest level referred to as the "peak
hour." The peak hour volume is used in our analysis to model the critical demand during each
time period. Counts were collected on Tuesday, March 3rd and Saturday, March 5, 2011.

   The following is a list of the study intersections included in our analysis of the proposed
project.

              Middle Neck Road and Old Mill Road
              Middle Neck Road and Clover Drive
              Middle Neck Road and Linden Boulevard
              Clover Drive and Hilltop Drive

              Clover Drive and East School Driveway
              Clover Drive and West School Driveway
              Clover Drive and Young Israel

   Traffic volume, speed and vehicle classification data was collected continuously for
168-hours on Clover Drive (7-days x 24-hours = 168-hours). The data was collected in front of
the proposed site.

   The study intersections are located within a -mile radius from the project site. Intersections
located beyond a  of a mile will not be effected by the project as vehicles are distributed
through the roadway network.




                                              - 22 -
   Additional turning movement counts were taken on Sunday, May 8, 2011. The following
study intersections were counted on Sunday, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

              Middle Neck Road and Clover Drive
              Clover Drive and Hilltop Drive
              Clover Drive and North Clover Drive
              Clover Drive and Driveway(s)
              Clover Drive and Young Israel

PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY
   Pedestrian counts were conducted at the study intersections during the peak hours. The peak
pedestrian volume at the intersections was incorporated into the highway capacity analysis to
reflect the impact of pedestrian activity on traffic flow. The pedestrian counts are included in the
technical appendix.

   Field data collection and observations were made at the study intersections during the peak
hours of the roadway network. Additional field data and observations were made on Clover
Drive from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm during the week and from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on Saturday. The
peak pedestrian traffic within the study area occurs on Saturday in connection with religious
services. Limited pedestrian activity was observed in connection with the school complex
located at 105 Clover Drive. The limited pedestrian activity that was generated by the school
complex related to pedestrian trips to and from Middle Neck Road. During the 19-hours of
observations no significant pedestrian activity associated with the school complex was observed
passing the subject site.

ADJUSTED TRAFFIC VOLUME FLOW RATE
   The Highway Capacity Analysis uses the adjusted flow rate based on the peak hour volume
and the peak hour factor at each location. The peak hour volume is divided by the peak hour
factor to produce the critical 15-minute demand projected over the entire one hour period. The
results of this analysis provide the level of service experienced during the busiest 15-minute
period within the peak hour.




                                               - 23 -
VEHICLE CLASSIFICATION
   The Highway Capacity Analysis uses a factor to account for the percentage of Heavy
Vehicles within the traffic stream. For stop controlled intersection analysis these factors are
applied to the minor street and to the left turn movements for the major street approaches. For
signalized intersection analysis these factors are applied to each lane group to determine the
saturated flow rate. The heavy vehicle percentage includes trucks and buses.

   The capacity analysis prepared for this project uses a vehicle classification mix consisting of
98% passenger vehicles and 2.0% heavy vehicle. This vehicle classification mix is widely used
for highway capacity analysis and has been accepted by various government agencies such as the
Nassau County Department of Public Works and the New York State Department of
Transportation (NYSDOT Region 10  Nassau and Suffolk County).

                               NO BUILD CONDITIONS
AMBIENT TRAFFIC GROWTH
   The volume of traffic using the roadway network has historically increased each year based
on population growth and development. An ambient growth rate is used to determine the future
base traffic volumes. The ambient growth rate takes into account developments that will increase
the volume of traffic at the study intersections prior to the completion of this project.

   The peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersections were increased by a growth rate
factor of 2.0 % compounded yearly. This growth rate is applied to the existing volumes to
generate the ambient no build traffic volumes.

   This rate exceeds the standard ambient growth forecasted for this area. The additional
ambient growth is used to account for local development projects that would increase traffic at
the study intersections above and beyond the forecasted increase for this area.

   For the purposes of this analysis, the future no build and build conditions are anticipated to
occur within the next two years. This timeframe looks to forecast the traffic conditions beyond
the completion of the project. The construction time-frame for this project is anticipated to be
less than 18-months.

OTHER PLANNED PROJECTS
   In addition to the ambient growth rate the proposed Rose Apartment complex project was
included in the future no build conditions. This project is located on the southwest corner of
Middle Neck Road and Clover Drive. The complex will consist of 40-apartments with access on
Middle Neck Road.

   The site plan design for this project eliminates the existing driveway on the south side of
Clover Drive opposite Young Israel. The analysis and traffic volume figures prepared for the no
build and build conditions reflect 1) the additional traffic generated by the proposed apartment
complex and 2) the proposed site access design which eliminates access to and from Clover
Drive.

                         FUTURE BUILD CONDITIONS
TRIP GENERATION
   The development of the subject site will generate a certain number of vehicle trips
throughout the day. The volume of trips generated by the proposed development was calculated
using the standard calculations compiled by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the
8th Edition Trip Generation, 2008. This is often referred to as the Trip Generation Manual and is
considered the industry standard for traffic engineering studies.

   The trip generation of the proposed development was calculated using the ITE Land Use
Code 210. The independent variable used in the calculation is the number of "dwelling units".
This land use code represents Single Family Detached Housing.

   At the request of the Village's Engineering Consultant trip generation studies were conducted
in the area of the proposed site. Two locations were studies. The first location is Stony Run Road
off Old Mill Road in the Village of Great Neck. Stony Run Road is a cul-de-sac with 10-single
family homes. The second location is Oakland Place off Linden Boulevard in the Village of
Great Neck Estates. Oakland Place is a cul-de-sac with 6-single family homes.

   Turning movements counts collected at the intersections of Old Mill Road at Stony Run
Road and Linden Boulevard and Oakland Place. These counts were used to determine the
number of vehicles entering and exiting the two cul-de-sacs. The peak hour trip generation at
each site was combined to determine the trip generation rate per home. The trip generation rates
at these two locations were found to be higher than the ITE trip generation rates.

   The highway capacity analysis for the proposed development utilizes the local trip generation
data and associated traffic volumes to evaluate the future build conditions.




                                               - 26 -
   The proposed development will redevelop one home and build eleven new homes. However
in order to provide a conservative analysis no credit was taken for the trip generated by the
existing home on the subject property.

   The volumes below represent the peak number of trips generated during a one hour time
period.

CONSTRUCTION
   Construction is estimated to extend over 18 months and would occur in the following order:
During the first two months, the site preparation would include tree and stump removal, retaining
wall construction and removal and storage of top soil from the roadway area.

   Road construction would follow over the next four months and would include roadway
grading, installation of sewer main, water main, underground electric, road drainage, catch
basins and road base.

   House construction would follow over the next 9 months

   Finally the road would be completed in the next 3 months with installation of gas service,
road compaction, final grading, street lighting, asphalt and landscaping

   The schedule is subject to change as a result of weather-related delays and other unforeseen
events.

   In order to limit the impact on religious holidays, practices and activities at Young Israel and
on the adjoining community, several concessions will be made to normal construction practices.
Village of Great Neck Code Section 391-2 (G) prohibits "the erection, including excavating,
demolition, alteration or repair, of any building other than between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and
7:00 p.m. on weekdays, (i.e., Mondays through Fridays, excluding holidays) and 9:00 a.m. and
7:00 p.m. on Saturdays and holidays". The applicant will voluntarily limit construction activities
as follows:

   Weekday construction activities would be confined to the hours of 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Saturday construction activities would be confined to the hours of 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., however
heavy equipment operation or other construction activity that might be accompanied by "loud or
disturbing noise" would be restricted to the weekday hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and would not
occur on Saturdays or the following religious holidays:

Passover 1st day                 Shavuoth 1st day                  Succoth 2nd day
Passover 2nd day                 Shavuoth 2nd day                  Shemini Aatzereth
Passover 7th day                 Tisha B'av                        Simchath Torah
Passover last day                Succoth 1st day                   Channukah 1st day


                                               - 28 -
   There would be no construction activities on the High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom
Kippur.

   The volume of construction vehicles will vary based on the phase of construction and the
number of homes constructed simultaneously. As detailed above, the initial phase of construction
will include the preparation and clearing of the site. The second stage of construction will
involve the grading of the site. The third stage of construction will include the installation of the
drainage system and internal roadway. The forth stage of construction will involve the
construction of the homes.

   An excavator will be delivered to the site and used during the grading phase of construction.
Lumber, bricks, asphalt and concrete will be delivered to the site via truck. These deliveries will
occur sporadically during construction. Construction vehicles will primarily enter the site from
the south, travelling on Middle Neck Road to Clover Drive. Upon exiting the site these vehicles
will travel east of Clover Drive and turn right onto Middle Neck Road.

   Peak hours related to the construction activity on site are related to the arrival and departure
times of the various trade groups that will be involved in the construction of this project.

   During the initial phase of construction the trip generation is anticipated to be approximately
5-vehicles entering and exiting the site during the morning and evening peaks. As the project
progresses the trip generation is anticipated to be approximately 10-vehicles entering and exiting
the site during the morning and evening peaks.

   The level of activity on the site during construction is consistent with or lower than the trip
generation of some of the alternative developments analyzed within this report. The volume of
traffic generated during construction will have no perceptible impact to the level of service on
the surrounding roadway network.

   Construction vehicles will be guided into and out of the site with flaggers to safeguard
pedestrians and motorist, during all phases of construction.

                                TRIP DISTRIBUTION
    Trips generated by the development of the subject site are distributed throughout the roadway
network and assigned to the study intersections. The percent distribution is applied to the trip
generation to establish the number of trips assigned to specific turning movements at each of the
study intersections. One hundred percent of the trip generation is distributed and assigned to the
site access.

    A portion of the total trip generation is distributed and assigned to each of the other study
intersections. The volume of trips assigned to each intersection is based on the percentage of
vehicles that are anticipated to use these intersections while traveling to and from the site. The
distribution at the site driveway is based on the local roadway network.

    Residents living at the site will enter the site via Middle Neck Road due to the one-way
restriction on Clover Drive.

    Residents living on Clover Drive exiting the site traveling north, south or east will head
towards Middle Neck Road. Middle Neck Road is a main north-south collector roadway in this
area.

    Middle Neck Road heading north towards Kings Point intersects with Fairview Avenue,
Arrandle Avenue, Steamboat Road and Red Brook Road. Fairview Avenue leads to Memorial
Field Park. The Village Green & Rose Garden Park is located on Middle Neck Road between
Fairview Avenue and Arrandale Avenue. Arrandale Avenue leads to the Parkwood Sports
Complex. Steamboat Road and Red Brook Road lead to the Kings Point Park. To the north of
the site Middle Neck Road is developed with a mix of retail, office and residential land uses.

    Middle Neck Road heading south towards Northern Boulevard intersects with Allenwood
Road, leading to Allenwood Park. Middle Neck Road heading south also passes the central
downtown shopping district and the train station.

    Middle Neck Road is developed with a variety of offices, stores, religious establishments and
residential properties. Middle Neck Road is anticipated to receive 75% of the exiting traffic
from the subject site.




                                               - 30 -
   Vehicles traveling to the west can exit towards Middle Neck Road travel north to Old Mill
Road to Bayview Avenue. Bayview Avenue leads to Northern Boulevard (NYS Rt. 25A).
These vehicles can also exit towards Middle Neck Road travel south to Cutter Mill Road, Great
Neck Road or Northern Boulevard (NYS Rt. 25A).

   Clover Drive to the west of the site leads through a residential community. Clover Drive
intersects with Hilltop Drive, Clover Drive North, Linden Boulevard, Gateway Drive and
terminates at Deepdale Drive. Clover Drive and Clover Drive North form the northern most
roadways within this residential area. In order to travel outside of this residential area vehicle
will need to enter onto Bayview Avenue or Middle Neck Road.

   During the morning, evening and Saturday peak hours a total of 25-vehicles exited the
office/retail parking lot located just east of the school complex. Of the 25-vehicles 23 turned
right and 2 turned left. The resulting distribution is 92% eastbound and 8% westbound. Using
these percentages would assign a maximum of 0.64-vehicles per hour from the proposed site to
the intersections of Clover Drive and Hilltop Drive and Clover Drive and North Clover Drive.
Using this trip distribution model would essentially negate the inclusion of these intersections
from the scope of this study.

   As a portion of the site generated traffic will exit to the west via Clover Drive. The analysis
assigns 25% of the exiting traffic to this movement in order to analyze the potential impact of
vehicles traveling west via Clover Drive. Based on the trip generation of the site this amounts to
a maximum of 1-vehicle every 30-minutes or 2-vehicles per hour.

DESCRIPTION
   The level of service and capacity analysis prepared for this project is based on the
methodologies presented in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000), published by the
Transportation Research Board. The manual provides a consistent system of techniques for the
evaluation of the quality of service on highway and street facilities. The following information is
contained within Chapters 10, 16 and 17 of the Highway Capacity Manual.

SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
CAPACITY
     Capacity at intersections is defined for each lane group. The lane group capacity is the maximum
hourly rate at which vehicles can reasonably be expected to pass through the intersection under
prevailing traffic, roadway, and signalization conditions. The flow rate is generally measured or
projected for a peak 15-minute period, and capacity is stated in vehicles per hour (vehicles per hour).
Traffic conditions include volumes on each approach, the distribution of vehicles by movement (left,
through, and right), the vehicle type distribution within each movement, the location and use of bus
stops within the intersection area, pedestrian crossing flows, and parking movements on approaches
to the intersection. Roadway conditions include the basic geometrics of the intersection, including the
number and width of lanes, grades, and lane use allocations (including parking lanes). Signalization
conditions include a full definition of the signal phasing, timing, and type of control, and an
evaluation of signal progression for each lane group. The analysis of capacity at signalized
intersections focuses on the computation of saturation flow rates, capacities, volume to capacity
ratios, and level of service for lane groups.
LEVEL OF SERVICE
     Level of service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of control delay, which is a
measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and increased travel time. The delay
experienced by a motorist is made up of a number of factors that relate to control, geometrics, traffic,
and incidents. Total delay is the difference between the travel time actually experienced and the
reference travel time that would result during base conditions: in the absence of traffic control,
geometric delay, any incidents, and any other vehicles. Specifically, LOS criteria for traffic signals
are stated in terms of the average control delay per vehicle, typically for a 15-minute analysis period.
Delay is a complex measure and depends on a number of variables, including the quality of
progression, the cycle length, the green ratio, and the volume to capacity ratio for the lane group. The
critical volume to capacity ratio is an approximate indicator of the overall sufficiency of an
intersection. The critical volume to capacity ratio depends on the conflicting critical lane flow rates
and the signal phasing.
         The average back of queue is another performance measure that is used to analyze a
signalized intersection. The back of queue is the number of vehicles that are queued depending on
arrival patterns of vehicles and vehicles that do not clear the intersection during a given green phase.




                                                 - 57 -
Levels of service are defined to represent reasonable ranges in control delay.

LOS A describes operations with low control delay, up to 10 seconds per vehicle. This LOS occurs
when progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Many
vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may tend to contribute to low delay values.

LOS B describes operations with control delay greater than 10 and up to 20 seconds per vehicle. This
level generally occurs with good progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles stop than
with LOS A, causing higher levels of delay.

LOS C describes operations with control delay greater than 20 and up to 35 seconds per vehicle.
These higher delays may result from only fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both. Individual
cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. Cycle failure occurs when a given green phase does
not serve queued vehicles, and overflows occur. The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this
level, though many still pass through the intersection without stopping.

LOS D describes operations with control delay greater than 35 and up to 55 seconds per vehicle. At
LOS D, the influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some
combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume to capacity ratios.
Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle failures
are noticeable.

LOS E describes operations with control delay greater than 55 and up to 80 seconds per vehicle.
These high delay values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high seconds
per vehicle ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent.

LOS F describes operations with control delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This level,
considered unacceptable to most drivers, often occurs with over-saturation, that is, when arrival flow
rates exceed the capacity of lane groups. It may also occur at high volume to capacity ratios with
many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also contribute
significantly to high delay levels.

        Delays in the range of LOS F (unacceptable) can occur while the volume to capacity ratio is
below 1.0. Very high delays can occur at such volume to capacity ratios when some combination of
the following conditions exists: the cycle length is long, the lane group in question is disadvantaged
by the signal timing (has a long red time), and the signal progression for the subject movements is
poor. The reverse is also possible (for a limited duration): a saturated lane group (i.e., volume to
capacity ratio greater than 1.0) may have low delays if the cycle length is short, or the signal
progression is favorable, or both.
         Thus, the designation LOS F does not automatically imply that the intersection, approach, or
lane group is over capacity, nor does an LOS better than E automatically imply that unused capacity
is available.

UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
CAPACITY
        At two-way stop controlled (unsignalized) intersections, drivers on the controlled approaches
are required to select gaps in the major street flow through which to execute crossing or turning
maneuvers on the basis of judgment. In the presence of a queue, each driver on the controlled
approach must also use some time to move into the front-of-queue position and prepare to evaluate
gaps in the major street flow. Thus, the capacity of the controlled legs is based on three factors: the
distribution of gaps in the major street traffic stream, driver judgment in selecting gaps through
which to execute the desired maneuvers, and the follow-up time required by each driver in a queue.

        The basic capacity model assumes that gaps in the conflicting stream are randomly
distributed. When traffic signals on the major street are within 0.25 miles of the subject intersection,
flows may not be random but will likely have some platoon structure.

        Pedestrians crossing an intersection impede lower-ranked minor street vehicles, but only one
lane at a time. This is because vehicles performing a given through or turning movement tend to pass
in front of or behind pedestrians once a driver's target lane is clear. The important factor is to
determine the number of blockages. For the purpose of determining the pedestrian impedance, the
pedestrian volume is the sum of individual pedestrians crossing individually and groups of
pedestrians crossing together during the analysis time period.

         The existence of a raised or striped median or a two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) on the
major street often causes some degree of a gap acceptance phenomenon known as "two-stage gap
acceptance". For example, the existence of a raised or striped median causes a significant proportion
of the minor street drivers to first cross part of the major street approach and then pause in the middle
of the road to wait for another gap in the other approach. If a two-way left-turn lane exists on the
major street, the minor street left-turn vehicle usually merges into the two-way left-turn lane first,
then seeks a usable gap on the other approach while slowly moving some distance along the two-way
left-turn lane. Both of these behaviors can increase capacity.

        The geometric elements near the stop line on the stop-controlled approaches of many
intersections may result in a higher capacity than the shared-lane capacity equation may predict. This
is because, at such approaches, two vehicles may occupy or depart from the stop line simultaneously
as a result of a large curb radius, a tapered curb, or a parking prohibition. The magnitude of this
effect will depend in part on the turning movement volumes and the resultant probability of two
vehicles being simultaneously at the stop line and on the storage length available to feed the second
position at the stop line.

        Often, two or three movements share a single lane on the minor approach. With this lane
sharing, vehicles from different movements do not have simultaneous access to gaps, nor can more
than one vehicle from the sharing movements use the same gap, which influences capacity.




                                                  - 59 -
        The existence of nearby signalized intersections (i.e., traffic signals on the major street within
0.25 miles of the subject intersection) typically causes vehicles to arrive at the intersection in
platoons. This influences the size and distribution of available gaps and may cause an increase in the
minor street capacity. The greater the number of vehicles traveling in platoons, the higher the minor
street capacity for a given opposing volume. This is due to the greater proportion of large gaps that
more than one minor street vehicle can use. If signalized intersections exist upstream of the subject
intersection in both directions, the effect is much more complex.
LEVEL OF SERVICE
        Four measures are used to describe the performance of TWSC intersections: control delay,
delay to major street through vehicles, queue length, and v/c ratio. The primary measure that is used
to provide an estimate of LOS is control delay. This measure can be estimated for any movement on
the minor (i.e., the stop-controlled) street. By summing delay estimates for individual movements, a
delay estimate for each minor street movement and minor street approach can be achieved.

        For AWSC intersections, the average control delay (in seconds per vehicle) is used as the
primary measure of performance. Control delay is the increased time of travel for a vehicle
approaching and passing through an AWSC intersection, compared with a free flow vehicle if it were
not required to slow or stop at the intersection.

        Capacity analysis at TWSC intersections depends on a clear description and understanding of
the interaction of drivers on the minor or stop-controlled approach with drivers on the major street.
Both gap acceptance and empirical models have been developed to describe this interaction.
Procedures described in this chapter rely on a gap acceptance model developed and refined in
Germany (I). The concepts from this model are described in Chapter 10. Exhibit 17-1 illustrates input
to and the basic computation order of the method described in this chapter.

        Level of service (LOS) for a TWSC intersection is determined by the computed or measured
control delay and is defined for each minor movement. LOS is not defined for the intersection as a
whole. LOS criteria are given below:

                    Level of Service Criteria for Unsignalized Intersections
                   Level of Service                   Delay (in seconds per vehicle)
                          A                                         10
                          B                                   10 and  15
                          C                                   15 and  25
                          D                                   25 and  35
                          E                                   35 and  50
                          F                                         50

        The LOS criteria for TWSC intersections are somewhat different from the criteria used for
signalized intersections primarily because different transportation facilities create different driver
perceptions. The expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic
volumes and experience greater delay than an unsignalized intersection.

RESULTS
   The following tables provide the results of the highway capacity analysis prepared for this
project in terms of level of service and delay experienced at the study intersections, under the
Existing, No Build and Build Conditions. The delay provided for signalized intersections
represents the overall average intersection delay in seconds. The delay provided for unsignalized
intersections represents the control delay on the critical approach in seconds. The technical
appendix includes the highway capacity analysis output files detailing the level of service and
delay at each of the study intersections.

   The "Existing Condition" provides an analysis of the critical 15-mintue period during the
peak hour observed at the study intersections. The "No Build Condition" takes into account the
background traffic growth that will increase the traffic volumes at the study intersections. To
determine the future volume of traffic on the roadway network upon completion of the proposed
project; the "Build Condition" considers the trip generation, trip distribution and no build traffic
volumes.

The eastbound approach of Clover Drive operates with a Level of Service E during the evening
peak hour under No Build Condition. The associated average delay is 48.1-seconds per vehicle.

If the site is developed as proposed without mitigation the average delay for vehicles travelling
eastbound on Clover Drive would increase by 3.8-seconds during the evening peak hour. This
increase in delay creates a change in the level of service for this approach.

FINDINGS
    Clover Drive is located between two signalized intersections on Middle Neck Road located at
Wooleys Lane to the north and Allenwood Road to the south. These traffic signals create gaps in
the traffic steam during the side street phases. These gaps provide opportunities for vehicles to
enter and exit Clover Drive.

    The capacity analysis shows that during the Existing PM Peak Hour the eastbound delay on
Clover Drive is 49.4-seconds. This represents a level of service E and is only 0.6-seconds above
a level of service F.

    Although gaps in the traffic stream are created by the traffic signals and the overall volume
of traffic exiting Clover Drive is minimal; vehicles turning left increase the overall average delay
for this approach.

    The highway capacity analysis of the study intersections shows that the development of this
property will have no perceptible impact to the level of service on the surrounding roadway
network.

    The existing curvature of Clover Drive limits the stopping sight distance for motorist. This
curvature also affects the intersection sight distance from the proposed site driveway and the
existing driveways to the west. The recommended stopping sight and intersection sight distances
increase in connection with travel speed. The combined 85th percentile travel speed on Clover
Drive was recorded at 31.9-miles per hour.

MITIGATION
    Clover Drive and Middle Neck Road: The proposed project will not have a perceptible
impact to the delay at this intersection. However, as the delay during the pm peak hour is above
the generally accepted limits during the Existing and Future conditions the following mitigation
measure is provided for consideration by the Village. In order to reduce the overall delay the
Village may want to consider restricting left turns from Clover Drive during the pm peak hour
from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm. This measure would reduce the delay from 51.6-seconds to
13.9-seconds. This represents an improvement from a level of service F to level of service B.



                                               - 91 -
   The accident history does not support the need for this restriction. The overall volume of
exiting Clover Drive during the evening peak hour is 24-vehicles or 1-vehicle every 2.5-minutes.
Therefore motorists can wait for a gap in traffic to turn left without impacting other drivers.

   This restriction would require the review and approval of the Nassau County Department of
Public Works.

   Clover Drive: The vertical alignment of Clover Drive limits the sight distance from the
proposed site access. It also limits the stopping sight distance for motorists traveling along
Clover Drive. On Saturday up to 150 pedestrian were observed travelling along Clover Drive. It
was observed that the large majority travelled within the roadway and did not use the sidewalk
area. In addition the subject property is located across the street from a school.

   In accordance with Section 2C.18 of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, the
applicant proposes to install a dual set of W7-6 and W13-1P signs on the north and south sides of
Clover drive facing eastbound and westbound traffic. The two signs facing westbound traffic will
be installed on either side of Clover Drive in proximity to and replace the existing Hidden
Driveway sign, to the east of the subject site. The second set of signs would be installed to the
west of the property facing eastbound traffic. The W7-6 sign reads "HILL BLOCKS VIEW" and
the W13-1P sign reads "15 MPH".

   The intent of the proposed signage is to influence driver behavior and lower travel speeds.
Lowering the travel speed on Clover Drive will increase safety and reduce the stopping and
intersection sight distance requirements to compensate for the existing geometry of Clover
Drive.

If approved, the applicant would be responsible for the cost associated with these improvements.

ALTERNATIVE BUILD CONDITION
   The following tables provide the results of the highway capacity analysis prepared for this
project in terms of level of service and delay experienced at the study intersections, under the
Altenative Build Conditions. The delay provided for signalized intersections represents the
overall average intersection delay in seconds. The delay provided for unsignalized intersections
represents the control delay on the critical approach in seconds. The technical appendix includes
the highway capacity analysis output files detailing the level of service and delay at each of the
study intersections.

   Alternative Build Conditions: As part of our analysis several alternative developments were
considered for comparison to the proposed development. These alternative build conditions
include:

   No-Action Alternative: This alternative considers the potential impacts of leaving the site in
its present state. The future traffic conditions under this alternative are equivalent to the no build
conditions.

   As-of-Right Alternative: Under this alternative a total of 9-single family homes would be
constructed, replacing the existing single family home on the site.

   Subdivision Including Reservation of Parkland: The future build condition under this
alternative would be equivalent to the as-of-right build condition. The reservation of parkland
would be maintained in lieu of a financial payment to the Village.

   Workforce Housing: The site would be developed with a total of 120-apartment units. The
apartment complex would consist of two 3-story buildings. The first building would provide for
emergency workforce housing with a unit mix includes 5-studios, 10-one bedroom and 9-two
bedroom apartments (24-units). The second building would provide market rate units including
24-one bedroom, 45-two bedroom and 27-three bedroom apartments.

   Religious Use: This alternative examines the potential impact of a 15,000-sf Church with
210-parking spaces. In order to analyze the potential impact of a proposed Church traffic counts
and analysis are provided for Sunday at the intersections along Clover Drive. The analysis
examines the peak adjusted flow rate for the peak entering and exiting conditions. The adjusted



                                                - 93 -
flow rate anticipates that all vehicles entering the site for Sunday Mass will arrive within a
15-minute period. The exiting traffic will depart from the site in the same fashion. These peak
events are analyzed separately to examine the peak flows entering and exiting the site. In order
to simulate this peak concentration a peak hour factor of 0.25 (60-minutes x 0.25 = 15-minutes)
is used to calculate the adjusted flow rate.

   Development with Alternative Access: Our understanding is that the subject site does not
have access to any public roadway other than Clover Drive. For this reason no analysis was
prepared for this alternative.

   The trip generation calculation for each use is provided within the technical appendix. The
trip generation calculation for the As-of-Right development utilizes the local trip generation data.

The eastbound approach of Clover Drive operates with a Level of Service E during the evening
peak hour under No Build Condition. The associated average delay is 48.1-seconds per vehicle.

If the site is developed under the As-of-Right Alternative without mitigation the average delay
for vehicles travelling eastbound on Clover Drive would increase by 4.6-seconds during the
evening peak hour. This increase in delay creates a change in the level of service for this
approach.

If the site is developed under the Workforce Housing Alternative without mitigation the
average delay for vehicles travelling eastbound on Clover Drive would increase by 23.2-seconds
during the evening peak hour. This increase in delay creates a change in the level of service for
this approach.

The eastbound approach of Clover Drive operates with a Level of Service C during the Saturday
peak hour under No Build Condition. The associated average delay is 24.9-seconds per vehicle.

If the site is developed under the Workforce Housing Alternative without mitigation the
average delay for vehicles travelling eastbound on Clover Drive would increase by 1.2-seconds
during the Saturday peak hour. This increase in delay creates a change in the level of service for
this approach.

If the site is developed under the Religious Use Alternative without mitigation the average
delay for vehicles travelling eastbound on Clover Drive would increase by 0.7-seconds during
the Saturday peak hour. This increase in delay creates a change in the level of service for this
approach.

The eastbound approach of Clover Drive operates with a Level of Service C during the Sunday
peak hour under No Build Condition. The associated average delay is 20.3-seconds per vehicle.

If the site is developed under the Religious Use Alternative without mitigation the average
delay for vehicles travelling eastbound on Clover Drive would increase by 110.4-seconds during
the Sunday peak hour when vehicles are arriving at the site.

On Sunday as vehicles are leaving the site the average delay for vehicles travelling eastbound on
Clover Drive would increase by 159.4-seconds per vehicle.

These increases in delay create a change in the level of service for this approach. The level of
service would decrease from a Level of Service E in the No Build Condition to a Level of
Service F, under the Religious Use Alternative.

BUILD ALTERNATIVE COMPARISON
    The proposed development will generate less traffic than the Religious Use or Workforce
Housing Alternatives. The Workforce Housing and Religious Use Alternatives will have a
greater impact on the level of service and delays on the roadway network surrounding the subject
site.

                                      CONCLUSIONS
   In summary, the proposed project will redevelop the existing single family home located at
100 Clover Drive and construct 11-single family homes along a private roadway and cul-de-sac. The
private roadway will intersect with Clover Drive west of Middle Neck Road.

   Parking is provided for each of the 12-single family homes. Each home will have a private
driveway leading to an attached two car garage. The number of parking spaces provided meets the
requirements of the Village of Great Neck and Great Neck Estates.

   The private roadway and cul-de-sac have been designed in accordance with standard engineering
practices. The private roadway will provide two-way traffic flow via one 13-foot lane in each
direction. Pedestrian access is provided via a five foot sidewalk. The home located at 100 Clover
Drive will continue to have access on Clover Drive. The other homes will have individual driveways
connecting to the private roadway.

   The site is anticipated to generate a maximum of 19-trips during the evening peak hour
(11-entering and 8-exiting the site). As these trips are distributed through the roadway network
the potential impact becomes de minimis. One vehicle is equivalent to approximately 9% of the
entering traffic and 12% of the exiting traffic.

   During the peak hour the proposed site is anticipated to generate less then 1-entering trip
every 5-minutes and 1-exiting trip every 7-minutes. This equates to less than 1-trip every
3-minutes entering or exiting the site.

   The traffic signals along Middle Neck Road have a cycle length of approximately
60-seconds. Cycle length refers to the time required for one complete sequence of all signal
indications. The total site generated traffic would add 1-vehicle during the course of 3-complete
cycle lengths.

   The level of traffic generated by the subject site will have no perceptible impact to the level
of service on the surrounding roadway network.

    The applicant is proposing two potential mitigation measures to address existing traffic issues
on Clover Drive. The first mitigation measure would be to restrict left turn movements from
Clover Drive during the pm peak hour from 4:00pm to 6:00pm. This mitigation measure is
presented due to the existing delay experience by vehicles turning left from Clover Drive onto
Middle Neck Road. Although these vehicles need to wait approximately 50-seconds we do not
believe this is a safety issue. The accident history at this intersection does not support the need
for this restriction.

    The finding of our sight distance analysis show that the proposed roadway meets the
recommended guidelines provided by the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), Guidelines for Geometric Design of Very Low-Volume
Local Roads (ADT400), 2001.

    The second mitigation measure relates to the safety of motorist and pedestrians on Clover
Drive. As part of the construction of the project the applicant proposes to install a series of
warning signs and advisory speed plaques related to the vertical grade change and limited sight
distance along Clover Drive. If approved the applicant would be responsible for the cost
associated with these improvements.

    The proposed development will generate less traffic than the Religious Use or Workforce
Housing Alternatives. The Workforce Housing and Religious Use Alternatives will have a
greater impact on the level of service and delays on the roadway network surrounding the subject
site.

INTRODUCTION


This traffic impact study summarizes the potential impacts of the proposed development of a Pickle
Barrel Restaurant in Billings, Montana. The proposed project is located on the northwest corner of
the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive on the west end of Billings.


The purpose of this traffic impact study (TIS) is to assess the impacts that this development may
have on the surrounding transportation system, and to provide recommendations to mitigate any
impacts identified. The methodology and analysis procedures used in this study employ the latest
technology and nationally accepted standards in the area of site development and transportation
impact assessment. Recommendations made in this report are based on professional judgment and
these principles.


SITE LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION


The proposed project would consist of redevelopment of the existing day care building located on
the northwest corner of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive. The project site is located on Lot 2,
Block 28 of Harvest Subdivision, 3rd Filing, which is shared with several existing residential
condominiums. The site is bordered by 32nd Street West to the east, Rosebud Drive to the south
and existing residential development to the north and west. Figure 1 shows the vicinity of the
proposed development.


The site currently consists of a 2000 square-foot day care building and 15 residential condominium
units. The condo units are occupied, but the day care is currently vacant. Pending a zone change
application, the vacant day care building will be remodeled for the Pickle Barrel Restaurant. The
new restaurant will have approximately 2000 square feet of interior space and an outdoor patio
estimated at approximately 500 square feet. The site is accessed by an existing driveway along
Rosebud Drive, as well as a direct access to 32nd Street West on the north side of the restaurant.
Because of the location of the customer parking and the building entrance on the south side of the
building, it is likely that most of the customer traffic would enter via the Rosebud access. When the
Rosebud intersection is congested, it is possible that some drivers will use the 32nd Street access
instead, particularly to exit the site. Figure 2 shows the proposed site layout.

EXISTING CONDITIONS


Streets
The proposed redevelopment of the Pickle Barrel site may have a direct impact on the adjacent
streets and intersections. The following paragraphs describe the existing area roadways that are
most likely to be affected by the traffic volumes generated by this development.


32nd Street West
Classified as a principal arterial in the City of Billings functional classification system, 32nd Street
West provides north-south access from Hesper Road at the south end to Broadwater Avenue where
it becomes Zimmerman Trail and continues to the north side of the Rimrocks where it intersects US
Highway 3 west of the airport. Near the project vicinity, 32nd Street West has a three-lane cross
section with a two-way left-turn lane and traffic signals at major intersections. Traffic count data
recently collected by the City of Billings shows Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes of
16,600 vehicles per day (vpd) in August 2012 and 15,500 vpd in November 2012. The posted speed
limit on 32nd Street West is 35 mph.


Rosebud Drive
Rosebud Drive is classified as a local street in the Billings functional classification system. It
provides access to primarily residential properties located on both the west and east sides of 32nd
Street West. Rosebud Drive is a two-lane roadway with stop control at 32nd Street West and
uncontrolled intersections within the neighborhoods on either side. There is not a posted speed
limit on 32nd Street West, but it is generally considered to be 25 mph, as with all local residential
streets.


King Avenue West
King Avenue West is classified as a principal arterial in the Billings functional classification system.
It provides east-west access between the West Billings Interstate 90 Interchange and its terminus
near 80th Street West on the far west end of the Billings area. Within the vicinity of 32nd Street
West, King Avenue West consists of a five-lane section with raised median and provides access to a
mix of commercial and residential development. Traffic volumes on King Avenue West range from
approximately 10,000 vpd near 32nd Street West to 25,000 vpd near 24th Street West where the

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                     4
                                                                      PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


commercial traffic increases significantly. King Avenue West has a posted speed limit of 35 mph
near the project vicinity.


Monad Road
Monad Road is classified as a minor arterial in the Billings functional classification system. It
provides east-west access from Shiloh Road on the west end to Moore Lane near its intersection
with Laurel Road on the east end. It generally consists of a single lane in each direction with
dedicated turn lanes at major intersections. Monad Road has a posted speed limit of 35 mph.


Intersections
The following paragraphs describe the existing area intersections that are most likely to be impacted
by the redevelopment of the proposed Pickle Barrel site.

32nd Street West & Rosebud Drive
The intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive is a two-way stop-controlled intersection
with stop signs located on the eastbound and westbound Rosebud Drive approaches.                The
northbound and southbound approaches consist of dedicated left-turn lanes provided by the newly
striped two-way left-turn lane. The eastbound and westbound approaches provide a single lane for
all movements, although adequate width is available for a right-turning vehicle to get around another
vehicle waiting to turn left.


32nd Street West & King Avenue West
The intersection of 32nd Street West and King Avenue West is controlled by an existing fully-
actuated traffic signal. The northbound and southbound approaches consist of three separate
approach lanes to accommodate left-turn, thru, and right-turn movements.            The westbound
approach consists of a dedicated left-turn lane, two thru lanes, and a dedicated right-turn lane. The
eastbound approach consists of a dedicated left-turn lane, one thru lane and one shared thru/right-
turn lane. The existing traffic signal provides for protected/permitted left-turn phasing for all
approaches with an overall peak-hour cycle length of approximately 100 seconds.




SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                  5
                                                                      PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


32nd Street West & Monad Road
The intersection of 32nd Street West and Monad Road is also controlled by a fully-actuated traffic
signal. The northbound, southbound, and eastbound approaches all consist of a dedicated left-turn
lane and a shared thru/right-turn lane. The westbound approach has three separate lanes for left-
turn, thru and right-turn movements. The existing traffic signal provides for protected/permitted
left-turn phasing for the northbound and southbound approaches, but does not provide a protected
phase for eastbound or westbound left-turn movements.        The overall peak-hour cycle length was
measured to be approximately 80 seconds.


Traffic Volumes
Existing weekday noon and PM peak hour turning movement counts were collected for the study
area intersections in November 2012. The noon peak hour was assumed to be from 12:00 to 1:00
PM and the PM peak hour was assumed to be from 4:30 to 5:30 PM. MDT seasonal adjustment
factors for the month of November were applied to the existing traffic volumes.             Figure 3
summarizes the peak hour turning movement volumes, and detailed traffic count data are included
in Appendix A.


Intersection Capacity
Capacity calculations were performed for the study area intersections using Synchro 8 (Version
8.0.802.685), which is based on 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM2010) methodologies. The
HCM2010 defines level of service (LOS) as "a quality measure describing operational conditions
within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures as speed and travel time, freedom
to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience." LOS is a qualitative measure of the
performance of an intersection with values ranging from LOS A, indicating good operation and low
vehicle delays, to LOS F, which indicates congestion and longer vehicle delays.


The City of Billings generally considers LOS C as the minimum standard for acceptable peak hour
intersection operations. As shown by the results in Table 1, most of the study area intersection
approaches currently operate at LOS C or better during both the noon and PM peak hours. The
one exception is the eastbound approach to the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud
Drive, which currently operates at LOS F during both peak periods. Detailed capacity calculation
worksheets for existing conditions are provided in Appendix B.

TRIP GENERATION


An accurate estimate of site-generated traffic must be made in order to analyze the impacts of a new
development. The most common source for determining trip generation rates is Trip Generation, 8th
Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The land use categories
available in this manual that would be the closest to the characteristics of a Pickle Barrel Restaurant
would be the Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-through Window (ITE Land Use 934) and the High-
turnover (Sit-down) Restaurant (ITE Land Use 932). Through discussions with the City of Billings
Engineering Department it was agreed that neither of these categories fully represent a sandwich
shop like the Pickle Barrel, which does not have a drive-through window and where customers order
at the counter and then sit down or take the food to go. It was anticipated that the trip generation
characteristics of this type of restaurant would fall somewhere between the trip generation rates of a
fast-food restaurant and a high-turnover sit-down restaurant.

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                    8
                                                                            PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS




Therefore, trip generation data was collected at two local restaurants that are similar in nature to the
Pickle Barrel. The selection of restaurants was approved ahead of time by the City of Billings
Engineering Department and included the Pita Pit Restaurant on Grand Avenue (west of 24th Street
West) and the Spicy Pickle Restaurant on 24th Street West (south of King Avenue West). As shown
by the results provided in Appendix C, trip generation data was collected during both of the peak
periods used for this study, the weekday noon peak hour and the weekday PM peak hour. Data was
also collected during the Saturday noon peak hour at the Pita Pit and has been provided for
comparison purposes even though this peak hour was not considered for further analysis.


The resulting noon and PM peak hour trip generation rates were then used to estimate the number
of trips that will be generated by the proposed Pickle Barrel Restaurant, as shown in Table 2 below.
In order to be conservative, the maximum peak hour trip generation rate of the two restaurants
discussed above was used to estimate the peak hour trip generation for the Pickle Barrel, as opposed
to using the average of the two. The Spicy Pickle data was higher for the weekday noon peak hour,
but the Pita Pit was higher for the weekday PM peak hour. The average weekday rate shown in
Table 2 was based on the proportion of average weekday and PM peak hour trip generation
estimates in the ITE Trip Generation manual.

In order to estimate the net number of new trips made by personal vehicles external to the site,
adjustments should often be made to account for internal capture trips, pass-by trips and trips made

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                            9

by alternate modes. Internal capture trips are those that are made from one on-site development to
another using internal roadways. Mixed-use developments often have a high number of internal
trips made between the various land uses. For this site in particular, it is possible that internal trips
would be generated between the residential condos and the Pickle Barrel Restaurant, but these trips
are not expected to make up a significant portion of the average weekday trips and were therefore
not accounted for in this analysis.


Pass-by trips are trips made to a development as a secondary destination, but the primary trip path is
on the adjacent street system. Commercial developments often generate a significant amount of
pass-by trips. As shown in Table 2, pass-by rates were estimated for the restaurant based on data
summarized in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition. The pass-by rate used for the Pickle
Barrel restaurant was the lower (and more conservative) of the rates provided for fast-food
restaurant with drive-through window and high-turnover sit-down restaurant.


Typically, it is also important to estimate the number of new trips that would be made by alternate
modes of travel (pedestrian, bicycle and transit). These trips would not involve new external
personal vehicles accessing the site.     The Pickle Barrel site will likely generate quite a bit of
pedestrian and bicycle traffic from nearby residential neighborhoods, but it is not anticipated that it
would have a significant effect on the results of this analysis. In order to add a measure of
conservatism to the study, no reductions were made for alternate mode trips.


Table 2 provides a breakdown of each of these trip types. Results of this analysis show that the
redevelopment of the proposed Pickle Barrel site would generate approximately 310 new personal
vehicle trips during the average weekday (combination of new external trips and pass-by trips).
Approximately 75 (37 entering and 38 exiting) of those trips would be generated during the noon
peak hour and 21 (11 entering and 10 exiting) would be generated during the PM peak hour.


Comparison to Other Land Use Scenarios
As noted previously, it was anticipated that the trip generation rates for the Pickle Barrel Restaurant
should fall somewhere in the middle of what would have been estimated using either of the
restaurant land uses available in the ITE Trip Generation manual (fast-food restaurant with drive-
through window or high-turnover sit-down restaurant). Therefore, it is relevant to compare the

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                     10
                                                                         PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


results of the trip generation data collection effort to determine if that was indeed the case. The ITE
Trip Generation manual does not include data specifically for the noon peak hour, but a general
comparison can be made for the PM peak hour data. The PM peak hour rate estimated for the
Pickle Barrel Restaurant in Table 2 is on the same order of magnitude as the PM peak hour average
rate for a high-turnover sit-down restaurant in the ITE manual (8.46 vs. 11.15). Interestingly, the
noon peak hour rate shown in Table 2 is very close to the PM peak hour rate for fast-food
restaurant with drive-through window in the ITE manual (30.00 vs. 33.84). What this tells us is that
the trip generation data collection effort completed for this analysis produced reasonable results
compared to the ITE data. However, had we used the ITE data, we would not have been able to
adequately estimate trips generated during the noon peak hour, which clearly represents the worst-
case scenario for a sandwich shop located on Billings' West End.


It is also relevant to compare the trip generation estimates for the Pickle Barrel Restaurant to the
original day care center land use. This site was previously approved for a 2000 square-foot day care
center for up to 72 children under the current zoning designation. The ITE Trip Generation
manual shows that a Day Care Center (ITE Land Use 565) could be estimated to generate 12.46
trips per 1000 square feet of gross floor area or 0.82 trips per student in the PM peak hour. Based
on gross floor area, the Pickle Barrel Restaurant will generate very close to the same number of trips
during the PM peak hour (25 trips for the day care vs. 21 trips for the Pickle Barrel). If trip
generation for the day care were estimated using the rate based on number of students, we would
see a significantly higher number of trips for the day care center (59 trips for the day care vs. 21 trips
for the Pickle Barrel). Either way, this analysis shows that the Pickle Barrel Restaurant should
generate the same or fewer trips than the previous land use of day care center.


TRIP DISTRIBUTION


Trip distribution is an estimate of site-generated trip origin and destination locations, which can be
determined by several methods from computerized travel demand models to simple inspection of
existing traffic volumes. For this study, the trip distribution was primarily based on the distribution
of existing traffic volumes at the study area intersections and existing driveways, as well as the
location of regional highways and commercial areas. Although a portion of the traffic generated by
the site will use the driveway north of the proposed Pickle Barrel building, for the purposes of this

SANDERSON STEWART                                                                                      11
                                                                       PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


analysis, it was assumed that this driveway would primarily be used by employees accessing the back
of the building during non-peak periods. The noon and PM peak hour traffic generated by the site
is expected to be made up entirely of customer traffic and would therefore access the site via the
Rosebud driveway. The trip distribution for the proposed development is illustrated in Figure 4.


TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT


Traffic assignment is the procedure where site-generated vehicle trips are assigned to the study area
intersections and site access driveways. The assignment of site-generated traffic is based on the
development's trip distribution, physical attributes of the development site, and the surrounding
street system. Based on this approach, the site-generated trips were assigned to the study area
roadway network as illustrated in Figure 4.


TRAFFIC IMPACTS


Existing + Project Traffic Volumes
Existing + Project traffic volumes represent an estimate of the traffic volumes forecasted to be on
the street network at the time period when the site is expected to be reconstructed. The resulting
combination of existing traffic volumes and the new site-generated traffic volumes is illustrated in
Figure 5. Because the redevelopment of the site is expected to occur in the immediate future, it was
not necessary to consider future background traffic growth in this analysis.


Existing + Project Capacity Analysis
Existing + Project intersection operations were evaluated using the same methodologies discussed in
the evaluation of existing conditions. The LOS analysis is based on the Existing + Project traffic
volumes shown in Figure 5, utilizing existing intersection geometry and traffic control at all
intersections. Table 3 summarizes the noon and PM peak hour Existing + Project LOS at the study
area intersections. The results for existing conditions are also provided for comparison purposes.

As shown in Table 3, the addition of traffic generated by the proposed Pickle Barrel Restaurant
would result in only very minor increases in approach delay. The existing capacity issue at the
intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive would get even worse with the addition of site-
generated traffic, but none of the other impacts would be significant enough to result in degradation
in level of service. Detailed capacity calculation worksheets for the Existing + Project scenario are
provided in Appendix D.

Mitigation Measures
Improvement alternatives were evaluated to mitigate capacity concerns at the intersection of 32nd
Street West and Rosebud Drive. The most logical options for improvement include the installation
of a traffic signal or the installation of a raised median to limit the intersection to three-quarter
access.   These options are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.                  Capacity
calculations were performed for both of these alternatives as summarized in Table 4 on page 17.
Detailed capacity calculation reports and signal warrant worksheets are provided in Appendix E.

                                                                         PICKLE BARREL RESTAURANT TIS


Improvement Alternative 1: Traffic Signal at 32nd Street West & Rosebud Drive
The first improvement alternative evaluated at the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud
Drive was the installation of a traffic signal. For the purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that
the lane configurations would stay the same as existing conditions, and the signal would provide for
permitted left-turn movements only with the overall cycle length on the order of 80 seconds.
Capacity calculation results provided in Table 4 show that the eastbound approach to the
intersection would be improved from LOS F to LOS B for both peak periods, while the northbound
and southbound approaches could still be expected to operate at LOS A.


The need for a traffic signal at this intersection was further evaluated using the traffic signal warrants
provided in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2009 Edition. The three volume
warrants (warrants 1-3) were fairly easy to consider using the data collected for this study.
Additional data will need to be collected in order to complete a comprehensive warrant analysis that
addresses the remaining warrants.        Results of this preliminary analysis of warrants 1-3 (see
worksheets provided in Appendix E) show that the intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud
Drive would meet all three of the volume warrants for a traffic signal under existing conditions. The
need for a traffic signal (or some other form of intersection control) would only increase with the
addition of site-generated traffic.


Although the proposed traffic signal is likely warranted and capacity calculation results show that it
would provide for significant improvement over existing conditions, there are some valid concerns
associated with the signalized alternative. The primary concern is related to the close proximity to
the signalized intersection of 32nd Street West and King Avenue West. The distance between the
two intersections is approximately 600 feet and queues at the King Avenue West intersection have
occasionally backed up beyond the Henesta Drive intersection and near the Rosebud Drive
intersection. Therefore, if the signalized alternative is pursued, a critical component of the design
will be the need for coordination between these two intersections and throughout the 32nd Street
West corridor. While this alternative may be less desirable to the City of Billings due to the close
proximity between signals, it will certainly be the much more desirable alternative to nearby property
owners due the improved access and ease of getting onto 32nd Street West from Rosebud Drive.

Improvement Alternative 2: Three-Quarter Access at 32nd Street West & Rosebud Drive
The second alternative evaluated for improvement to the intersection of 32nd Street West and
Rosebud Drive consists of installing a raised median within the vicinity of the intersection to
implement what is commonly referred to as three-quarter access control.          All of the existing
northbound and southbound movements would still be allowed, but the eastbound and westbound
movements would be limited to right-turn only. The eastbound/westbound thru and left-turn
movements would be eliminated. With this type of treatment, the minor approach delay can be
improved significantly by eliminating the wait time associated with making a left-turn onto the
higher-volume arterial roadway. As shown by the results in Table 4, this would be the case with this
particular intersection. The eastbound approach could be improved from LOS F to LOS B for both
the noon and PM peak periods.


This improvement alternative would likely be the more desirable alternative for the City of Billings
given their concerns about closely spaced signalized intersections. However, it will most definitely
be the less desirable alternative for surrounding property owners due to common complaints about
reduced access and overall effectiveness of these types of treatments for individual intersections
when the rest of the corridor does not have raised median. Results of this analysis show that either
improvement alternative would result in acceptable intersection operations for the Existing + Site
traffic volume scenario.    The final decision regarding which of the options would be most
appropriate for this intersection will have to be based on input provided by the City of Billings and
the adjacent property owners.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


The preceding analysis provides a summary of existing conditions, as well as trip generation, traffic
assignment, and the resultant capacity analysis for the proposed Pickle Barrel Restaurant on 32nd
Street West. The new site is expected to generate approximately 310 new average weekday trips
with 75 and 21 new vehicle trips occurring during the noon and PM peak hours, respectively.
Capacity analysis results show that the proposed project would have only minor impacts to traffic
operations on the surrounding roadways.        However, an existing traffic capacity issue at the

intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive would be made even worse with the addition of
traffic generated by the new Pickle Barrel Restaurant.


Two different improvement options were considered to alleviate the capacity concerns at this
intersection. The first option is the installation of a new traffic signal at the intersection and the
second is the installation of a raised median to limit access at the intersection to three-quarter access.
MUTCD traffic signal warrants would likely be met for both the existing and existing + site traffic
volume scenarios. Capacity calculation results show that either improvement alternative would
result in acceptable intersection operations for the Existing + Site traffic volume scenario.
Therefore, it is recommended that the final decision regarding which of the improvement
alternatives would be most appropriate for this location be based on input provided by the City of
Billings and the adjacent property owners.


The City of Billings will often times consider a developer contribution toward the cost of
improvements at an impacted intersection based on the development's portion of the total entering
volume at the intersection.      The Pickle Barrel's portion of the total entering volume at the
intersection of 32nd Street West and Rosebud Drive is 4% during the noon peak hour and 1%
during the PM peak hour. Therefore, based on this method of calculating developer contribution,
the developer of the Pickle Barrel Restaurant should not be responsible for more than 4% of the
cost of improvements.


It is recommended that a more comprehensive signal warrant analysis be completed for this
intersection prior to the installation of a traffic signal. Regardless of which improvement alternative
is ultimately selected, it is also recommended that the City of Billings consider an evaluation of
potential signal timing coordination for the 32nd Street West corridor.              With better traffic
progression between signalized intersections, overall corridor operations could likely be improved
significantly. These and any other improvements made shall be completed in accordance with City
of Billings standards and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2009 Edition. If
these improvements are implemented as recommended, traffic on area roadways should continue to
operate in a safe and efficient manner.

                          The Site Planning Process


In our site planning process the sequence of actions moved from inventory and analysis
of existing conditions to conceptual design alternatives (including neighborhood
participation) to a final design.
Site Inventory and Analysis
The first step in the planning process involved an extensive look at the site's current
condition. This process of inventory and analysis is an important step because it
clarifies how the site functions in its present condition. A large number of maps, plans,
photographs and background information concerning the site were compiled. Natural
features and the built environment were documented through on-site inspection.
Elements that were studied included: slopes, soils, vegetation, utilities (water, sewer,
gas, storm drainage), views, access and circulation.




 Additionally a zoning analysis was developed indicating that the build-out of this
property could support up to 50 residential units plus an additional 4 commercial units.
Conceptual Design Alternatives
Eight conceptual site designs were developed indicating various ways to locate
buildings, roadways, walkways, parking areas and plantings. Design alternatives ranged
in size from 44 ­ 50 apartments.
The site plan alternatives were reviewed, revised and re-designed. Concept #8, which
included 48 units, appeared to address the project's goals including:

   ·   Safe pedestrian and vehicular access

   ·   More than adequate parking

   ·   Open space

   ·   Vegetative buffering

   ·   Generously landscaped




But it still lacked certain elements that would create a strong sense of community. So
the team revised this concept by eliminating 8 centrally located units and designing a
town common in its place.
The revised town common plan (40 units) creates a park-like setting throughout the
development while linking residential and recreational elements. The focal point of the
common area is a community building that will house a management office,
maintenance area, laundry facilities, meeting rooms and a community mailbox area.
Other elements of the common include: playground, picnic areas, walkways, plazas,
lawns, site furnishings, lighting and landscaping.
At this point in the conceptual design phase we were ready for some community
"outreach" regarding neighborhood concerns, questions and input. After two separate
workshops with the neighborhood regarding the Town Common Concept (40 units) we
listened and heard a number of concerns. Three comments included the following:

   ·   The Common area at Parsons Village will be a wonderful and great asset to the
       neighborhood and residents

   ·   Can you somehow make this asset feel more connected to the neighborhood and
       more accessible to the community?

   ·   Can the density be reduced even more?




                      Community "outreach" (November 2010)
The team offered to meet again with the neighborhood with revised plans. Back at the
drawing board revealed that if we reduced the project to 38 units and realigned the
entrance drive we could create a welcoming physical connection from Parsons Street to
the common area through a landscaped "pocket park".




The revised plan (38 units) creates a pedestrian friendly, naturalistic entrance to the
Parsons Village common area. This would allow neighbors to feel comfortable
accessing the common area while providing even more open space to the development.

Traffic Report
TRAFFIC IMPACT REPORT
Parsons Village
69 Parsons Street
Easthampton, MA
December 27, 2010

The following report summarizes the analysis and evaluation of the traffic impact of a proposed 38
unit apartment complex to be located on Parsons Street in Easthampton, Massachusetts. This report
presents the results of a field investigation, traffic counts, analysis of the estimated increased traffic
to be generated by the site, and the resulting traffic increases on the adjacent roadway. Graphical
figures, capacity analysis worksheets and count data summaries are appended.

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
The proposed site for this project is on a vacant lot located on the east side of Parsons Street. The
nearest major intersections on Parsons Street nearest the site are the intersection of Ferry Street @
Parsons Street and the intersection of Parsons Street @ Everett Street & James Lane. The proposed
project will include the construction of a 38 unit apartment complex, along with associated parking
and infrastructure. There will be a separate common building for use by the tenants of the complex
and as such the common building would not contribute to additional traffic..

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

The proposed site would be accessed from Parsons Street. Automatic traffic recorders, (ATR's)
were placed on Parsons Street at the approximate location of the site in order to determine the
existing traffic patterns and distribution of traffic to and from the site. The ATR's were installed for
a total of 3 days, (from Tuesday October 26, 2010 through Thursday October 28, 2010.)

Traffic turning movements were also conducted for the morning and afternoon peak hours at the
two major intersections likely to be effected by the proposed project, the intersection of Ferry Street
@ Parsons Street and the intersection of Parsons Street @ Everett Street & James Lane. These
turning movement counts were conducted from 7:30 AM- 9:30 AM and from 3:30 PM ­ 5:30 PM
on Wednesday October 27, 2010.

The results of these traffic counts are included in the attached tabulated data sheets.

PROPOSED TRAFFIC GENERATION

The proposed project will consist of the construction of a 38 unit apartment complex.

The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) "Trip Generation" report uses actual field surveys
to estimate trips associated with a variety of land uses and is a nationally accepted standard. The ITE
report was used to project traffic volumes for the proposed use of the property. The ITE Land Use
Code 220 Apartment Building was used assuming a 38 unit apartment.

The traffic to be generated by the project during the weekday morning peak hour is estimated at
approximately 19 vehicle trips (4 entering and 16 exiting). Traffic to be generated by the project



Page |1
during the weekday evening peak hour is estimated at approximately 24 vehicle trips (15 entering
and 8 exiting). The total weekday daily traffic to be generated by the project is estimated at
approximately 253 vehicle trips per day, (126 entering and 126 exiting). Saturday and Sunday trip
generations were slightly less. This is summarized below:


                             avg/unit  % entering     % leaving     Total    Entering  Leaving 
 AM peak hour 
 trips                         0.51           20         80          19         4        16

 Weekday ADT                   6.65           50         50         253        126       126 

 Saturday ADT                  6.39           50         50         243        121       121 

 Sunday ADT                    5.86           50         50         223        111       111 

                                       Table 1 Traffic Generation


The existing traffic was also analyzed considering a five year forecast of future traffic on Beech
Street, assuming a 1% growth rate per year, which is approximately what the region has experienced
based upon MDOT historical traffic counts.

The resulting traffic counts and projections are shown for the AM and PM peak hour for the build
and no-build condition, both for the 2010 and 2015 scenarios. (See the attached Figures 1 thru 4.)


TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

The two major intersections on Parsons Street were analyzed for Level of Service (LOS), and
Approach Delay for existing (no-build) and proposed (build)conditions in both the AM and PM
peak hour conditions, for current (2010) and future (2015) conditions. All approaches to the
intersections were found to be operating with a LOS of A or B, with the exception of the
Northbound Parsons Street which operated at a LOS of C.

The result of the analysis indicate that for all scenarios, the proposed project will have NO impact
on Level of Service, (LOS), and an insignificant effect on approach delay for both of the
intersections and for all approaches, (in both the 2010 and 2015 scenarios).

Level of Service for all movements, and Approach Delay and Approach LOS for the Stopped
Movements are shown in Table 2 for the Ferry Street@Parsons Street intersection and in
Table 3 for the Everett Street/James Lane@Parson Street intersection.

SUMMARY

The proposed apartment complex will only generate approximately 19 AM peak hour trips and 24
PM peak hour trips. An in-depth traffic analysis of the adjacent roadway and nearby intersections
which could potentially be most affected was conducted. The results of that analysis indicates that
in the AM peak hour and the PM peak hour, for both the 2010 and 2015 scenarios, the adjacent
roadway and nearest major intersections would experience no change in level of service and an
insignificant change in approach delay.

Based upon this study the project will have no discernable traffic impacts to the adjacent
intersections.

Economic Impact Statement
                               Financial Impact Statement


       Valley Community Development Corporation (Valley CDC) expects few costs
related to improving public services and infrastructure. The development has been
planned in coordination with existing infrastructure and as of now, will not have a
considerable impact on the community. Based on the statistics of Valley CDC's current
developments, we expect to provide housing for approximately 72 to 80 residents with
the Parsons development. These averages are based on the actual number of residents
currently residing in Valley CDC's efficiency, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-
bedroom apartments (43 units with 90 residents total). Although the residents will not
generate property tax revenue, they will increase sales tax revenue and personal income
tax revenue. Though the residents themselves will not be paying property taxes, Valley
CDC, as the owner of the property, will be paying property taxes therefore contributing to
the City's property tax revenue. Valley CDC expects that approximately 28 children will
reside in this development, which is again based on the number of children that the
families in Valley's two and three-bedroom units currently have. It is expected that less
than half that number will be school-age children (K-12), therefore having little impact
on the public school system. Furthermore, Valley CDC expects that there will be a
significant number who are already Easthampton residents therefore making any impact
caused by the number of residents or children negligible. Valley CDC foresees that the
City's employment levels will rise, but again the margin of change will depend on how
many of the development's residents already live and/or work in Easthampton. Although
there are not currently any plans for improvements to public services or infrastructure,
Valley would consider the creation of a bus stop and/or be willing to discuss traffic
calming methods along Parsons Street with City officials if appropriate. Such changes, if
indicated by need, would be beneficial to Easthampton residents.


       Studies have shown that affordable housing developments, especially those
developed by non-profit community development corporations (CDCs), have little to no
impact on surrounding property values (Ahrentzen 2008, Maxfield Research Inc. 2000).
In many of these studies, there was even an increase in property values ("The Impact of
Affordable Housing on Property Values," Bratt). Valley feels that these studies are
applicable as they all examine the impact of affordable rental properties that are similar to
the scale and location of the Parsons development. Based on a 2009 study by the National
Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the estimated first year impact of the Parsons
development on the local community and surrounding area would include $3.02 million
accrued in local income, $314,260 in local taxes and fees revenue, and the creation of 46
jobs, all of which would benefit Easthampton. After the first year, the recurring impacts
of the development would remain strong with $874,000 in local income, $150,100 in
local taxes and fees revenue, and 12 jobs. These statistics were generated using an
economic model developed by NAHB that analyzes the impact of different types of
housing developments. The numbers for the Parsons development have been prorated
based on 38 units of housing versus the 100 units studied in the 2009 model. The study's
assumptions in terms of land values and average rental unit market values are lower than
those of Easthampton, indicating that the numbers given are conservative estimates.
Valley CDC expects that the quality of the design and management of the Parsons
development will contribute to either sustaining current property values or possibly
increasing them, though Valley does not expect a significant loss or increase to the City's
tax revenues.

Parsons Street Neighborhood
Parsons Street neighborhood is a mixed-use residential street that once had more
commercial uses, but has changed over to predominantly residential use. The
residential uses in the immediate neighborhood vary in height, age, density and style.
The housing stock is mostly older, with some late Victorian homes and more recent
"factory housing" as well as a more recent single family subdivision. The neighborhood's
residential properties include duplexes with small yards, single family homes that have
been converted to multifamily uses, town houses, and single family tract housing.




In general, both the residential and commercial buildings along and near Parsons Street
help create a walkable traditional neighborhood structure: buildings face the street, are
set directly on the street or have very small setbacks, and front doors connect buildings
to the sidewalk. The buildings in the neighborhood range from one to three stories,
mostly falling into the two -story range. The one-story buildings are mostly the general
commercial buildings. On the other end of the spectrum, there are a few late Victorian
three story residential homes.
The Parsons Village property is located immediately adjacent to a cemetery, a 15 unit
residential rental development, and fairly dense residential lots of single family,
duplexes and triplex structures.




The graphic map shown below indicates various levels of density in the surrounding
neighborhood. Parsons Village will have a density of 8.7 Dwelling Units Per Acre.
A zoning analysis was performed indicating that the build-out of this property could
support up to 50 residential units plus an additional four commercial units.
Parsons Village Description
Parsons Village is a 38 unit planned apartment community set on 4.3 acres abutting the
New City neighborhood in Easthampton. Building placement takes full advantage of
solar access while allowing safe and ample vehicular circulation and parking for
residents and visitors. (76 total parking spaces)
Apartments at Parsons Village range in size from studio to three-bedroom units, and
rents range accordingly. Each unit has a private outdoor patio, storage shed and lawn
area. Viewsheds of the Mt. Tom mountain range have been preserved for many of the
units facing south.




The plan seeks to maximize open space amenities, including a large town common
area and an extensive landscaped walkway system which will benefit residents of both
existing and new housing. Picnic areas, playgrounds, plazas and extensive landscaping
create a park-like setting throughout the development while linking residential and
recreational elements.




Overall, Parsons Village is a cluster development that is generously landscaped with
attractive and useful open space and buildings that are compatible with the residential
character and scale of neighboring architecture.

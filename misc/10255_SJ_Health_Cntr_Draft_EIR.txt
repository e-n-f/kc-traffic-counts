County of Santa Clara                          iv          Draft EIR
San José Downtown Health Center                           March 2012
SUMMARY


The San José Downtown Health Center project proposes construction of a new 60,000 square foot
primary care health center on an approximately five-acre site located at the northwest corner of East
Santa Clara Street and North 17th Street in San José. The proposed health center would be three
stories tall (up to 65 feet).

While the project site is located within the City of San José, the County of Santa Clara owns the
project site and is the Lead Agency under CEQA.

The following is a brief summary of project impacts and mitigation measures. The reader is
referred to the main body text of the EIR for detailed discussions for the existing setting, impacts,
and mitigation measures.

                          Summary of Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The project would not result in impacts to the following resources, as discussed in the text of the
EIR:

    ·   Land Use                                            ·   Historic Resources

The project would result in less than significant impacts to the following resources, as discussed in
the text of the EIR:

    ·   Transportation                                      ·   Hazards and Hazardous Materials
    ·   Air Quality                                         ·   Trees
    ·   Noise                                               ·   Utilities and Service Systems
    ·   Aesthetics                                          ·   Energy
    ·   Geology and Soils                                   ·   Public Services
    ·   Hydrology and Water Quality

The project would result in less than significant impacts with the incorporation of the identified
mitigation to the following resources, as discussed in the text of the EIR:

    ·   Greenhouse Gas Emissions                            ·   Nesting Birds
    ·   Archaeological Resources

The table on the following pages summarizes the project impacts found to be less than significant
with the incorporation of the identified mitigation measures.

The project would not result in any significant and unavoidable impacts.

                                  Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Impact GHG ­ 1: The         MM GHG ­ 1.1: Prior to occupancy of the proposed health center,
construction and operation  the County shall prepare and implement a Greenhouse Gas Emissions
of the project would result Reduction Plan (GHG Plan) to offset the project-related incremental
in significant greenhouse   increase of greenhouse gas emissions exceeding 1,100 metric tons of
gas emissions.              carbon dioxide equivalents per year. Refinement of the project's
                            estimated GHG emissions would be completed as part of the GHG
Significant Impact          Reduction Plan in order to reflect the most current and accurate data
                            available regarding the project's estimated emissions (including
                            emission rates). Offsets may include, but are not limited to, the
                            following (in order of preference):

                                  1. Incorporation of on-site measures to offset project emissions, for
                                     example through development of a renewable energy generation
                                     facility or additional energy efficiency measures.
                                  2. Implementation of County projects that would result in real,
                                     permanent, verifiable, enforceable, and additional reduction in
                                     greenhouse gas emissions. (The County has developed a program
                                     to make investments in greenhouse gas reduction projects, such as
                                     photovoltaic solar installations and energy efficiency retrofits in
                                     County buildings.)
                                  3. Purchase of carbon credits. Carbon offset credits must be verified
                                     and registered with the Climate Registry, the Climate Action
                                     Reserve, or other source that is approved by the California Air
                                     Resources Board as being consistent with the policies and
                                     guidelines of the California Global Warming Solution Act of 2006
                                     (AB 32).

                                  Impact GHG ­ 1: The proposed project, with the implementation of
                                  the identified mitigation measure (MM GHG ­ 1.1), would not result
                                  in significant greenhouse gas emission impacts.

                                      notified and shall make a determination as to whether the remains
                                      are Native American. If the Coroner determines that the remains
                                      are not subject to his authority, he shall notify the Native
                                      American Heritage Commission who shall attempt to identify
                                      descendants of the deceased Native American. If no satisfactory

                                         Summary of Alternatives

CEQA requires that an EIR identify alternatives to a project as it is proposed. The CEQA Guidelines
specify that an EIR should identify alternatives that "will feasibly attain most of the basic objectives
of the project but will avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project." The
purpose of this section is to determine whether there are alternatives of design, scope or location that
will substantially lessen the significant impacts, even if those alternatives "impede to some degree
the attainment of the project objectives."

The project's primary objective is to provide urgent care and expanded primary healthcare services in
the downtown area. The County believes that a facility between 30,000 and 60,000 square feet in
size would be sufficient to provide the necessary services to meet the project's objective. Overall,
the County strives to construct and maintain well-planned County facilities that provide public
services in a sound financial manner in conformance with long-term sustainability policies.

No Project Alternatives

The CEQA Guidelines specifically require consideration of a "No Project" alternative. The
Guidelines specifically advise that the No Project Alternative is "what would be reasonably expected
to occur in the foreseeable future if the project were not approved, based on current plans and
consistent with available infrastructure and community services." The Guidelines emphasize that an
EIR should take a practical approach and not "... create and analyze a set of artificial assumptions
that would be required to preserve the existing physical environment [§15126.6(e)(3)(B)]."

The project site is currently developed with surface parking and landscaping. Under the No Project
Alternative, the project site could continue to remain as it does today or it could be developed with
uses consistent with the existing General Plan land use designation of Public/Quasi-Public. Under
the Public/Quasi-Public land use designation, the site could be redeveloped with County office
space. There are two logical No Project alternatives: 1) a No Project/No Development Alternative
and 2) a No Project/Development Alternative. These two alternatives are summarized below.

No Project/No Development Alternative

The No Project/No Development Alternative assumes that the project site would continue to remain
as is ­ developed with surface parking and landscaping. While the No Project/No Development
Alternative would avoid the project's impacts, it would not meet the project's objectives.

No Project/Development Alternative

The No Project/Development Alternative assumes that the project site is redeveloped with a 60,000
square foot office building. While the No Project/Development Alternative would have lesser
environmental impacts than the proposed project, it would not meet the project's primary objective
and may not meet the County's overall objective of providing County facilities that provide public
services.

Alternative Locations

The County considered a number of locations for the proposed downtown health center. In general,
the County was looking for a site that was a) located in downtown San José; b) accessible to drivers,
transit users, and pedestrians; c) and available for purchase or a long-term lease. The site also needed
to have sufficient parking for the project. If there was a building already developed on-site, the
condition of the building (including layout, size, and need/cost for improvements) was considered.

The County evaluated over 25 possible locations for the proposed health center. After evaluating
each possible location against the above listed criteria, four sites were considered further. The
proposed project site is one of the four downtown locations considered. The other three possible
locations were:

1.      25 North 14th Street;
2.      96 North 3rd Street; and
3.      210 North 4th Street.

25 North 14th Street Alternative Location

The alternative location at 25 North 14th Street in downtown San José is located approximately 680
feet west of the project site. This alternative location is currently developed with a 10-story office
building that was built in the late 1960s. Under this alternative location, the County would only lease
a portion of the building (60,000 square feet) for the proposed health center.

Because the proposed health center would be located in an existing building under this location
alternative, the project's impacts to archaeological resources and nesting birds would be avoided.
This alternative would also avoid the project's construction-related greenhouse gas emissions, but
would result in similar operational greenhouse gas emission as the proposed project. This alternative
would meet the project's primary objective, however, it may not meet the County's overall objective
of providing well-planned County facilities in a sound financial manner.

96 North 3rd Street Alternative Location

The alternative location at 96 North 3rd Street in downtown San José is currently developed with a
six-story office building. Under this alternative location, the County would only lease a portion of
the building (60,000 square feet) for the proposed health center.

Because the proposed health center would be located in an existing building under this location
alternative, the project's impacts to archaeological resources and nesting birds would be avoided.
This alternative would also avoid the project's construction-related greenhouse gas emissions, but
would result in similar operational greenhouse gas emission as the proposed project. This alternative
would meet the project's primary objective (but may not meet the County's overall objective for
providing well-planned County facilities). In addition, this alternative appears infeasible because the
building is not currently available for sale or lease.

210 North 4th Street Alternative Location

The alternative location at 210 North 4th Street is currently developed with a four-story office
building. Under this alternative location, the County would lease only a portion of the building
(60,000 square feet) for the proposed health center.

Because the proposed health center would be located in an existing building under this location
alternative, the project's impacts to archaeological resources and nesting birds would be avoided.
This alternative would also avoid the project's construction-related greenhouse gas emissions, but
would result in similar operational greenhouse gas emission as the proposed project. This alternative
would meet the project's primary objective (but may not meet the County's overall objective of
providing well-planned County facilities).

Reduced Scale Development Alternative

To avoid the project's significant greenhouse gas emissions impact, the Reduced Scale Development
Alternative consists of construction of a 26,000 square foot health center, about a 57 percent
reduction in size.

The Reduced Scale Development Alternative would avoid the project's significant and unavoidable
greenhouse gas emissions impact and result in the lesser impacts to archaeological resources and
nesting birds compared to the proposed project. This alternative, however, would only partially meet
the project's primary objective and may not meet the County's overall objective for long-term
sustainability for County facilities.

                    Known Views of Local Groups and Areas of Controversy

Issues raised by residents of San José and owners of property near the project site during community
outreach meetings include concerns related to traffic, aesthetics, impacts to trees, and construction-
related impacts.

SECTION 1.0            INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE


1.1            CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared by the County of Santa Clara as the Lead
Agency in conformance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the CEQA
Guidelines. The purpose of this EIR is to inform decision makers and the general public of the
environmental effects which might result from approval of the proposed San José Downtown Health
Center project. The proposed project is described in detail in Section 2.0 Project Information of
this Draft EIR.

1.1.1          Purpose of an EIR

The purpose and role of an EIR are detailed in CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. The following
guidelines are included in CEQA to clarify the role of an EIR:

        Section 15121(a). Informational Document. An EIR is an informational document which
        will inform public agency decision makers and the public generally of the significant
        environmental effect of a project, identify possible ways to minimize the significant effects,
        and describe reasonable alternatives to the project. The public agency shall consider the
        information in the EIR, along with other information which may be presented to the agency.

        Section 15146. Degree of Specificity. The degree of specificity required in an EIR will
        correspond to the degree of specificity involved in the underlying activity which is described
        in the EIR.

        (a)    An EIR on a construction project will necessarily be more detailed in the specific
               effects of a project than will an EIR on the adoption of a local general plan or
               comprehensive zoning ordinance because the effects of the construction can be
               predicted with greater accuracy.

        (b)    An EIR on a project such as the adoption or amendment of a comprehensive zoning
               ordinance or a local general plan should focus on the secondary effects that can be
               expected to follow from the adoption or amendment, but the EIR need not be as
               detailed as an EIR on the specific construction projects that might follow.

        Section 15151. Standards for Adequacy of an EIR. An EIR should be prepared with a
        sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision makers with information which enables them
        to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences. An
        evaluation of the environmental effects of a proposed project need not be exhaustive, but the
        sufficiency of an EIR is to be reviewed in the light of what is reasonably feasible.
        Disagreement among experts does not make an EIR inadequate, but the EIR should
        summarize the main points of disagreement among the experts. The courts have looked not
        for perfection, but for adequacy, completeness, and a good-faith effort at full disclosure.

1.1.2           Project Environmental Review Process

This document includes descriptions of the physical environment in the vicinity of the project, as
those conditions existed at the time the Notice of Preparation (NOP) circulated in December 2010.
In accordance with Section 15082 of the CEQA Guidelines, the NOP was circulated to the public and
responsible agencies for input regarding the analysis in this EIR. This EIR addresses those issues
which were raised by the public and responsible agencies in response to the NOP.

The consideration and discussion of environmental impacts that follow evaluate whether the
environmental effects are significant; that is: do those effects exceed stated levels, or "thresholds" of
significance. Mitigation measures, proposed to minimize the identified significant environmental
effects, are also described in the discussion of environmental impacts and mitigation measures, per
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.

003, 467-14-006 to -010, 467-14-082, 467-14-088, and a portion of 467-14-087). The project site is
bounded by East Saint John Street to the north, North 17th Street to the east, and East Santa Clara
Street to the south. 1 The project site is currently developed with a 34,000 square foot medical office
building (the Mediplex building), surface parking, and landscaping.

Regional and vicinity maps are shown on Figures 1 and 2, respectively. An aerial photograph of the
project site and surrounding area is provided on Figure 3.

The San José Medical Center, a privately-operated facility, formerly occupied an approximately 11-
acre property which includes the project site. This facility was closed in 2004. By June 2011, the
former hospital and medical buildings, with the exception of the Mediplex building and Building 800
(a portion of which is a historic resource) had been demolished. The environmental effects of
demolishing the San José Medical Center, including the Mediplex building and Building 800, were
previously addressed in the Demolition of the San José Medical Center Final EIR (April 2009) and
the Demolition of the San José Medical Center Addendum #1 to the Final EIR (April 2010). 2


2.2               PROJECT DESCRIPTION

2.2.1             New Health Center

The proposed San José Downtown Health Center project would involve the construction and
operation of a new 60,000 square foot primary care health center at the southeast corner of the
project site, fronting East Santa Clara Street. The proposed building would be three stories (up to 65
feet). A conceptual site plan is provided on Figure 4. The proposed health center would include
primary care (adult medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and urgent care for non-
emergency medical problems), outpatient imaging, laboratory services (specimen collection only),
and outpatient pharmacy. There would be no surgery or other services requiring patient stays and no
patient visit would exceed 23 hours.

The proposed health center would be oriented along East Clara Street, set back approximately 25 feet
from the sidewalk along East Santa Clara Street and approximately 13 feet from the sidewalk along
East 17th Street. An outdoor staff patio area is proposed on the north side of the building. Landscape
trees would border pedestrian walkways and sidewalks at the building perimeter and be located
throughout surface parking areas. A diesel-fueled back-up generator would supply power to the
health center in the event of an electricity outage.

  For the purposes of this EIR, East Santa Clara Street is considered the southern boundary of the project site, North
17th Street the eastern boundary of the project site, and East Saint John Street the northern boundary of the project
site.

2.2.2           Site Access and Parking

The main entrance to the proposed 60,000 square foot health center would have connections to a
drop-off area and bus transit stop. Vehicular access to the health center would be available via a
driveway on East Santa Clara Street and two driveways on North 17th Street (see driveways 2, 3, and
4 on Figure 4). Site access during construction is described in Section 2.2.6 below. The existing on-
site parking lot would be reconfigured as part of the project to provide 405 parking spaces. Bicycle
racks would be provided on-site.

2.2.4           Utility and Roadway Improvements

The project would require connections to the existing utility lines (storm drain, sewer, water,
recycled water, gas, and electric) in East Santa Clara Street. No roadway improvements are proposed
as part of the project.

2.2.5           Sustainability and Green Building

The project would incorporate the following design features to reduce energy and water use and
waste:

·       LEED Silver certification;
·       Reflective roofing;
·       Exterior sunshades at south and west facing windows and interior shade devices at all other
        windows;
·       High energy efficient exterior glazing;
·       LED lighting in some areas of the health center;
·       Day-lighting controls in all waiting rooms of the health center;
·       Motion sensor controls in all conference rooms in the health center;
·       Native plants as part of landscaping;
·       Connection to the existing recycled water system for landscape irrigation;
·       Low-flow toilets; and
·       Recycled materials in construction as practical.

2.2.6           Construction Phasing

It is anticipated that construction of the proposed health center would take approximately 33 months.
A breakdown of the construction phases is provided in Table 1 below. The project would require
excavating approximately 5,000 cubic yards of soil and importing approximately 2,500 cubic yards
of clean, engineered fill.

Currently, access to the existing building on-site (the Mediplex building) is provided via an existing
driveway on East Santa Clara Street (see driveway 2 on Figure 4). The construction of the project
would temporarily close this existing driveway. An interim driveway would be constructed east of
the Mediplex building (see driveway 1 on Figure 4) to allow for access to the Mediplex building
during project construction. Secondary access to the Mediplex building would be provided via
existing driveway 6 on Figure 4.

Once the project is constructed, existing driveway 2 between the Mediplex building and proposed
building would be reopened, interim driveway 1 west of the Mediplex building would be closed to
the public, existing driveway 5 on East St. John Street would be closed, and existing driveway 6 on
East St. John Street would be limited to maintenance vehicles only.


2.3            PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The closure of San José Medical Center in 2004 reduced regional hospital capacity and resulted in
increased demands for service at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and other community hospitals.
Residents of downtown San José were particularly hard-hit because they lost both a local hospital
and an emergency room that had served the area for 80 years. In response to the closure, the County
of Santa Clara and City of San José jointly commissioned a study that concluded that there was a
need for certain types of healthcare services in downtown San José to replace those that were lost.

This study caused the formation of a Stakeholder Advisory Committee by the City of San José,
whose final recommendations were presented to the San José City Council in March 2008. The
Stakeholder Advisory Committee report recommended that urgent care services be established and
primary care services be expanded in the downtown area, and that a joint City-County Taskforce be
established to assess future healthcare needs for the area. Availability of urgent care and expanded
primary care services in or near downtown San José, possibly operated by an established local
provider, would add much-needed healthcare services capacity for the community. Measure A,
which would make $790 million available for construction of the Valley Medical Center campus and
$50 million available for medical facilities in San José, was put on the ballot in 2008. It was
approved by 78 percent of County voters.

The proposed project would be funded by Measure A. The project's primary objective is to provide
urgent care and expanded primary healthcare services in the downtown area. The County believes
that a facility between 30,000 and 60,000 square feet in size would be sufficient to provide the
necessary services to meet the project's objective.

Overall, the County strives to construct and maintain well-planned County facilities that provide
public services in a sound financial manner in conformance with long-term sustainability policies.

2.4             USES OF THE EIR

This EIR is intended to be an informational document and is subject to public review, agency review,
and consideration by the County of Santa Clara. The purpose of this EIR is to identify potentially
significant effects of the project on the physical environment, to determine the extent to which these
effects could be reduced or avoided, and to identify feasible alternatives to the project. The EIR is an
information document and in itself does not determine whether a project should or will be approved.

The following project-specific discretionary action(s) may be considered by the County of Santa
Clara:

·       Approval of a contract or contracts for construction of a new health center by the Board of
        Supervisors, and
·       Tree removal permit(s) from the Planning Office.

Ministerial permits, such as an Inter-Agency Encroachment Permit for other Governmental Agencies
from the City of San José, may also be required.

SECTION 3.0             ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING, IMPACTS, AND
                        MITIGATION


In accordance with Section 15143 of the CEQA Guidelines, the discussion in this EIR is focused on
the significant effects on the environment resulting from the proposed San José Downtown Health
Center project. An important consideration for the environmental analysis in this EIR is the
establishment of an appropriate environmental baseline for the project. The baseline is the conditions
against which the proposed project would be compared. The environmental impacts are based upon
the difference between the environmental baseline and the project. Both the CEQA Guidelines and
case law provide standards for establishing the baseline.

The CEQA Guidelines state that, "an EIR must include a description of the physical environmental
conditions in the vicinity of the Project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is
published, or if no notice of preparation is published, at the time the environmental analysis is
commenced, from both a local and regional perspective. This environmental setting will normally
constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a Lead Agency determines whether an impact is
significant" [CEQA Guidelines §15125(a)].

The baseline used for the environmental analysis in this EIR is the actual physical conditions existing
on and around the project site at the time of the Notice of Preparation was circulated (December 1,
2010), and also the predicted conditions on the project site at the expected date of project approval (if
different). Mitigation measures are identified for all significant project impacts. "Mitigation
measures" are measures that will minimize, avoid, or eliminate a significant impact (CEQA
Guidelines 15370). Each impact is numbered using an alpha-numerical system that identifies the
environmental issue. For example, Impact HAZ ­ 1, denotes the first impact discussed in the
hazards and hazardous materials section. Mitigation measures (MM) are also numbered to
correspond to the impact they address. For example, MM NOI ­ 2.3 refers to the third mitigation
measure for the second impact in the noise section. The letter codes used to identify environmental
issues are listed in Table 2 below.

3.1                 LAND USE

3.1.1               Existing Setting

The approximately five-acre project site is located within the City of San José. It is developed with a
34,000 square foot medical office building (Mediplex building), surface parking, and landscaping.

Previously, the project site was part of a larger approximately 11-acre site developed with a hospital
­ San José Medical Center. In 2004, all of the facilities (except the Mediplex building) closed. Since
the closure, all of the San José Medical Center buildings except for the Mediplex building and
Building 800 (refer to Figure 3) have been demolished. The Mediplex building and Building 800 are
currently unoccupied. The Mediplex building, however, is planned to be fully occupied with medical
office uses between now and the approval of the proposed project. 3 Other surrounding land uses
include a mix of undeveloped, residential, commercial, and public utility uses.

The project site has an existing San José General Plan land use designation of Public/Quasi-Public.
The Public/Quasi-Public land use designation is used to designate public land uses, including
schools, colleges, corporation yards, homeless shelters, libraries, fire stations, water treatment
facilities, convention centers and auditoriums, museums, governmental offices and airports. This
land use designation is also used to designate lands used by some private entities, including public
utilities and the facilities of any organization involved in the provision of public services such as gas,
water, electricity, and telecommunications. In addition, such institutions as churches, private schools
and private hospitals are also appropriate for this designation.

According to the Santa Clara County Important Farmland Map (2010), the project site is identified as
Urban and Built-Up Land. Urban and Built-Up Land is defined as land occupied by structures with
a building density of at least one unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately six structures to a 10-acre parcel.
The project site is not considered prime farmland and is not part of a Williamson Act contract. The
project site is not zoned for agricultural use, forest land, timberland, or timberland production.

3.1.2               Land Use Impacts

3.1.2.1             Thresholds of Significance

A land use impact is considered significant if the project would:

·          Physically divide an established community;
·          Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with
           jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, local
           coastal program, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
           environmental effect;
·          Conflict with special policies: San Martin and/or South County; Los Gatos Specific Plan or
           Lexington Watershed; Guadalupe Watershed; Stanford; City of Morgan Hill Urban Growth
           Boundary Area; West Valley Hillsides Preservation Area; Water Collaborative (Guidelines
           and Standards for Land Use Near Streams);

·         Convert 10 or more acres of farmland classified as prime in the report Soils of Santa Clara
          County (Class I, II) to non-agricultural use;
·         Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use;
·         Conflict with an existing Williamson Act Contract or the County's Williamson Act
          Ordinance (Section C13 of County Ordinance Code);
·         Conflict with existing zone for, or cause rezoning of, forest land (as defined in Public
          Resources Code section 12220(g)), timberland (as defined by Public Resources Code section
          4526), or timberland zoned Timberland Production (as defined by Government Code section
          51104(g));
·         Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land to non-forest use; or
·         Involve other changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature,
          could result in conversion of Farmland, to non-agricultural use or conversion of forest land to
          non-forest use.

The project site is not located within special policy areas including San Martin, South County, Los
Gatos, Lexington Watershed, Guadalupe Watershed, Stanford, City of Morgan Hill Urban Growth
Boundary, or West Valley Hillsides Preservation Area. As discussed in Section 3.9.2.6, the project
would not conflict with the Guidelines and Standards for Land Use Near Streams. The project site
and adjacent property are not used or zoned for agricultural or forest uses. Nor is the project site is
subject to an existing Williamson Act contract. For these reasons, the project would not result in
impacts to these resources and, therefore, the last seven bulleted thresholds listed above are not
discussed further.

3.1.2.2          Impacts to an Established Community

The project area includes a mix of land uses including medical, residential, commercial, and public
utility uses. The proposed use is the same as the existing Mediplex building on-site, and similar to
the hospital use that used to occupy the project area.

The proposed health center is separated from the residential uses to the north by approximately 500
feet of surface parking and Saint John Street. The residential and public utility uses east of the site
are separated from the proposed health center by North 17th Street, which is approximately 55 feet
wide. The residential and commercial uses south of the site are separated from the proposed health
center by East Santa Clara Street, which is approximately 65 feet wide.

Given that the project area consists of a mix of uses and the project is not proposing a new land use
or physical layout (e.g., blocking of roadways or sidewalks) that would change the neighborhood,
and the fact that the project activity areas are mostly separated from surrounding land uses by
roadways, the project would not divide an established community.

Impact LU ­ 1:           The project would not divide an established community. (Less Than
                         Significant Impact)

3.1.2.3        Consistency with the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance

The project site, located within the city limits of San José, is owned by the County and the proposed
project would be operated by the County of Santa Clara Health and Hospital System.

As described in Section 6.0 Consistency with Relevant Plans, the Santa Clara County General Plan
is the document that contains the County's vision and overall direction for growth in the form of
strategies, policies, and actions. The proposed project, development of a health center to serve
residents of Santa Clara County, would be located in an existing urban area and developed in a
manner consistent with County policies designed to reduce environmental effects including, but not
limited to, transportation, air quality, noise, water quality, and energy use.

Because the project is a public project proposed by the County, it is not subject to City of San José
land use policies or zoning. Although not subject to City of San José General Plan policies, the
project's characteristics that relate to the recently adopted Envision San José 2040 General Plan are
discussed in Section 6.0 Consistency with Relevant Plans.

Impact LU ­ 1:         The project would not conflict with applicable land use plans, policies, or
                       regulations adopted to avoid environmental impacts. (Less Than Significant
                       Impact)

3.1.3          Mitigation Measures

No mitigation measures are proposed or required.

3.1.4          Conclusion

3.2.1.2           Study Intersections

Transportation impacts related to the proposed project were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San José. Since the project would generate more than 100
peak hour vehicle trips, the transportation analysis was prepared in accordance with the VTA's
Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines. Per CMP Transportation Impact Analysis
Guidelines, intersections are to be evaluated if the project adds 10 or more peak hour trips per lane.
The study intersections are listed below and shown on Figure 5:

    1.    US 101 Ramps and Alum Rock Avenue*
    2.    US 101 Ramps and Santa Clara Street*
    3.    24th Street and Santa Clara Street
    4.    17th Street and Santa Clara Street
    5.    17th Street and Julian Street

    * denotes CMP intersection

Traffic conditions at the study intersections were analyzed for the weekday AM and PM peak hours
of traffic. The AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM, and the PM peak
hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods on an average day that the
most congested traffic conditions occur. Traffic conditions were evaluated for the following
scenarios:

·         Existing Conditions ­ Existing traffic conditions are represented by existing peak-hour traffic
          volumes on the existing roadway network. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from the
          City of San José and supplemented with new counts conducted in 2011.

·         Existing Plus Project Conditions ­ Existing plus project peak hour traffic volumes were
          estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the project

          (60,000 square foot medical office). Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative
          to existing conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

·         Background Conditions ­ Background traffic conditions are represented by future
          background traffic volumes on the near-term future roadway network. Background traffic
          volumes were estimated by adding to existing peak-hour volumes the projected volumes from
          approved but not yet completed developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet
          completed developments was provided by the City of San José in the form of the Approved
          Trips Inventory (ATI), which also includes traffic volumes associated with the Downtown
          Strategy Plan Phase I. Background conditions include trips generated by the planned re-
          occupancy of the presently vacant Mediplex building located on-site.

·         Background Plus Project Conditions ­ Background plus project traffic volumes were
          estimated by adding the peak-hour traffic volumes generated by the new 60,000 square foot
          health center to the background traffic volumes. Background plus project conditions were
          evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

3.2.1.3          Intersection Level of Service Methodology

Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative description of intersection operations and is reported using an
A through F letter rating system to describe travel delay and congestion. LOS A indicates free flow
conditions with little or no delay, and LOS F indicates jammed conditions with excessive delays and
long back-ups.

                                     City of San José Intersections

The City of San José level of service methodology for signalized intersections is the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) method. This method is applied using the TRAFFIX software. The 2000
HCM operations method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the basis of average control
delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. The City of San José level of service standard for
signalized intersections is LOS D or better. The correlation between average control delay and level
of service is shown in Table 3.

service standard for signalized intersections is LOS E or better.

                                           Freeway Segments

According to CMP guidelines, an analysis of freeway segment levels of service is required if a
project is estimated to add trips to a freeway segment equal to or greater than one percent of the
capacity of that segment, or the proposed development is adjacent to one of the freeway segment's
access or egress points. The number of peak-hour trips added to the freeways in the project area by
the proposed project (under either option) is estimated to be well below the one-percent threshold
(refer to Appendix B) and the site is not located next to freeway access or egress points. Therefore, a
detailed analysis of freeway segment levels of service was not performed.

                                    Intersection Levels of Service

The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized
below in Table 4. The results show that, based on the City of San José standards, all study
intersections operate at an acceptable LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.

                                    Observed Traffic Conditions

Traffic conditions were observed during the AM and PM peak commute periods to identify existing
operational deficiencies and to confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of
this effort was 1) to identify any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to level of
service and 2) to identify any locations where the level of service analysis does not accurately reflect
actual existing traffic conditions.

Field observations revealed that the study intersections operate well during both peak commute
periods with minimal delay for most movements. The freeway ramp meters at the US 101/Santa
Clara Street/Alum Rock Avenue interchange currently are activated only on the northbound on ramp
during the AM peak period. The queue extending from the ramp meter was confined to the on ramp
and did not affect traffic flow on the adjacent roadways. Queues were observed to overflow the
westbound left-turn pocket at the intersection of Santa Clara Street and 24th Street during the PM
peak hour. In addition, at the same intersection, the eastbound through movement occasionally
queued past the upstream intersection at 23rd Street; however, the queues cleared during each signal
cycle so the blockage of cross street traffic was only temporary and did not cause any problems.

3.2.1.5           Background Conditions

The following discussion describes background conditions in the project area. Background traffic
conditions are traffic conditions just prior to completion of the proposed project. At the direction of
the City of San José, the transportation network under background conditions was assumed to be the
same as under existing conditions. 4

Background peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing volumes the estimated
traffic from approved but not yet constructed developments in the project area. The added traffic
from approved but not yet completed developments (including Phase I of the Downtown Strategy)
was provided by the City of San José in the form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI). Trips
generated by the Mediplex building on-site are also included in background traffic conditions since
they are associated with an existing building. Refer to Appendix B for more detail regarding
background traffic volumes.

The results of the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are summarized
in Table 4. The results show that, based on the City of San José standards, all study intersections are
expected to operate at acceptable LOS C or better conditions during both the AM and PM peak hours
of traffic on a typical weekday.

3.2.2             Transportation Impacts

3.2.2.1           Thresholds of Significance

A transportation impact is considered significant if the project would:

    ·     Conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance, or policy establishing measures of effectiveness
          for the performance of the circulation system, taking into account all modes of transportation
          including mass transit and non-motorized travel and relevant components of the circulation
          system, including but not limited to intersections, streets, highways and freeways, pedestrian
          and bicycle paths, and mass transit;
    ·     Conflict with an applicable congestion management program, including, but not limited to
          level of service standards and travel demand measures, or other standards established by the
          county congestion management agency for designated roads or highways;
    ·     Result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a
          change in location that results in substantial safety risks;
    ·     Substantially increase hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous
          intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment);
    ·     Result in inadequate emergency access;
    ·     Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or
          pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease in performance or safety of such facilities; or

  The VTA is planning to implement a bus rapid transit project along the Santa Clara-Alum Rock Corridor. The
BRT project would include a station on Santa Clara Street between 16th and 17th Streets. Preliminary drawings of
the 17th Street station show sidewalk improvements would cause a reduction in the width of the curb lane on Santa
Clara Street. As a result, traffic using this lane will be temporarily blocked when a bus stops at the station. The City
of San José is working with VTA to refine the BRT plans. Since the design is not yet finalized and the timing of the
BRT project is uncertain, modifications related to the BRT project were not included in this traffic analysis.

 ·        Not provide safe access, obstruct access to nearby uses or fail to provide for future street
          right of way.

The project would not result in impacts to air traffic patterns or emergency access. The project does
not fail to provide necessary future street right-of-way. Therefore, the third and fifth, and a portion
of the last bulleted threshold listed above is not discussed further.

                                      Intersection Impact Criteria

The criteria used to determine impacts on intersections are based on the level of service standards of
the City of San José. The project's impacts were also analyzed according to the County CMP
methodology for the CMP study intersection.

A project would create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
in the City of San José if for either peak hour:

·         The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
          background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus project
          conditions; or
·         The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
          conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
          intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
          increase by one percent (.01) or more.

An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
stopped delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average stopped delay for critical
movements is negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C
value by .01 or more.

The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of San José,
except that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or
better.

3.2.2.2           Project Traffic Estimates

The amount of traffic added to the roadway system from the proposed project is estimated using a
three-step process: 1) trip generation; 2) trip distribution; and 3) trip assignment. In determining
project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the project site is estimated for
the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of the
directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project
trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections. These procedures are described below.

                                               Trip Generation

Based on the medical office trip rates recommended by the City of San José, the project is estimated
to generate 3,000 gross daily vehicle trips, with 180 trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 300
trips occurring during the PM peak hour. The project site is within 2,000 feet of a major bus stop. In
accordance with the VTA guidelines, the gross trip estimates were reduced by two percent to account
for transit usage. After deducting for transit usage, the proposed 60,000 square foot health center is
expected to generate 2,940 net daily vehicle trips, with 176 net trips occurring during the AM peak
hour and 294 net trips occurring during the PM peak hour. The project trip generation estimates are
presented in Table 5.

                                     Trip Distribution and Assignment

The trip distribution pattern for the proposed health center was estimated based on existing travel
patterns on the surrounding roadway system and the relative locations of complementary land uses.
The project trip distribution pattern, which has been reviewed by City of San José staff, is included in
Appendix B. The peak hour trips generated by the proposed project were assigned to the roadway
system in accordance with the trip distribution pattern. The project trip assignment to individual
roadways is included in Appendix B.

3.2.2.3          Existing Plus Project Conditions

The project trips were added to existing traffic volumes to obtain existing plus project traffic
volumes. The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project
conditions are summarized in Table 6. The results show that all study intersection are expected to
operate at acceptable LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours under existing plus
project conditions.

3.2.2.4         Background Plus Project Conditions

The background plus project conditions reflect the near-term traffic conditions expected to occur
when the project is complete. The project trips (Table 5) were added to background traffic volumes
to obtain background plus project traffic volumes. Background plus project conditions were
evaluated relative to background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts. This
traffic scenario represents a more congested traffic condition than existing plus project conditions
since it includes traffic from approved (but not yet constructed) projects and reoccupancy of the
Mediplex building.

The results of the level of service analysis under background plus project conditions show that,
measured against the City of San José and CMP level of service impact criteria, all of the study
intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service and none of the study intersections would
be significantly impacted by the project (see Table 7).

3.2.2.5        Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities Impacts

The proposed health center would generate pedestrian traffic primarily from clinic workers and
patients walking to and from the nearby transit stops within 0.5 miles of the site on Santa Clara
Street, Julian Street, and San Carlos Street. In addition, some people who reside in the surrounding
neighborhood may walk to the proposed health center. As described previously, all of the roadways
in the vicinity of the project site have sidewalks on both sides of the street. Crosswalks with
pedestrian signal heads are located at all signalized intersections in the project area. Overall, the
existing network of sidewalks in the project area exhibits good connectivity and provides pedestrians
with a safe connection between the project site and surrounding land uses. The existing pedestrian
facilities are adequate to serve the anticipated pedestrian demand.

Class II bicycle lanes exist on 17th Street and 21st Street. In addition, with the exception of Santa
Clara Street, many of the streets in the project area are local neighborhood streets with low traffic
volumes and slow speeds, which are well suited to bicycling. A reasonable assumption for bicycle
trip generation for the project would be a one percent mode share. This equates to two to three new
bicycle trips during both the AM and PM peak commute periods. Given the estimated number of
bicycle trips generated from the proposed project, the existing bicycle facilities would be adequate to
serve the anticipated bicycle demand.

As noted in the project description, no off-site roadway improvements are proposed by the project.
The project does not include features that would adversely affect planned bicycle or pedestrian paths
in the area.

Impact TRAN ­ 3:        The proposed project would not have a significant impact on existing or
                        planned pedestrian or bicycle facilities. (Less Than Significant Impact)

3.2.2.6           Transit Service Impacts

Five bus lines are located within walking distance of the project site. Due to the convenient locations
of the bus stops, it is assumed that some workers and patients of the new health center would utilize
the existing transit services. Applying a two percent transit mode share, which is consistent with the
Congestion Management Program TIA Analysis Guidelines, it is estimated that the project would
generate approximately four new transit riders during the AM peak hour and six new transit riders
during the PM peak hour. Assuming the existing transit services would remain unchanged, the small
number of new transit riders resulting from the project would have little effect on bus lines 22, 23,
64, 72, and 522. The potential new riders could be accommodated by the current available ridership
capacity of the transit services in the project area, and no improvements to the existing transit
services would be necessary to accommodate project generated transit riders.

The VTA is planning to implement a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project along the Santa Clara-Alum
Rock corridor. The BRT project would include sidewalk improvements to create a bus station on
Santa Clara Street between 16th and 17th Streets. The project would not conflict with the BRT station
plans. 5

3.2.2.7           Obstruct Access to Nearby Uses

Currently, access to the Mediplex building on-site is provided by a driveway on East Santa Clara
Street between the Mediplex building and the proposed health center building (see driveway 2 on
Figure 4). While the project is being constructed, this driveway would be temporarily closed. As a
result, the project would construct an interim driveway (driveway 1 on Figure 4) west of the
Mediplex building for employees and patients of the Mediplex building. Secondary access to the
Mediplex building is provided via existing driveway 6 (see Figure 4) on St. John Street opposite 15th
Street.

Once the project is constructed, driveway 2 would be reopened and the interim driveway west of the
Mediplex building (driveway 1) would be closed to the public.

Impact TRAN ­ 5:           The project would not result in significant access impacts to the adjacent
                           Mediplex building. (Less Than Significant Impact)

3.2.3             Mitigation Measures

No mitigation measures are proposed or required.

 The transportation impact analysis in Appendix B recommends coordinating with the VTA to revise the
preliminary plans for the BRT bus stop to move the taper for the bus to the other side of the site driveway at 16th
Street to enhance circulation. If this recommendation is not implemented, no substantial impacts to level of service
or safety are anticipated (Source: Michelle Hunt, Hexagon Transportation Consultants. Personal communications.
September 2010.).

3.3             AIR QUALITY

3.3.1           Existing Setting

Air quality and the amount of a given pollutant in the atmosphere are determined by the amount of
pollutant released and the atmosphere's ability to transport and dilute the pollutant. The major
determinants of transport and dilution are wind, atmospheric stability, terrain, and for photochemical
pollutants, sunshine.

The project is located in San José, which is in Santa Clara Valley. The project site is in proximity to
both the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay, which have moderating influence on the climate. The
valley is bound to the north by the San Francisco Bay and by mountains to the east, south, and west.
The surrounding terrain greatly influences winds in the valley, resulting in a prevailing wind that
follows along the valley's northwest-southeast axis. During the afternoon and early evening, a north-
northwesterly sea breeze often flows from the Bay through the valley, and a light south-southeasterly
drainage flow often occurs during the late evening and early morning hours.

3.3.1.1         Regional and Local Criteria Pollutants

Major criteria pollutants, listed in "criteria" documents by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) include ozone, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter (PM). These pollutants have
health effects such as respiratory impairment and heart/lung disease symptoms.

Areas that do not violate ambient air quality standards are considered to have attained the standard.
Violations of ambient air quality standards are based on air pollutant monitoring data and are judged
for each air pollutant. The Bay Area as a whole does not meet state or federal ambient air quality
standards for ground level ozone and state standards for particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). The
area is considered attainment or unclassified for all other pollutants.

3.3.1.2         Local Community Risks/Toxic Air Contaminants and Fine Particulate Matter

Besides criteria air pollutants, there is another group of substances found in ambient air referred to as
Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs). These contaminants tend to be localized and are found in relatively
low concentrations in ambient air. However, they can result in adverse chronic health effects if
exposure to low concentrations occurs for long periods.

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) is a complex mixture of substances that includes elements such as
carbon and metals; compounds such as nitrates, organics, and sulfates; and complex mixtures such as
diesel exhaust and wood smoke. Long-term and short-term exposure to PM2.5 can cause a wide range
of health effects.

Common stationary source types of TACs and PM2.5 include gasoline stations, dry cleaners, and
diesel backup generators which are subject to permit requirements. The other, often more significant,
common source is motor vehicles on freeways and roads.

3.3.1.3           Sensitive Receptors

The San Francisco Bay Area Air Quality Management District defines sensitive receptors as facilities
or land uses that include members of the population that are particularly sensitive to the effects of air
pollutants, such as children, the elderly, and people with illnesses. Examples include schools,
hospitals, and residential areas. The nearest existing sensitive receptors to the project site include the
residences located north of the project site on East Saint John Street, east of the project site on North
17th Street, and south of the project site on East Santa Clara Street (refer to Figure 3).

3.3.1.4           Regulatory Overview

The City of San José is within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(BAAQMD). BAAQMD is the agency primarily responsible for assuring that the federal and state
ambient air quality standards are maintained in the San Francisco Bay Area. Air quality standards
are set by the federal government (the 1970 Clean Air Act and its subsequent amendments) and the
state (California Clean Air Act of 1988 and its subsequent amendments). Regional air quality
management districts such as BAAQMD must prepare air quality plans specifying how state
standards would be met. BAAQMD's most recently adopted Clean Air Plan (CAP) is the 2010
Clean Air Plan (2010 CAP). The 2010 CAP provides an updated comprehensive plan to improve
Bay Area air quality and protect public health, taking into account future growth projections to 2035.

3.3.2             Air Quality Impacts

3.3.2.1           Thresholds of Significance

An air quality impact is considered significant if the project would:

·         Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan;
·         Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air
          quality violation;
·         Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the
          project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality
          standard (including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
          precursors);
·         Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations; or
·         Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people.

The construction and operation of the proposed health center would not create objectionable odors.
Therefore, the last bulleted threshold listed above is not discussed further.

                           BAAQMD Project-Level Significance Thresholds 6

The BAAQMD thresholds of significance for criteria air pollutants are 54 pounds or more a day of
reactive organic gas (ROG), nitrous oxide (NOx), and/or PM2.5; or 82 pounds or more a day of PM10.
According to the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (May 2011) screening criteria, the
construction of a 277,000 square foot medical office building may result in significant levels of
construction-related criteria air pollutants and the operation of a 117,000 square foot medical office
building may result in significant levels operational-related criteria air pollutants.

The BAAQMD-adopted thresholds of significance for local community risk and hazard impacts
apply to both the siting of a new source (e.g., proposed on-site generator) and to the siting of a new
receptor. Local community risks and hazard impacts are associated with TACs and PM2.5 because
emission of these pollutants can have significant health impacts at a local level. If emissions of
TACs or PM2.5 exceed any of the thresholds of significance listed below, the project would result in a
significant impact:

·         Non-compliance with a qualified risk reduction plan;
·         An excess cancer risk level of more than 10 in one million, or a non-cancer (i.e., chronic or
          acute) hazard index greater than 1.0 would be a cumulatively considerable contribution; or
·         An incremental increase of greater than 0.3 micrograms per cubic meter annual average
          PM2.5 would be a cumulatively considerable contribution.

3.3.2.2          Consistency with the Clean Air Plan

Determining consistency with the 2010 CAP involves assessing whether applicable control measures
contained in the 2010 CAP are implemented. Implementation of control measures are intended to
improve air quality and protect public health. These control measures are organized into five
categories: Stationary Source Measures, Mobile Source Measures, Transportation Control Measures
(TCMs), Land Use and Local Impact Measures, and Energy and Climate Measures. Applicable

  In December 2010, the California Building Industry Association (BIA) filed a lawsuit in Alameda County Superior
Court challenging toxic air contaminants and PM2.5 thresholds developed by BAAQMD for its CEQA Air Quality
Guidelines (California Building Industry Association v. Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Alameda
County Superior Court Case No. RG10548693). One of the identified concerns is that the widespread use of the
thresholds would inhibit infill and smart growth in the urbanized Bay Area. On January 9, 2012, the Superior Court
made a tentative ruling that the adoption of thresholds by the BAAQMD for its CEQA Air Quality Guidelines is a
"project" subject to environmental review under CEQA. At the time this Draft EIR was prepared, the Superior
Court had not yet issued a final Statement of Decision, nor had any final judgment or writ been issued by the court.
The County understands the effect of the lawsuit to be that BAAQMD may eventually have to complete
environmental review before adopting the same or revised thresholds. However, the ruling in the case does not
equate to a finding that the quantitative metrics in the thresholds are incorrect or unreliable.

The determination of whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment is subject to the discretion
of each individual lead agency, based upon substantial evidence. Notwithstanding the BIA lawsuit, the County has
carefully considered the thresholds prepared by BAAQMD and considers them to be based on the best information
currently available for the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. Substantial evidence supporting these thresholds has
been presented in the following documents: a) Bay Area Air Quality Management District. CEQA Air Quality
Guidelines, Appendix D. May 2011; b) California Air Pollution Control Officers Association. Health Risk
Assessments for Proposed Land Use Projects. July 2009; and c) California Environmental Protection Agency,

3.3.2.3           Short-Term Construction-Related Impacts

Construction activities would temporarily affect local air quality. Construction activities such as
earthmoving, construction vehicle traffic, and wind blowing over exposed earth would generate
exhaust emissions and fugitive particulate matter emissions that affect local and regional air quality.
Construction activities are also a source of organic gas emissions. Solvents in adhesives, non-water
based paints, thinners, some insulating materials, and caulking materials would evaporate into the
atmosphere and would participate in the photochemical reaction that creates urban ozone. Asphalt
used in paving is also a source of organic gases for a short time after its application.

Construction dust could affect local air quality at various times during construction of the project.
The dry, windy climate of the area during the summer months creates a high potential for dust
generation when and if underlying soils are exposed to the atmosphere. Construction activities
would increase dustfall and locally elevated levels of PM10 downwind.

The BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines has a screening threshold of a 277,000 square foot
medical office building a potentially significant construction-related air quality impact from criteria
pollutant emissions. The proposed project would result in the construction of a new 60,000 square
foot health center, which is below the BAAQMD screening threshold.

According to the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines, the construction of a project would
result in a less than significant impact from criteria air pollutant and precursor emissions if the
project is below the screening threshold, implements all basic construction mitigation measures, and
does not include: demolition activities inconsistent with District Regulation 11, Rule 2 ­ Asbestos
Demolition, Renovation and Manufacturing; simultaneous occurrence of more than two construction
phases (e.g., paving and building construction would occur simultaneously); simultaneous
construction of more than one land use type; extensive site preparation; or extensive material
transport (e.g., greater than 10,000 cubic yards of soil import/export) requiring a considerable amount
of haul truck activity. No demolition is proposed as part of this project.

The project includes implementation of the following BAAQMD basic construction mitigation
measures to reduce construction-related air quality impacts to a less than significant level:

·         All exposed surfaces (e.g., parking areas, staging areas, soil piles, graded areas, and unpaved
          access roads) shall be watered two times per day.
·         All haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose material off-site shall be covered.

·         All visible mud or dirt track-out on to adjacent public roads shall be removed using wet
          power vacuum street sweepers at least once per day. The use of dry power sweeping is
          prohibited.
·         All roadways, driveways, and sidewalks to be paved shall be completed as soon as possible.
          Building pad shall be laid as soon as possible after grading unless seeding or soil binders are
          used.
·         Idling times shall be minimized either by shutting equipment off when not in use or reducing
          the maximum idling time to five minutes (as required by the California airborne toxics
          control measure Title 13, Section 2485 of California Code of Regulations). Clear signage
          shall be provided for construction workers at all access points.
·         All construction equipment shall be maintained and properly tuned in accordance with
          manufacturer's specifications. At the start of project construction, all equipment shall be
          checked by a California Air Resources Board certified visible emissions evaluator.
·         Post a publicly visible sign with the telephone number and person to contact at the County
          regarding dust complaints. This person shall respond and take corrective action within 48
          hours. The BAAQMD's phone number shall also be visible to ensure compliance with
          applicable regulations.

Impact AIR ­ 2:          The proposed project, with the implementation of the above BAAQMD basic
                         construction mitigation measures, would not result in significant construction-
                         related air quality impacts. (Less Than Significant Impact)

3.3.2.4          Long-Term Air Quality Impacts

As discussed previously, the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines has a screening threshold of a
117,000 square foot medical office building for a potentially significant operational-related air
quality impact. The proposed project would result in an increase of 60,000 square feet of medical
clinic space, which is below the screening threshold and therefore, would not result in a significant
air quality impact.

Impact AIR ­ 3:          The project would not result in significant long-term air quality impacts.

3.3.2.5          Local Community Risks/ Toxic Air Contaminants and Fine Particulate Matter 7

The proposed project includes a 1,000 kilowatt (kw) back-up diesel generator on-site. The generator
would provide power to the health center building in the event of an electricity outage. The
generator would be located adjacent to the health center building and is considered a stationary
source of air emissions, including TACs and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).

Local community risks were assess by Illingworth & Rodkin (refer to Appendix E) using BAAQMD
methodology. Existing sensitive receptors in the project area were identified. The closest sensitive
receptors to the project site are the single-family residence located at the southeast corner of North
17th Street and East St. John Street and the multi-family residence located at the southwest corner of
South 16th Street and East Santa Clara Street (refer to Figure 3). The TAC emission concentrations

  BAAQMD requires that the health risk from existing or future proposed sources of TAC and/or PM2.5 emissions
that would adversely affect a proposed sensitive receptor be evaluated.

from the proposed generator were calculated at the nearby residences based on BAAQMD screening
tables and information provided by BAAQMD. The results are summarized in Table 9 and show that
the TAC emissions from the proposed on-site generator from routine testing would not exceed the
BAAQMD health risk thresholds of significance at the closest sensitive receptors. The health risk
from the proposed generator would be less than identified in Table 9 at other sensitive receptors in
the project area located further from the project site than at the closest single-family and multi-family
residences analyzed. The routine operation of the proposed on-site generator would not subject
existing sensitive receptors (e.g., existing nearby residences) to significant health risks from TACs or
PM2.5.

Notes:
* Values for non-cancer (chronic and acute hazards index) risks are negligible (i.e., well below the threshold) for the
on-site diesel generator and therefore, not included.
**The health risks identified are conservative. The emissions and risk calculated were based on the generator being
tested one hour per month (or about 12 hours annually). The County anticipates that the generator would only be
tested for 30 minutes once a month.



The project's contribution to cumulative TAC and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) hazards is described
in Section 4.3.5 Cumulative Air Quality Impacts. As discussed in Section 4.3.5, the project, along
with other emission sources in the area, would not result in a cumulative TAC or PM2.5 impact.

BAAQMD considers a project a new sensitive receptor if the project is likely to be a place where
people live, play, or convalesce; and if sensitive individuals (i.e., segments of the population most
susceptible to poor air quality including children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing serious
health problems affected by air quality) are likely to spend a significant amount of time there. While

some patients at the proposed health center could have pre-existing health problems affected by air
quality, patient visits at the proposed health center would be relatively short and not exceed 23 hours
(i.e., no overnight stays). Therefore, patients would not spend a significant amount of time at the
project site. For this reason, the proposed health center is not considered a sensitive receptor with
respect to the community risk impact criteria, and therefore, health risks to the proposed health center
from existing mobile and stationary sources were not evaluated further.

Impact AIR ­ 4:         The proposed on-site generator would not subject sensitive receptors (e.g.,
                        existing nearby residences) to significant health risks from TACs. (Less
                        Than Significant Impact)

3.3.3           Mitigation Measures

No mitigation measures are proposed or required.

3.3.4           Conclusion

Impact AIR ­ 1:         The project is generally consistent with the 2010 CAP. (Less Than
                        Significant Impact)

Impact AIR ­ 2:         The proposed project, with the implementation of the above BAAQMD basic
                        construction mitigation measures, would not result in significant construction-
                        related air quality impacts. (Less Than Significant Impact)

                        objectionable odors. (Less Than Significant Impact)

Impact AIR ­ 4:         The proposed on-site generator would not subject sensitive receptors (e.g.,

3.4               GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

The following discussion is based in part on modeling completed to determine the project's
construction and operational greenhouse gas emissions. The modeling results are included in
Appendix F of this EIR.

3.4.1             Existing Setting

3.4.1.1           Background Information and Regulatory Framework

Global climate change refers to changes in weather including temperatures, precipitation, and wind
patterns. Global temperatures are modulated by naturally occurring and anthropogenic (generated by
mankind) atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. 8 These gases allow
sunlight into the Earth's atmosphere but prevent heat from radiating back out into outer space and
escaping from the earth's atmosphere, thus altering the earth's energy balance. This phenomenon is
known as the greenhouse effect.

Naturally occurring greenhouse gases include water vapor, 9 carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
and ozone. Several classes of halogenated substances that contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine are
also greenhouse gases, but are for the most part solely a product of industrial activities. Emissions of
greenhouse gases are typically expressed in a common metric (i.e., carbon dioxide equivalent), so
that their impacts can be directly compared, as some gases are more potent (have a higher global
warming potential) than others.

Agencies at the international, national, state, and local levels are considering strategies to control
emissions of gases that contribute to global warming. There is no comprehensive strategy that is
being implemented on a global scale that addresses climate change; however, in California a multi-
agency "Climate Action Team," has identified a range of strategies and the Air Resources Board,
under AB 32, has approved the Climate Change Scoping Plan. AB 32 requires achievement by 2020
of a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to 1990 emissions, and the adoption of rules
and regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas
emissions reductions. The CARB and other state agencies are currently working on regulations and
other initiatives to implement the Climate Change Scoping Plan. By 2050, the state plans to reduce
emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels.

Other state and local greenhouse gas regulations include:

·         SB 1078 and 107 which requires retail sellers of electricity to provide at least 20 percent of
          their supply from renewable sources by 2010.

  Concentrations of water are highly variable in the atmosphere over time, with water occurring as vapor, cloud
droplets and ice crystals. Changes in its concentration are also considered to be a result of climate feedbacks rather
than a direct result of industrialization or other human activities. For this reason, water vapor is not discussed
further as a greenhouse gas.

·      Executive Order S-14-08 which expands the state's Renewable Energy Standard to 33
       percent renewable power by 2020.
·      SB 375 which aligns regional transportation planning efforts, regional greenhouse gas
       reduction targets, and land use and housing allocation.
·      Executive Order S-1-07 which establishes a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of
       transportation fuels sold in California by a minimum of 10 percent by 2020.
·      Bay Area Air Quality Management District Climate Protection Program which includes
       measures to promote energy efficiency, reduce vehicle miles traveled, and develop
       alternative sources of energy ­ all of which assist in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
       air pollutants.

The County has a Climate Action Plan for Operations and Facilities, Green Building Policy for
County Government Buildings and sustainability policies. In 2007, the County Board of Supervisors
signed the Cool Counties Climate Stabilization Declaration and established a set of goals for
greenhouse gas emission reductions for the County:

·      Stop increasing the amount of emissions by 2010;
·      Decrease emission by 10 percent every five years from 2010-2050; and
·      Reach an 80 percent reduction by 2050.

The County's Climate Action Plan for Operations and Facilities (CAP) focuses primarily on the ten
percent reduction by 2015 and identifies policies and actions that are needed to set the stage for
reductions past 2015. To reduce greenhouse gas emission from County facilities, the CAP
recommends:

·      Designing facilities to meet LEED standards;
·      Reducing cars on the road by promoting public transportation, carpools, bicycling, vanpools,
       and shuttles;
·      Increasing waste diversion;
·      Integrating information technology (IT) strategies to reduce paper, printing, and travel;
·      Using energy efficient lighting;
·      Increasing water conservation; and
·      Using recycled water.

The County also has a Green Building Policy for County Government Buildings. "Green building"
is the practice of siting, designing, constructing, operating, maintaining, and removing buildings in
such a way as to increase the efficiency of resource use ­ energy, water, and materials ­ while
reducing building impacts on human health and the environment. For new buildings, such as the
proposed health center, the Green Building Policy requires:

·      The building to be designed and constructed to meet LEED Silver standards;
·      New County owned buildings will be designed to control stormwater runoff in accordance
       with the requirements and procedures set forth in the SCVURPPP; and
·      Within a reasonable distance of existing or planned recycled water infrastructure, new
       buildings shall be plumbed and landscaping shall be planned to utilize recycled water.

In April 2010, the County Board of Supervisors adopted policies on sustainability. The policies
focus on providing a vibrant economy, healthy environment, social equity, and balance between
these elements.

3.4.1.2          Existing Conditions

The project site is currently developed surface parking and landscaping. Greenhouse gas emissions
from the project site include:

·         Emissions produced from conveying water to the project site for landscape irrigation.

3.4.2            Greenhouse Gas Emission Impacts

3.4.2.1          Thresholds of Significance

A greenhouse gas emission impact is considered significant if the project would:

·         Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant
          impact on the environment; or
·         Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the
          emissions of greenhouse gases.

The BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines include quantitative thresholds for greenhouse gas
emissions. 10 Using a methodology that models how new land use development in the San Francisco
Bay area can meet AB 32 GHG reduction goals, the BAAQMD Guidelines establish a significance
threshold of 1,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. In addition to this bright line
threshold, the Guidelines include an "efficiency" threshold to be used for urban high density, transit
oriented development projects that are intended to reduce vehicle trips but may still result in overall
emissions greater than 1,100 meter metric tons per year. This efficiency threshold is 4.6 metric tons
of carbon dioxide equivalents per service population (e.g., residents and employees) per year. The
BAAQMD does not have a threshold of significance for construction related greenhouse gas
emissions.

3.4.2.2          Greenhouse Gas Emission Impacts

Given the overwhelming scope of global climate change, it is not anticipated that a single
development project would have an individually discernible effect on global climate change. It is
more appropriate to conclude that the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the proposed project
would combine with emissions across the state, nation, and globe to cumulatively contribute to
global climate change.

  Refer to previous footnote 5 in Section 3.3 Air Quality. The determination of whether a project may have a
significant effect on the environment is made by the lead agency, in this case the County of Santa Clara, based upon
substantial evidence (CEQA Guidelines Section 15064(b)). The County of Santa Clara considers the thresholds
identified in the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (May 2011) to be based on the best information available
for the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin.

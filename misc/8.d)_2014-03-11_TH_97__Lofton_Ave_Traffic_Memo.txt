                                                  MEMORANDUM


      Date: March, 2014

   Subject: Trunk Highway 97 & County Road 91 (Lofton Ave) Traffic Monitoring Memo
              Scandia, MN



At the request of the City of Scandia, the intersection of Trunk Highway (TH) 97 at County Road (CR) 91
(Lofton Ave) was evaluated to determine existing traffic operations and identify any potential safety
issues. Based on the analysis, the addition of hauling trucks at this intersection doesn't appear to
appreciably lower the level of service or safety of the intersection.

The video of the intersection shows that trucks are able to make all necessary turns safely and efficiently
when needed. Right turning trucks onto Lofton Ave tend to turn into the opposing lane if there is no
opposing traffic, but have no problem staying in their lane when there is opposing traffic. During the PM
peak hour, trucks turning left onto TH 97 started accepting smaller gaps than non-peak hours. This
caused some vehicles heading eastbound on TH 97 to slow down for the trucks. Figures 2 and 3 depict
the above scenarios.

During the February 25, 2014 video log period (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM), the peak truck volumes were
comparable to the data collected in December 2013. There have been no crashes at this intersection from
November 4, 2013 to January 31, 2014 (since the release of the last report). The Crash Mapping Analysis
tool currently has crashes listed through January 31st, 2014. There has only been one crash on the TH 97
and CR 91 corridors during this time period and it was at the intersection of Penrose Ave & TH 97
(collision with a deer). Trucks hauled material from the mine from November 25th, 2013 to December
20th, 2013 and then started hauling again on January 9th.

The video log at the TH 97 & Lofton Ave intersection indicates that the drivers appear to be able to
negotiate the turning activity with slowing moving vehicles during their turn. It is recommended that the
mine officials be requested to advise all drivers to slow their vehicles during the turn to minimize/avoid
crossing into the opposing lane of traffic. If drivers continue have difficulty staying in their lane during
the turns, it would be suggested that the intersection be revised to accommodate the large trucks. Another
option would be to modify the permit to restrict the haul to the shorter wheel based single unit trucks if
the larger trucks have difficulty staying in their lane.

Existing Conditions
TH 97 runs east/west and is classified as a rural minor arterial. CR 91 runs north/south and is classified
as a rural major collector. The intersection has two-way stop control with vehicles on CR 91 required to
stop. The north leg of the intersection is a two lane approach (left-thru and right) and the south leg is a
single approach. The east and west legs of the intersection are two lane approaches (left-thru and
bypass/right turn lane). The speed limit on both roadways is 55 MPH. Figure 1 below shows the layout
of the intersection.

Turning Movement Counts
A 14 hour turning movement count was taken on February 25th, 2014 from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM to
capture traffic conditions while trucks were hauling material from the Zavoral Mine. The turning
movement count data is included in the attachments. Hauling trucks were classified as any truck that
turned left onto TH 97 from CR 91 and any truck that turned right from TH 97 onto CR 91.
The following was taken from the February 25th turning movement count:
              Hauling trucks were driven to/from the mine from 7:15 AM to 6:00 PM
              The hour with the heaviest amount of trucks hauling to/from the mine was 11:00 AM to
                 12:00 PM (51 trucks)
              AM Peak Hour (6:30 AM to 7:30 AM): 494 total vehicles used the intersection (8 trucks
                 going to or from mine)
              Mid-Day Peak Hour (11:00 AM to 12:00 PM): 351 total vehicles used the intersection
                 (51 trucks going to or from mine)
              PM Peak Hour (4:30 PM to 5:30 PM): 663 total vehicles used the intersection (46 trucks
                 going to or from mine)
         Page 3


              The total number of trucks going to or from the mine was 470 (7:15 AM to 6:00 PM),
               and the number of round trips was 231.

Introduction
Included herein is the traffic impact analysis for a proposed CarMax dealership located between
Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound and southbound, on the existing Building 19 site, in
Warwick/Cranston, Rhode Island. The site is proposed to be developed on 7.7 acres of land, and
will include a 10,625 square foot sales area, a 3,342 square foot service area, a 936 square foot
car wash, and a 3,373 square foot presentation area, totaling 18,276 square feet. Access and
egress will be provided via the existing curb cut on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound and a
proposed curb cut on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) southbound. The Bald Hill Road (Route 2)
southbound curb cut will be used for test-drive traffic only.

The following represents the analysis completed to determine the potential impact of the
proposed CarMax on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the corresponding intersections. Included are
discussions of the existing, future 2017 no-build conditions, and future 2017 build conditions.
Potential impacts of the proposed development have been determined, and mitigation has been
recommended as required.

An aerial locus map is included as Figure 1 and the proposed site plan is included as Figure 2.


Data Collection
Manual turning movement counts were completed on Wednesday and Thursday, September 26
and 27, 2012, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. and Saturday, September 29, 2012 from 11:00 a.m. to
1:00 p.m. at the following intersections:
     Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and East Avenue (Route 113)
     Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the Rhode Island Mall Driveway
     Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and West Natick Road
     Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the Turnaround north of West Natick Road

In addition, a 72-hour automatic traffic recorder (ATR) count was performed by Transportation
Data Corporation (TDC) on Bald Hill road (Route 2) northbound and southbound in the vicinity
of the site entrances on October 4-6, 2012. Copies of all count data are provided in Appendix A.

Crash data for the roadway network in the vicinity of the project site was requested from the
police departments in the Cities of Warwick and Cranston for the most recent three-year period.
Crash data was received on October 11, 2012.

A field review of the area was conducted, with geometric measurements and other field
observations recorded at the significant intersections in the vicinity of the project site that provide
access. The information obtained was used in the analysis of the study area intersections.

Signal plans for the intersections along Bald Hill Road (Route 2) were obtained from the Rhode
Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT). The data provided was used in the capacity
analysis of the study intersections.

Existing Roadway Conditions
The study area reviewed for the proposed CarMax includes the signalized intersections along
Bald Hill Road (Route 2) in Warwick, Rhode Island, between East Avenue (Route 113) and West
Natick Road and the unsignalized turnaround north of West Natick Road.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2)
Bald Hill Road (Route 2) within the project area is classified as an Urban Principal Arterial,
providing direct access to Interstate 295 northbound and southbound. Land use within the project
area is primarily commercial, with access to notable establishments such as the Warwick Mall
and the Rhode Island Mall provided directly from the roadway. Bald Hill Road (Route 2) is a
divided roadway, with two to three through lanes provided in each direction and designated
turning lanes provided at the signalized intersections. The posted speed limit on Bald Hill Road
(Route 2) through much of the project area is 35 miles per hour. Traveling south from Cranston
toward the site, the posted speed limit is 45 miles per hour. This speed limit is reduced to 35
miles per hour south of West Natick Road.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) at East Avenue (Route 113)
The intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with East Avenue (Route 113) forms a four-legged
signalized intersection. Bald Hill Road (Route 2) runs in a north/south direction and East Avenue
(Route 113) runs in an east/west direction. The northbound approach, on Bald Hill Road (Route
2) has one 14-foot designated left turn lane, two 10-foot through lanes, and a 16-foot channelized
right turn lane northbound with one 13-foot and one 17-foot travel lane southbound. The
southbound approach to the intersection on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) has two 12-foot designated
left turn lanes, two 12-foot through lanes, and one 12-foot designated right turn lane southbound
with a 12-foot and a 14-foot travel lane northbound. Bald Hill Road (Route 2) is a divided
roadway, with landscaped medians separating northbound and southbound traffic.

The eastbound approach to the intersection, on East Avenue (Route 113), has one 26-foot lane
eastbound and one 18-foot lane westbound separated by a solid double yellow line. A 9-foot
crosswalk is marked across this approach. The westbound approach has one 13-foot and one 12-
foot designated left turn lane, one 12-foot through lane, and one 16-foot channelized right turn
lane westbound with a 14-foot and a 21-foot travel lane westbound. Directional traffic on the
East Avenue (Route 113) westbound approach is separated by a landscaped median. East Avenue
(Route 113) is classified as an Urban Principal Arterial. The posted speed limit on East Avenue
(Route 113) east of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) is 40 miles per hour and west of Bald Hill Road
(Route 2) is 25 miles per hour. Land use in the vicinity of the intersection is commercial,
including two fast-food restaurants, retail stores, and a mall.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the Rhode Island Mall Driveway/I-295 Southbound Ramps
The intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with the Rhode Island Mall Driveway and the I-295
Southbound Ramps forms a three-legged signalized intersection. The I-295 on- and off-ramp are
located opposite the Rhode Island Mall Driveway, but are channelized right turns that are not
controlled by the traffic signal. Land use in the vicinity of the intersection is commercial,
including a restaurant, an auto service center, and a mall.

The northbound approach to the intersection, on Bald Hill Road (Route 2), has two 10-foot and
one 13-foot through lanes and a 20-foot channelized right turn lane northbound with one 11-foot,
one 12-foot, and one 13-foot travel lane southbound. The southbound approach on Bald Hill
Road (Route 2) has a 15-foot and a 12-foot designated left turn lane and two 12-foot through
lanes southbound with a 10-foot, and 11-foot, and a 12-foot travel lane northbound. The I-295



                                               -4-
southbound on-ramp, located just north of the stop bar for southbound traffic, is approximately 19
feet wide. Directional traffic on Bald Hill Road is separated by landscaped center medians.

The westbound approach to the intersection is formed by one of the entrances to the Rhode Island
Mall. The mall driveway carries two-way traffic, separated by a bituminous center median. The
westbound approach has one 23-foot travel lane and a 17-foot channelized right turn lane
westbound with a 23-foot travel lane eastbound. A 9-foot crosswalk is marked across the
northbound channelized right turn lane, the eastbound and westbound directions of the Rhode
Island Mall Driveway, and the channelized right turn lane from the Mall Driveway. The Mall
Driveway is a non-classified roadway.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and West Natick Road
The intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with West Natick Road forms a four-legged
signalized intersection. Bald Hill Road (Route 2) runs in a north/south direction at the
intersection and West Natick Road runs east/west. The northbound approach, on Bald Hill Road
(Route 2) has one 11-foot and one 13-foot through lane and two 12-foot channelized right turn
lanes northbound with two 13-foot through lanes southbound. Left turns are prohibited from the
northbound approach. The southbound approach to the intersection on Bald Hill Road (Route 2)
has one 12-foot and one 23-foot through lane southbound with one 13-foot and one 24-foot travel
lane northbound. Left turns are also prohibited from the southbound approach. Directional
traffic on both Bald Hill Road (Route 2) approaches is separated by landscaped center medians.

The eastbound approach on West Natick Road has one 28-foot travel lane. This approach carries
only eastbound traffic, and is typically used as two lanes although no separate lanes are striped.
Southbound Bald Hill Road (Route 2) traffic must use this approach to access West Natick Road
east of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the Warwick Mall. The westbound approach on West
Natick Road has two 12-foot designated left turn lanes and one 16-foot channelized right turn
lane westbound with two 12-foot through lanes eastbound. Directional traffic on this approach is
separated by a bituminous center median. West Natick Road is classified as an Urban Collector
west of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and as an Urban Principal Arterial east of Bald Hill Road, with
no posted speed limit. Land use in the vicinity of the intersection is a mix of commercial and
professional. Retail stores and restaurants are located on the northeast, northwest, and southwest
corners of the intersection. A medical office building and a mall are located on the southeast
corner of the intersection.

Bald Hill Road at the Turnaround
North of West Natick Road, Bald Hill Road (Route 2) splits into a northbound roadway and a
southbound roadway. The project site, the current location of Building 19 and former site of
Syms, is centered between the two roadways. A turnaround is located on Bald Hill Road (Route
2) approximately 700 feet north of West Natick Road, just south of the project site. The
turnaround provides the opportunity for northbound traffic to travel south towards Warwick or
west towards the connector that provides access to West Natick Road. Use of this connector is
required if northbound traffic wishes to access the Warwick Mall. Northbound on Bald Hill Road
(Route 2) at the turnaround, one 12-foot and one 27-foot through lane are provided. The 27-foot
lane provides access to the 31-foot channelized left turn lane. This left turn lane is stop-
controlled at the intersection, while the through lanes operate uncontrolled.

Southbound on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) at the turnaround, one 16-foot, one 13-foot, and one 22-
foot travel lane are provided. The 16-foot lane continues directly to the 82-foot channelized
connector to West Natick Road. The 13-foot travel lane continues south, and the 22-foot travel
lane continues south as a 12-foot through lane and provides access to the 36-foot u-turn lane to


                                               -5-
travel northbound. This u-turn lane, as well as both southbound through lanes, is uncontrolled at
the intersection.


Existing Traffic Volumes
Traffic volume data for the study area was collected by Pare Corporation on Wednesday and
Thursday, September 26 and 27, 2012, and Saturday, September 29, 2012. Manual turning
movement counts were performed at the intersections of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with East
Avenue (Route 113), Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with the Rhode Island Mall driveway, Bald Hill
Road (Route 2) with West Natick Road, and Bald Hill Road at the turnaround north of West
Natick Road. Based on the results of the weekday counts, the peak hours at each individual
intersection varied. Therefore, a network peak hour of 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. was selected for the
analysis. For the Saturday count, the peak hour at each of the intersections occurred between
12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m.

Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) counts were taken on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound
and southbound in the vicinity of the proposed site over a 72-hour period, from Thursday,
October 4, 2012 through Saturday, October 6, 2012. According to the results of the ATR, the
average weekday traffic volume on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound is approximately 9,900
vehicles per day, and the average weekday traffic volume on Bald Hill Road (Route 2)
southbound is 6,900 vehicles per day. The Saturday ATR indicated that the average traffic
volume on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound is 9,250 vehicles per day, while the average
traffic volume on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) southbound is 6,300 vehicles per day. The majority
of directional traffic on both days, approximately 59%, was traveling northbound along the
roadway.

It should be noted that the existing traffic volumes recorded at the study intersection include some
traffic from the Building 19 retail use which currently occupies the proposed site. The Building
19 will be removed for construction of the CarMax, which may result in slightly lower traffic
volumes at the study intersections than those recorded. To provide a conservative analysis of the
roadway network in the vicinity of the site, the existing Building 19 volumes were not removed
from the traffic stream.

Existing (2012) p.m. and Saturday peak hour volumes are provided in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively.

Safety Analysis

Crash Data
Crash data for the calendar years 2009 through 2011 received from the City of Warwick was
reviewed in the preparation of this study. Because the City line runs across the northern portion
of the site, crash data from the City of Cranston was also reviewed for the same time period.

Warwick Crash Data
The study area reviewed within the City of Warwick included Bald Hill Road (Route 2) from East
Avenue (Route 113) to the Warwick/Cranston City line. Over the course of three years, 354
crashes were reported along this approximate one mile stretch of roadway. These crashes include
all intersections within the study area, the I-295 northbound and southbound ramps, and a number
of crashes that were reported on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) without an intersecting street. The
location of those crashes without an intersecting street cannot be accurately identified, therefore,
it is possible that some are outside of the project area.

At the intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and East Avenue (Route 113), 197 crashes were
reported between 2009 and 2011. One hundred and nineteen were rear end crashes, 43 were
angle crashes, 27 were sideswipes in the same direction, 4 were motorist collisions with an object,
2 were sideswipes in the opposite direction, 1 was a head-on crash, and 1 was a loss of control
crash. Overall, the majority of crashes at this intersection were low severity rear-ends, which are
typical at signalized intersections

Only three crashes were reported at the intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with the entrance
to the Rhode Island Mall between 2009 and 2011. All three occurred in 2009, and none resulted
in an injury. One was an angle crash, one was a sideswipe in the same direction, and one was a
motorist collision with an object. The low number of crashes reported at this intersection does
not indicate the presence of an existing safety concern. It is possible that other crashes may have
occurred at this intersection within the study time frame, but were not referenced correctly.

Seventy-one crashes were reported at the intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with West
Natick Road between 2009 and 2011. Forty-three were rear-end crashes, 15 were angle crashes,
11 were sideswipes in the same direction, 1 was a sideswipe in the opposite direction, and 1 was a
motorist collision with an object. Sixty-one of the reported crashes resulted in property damage
only, while 10 resulted in an injury. The overall severity of the reported crashes at this
intersection is low, and it is not anticipated that the addition of traffic from the CarMax
development will create a safety concern.

Sixty-three additional crashes were reported at the intersections of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with
the I-295 on and off-ramps. Not all of the reported crashes indicated which ramp they occurred
at, therefore, all were grouped together. Forty-eight of the reported crashes were rear ends, 4
were angle crashes, 4 were sideswipes in the same direction, 3 were motorist collisions with an
object, 2 were head-on crashes, and 2 were motorist losses of control. Forty-six of the reported
crashes involved property damage only, while 17 resulted in an injury. The on-ramp intersections
are uncontrolled, while the off-ramp intersections operate under yield control. Overall, the
severity of the reported crashes is low, and no existing safety concern is apparent.

Table 1 provides a summary of the crashes reported in Warwick by intersection, severity, and
type of crash.

Cranston Crash Data
Crash data was provided by the City of Cranston for January 2009 through June 2012 for the area
on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound and southbound between the Warwick city line and the
intersection with the New London Avenue (Route 33) ramps. Within the 3.5-year period, 11
crashes were reported in the vicinity of the project site. Five crashes were reported on Bald Hill
Road (Route 2) at the WB Mason entrance, north of the site driveway, 4 crashes were reported on
Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound at the Building 19/Syms driveway, the proposed site
driveway, and 2 were reported at miscellaneous locations along Bald Hill Road (Route 2).

Of the crashes reported at the WB Mason entrance, 4 were sideswipes in the same direction and 1
was an angle crash. All five involved property damage only. Three of the four crashes reported
at the Building 19/Syms entrance were angle crashes and 1 was a motorist collision with an
animal. The 3 angle crashes involved one motorist who tried to turn right from the entrance on
the one-way roadway and two that involved a motorist turning into the site from the right lane or
out of the site into the right lane. All four crashes resulted in an injury.

Table 2 provides a summary of the crashes reported in Cranston by intersection, severity, and
type of crash. A complete crash summary is included in Appendix B.

The overall number of crashes reported in the vicinity of the site entrance is minimal given the
length of the study period. As these crashes were reported while the site was occupied by two
retail uses, it is expected that the in/out volume was higher and more consistent over the duration
of the day. It is not expected that the installation of an automobile dealership on the same site
will create new safety concerns along Bald Hill Road (Route 2).

Speed Study
Speed studies were performed on Tuesday, October 2, 2012 on Bald Hill Road (Route 2)
northbound and southbound in the vicinity of the proposed site driveways. Forty speed
measurements were taken with a radar gun in each direction. The results of the speed studies are
shown in Table 3 below.

Based on the results of the speed study, a design speed of 50 miles per hour was selected for Bald
Hill Road (Route 2) northbound and a design speed of 55 miles per hour was selected for Bald
Hill Road (Route 2) southbound.




                                                  -11-
Sight Distance
Stopping sight distance (SSD) and intersection sight distance (ISD) measurements were taken for
the existing site driveway on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound and the proposed site
driveway on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) southbound to ensure vehicles can safely exit the proposed
driveways. Sight distance measurements taken at the proposed sight driveway were compared to
those required by the AASHTO publication A Policy on Geometric Design of Streets and
Highways, 2011 Edition.

According to AASHTO, sight distance is the length of roadway ahead that is visible to the driver.
Stopping sight distance is the sum for the distance traversed by the vehicle from the instant a
driver sees an object requiring a stop and the distance needed to stop the vehicle from the instant
the brakes are applied. The AASHTO required SSD for the 35 mile per hour northbound posted
speed limit is 250 feet, and the required SSD for the selected 50 mile per hour design speed is 425
feet. In the southbound direction, the required SSD for the posted 45 mile per hour speed limit is
360 feet, and for the selected 55 mile per hour design speed is 495 feet.

For the northbound travel direction, the available SSD to the site entrance on Bald Hill Road
(Route 2) is approximately 745 feet, which exceeds the AASHTO requirement for the posted
speed limit and the selected design speed. For the southbound travel direction, the available SSD
to the site entrance on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) is approximately 685 feet, which exceeds the
AASHTO requirement for the posted speed limit and the selected design speed. Because each
section of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) carries single-direction traffic, sight distances are only
required in one direction from the proposed site entrances. Table 4 below provides a summary of
the available SSD.

Table 4: Stopping Sight Distance Summary
                                 Design Speed              Required SSD        Available SSD
            Northbound             50 MPH                     425 FT              745 FT
            Southbound             55 MPH                     495 FT              685 FT

Intersection sight distance (ISD) measurements were also taken from the proposed site entrances
on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound and southbound. ISD is provided to allow drivers to
perceive the presence of potentially conflicting vehicles when approaching an intersection. ISD
requirement are based on the principal that a driver approaching an intersection should have an
unobstructed view of the entire intersection and sufficient lengths along the intersection roadway
to permit the driver to anticipate and avoid potential collisions. ISD requirements vary for an
uncontrolled maneuver, a stop-controlled maneuver, and a yield-controlled maneuver. Currently,
the site exit onto Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound operates uncontrolled. Under future build
conditions, it is anticipated that both intersections will operate under yield control exiting the site.

For a left turn from a yield-controlled condition, the required ISD for a 35 mile per hour speed
limit is 415 feet, and for a 50 mile per hour design speed is 475 feet. For the posted 45 mile per
hour speed on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) southbound, the requirement for a left turn from yield-
control is 530 feet, and for the 55 mile per hour design speed is 650 feet. The AASHTO
description for intersection sight distance does indicate that if the available sight distance for an
entering vehicle is at least equal to the required SSD, then the motorist will have sufficient sight
distance to avoid a collision.

At the location of the existing site driveway on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound, the
available ISD is approximately 810 feet. This distance exceeds the AASHTO requirements for
both the posted speed limit and the selected design speed. At the proposed site entrance on Bald


                                                 -12-
Hill Road (Route 2) southbound, the available ISD is approximately 685 feet, which again
exceeds the AASHTO requirements for the posted speed limit and the selected design speed.
Table 5 below provides a summary of the available ISD.

Future Conditions
Future traffic volumes are determined by projecting the existing traffic volumes based on a
determined annual growth rate and including known potential developments within the study
area. The planning departments from the City of Cranston and the City of Warwick were
contacted to determine if there are currently any developments proposed within the vicinity of the
site whose trip generation information should be included in the CarMax study. Both planning
departments indicated that there are currently no proposed developments in the vicinity of the
CarMax site.

To account for background growth along the roadways in the vicinity of the project site, the
existing traffic volumes were projected over a five-year horizon from 2012 to 2017. Census data
available from the Rhode Island Statewide Planning Program was reviewed for both Cranston and
Warwick to determine the appropriate growth factor.

The Warwick data indicated that between 2000 and 2010, the City experienced a 3.7% decline in
overall population. The Cranston data indicated that the City had grown by 1.4% between 2000
and 2010, less than 1% per year. To provide a conservative analysis of background growth in the
vicinity of the proposed site, a rate of 1% per year was used.

A copy of the available census data is provided in Appendix C. Figure 5 provides the 2017 future
no-build volumes for the p.m. peak hour, and Figure 6 provides the 2017 future no-build volumes
for the Saturday peak hour.

Trip Generation

Existing Site Trip Generation
The existing site currently houses a Building 19 retail store, as well as a vacant retail store
(formerly Syms) and a vacant salon. No traffic counts were completed at the site driveway
intersection as part of this study. To estimate the number of daily and peak hour trips that could
access the site, the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual Trip Generation, 8th
edition, was used. For the retail stores, ITE Land Use Code 815, Free-Standing Discount Store,
was used, and for the salon, ITE Land Use Code 918, Hair Salon, was used. The table below
provides a summary of the trip generation for the existing site, assuming full capacity.

Proposed Site Trip Generation
Trip Generation estimates were completed for the proposed 18,276 square-foot CarMax
dealership using the ITE manual Trip Generation, 8th edition. Trip generation for the proposed
site was completed utilizing Land Use Code 841, New Car Sales. According to ITE, new car
sales centers may also include automobile services, parts sales, and used car sales. The proposed
CarMax facility is expected to include a 10,625 square foot sales area, a 3,342 square foot service
area, a 936 square foot car wash, and a 3,373 square foot presentation area. A summary of the
trip generation estimates is provided in Table 7 below, and complete trip generation calculations
can be found in Appendix C.

As indicated in Table 7, the proposed CarMax is expected to generate approximately 609 trips per
day on a typical weekday, with 50% entering and 50% exiting, and 384 trips per day on a typical
Saturday, also with 50% entering and 50% exiting. During the p.m. and Saturday peak hours, the
facility is expected to generate 59 and 54 trips, respectively. During the p.m. peak hour, 23 trips
are expected to enter and 36 trips are expected to exit. During the Saturday peak hour, 28 trips
are expected to enter and 26 trips are expected to exit.


                                               -16-
Comparing the proposed site trip generation to the existing site trip generation at full capacity, the
overall number of new trips expected on a typical weekday and a typical Saturday is considerably
less for the proposed CarMax. The proposed CarMax is expected to generate approximately 10%
of the trips generated by the retail/salon uses on a typical weekday, and approximately 5% of the
total trips on a typical Saturday. Overall, the proposed use is expected to have considerably less
impact on the roadway network surrounding the site than the existing retail/salon uses.

Pass-By and Diverted Linked Trips
There are instances where the overall number of trips generated by a proposed site is different
than the total number of new trips generated by the site. Many retail or commercial uses attract
pass-by trips or diverted linked trips from the existing traffic stream in addition to attracting new
trips. Pass-by trips are trips attracted to the site from passing traffic on a roadway adjacent to the
site and diverted linked trips are those attracted to the site from roadways in the vicinity of the
site. Diverted linked trips require a diversion from one roadway to another to access the site, and
would not pass directly by the site otherwise.

ITE provides some guidance as to the appropriate pass-by and diverted linked trip percentages for
various types of retail and commercial uses. ITE does not provide any information specifically
for new car sales, but does provide information for the related land use automobile parts sales.
According to ITE, pass-by rates for automobile parts sales can be as high as 43%, while diverted
linked trip percentages can be as high as 13%. It is expected that an automobile parts sales store
would attract more pass-by and diverted trips than a new car sales facility. Review of data from
cities and towns nationwide has shown a pass-by trip rate of 15% - 20% for new car sales. To
provide a conservative estimate of the area, a pass-by trip rate of 10% was used for the proposed
CarMax facility. Given the proximity of the site to I-295, both north and south of the site, a
diverted linked trip percentage of 10% was also applied. Table 8 below provides a summary of
the trip generation for the proposed CarMax facility including the pass-by and diverted linked
trips.

Trip Distribution
Trip distribution for the proposed CarMax facility was based on the existing trip distribution
during the peak hours along Bald Hill Road (Route 2) in the vicinity of the site. During the p.m.
peak hour, 67% of traffic on the roadway is traveling northbound, while the remaining 33% is
traveling southbound. During the Saturday peak hour, 61% of traffic on the roadway is traveling
northbound, while 39% is traveling southbound.

Trip distribution calculations are contained in Appendix C. Figure 7 provides the site-generated
trips for the p.m. and Saturday peak hours, and Figures 8 and 9 provide the Future (2017) Build
traffic volumes for the p.m. and Saturday peak hours, respectively, at all the existing study
intersections and proposed site driveways.

Capacity Analysis
Capacity analysis was completed for each of the study intersections under Existing (2012)
Conditions, Future (2017) No-Build Conditions, and Future (2017) Build Conditions. The
weekday a.m. peak hour and the weekday p.m. peak hour was analyzed for each scenario.
Capacity analysis characterizes intersections based on their level of service (LOS). LOS is a
quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of
service measures such as speed, travel times, traffic interruptions, etc. Six LOS are defined for
both signalized and unsignalized intersections, from A to F, with A representing the best
operating conditions and F representing the worst operating conditions. The LOS criteria for both
types of intersections are provided below.

Table 9: LOS Criteria

             C                  > 20 ­ 35                      > 15 - 25
             D                  > 35 - 55                      > 25 - 35
             E                  > 55 ­ 80                      > 35 - 50
             F                    > 80                           > 50

The traffic volumes used for the Existing (2012) Conditions scenario were those presented in
Figures 3 and 4, the traffic volumes used for the Future (2017) No-Build Condition were those
presented in Figures 5 and 6, and the traffic volumes used in the Future (2017) Build Condition
were those shown in Figures 8 and 9.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and East Avenue (Route 113)
During the p.m. peak hour, the signalized intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with East
Avenue (Route 113) operates at LOS E with approximately 63 seconds of delay per vehicle.
Under the future 2017 no-build condition, the intersection is expected to remain at LOS E with
approximately 72 seconds of delay per vehicle. The addition of the CarMax traffic to the
intersection has little impact. The intersection is expected to remain at LOS E, with an increase
in delay of approximately one second per vehicle.

During the Saturday peak hour, the overall intersection currently operates at LOS E with
approximately 74 seconds of delay per vehicle. Under the future 2017 no-build condition, the
intersection is expected to operate at LOS F with a delay of approximately 86 seonds per vehicle.
With the addition of the CarMax traffic, the intersection is expected to remain at LOS F, with an
overall increase in delay of less than one second per vehicle.

Optimization of the signal timing at this intersection was considered as a mitigation measure.
Currently, the intersection operates on the same timing plan for the entire day. Optimization,
including timing plans based on the time of day, shows minor improvements to the overall
intersection delay times, but significant negative improvements to several approach movements.
The intersection and approach LOS are not improved. As such, it is not recommended that the
signal timing at this intersection be revised.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the Rhode Island Mall Entrance
During the p.m. and Saturday peak hours, the intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with the
Rhode Island Mall entrance operates at LOS C or better, with less than 21 seconds of delay per
vehicle. Under future 2017 no-build conditions, the intersection LOS remains unchanged, and
delays increase by less than three seconds per vehicle. With the addition of the CarMax traffic to
the intersection, the overall LOS remains unchanged, and the intersection delays increase by less
than one second per vehicle.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) at West Natick Road
The intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) with West Natick Road currently operates at LOS C
during the p.m. and Saturday peak hours. Under future 2017 no-build and future 2017 build
conditions, the intersection is expected to continue operating at LOS C, with increases in delay
times less than two seconds per vehicle.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the Turnaround north of West Natick Road
The approaches to the intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the turnaround north of West
Natick Road operate at LOS A during both the p.m. and Saturday peak hours. Under future 2017
no-build and future 2017 build conditions, the intersection approaches are expected to remain at
LOS A, with an overall increase in delay of less than one second per vehicle.

Bald Hill Road (Route 2) and the Proposed Site Driveway
The approaches to the intersection of Bald Hill Road (Route 2) northbound with the proposed site
driveway are expected to operate at LOS B or better during the p.m. and Saturday peak hours.
Approach delay times are expected to be less than 14 seconds per vehicle.

The proposed site driveway on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) southbound is expected to be used for
test-drive traffic only, and will not carry peak hour and daily traffic. Therefore, no capacity
analysis was completed for this intersection.

Table 10 provides a LOS table for the intersection, with capacity analysis results for all
intersections during the p.m. and Saturday peak hours. Complete capacity analysis results can be
found in Appendix D.

The legend for the tables is as follows:

Conclusions
While the overall number of crashes reported on Bald Hill Road (Route 2) within the study area
between 2009 and 2011 is high, the severity of the crashes is generally low. This corridor is a
high-traffic corridor, providing direct access to one of Rhode Island's premier retail
establishments. The majority of crashes along the corridor were rear-ends at the signalized
intersections. Given the overall traffic volume, these types of crashes are expected, but do not
present a significant safety concern. The volume of traffic being added to the corridor for the
proposed CarMax development is minimal in comparison to the existing volumes, and is not
expected to create safety issues within the study area.

Capacity analysis of the study intersections and the proposed site entrance shows mixed
operational results. The East Avenue (Route 113) intersection on Bald Hill Road (Route 2)
experiences the worst levels of service, LOS E and F, respectively, during the p.m. and Saturday
peak hours. This intersection currently operates at similar LOS and delay, experiencing minimal
change as a result of the addition of the CarMax traffic. The other intersections along the corridor
and the proposed site entrance are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service with delays
less than 25 seconds per vehicle. Similar to the East Avenue (Route 113) intersection, the impact
of the proposed CarMax development on these intersections is expected to be minimal and will
not significantly impact the existing operations.

Project Description
Background
The subject property is situated on the west side of Wall Street, north of Perimeter Drive. Current
development on the site consists of an undeveloped lot with a small section of existing parking for
the adjacent property. Proposed improvements at the site include the construction of a 10,288
square foot conference center, associated parking and detention pond. In addition, the existing
parking area on the site will be removed and additional parking will be constructed on the
adjacent property.



Stormwater Management ­ Existing Conditions
Stormwater runoff from the existing site currently sheet flows overland to the east side of the site
to an existing catch basin along Wall Street. The runoff continues in a 30" RCP under Wall Street
to an existing retention pond. There are no storm sewer or detention facilities currently in place on
site.



Stormwater Management ­ Proposed Conditions
Proposed improvements will not impact the general topography of the existing site. The site will
continue to fall to the east side. Stormwater will be collected by a series of catch basins around
the building and throughout the parking area. Collected runoff will drain through the
interconnected 12" and 15" HDPE storm pipes to a detention pond located on the northeast side
of the site. The runoff will then be conveyed through the detention pond, designed with a forebay
and other required water quality components. The outlet structure in the pond has been designed
so that it will provide a controlled release into a proposed 12" HDPE pipe. The stormwater will
then travel through a proposed 12" HDPE pipe to an existing manhole, which will convey the
runoff under Wall Street to an existing retention pond.



Design Criteria and Methods
The City of Dublin's Stormwater Management Design Manual, dated June 2013, was used as the
basis for all calculations and analysis.

The pre and post developed stormwater runoff was generated using the SCS method. According
to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, the soils for the site were Type C/D.
Therefore, according to the Soil Conservation Service, a runoff curve number of 80 was used for
landscaped (grassy) areas and a runoff curve number of 98 was used for impervious surfaces.

Rainfall depths were found using the rainfall depths from the NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version
3.0 on page 2-5, see Table 1 below.

Table 1 Rainfall Depths (39.972 N, 83.01 W)

These values along with the runoff coefficients were used to determine the pre-developed and
post-developed volumes of runoff for the 1 year, 24 hours storm. These volumes were then
compared to determine the critical storm.

                                                                                3
The calculated pre-developed 1-year, 24-hour storm runoff volume was 6,861 ft and the
                                                                           3
calculated post-developed 1-year, 24-hour storm runoff volume was 11,138 ft .

The following equation was used to determine the critical storm.

(Post-Pre)/Pre x 100 = Percent of Increase in Runoff Volume = Critical Storm
(11,138-6,861)/6,861 x 100 = 62%

 volume is                                    storm runoff

 250                 500                    50 year


Upon calculation, the 10-year storm was determined to be the critical storm. See calculations in
the appendix.

Based on information provided by the City of Dublin Engineering Department, the site is located
in the South Fork Indian Run Watershed, sub-basin 1220. According to the South Fork Indian
Run Watershed Release Rate Requirements, sub-basin's release rate is 0.0 cfs/ac. Noted in the
requirements, in the case of 0.0 cfs/ac release rate, design based on a default value of 0.01
cfs/ac.

 Note:
 1) When zero is encountered for a release rate, use a default value of
 0.01.

Based on the requirements, the allowable release rate for the critical storm is 0.01 cfs/ac x 2.22
ac = 0.022 cfs

An outlet structure with an orifice and overflow was designed for the detention pond on site. An
orifice plate was sized to restrict the flow out of the pipe. While recognizing the requirements set
forth in the Stormwater Master Plan, it was unfeasible to size the orifice to release 0.022 cfs. The
chances of blockage with an orifice less than 0.5" were highly probably and the modelling
software used was unable to compute with such a small size. In order to prevent clogging of the
outlet, the orifice was sized to be 3". While using a 3" orifice allows more flow to leave the site
than 0.022 cfs, it is still far below the pre-developed flows from the site, see Table 4 below.

WD Partners hopes the city will take into consideration the issues with constructability and
potential for blockage with such a small release rate and orifice size and make an exception to
the rules.



Storm Sewer Design Calculations
All storm pipes have been designed at a minimum of 2 feet per second and for the 10-year
frequency event at full flow capacity. Calculations for pipe capacities have been included in the
Report Exhibits.

Water Quality Design Calculations
The post-developed water quality calculations were based on Dublin's Stormwater Management
Design Manual. Per the Stormwater Runoff Quality Requirements, the design water quality
volume for all stormwater control measures shall be the runoff from the first ¾" of rainfall of each
storm event. Stormwater enters the detention pond and travels through a forebay and other
required water quality components, treating the first ¾" of runoff. Water Quality calculations have
been included in the Report Exhibits.



Water Quality Volume:
WQv (ac-ft) = C * (P/12) * A
Where:          C = runoff quality coefficient (refer to OEPA Permit # OHC000004 for values)
                         or use the equation:
                            3       2
                C = 0.858i ­ 0.78i + 0.774i + 0.04
                         Where i = fraction of post-construction impervious surface = 61%
                C = (0.858)(.61^3) ­ (0.774)(.61^2) + (0.774)(.61) + 0.04
                C = 0.42
                P = 0.75 precipitation depth (inches)
                A = area tributary to the basin (acres)

WQv = 0.42 * (.75/12) * 2.22
WQv = 0.058 ac-ft

Extended Detention Volume = 0.75 * WQv = 0.044 ac-ft
Sediment Storage Volume = 0.2 * WQv = 0.12 ac-ft
Forebay/Micropool Volume (each) = 0.1 * 0.75 * WQv = 0.004 ac-ft

                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Noah's is proposing to develop a site in the City of Dublin with an event center. The site is
located in the City of Dublin on the east side of Wall Street north of Perimeter Drive. The
land use proposed for the site is a 10,300 SF event center. There is one proposed access on
Wall Street. Since the proposed site will generate more trips than the previously zoned site, a
traffic impact study is required by the City of Dublin. The City requires a 10 Year design so
2014 was assumed to be Opening Day which makes 2024 the horizon year.

Typically, trip generation is computed using the current edition of Trip Generation published
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). However, Trip Generation does not
provide data for Event Centers. In the MOU, the methodologies for projecting traffic and the
comparison to the existing zoning were described.

2014 and 2024 `No Build' and `Build' volumes were developed for use in turn lane warrant
analyses and unsignalized capacity analyses. The comparison of the 2024 `No Build' and
`Build' is what the City uses to determine what, if any, mitigation is required. Therefore, the
following are the conclusions of the traffic study:
                                      2024 `No Build'
       Post Road & Discovery Boulevard
             The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level of Service (LOS).
             A westbound left turn lane is not warranted.
             An eastbound right turn lane is warranted.

       Perimeter Drive & Discovery Boulevard-Venture Drive
            The impeded northbound left turn movement operates at LOS "E". This is a
            typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway approach at an
            intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the only correction
            to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an acceptable LOS.
            A westbound right turn lane is not warranted.

       Perimeter Drive & Wall Street-Venture Drive
            The impeded southbound left turn movement operates at LOS "F". This is a
            typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway approach at an
            intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the only correction
            to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an acceptable LOS.
            A westbound right turn lane is warranted.

       Discovery Boulevard & Wall Street
            The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level of Service (LOS).
            A southbound left turn lane is not warranted.
            A northbound right turn lane is not warranted.

                               2024 `Build'

Post Road & Discovery Boulevard
      Same as No Build: The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level
      of Service (LOS).
      Same as No Build: A westbound left turn lane is not warranted.
      Same as No Build: An eastbound right turn lane is warranted.

Perimeter Drive & Discovery Boulevard-Venture Drive
     Same as No Build: The impeded minor street movements operate at LOS
     "F". This is a typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway
     approach at an intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the
     only correction to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an
     acceptable LOS.
     Same as No Build: A westbound right turn lane is not warranted.
     Site traffic represents 3.33% of the traffic at the intersection. (Calculations
     are in Appendix "H")

Perimeter Drive & Wall Street-Venture Drive
     Same as No Build: The impeded minor street movements operate at LOS
     "F". This is a typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway
     approach at an intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the
     only correction to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an
     acceptable LOS.
     Same as No Build: A westbound right turn lane is warranted.
     Site traffic represents 5.83% of the traffic at the intersection. (Calculations
     are in Appendix "H")

Discovery Boulevard & Wall Street
     Same as No Build: The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level
     of Service (LOS).
     Same as No Build: A southbound left turn lane is not warranted.
     Same as No Build: A northbound right turn lane is not warranted.

Wall Street & Prop. Noah's Access
     The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level of Service (LOS).
     A northbound left turn lane is not warranted.
     A southbound right turn lane is not warranted.
     A site distance exhibit has been provided. See Appendix "G".




               Noah's ­ Dublin Site Traffic Impact Study - 2
                                     BACKGROUND
Noah's is proposing to develop a site in the City of Dublin with an event center. The site is
located in the City of Dublin on the east side of Wall Street north of Perimeter Drive. The
land use proposed for the site is a 10,300 SF event center. The site location is shown on
Figure 1. There is one proposed access on Wall Street. The site plan is shown in Figure 2.
Since the proposed site will generate more trips than the previously zoned site, a traffic
impact study is required by the City of Dublin. This report outlines the findings of the traffic
impact study prepared by Traffic Engineering Services (TES).

After an initial conversation with the City, a Memo of Understanding (MOU) dated
September 5, 2013 was submitted to the City. The City provided comments in an e-mail
dated September 17, 2013. A revised MOU dated December 4, 2013 was submitted to the
City. This was considered approved with comment in an e-mail dated December 12, 2013.
Copies of all referenced correspondence is in Appendix "A".

                              EXISTING CONDITIONS
The following is information about the streets in the study area.

                       Perimeter Dr.: 3 lanes; 35 MPH speed limit.
                       Post Rd.: 2 lanes; 35 MPH speed limit.
                       Discovery Blvd.: 2 lanes; 25 MPH speed limit.
                       Wall St.: 2 lanes; 25 MPH speed limit.

Peak hour (7-9 AM and 4-6 PM) turning movement counts were available for use in the
study at the following locations:

                       Post Rd. & Discovery Blvd.
                       Discovery Blvd. & Wall St.
                       Perimeter Dr. & Discovery Blvd. (AM Peak Only)
                       Perimeter Dr. & Wall St.

One consistent peak hour was used in the analysis which was from 7:45-8:45 AM and 5-6
PM. The original reports from all of the available turning movement counts are in Appendix
"B".

Trip Generation
Typically, trip generation is computed using the current edition of Trip Generation published
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). However, Trip Generation does not
provide data for Event Centers. In the MOU, the methodologies for projecting traffic and the
comparison to the existing zoning were described. A copy of the MOU is in Appendix "A".
The result of this was the determination that trip generation for an event center should be
used in the analysis.

Table 1 shows the trip generation developed for an event center. The daily traffic in the table
was projected by assuming two capacity events would occur in one day. Therefore, there
could be 500 people arriving and departing twice. The assumption of two people per car
described in the MOU was also applied to the daily traffic.

Traffic volumes generated in off peak hours will vary depending on start and end times of
particular events and the size of the events. The number of peak hour trips represents a
capacity event which would be the most conservative traffic and could occur in an off peak
hour. Based on the Owners parking statistics from two similar sized sites, an average event
has approximately 32% of the parking utilized.      Based on the traffic projected for the
proposed site, an average event would represent about 40 trips within an hour that an event
began or ended.

Trip Distribution
The traffic was applied to the street network based on the existing general distribution which
is as follows:
                                          AM Peak
                              22% to/from west on Post Road
                              52% to/from west on Perimeter Drive
                              26% to/from east on Perimeter Drive

                                          PM Peak
                              21% to/from west on Post Road
                              35% to/from west on Perimeter Drive
                              44% to/from east on Perimeter Drive

The distribution calculations are in Appendix "C".

                            2014 AND 2024 TRAFFIC
An area (all public streets) growth rate of 4.07% per year (compounded) was calculated
based on the weighted average of the AM and PM Peak hour for two links. 2030 adjusted
volumes based on the travel demand model were available from the Delta Energy Dublin
Development TIS. The figure from the report is in Appendix "D". The two links that were
compared were Perimeter Drive west of Wall Street and Wall Street north of Perimeter
Drive. The calculations are also in Appendix "D".

Figures 3-4 show all components of the 2014 `Build' traffic. Figures 5-6 show all
components of the 2024 `Build' traffic. To assist with review, exhibits showing the `No
Build' traffic are in Appendix "D".

 Turn Lane Warrant Analysis
 The procedure to determine whether turn lanes are warranted is according to the State
 Highway Access Management Manual (AMM) published by the Ohio Department of
 Transportation (ODOT). According to the ODOT L&D Manual, turn lane warrants only
 apply to unsignalized free flow approaches.

 Table 2 shows a summary of the results. The graphs from the AMM are in Appendix "E".
 The results show that there are no changes to the status of the turn lanes warrants between the
 `No Build' and `Build' conditions so there are no developer improvements necessary to
 mitigate the site traffic.

Unsignalized Capacity Analyses
Unsignalized capacity analyses were performed at all intersections in the study area. In the
analyses, delays are computed which correspond to a Level of Service (LOS) "A" through
"F". Typically, Level of Service (LOS) "D" or above is considered an acceptable LOS. For
a Two-Way Stop condition, the unsignalized capacity analysis gives LOS results for vehicles
that must wait for gaps to make their maneuver. In this case, the movements experiencing
delay would be the left turns from the major street and the minor street movements. All other
movements are free flowing so they don't encounter delay. Since driver expectations are
different for various types of traffic control, there are different LOS criteria for unsignalized
intersections versus signalized intersections. The LOS criteria for unsignalized intersections
are shown in Table 3.
               Level of Service         Delay Range (seconds/vehicle)
                      A            < 10
                      B            > 10 and < 15
                      C            > 15 and < 25
                      D            > 25 and < 35
                      E            > 35 and < 50
                      F            > 50

             TABLE 3 - Level of Service Criteria for Unsignalized Intersections

The following comprises the background of the analysis:
              HCS+ V5.6 was used to perform the analysis.
              The existing intersection peak hour factor (PHF) was used for existing study
              area intersections. For existing and proposed driveway intersections a peak
              hour factor of 0.9 was assumed.
              A 2% heavy vehicle percentage was assumed in the analysis.
              The warranted `No Build' turn lanes were not considered in the analyses.
              Because of the lower volumes along Discovery Blvd. and Wall St., only the
              2024 conditions were analyzed for intersections along those streets.
              If any movement operated below LOS D, roundabout analyses was
              performed for the intersection in that condition and all subsequent conditions.

A summary of the results are shown in Tables 4-5. The HCS reports are in Appendix "F".

Roundabout Capacity Analyses
Roundabout capacity analyses were performed at any intersection where an unsignalized
movement operated less than LOS "D". In the capacity analyses, delays are computed which
correspond to a Level of Service (LOS) "A" through "F". Typically, Level of Service (LOS)
"D" or above is considered an acceptable LOS. The LOS criteria for roundabouts are shown
in Table 6.

                Level of Service          Delay Range (seconds/vehicle)
                       A             < 10
                       B             > 10 and < 15
                       C             > 15 and < 25
                       D             > 25 and < 35
                       E             > 35 and < 50
                       F             > 50

                   TABLE 6 - Level of Service Criteria for Roundabouts
The following comprises the background of the signalized capacity analysis:
  HCS 2010 6.50 was used to perform the analysis.
  The existing intersection Peak Hour Factor (PHF) was applied.

A summary of the results are shown in Table 7. The HCS reports are in Appendix "F".

                                    CONCLUSIONS
2014 and 2024 `No Build' and `Build' volumes were developed for use in turn lane warrant
analyses and unsignalized capacity analyses. The comparison of the 2024 `No Build' and
`Build' is what the City uses to determine what, if any, mitigation is required. Therefore, the
following are the conclusions of the traffic study:

                                      2024 `No Build'
       Post Road & Discovery Boulevard
             The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level of Service (LOS).
             A westbound left turn lane is not warranted.
             An eastbound right turn lane is warranted.

       Perimeter Drive & Discovery Boulevard-Venture Drive
            The impeded northbound left turn movement operates at LOS "E". This is a
            typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway approach at an
            intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the only correction
            to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an acceptable LOS.
            A westbound right turn lane is not warranted.

       Perimeter Drive & Wall Street-Venture Drive
            The impeded southbound left turn movement operates at LOS "F". This is a
            typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway approach at an
            intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the only correction
            to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an acceptable LOS.
            A westbound right turn lane is warranted.

       Discovery Boulevard & Wall Street
            The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level of Service (LOS).
            A southbound left turn lane is not warranted.
            A northbound right turn lane is not warranted.


                                        2024 `Build'

       Post Road & Discovery Boulevard
             Same as No Build: The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level
             of Service (LOS).
             Same as No Build: A westbound left turn lane is not warranted.
             Same as No Build: An eastbound right turn lane is warranted.

       Perimeter Drive & Discovery Boulevard-Venture Drive
            Same as No Build: The impeded minor street movements operate at LOS
            "F". This is a typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway
            approach at an intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the



                       Noah's ­ Dublin Site Traffic Impact Study - 18
       only correction to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an
       acceptable LOS.
       Same as No Build: A westbound right turn lane is not warranted.
       Site traffic represents 3.33% of the traffic at the intersection. (Calculations
       are in Appendix "H")

Perimeter Drive & Wall Street-Venture Drive
     Same as No Build: The impeded minor street movements operate at LOS
     "F". This is a typical LOS for an unsignalized minor street or driveway
     approach at an intersection with a higher volume street. A roundabout is the
     only correction to this condition. A roundabout would operate with an
     acceptable LOS.
     Same as No Build: A westbound right turn lane is warranted.
     Site traffic represents 5.83% of the traffic at the intersection. (Calculations
     are in Appendix "H")

Discovery Boulevard & Wall Street
     Same as No Build: The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level
     of Service (LOS).
     Same as No Build: A southbound left turn lane is not warranted.
     Same as No Build: A northbound right turn lane is not warranted.

Wall Street & Prop. Noah's Access
     The impeded movements operate at an acceptable Level of Service (LOS).
     A northbound left turn lane is not warranted.
     A southbound right turn lane is not warranted.
     A site distance exhibit has been provided. See Appendix "G".

Re: Noah's Event Center TIS

Please consider this letter as a Memo of Understanding (MOU) for the TIS required for
the subject site. The site is located in the City of Dublin on the east side of Wall Street
north of Perimeter Drive. The land use proposed for the site is a 10,300 SF event
center. The scope of the study described below is based on conversations with City
staff. We have also included some follow up information.

   x   Study area - The study area includes the following intersections:
          o All proposed site access points
          o Discovery Blvd & Post Road
          o Discovery Blvd & Wall St
          o Discovery Blvd & Perimeter Dr
          o Perimeter Dr & Wall St

   x   Time Periods - Weekday AM Peak hour (one hour between 7 AM and 9 AM);
       Weekday PM Peak hour (one hour between 4 PM and 6 PM).

   x   Data Collection ­ Turning movement counts taken as part of another study in
       this area that has been submitted to the City are acceptable for use.

   x   Trip Generation ­ Typically, trip generation is computed using the current
       edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
       (ITE). However, Trip Generation does not provide data for Event Centers. A
       web search for information regarding trip generation at this type of facility
       resulted in finding a traffic impact study for the proposed The Ridge Event Center
       in Orem, UT. The Ridge Event Center TIS (Ridge TIS) is attached. The facility
       analyzed in the Ridge TIS is of similar use and size to the subject site. The
       owner noted that the capacity of the proposed Noah's facility will be 250 people.
       Findings for PM Peak Hour trip generation in the Ridge TIS were based upon
       observations, traffic counts, and interviews with management of an existing
       convention center facility. The Ridge TIS also notes that the nature of the use of
       the facility indicated that most trips occur outside the PM Peak Hour.

       Based upon information from the owner (summary attached), events are
       scheduled such that there is at least a two hour window to clean and reset for the
       next event.   Therefore, there would not be an event ending and another

       beginning within the same hour. The most critical condition for analysis of an
       event center is proposed to be a capacity business event that begins within the
       AM Peak hour and concludes within the PM Peak hour.

       The Ridge TIS applied an assumption of three people per vehicle and 88% of the
       trips were inbound prior to the beginning of an event. The City has indicated that
       the assumption of three people per vehicle is not acceptable to apply to a
       business event.

       The owner provided information from a parking study at other sites which is
       attached. Two sites (Chandler, Arizona and Westminster, Colorado) that have
       slightly larger buildings than what is proposed in Dublin indicate that less than
       1% of events exceed the lot capacity which is in the 126 to 132 range for those
       sites. Applying an assumption of two people per vehicle for the Dublin site,
       would result in 125 trips which is consistent with the parking data at the similar
       sized site. Therefore, an assumption of two people for vehicle is assumed in the
       trip generation.

       The City has indicated that a comparison needs to be made between the trip
       generation of the proposed use and the trip generation of the permitted uses.
       Whichever has the most intense traffic is what is considered in the study. In
       reviewing the permitted uses, it was determined that general office, medical
       office, and fitness and recreational sports centers should be evaluated. There is
       not any known limitation to the size of the building in the zoning text so the
       assumption of a 25,000 SF (2.5 acre* 10,000 SF/Acre) building is assumed for
       each type of building.

       A table with comparisons of trip generation for the event center, office, medical
       office, and athletic club is attached. Note that for the office use in the PM Peak,
       utilizing the regression equation yields unrealistic results because the PM
       outbound is over 66% of the AM Inbound. Therefore, the trips were adjusted
       such that the outbound trips in the PM peak were equal to the inbound trips in the
       AM peak. The result is the athletic club generates more trips than the event
       center in the PM peak but the event center is higher in the AM Peak. Therefore,
       the event center will be used in the analysis.

Trip Distribution ­ The traffic will be applied to the street network based on the existing
general distribution established in the MOU dated 6/6/2013 for The Village at Coffman
Park Traffic Impact Study. Since the Noah's site is in closer proximity to Perimeter
Drive, it was assumed that all traffic oriented to the east would arrive and depart via
Perimeter Drive. The following is the proposed trip generation for the study.


                                          AM Peak
                             22% to/from west on Post Road
                             52% to/from west on Perimeter Drive
                             26% to/from east on Perimeter Drive

                             44% to/from east on Perimeter Drive

      x   Design Year ­ An Opening Day and a 10 Year design horizon are required.
          Opening day is anticipated to be 2014 so the design year will be 2024.

      x   Growth Rates ­ An area (all public streets) growth rate of 4.07% per year
          (compounded) was calculated as part of The Village of Coffman Park TIS. This
          growth rate will be used in the TIS.

      x   Analysis
            o Turn lane warrants
            o Capacity analyses and mitigation strategies (if LOS is less than D on any
               movement)

      x   Site Distance ­ An assessment of site distance at the proposed access
          locations will be made.

If this MOU is acceptable to you, please indicate your approval in the space provided
below. If not, please let us know what items need to be changed. Thank you for your
attention to this.

*Average number is Based on total cars parked for the day. Average number is often times separated by daytime parking and evening parking. Heaviest weighted average in the evening.

Chandler, Westminster and Irving have a higher ratio of large conference space to overall square footage resulting in higher parking counts per 1,000 sq.feet.

Noah's opinion:

The proper ratio for our type of use is 8 to 9 parking stalls per 1000sq. feet. As demonstrated by study, 94 to 98% of the use falls within this parameter.
In practical terms, perhaps 1 to perhaps 2 events per month exceed the capacity.

Re: Noah's Reception Center TIS

Please consider this letter as a Memo of Understanding (MOU) for the TIS required for
the subject site. The site is located in the City of Dublin on the east side of Wall Street
north of Perimeter Drive. The land uses proposed for the site is a reception center. The
scope of the study described below is based on a conversation with the City. We have
also included some follow up information.

   x   Study area - The study area includes the following intersections:
          o All proposed site access points
          o Discovery Blvd & Post Road
          o Discovery Blvd & Wall St
          o Discovery Blvd & Perimeter Dr
          o Perimeter Dr & Wall St

   x   Time Periods - Weekday AM Peak hour (one hour between 7 AM and 9 AM);
       Weekday PM Peak hour (one hour between 4 PM and 6 PM).

   x   Data Collection ­ Turning movement counts taken as part of another study in
       this area that has been submitted to the City are acceptable for use.

   x   Trip Generation ­ Typically, trip generation is computed using the current
       edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
       (ITE). However, Trip Generation does not provide data for Reception Centers. A
       web search for information regarding trip generation at this type of facility
       resulted in finding a traffic impact study for the proposed The Ridge Event Center
       in Orem, UT. The Ridge Event Center TIS (Ridge TIS) is attached. The facility
       in the TIS is of similar use and size to the subject site. The owner noted that the
       capacity of the proposed Noah's facility is 250 people. Findings for PM Peak
       Hour trip generation in the Ridge TIS were based upon observations, traffic
       counts, and interviews with management of an existing convention center facility.
       It noted that three people per car were assumed. The Ridge TIS also notes that
       the nature of the use of the facility indicated that most trips occur outside the PM
       Peak Hour.

       We propose to use the assumption of the capacity event arriving during each
       peak hour. From the Ridge TIS we will apply the assumption of 3 people per

       vehicle and that 88% of the trips were inbound. This would result in 84 vehicle
       trip ends in each peak hour and corresponds well to the 103 parking spaces
       being proposed.
       The City has indicated that a comparison needs to be made between trip
       generation of the proposed use and the trip generation of the permitted use.
       Whichever is has the most intense traffic is what is considered in the study. It is
       our understanding that office and medical office is permitted on the site. At this
       point, there is not any limitation to the size of the building so the assumption of a
       25,000 SF (2.5 acre* 10,000 SF/Acre) building is assumed for each type of office
       building.

       The table with comparisons of trip generation of the proposed, office, and
       medical office is attached. Note that for the office use in the PM Peak, utilizing
       the regression equation yields unrealistic results because the PM outbound is
       over 66% the AM Inbound. Therefore, the trips were adjusted such that the
       outbound trips in the PM were equal to the inbound trips in the AM. The result is
       the medical office building generates the same number of PM peak trips as the
       proposed use but the proposed use is higher in the AM Peak. Therefore, the
       reception center will be used in the analysis.

       Trip Distribution ­We will propose a distribution once we collect the data. If the
       City has received other TISs in the area that have distribution information, these
       may be helpful in proposing a distribution for this site.

                                          AM Peak
                             22% to/from west on Post Road
                             52% to/from west on Perimeter Drive
                             26% to/from east on Perimeter Drive

                                          PM Peak
                             21% to/from west on Post Road
                             35% to/from west on Perimeter Drive
                             44% to/from east on Perimeter Drive

   x   Design Year ­ An Opening Day and a 10 Year design horizon are required.
       Opening day is anticipated to be 2014 so the design year will be 2024.

   x   Growth Rates ­ An area (all public streets) growth rate of 4.07% per year
       (compounded) was calculated as part of The Village of Coffman Park TIS in the
       area. We propose to use this growth rate in the TIS.

   x   Analysis
         o Turn lane warrants
         o Capacity analyses and mitigation strategies (if LOS is less than D on any
            movement)

   x   Site Distance ­ An assessment of site distance at the proposed access
       locations will be made.

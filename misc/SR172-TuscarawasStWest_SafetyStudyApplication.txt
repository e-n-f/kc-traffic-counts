Project Description
Summary of Problem Statement
The SR172 (Tuscarawas St. West) corridor is the 22nd highest crash HotSpot section in the
State as listed by the 2009 ODOT Safety Program. A detailed Safety Study revealed in the most
recent three year (2008-2010) period there were a total of 383 applicable crashes as documented
by the ODOT CAM-Tool that occurred on SR172 from Whipple to Smith Avenues. This 1.4 mile
section had a crash rate of 8.52 crashes per MVMT which is nearly 6 times higher than the
State average of 1.44 for a similar facility. It experienced a total of 8 pedestrian/bicycle crashes
which is 1.5 times more than the State average involving these types of crashes. Based on the
Safety Study findings, the following elements were identified:
·   Nearly 63% of the crashes occurred at an intersection or was intersection related. Additionally,
    5.8% of the crashes occurred at driveway access locations. The 26 intersections (8 signalized)
    and the numerous driveway accesses create excessive turning conflicts on the corridor.
·   The four most common crash types includes rear-end, angle, side-swipe and left turn crashes,
    which account for over 84% of all crashes. The majority of these are turn conflict related.
·   Several intersections along the corridor have offset alignments which creates interlocking
    turning conflicts while motorists negotiate their turning movements.
·   Visibility of signalized intersections and optimized operations could be greatly improved by
    upgrading to the latest technologies. The signals do not currently have video detection, black
    polycarbonate signal heads per lane with reflective backplates and pedestrian countdown signal
    heads, all of which would improve intersection visibility and pedestrian safety.
·   The SR172 corridor experiences frequent pedestrian and bicycle traffic given the surrounding
    land uses. Current pedestrian/bicycle facilities do not provide enhanced visibility of these modes
    of transportation to motorists. Currently there are missing sections of sidewalks and there are
    no countdown pedestrian signal heads at signalized intersections. Particular emphasis should
    be focused on enhancing pedestrian/bicycle improvements on the 3,800' section from Bellflower
    to Smith Avenues since 7 of the 8 pedestrian/bicycle crashes occurred on this particular section.
    The percentage of pedestrian/bicycle crashes during the three-year period of 2008­2010 was
    1.5 times higher than the State Average.
Summary of Recommended Countermeasures
The full recommended improvements being applied for in this funding application include
the following (see Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1 in the Safety Study for a graphical presentation of
countermeasures ­ the Safety Study is included in this application package):
SR172 Corridor Full Recommended Improvements:
   Provide full upgrades to the 7 city-owned traffic signals on the corridor and a partial upgrade to
   the ODOT signal to provide improved traffic operations through more efficient signal controllers
   & video detection and to provide enhance visibility. The upgrades are needed based on new
   technologies and new design standards rather than due to a maintenance issue. The existing
   poles and controllers based on field review and discussions with the City will not support
   upgrading to the desired standards of providing a signal head per lane; providing reflective
   backplates; video detection; new controllers; countdown pedestrian signal heads; ADA
   compliant pushbutton placements; and new signal timing/phasing & progression. These
   improvements would add weight to existing poles and potentially not meet load standards.
   Enhance intersection safety by improving signing; pavement markings; increasing turning radii
   where determined necessary/feasible; and improve left turn storage at signalized intersections.
   Provide improved access management on corridor with such techniques as a mix of raised
   concrete medians (with mountable curbs for emergency vehicles); turn restrictions at identified
   crash locations; drive consolidations; drive removals; improved geometrics; and U-Turn lanes
   where feasible; all of which will be determined in the Preliminary Engineering/Design Phase.
   Provide improved lane balancing and striping improvements throughout the corridor. Based on
   functional classification and that this route is not a designated Federal Aid Primary route,
   consideration can be given to reduce lane widths to 11' for travel lanes and 10' for turn lanes,
   which may provide additional width for improved sidewalks and radii improvements;
   It is recommended that missing sections in sidewalk coverage be constructed so to provide
   continuous sidewalks through the corridor on both sides of the roadway, and that all curb ramps
   not meeting ADA standards be upgraded to meet current standards;
   Improve signing and crosswalks to provide awareness to motorists of pedestrian/bicycle activity,
   especially on the 3,800' section from Bellflower to Smith Avenues where 7 of the 8
   pedestrian/bicycle crashes occurred;
   Incorporate safer transit stops into corridor as these are also locations where pedestrian/bicycle
   activity is prevalent;
   Provide solar powered LED school zone flasher sign for the school located just north of SR172
   between the intersections of Clarendon and Arlington Avenues.
   Re-align the offset intersections found on the corridor where feasible, or control the movements
   associated with these offsets through either the use of directional restricted drives or by a raised
   median or other geometric improvements.
   Relocate a portion of Dartmouth Avenue so that is aligns with the current T-type intersection of
   Broad Avenue. The feasibility of this improvement will be determined in the Preliminary
   Engineering/Design Phase. This improvement will require close coordination with the Aultman
   Hospital as it would entail a need for new right-of-way (ROW), demolition of a building, and
   vacating/removing a section of Dartmouth. The Aultman Hospital in the past has expressed an
   interest to the City to revise Dartmouth so to provide a safer ingress/egress for their employees
   and hospital patient traffic. A separate ROR analyses and cost estimate was conducted in the
   Safety Study for this improvement in case it ever needed to be separated out of the overall
   project due to time frames for ROW acquisitions, costs, or from the hospital modifying their
   support for the project. For this application, the cost is included in the overall recommendations.

involves relocating less than 500' of the roadway to the west to align with current Broad Avenue
signalized intersection.

Project Priority
 Description of project priority (HSP or Local ranking)
 This project was listed as the 22nd highest ranked HotSpot corridor in the State in the HSP 2009
 listings, and it continues to experience high frequencies of crashes as documented in the current
 2008-2010 period in the Safety Study. In addition, the Stark County Area Transportation Study
 (SCATS) local MPO in 2009 indicated this corridor contains the #3, #9, #19, & #26 ranked high
 crash intersections in the MPO region. The SR172 (Tuscarawas St. West) corridor connects to
 one of the City's designated "Gateway" corridors into Downtown Canton. The City has made it a
 priority to improve the safety, operations, pedestrian/bicycle facilities, and appearance of this
 corridor as it is a key route connecting the Downtown and I-77 to areas west of the City. Given this,
 the City funded the Safety Study portion of the project with local funds to initiate the Safety Project
 process and to demonstrate their support for improving the corridor in the City of Canton.

CHSP Emphasis Area Strategy
The recommended countermeasures of the proposed safety project are focused on improving safety on the SR172
Corridor to address those specific patterns and crash types identified in the Safety Study. These recommendations
address 3 of the 5 emphasis areas identified in Ohio's Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan (CHSP), including:
· Emphasis Area II ­ Serious Crash Types
    The recommendations of the SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) Safety Study addresses the specific target area of
    "Intersection" crashes given that 63.2% of the crashes on this corridor were intersection or intersection related and
    this is well above the State percentage of 42.1% for similar facilities. Improvement strategies as outlined in Ohio's
    Safety Plan that are recommended for this corridor include:
               Improved lane use & guide signs at key intersections so as to improve signs and visibility;
               Signal upgrades to provide improved signal timing and visibility via use of LED signal heads with back
               plates; video detection, countdown pedestrian signals, & new controllers;
             Restrict left turns to private drives in tightly spaced intersections where feasible
·   Emphasis Area IV ­ Special Vehicles/Roadway Users (Pedestrians/Bicycles)
    The SR172 corridor was found to have a percentage of crashes 1.5 times higher than the State average of
    pedestrian/bicycle crashes. A total of 8 pedestrian/bicycle related crashes occurred on this section from 2008-2010.
    Given this, the target area of "Pedestrians/Bicycles" was targeted for improvements on the corridor in addition to the
    roadway improvements. Improvement strategies to increase pedestrian/bicycle safety include:
               Provide continuous sidewalks throughout corridor where feasible;
               Upgrade intersection curb ramps, sidewalks to ADA, & provide median resting areas where feasible;
               Provide countdown pedestrian signals at all signalized intersections;
            Improve crosswalk visibility and prohibit crosswalks where major left turn movements conflict with
            pedestrian median resting places;
·   Emphasis Area V ­ Incident and Congestion Related Crashes
    The corridor experienced over 43.6% of the crashes as being rear-end type crashes, which is above the State
    average of 30.9% for a similar facility. Given this, the "Rear-End crashes" target of this Emphasis area was
    addressed.
               Provide improved lane use & guide signs at key locations to assist the non-local drivers (primarily
               associated with the Hospital and I-77 area);
               Upgrade signal installations as necessary to provide latest technologies to improve visibility, traffic signal
               efficiency in servicing traffic demands, overhead street name and guide signs, countdown pedestrian
               signals, back plates, etc.;
               Access management improvements;

1.0        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.1       Introduction
Study Purpose
This safety study analyzes the 1.4 mile section of SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor from Whipple Avenue to
Smith Avenue located within the City of Canton, as shown on Figure 1.1. This roadway is locally referred to as
"Tusc-West". This section of roadway has mixed land uses and roadway characteristics found along this Urban
Principal Arterial. In the three-year crash history period (2008-2010), there was a total of 383 applicable crashes on
this section with a crash rate of 8.52 per Million Vehicle Miles Traveled (MVMT), which is nearly six times higher than
the State average of 1.44 crashes per MVMT. The purpose of this safety study is to document and analyze the
existing physical conditions, traffic operations, crash patterns and seek input from the City of Canton and the Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT), which will be used to develop conceptual improvements to enhance safety
and operations.

Background
The SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor is a commuter route that accesses I-77 and Downtown Canton. The
roadway is primarily a five-lane facility the entire length of the 1.4 mile section of SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West)
from Whipple Avenue eastward to Smith Avenue. This five-lane section involves two through travel lanes in each
direction with a center two way left turn lane which at some intersections becomes a dedicated left turn lane. There is
one small six-lane section from Whipple Avenue eastward to approximately Valley View Avenue. This six-lane
section involves a small section that contains a dedicated right turn lane for a couple of commercial/retail plazas.
Various sources of average daily traffic (ADT) values on the corridor were averaged to develop a corridor ADT, which
revealed the roadway is carrying approximately 25,330 vehicles per day between Whipple Avenue and Harrison
Avenue on this Urban Principal Arterial. The corridor has diverse adjacent land uses. The land uses along
Tuscarawas Street West that most influence traffic patterns are the Canton Center Shopping Center; Wal-Mart;
various retail and office businesses; residential areas; Aultman Hospital; and a school. These land uses and the
connectivity to various neighborhoods north and south of the corridor result in frequent pedestrian and bicycle traffic
at various locations. This pedestrian/bicycle activity is apparent given the seven (7) pedestrian and one (1) bicycle
related crashes in the study period.

                                  Tuscarawas Street West (SR 172) Safety Study
The corridor experiences frequent stop and go traffic during the peak traffic periods given the presence of eight (8)
signalized intersections on this 1.40 mile section of roadway being studied. In addition to the signals, there are
numerous unsignalized residential side streets and retail/commercial driveways that create turning conflicts from
vehicles entering and exiting these access points as they cross multiple lanes of traffic. The eastern end of the
corridor from Broad Avenue to Smith Avenue is particularly influenced from traffic generated by the Aultman Hospital
Complex as well as the school located near Bedford Avenue.

The corridor is listed as a HotSpot on the 2007-2009 Listing as it was
ranked as the 22nd highest crash corridor for the two mile section from         Crash Rankings of Corridor:

Need Elements
Safety: The section of SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) including the proposed safety project was ranked as the
22nd high crash HotSpot Corridor in the State during the 2009 ODOT Safety Program. The most recent three
year (2008-2010) crash history period as documented by the ODOT CAM-Tool indicates a total of 383 applicable
crashes have occurred on SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) from Whipple Avenue to Smith Avenue. This section
experienced a total of eight (8) pedestrian/bicycle crashes, which represented 1.5 times more than the State
average of percent of crashes involving these types of crashes. This section has a crash rate of 8.52 vehicles per
MVMT, which is nearly six times higher than the State average of 1.44 for a similar roadway facility.

Goals and Objectives
The primary goals & objectives of the project will be to reduce crashes and improve corridor operations by:
     ·     Minimizing traffic flow interruptions and unexpected stops by improving traffic operations;
     ·     Reducing the number of turning conflicts throughout corridor;
     ·     Improving intersection visibility and safety;
     ·     Enhancing pedestrian & bicycle safety; and,
     ·     Considering all modes of transportation (vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles and transit) in developing corridor
           safety improvements.

Logical Termini
The termini include Whipple Avenue as the western terminus as this is a major signalized intersection and is the City
of Canton's western corporation limits; and the eastern terminus is Smith Avenue, which is where the recently
improved I-77 Interchange Upgrade project (2008) ended, therefore the section of SR172 east of Smith is a recently
improved roadway. The section of roadway between Whipple and Smith Avenues is approximately 1.4 miles.

Summary
The SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor is a commuter route for population centers west of Canton and is also
a City designated "Gateway" into Canton. The corridor is heavily traveled (25,330 ADT) and contains a mix of land
uses including commercial/retail areas, residential, school, offices and the Aultman Hospital. The corridor is
experiencing crash rates nearly six times higher than the State Average. There were also eight (8) pedestrian/bicycle
crashes on the corridor from 2008-2010 which represents a percentage of cashes that is 1.5 times higher than the
State Average. Given this identified crash history and the importance of the corridor to the City of Canton, a Safety
Study was conducted to determine needed improvements to reduce crashes and improve pedestrian/bicycle safety.

1.3      Overview of Conceptual Improvements and Costs
The overall recommended countermeasures are detailed in Section 6.3 and are graphically presented in Table 6.1

2.0        EXISTING CONDITIONS

2.1       Conditions Diagrams
An Existing Conditions Diagram was produced for the project section of SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) being
studied and is presented in Figure 2.1, which consists of six (6) separate 11x17 figures. These figures display
existing signs, lanes, pavement markings, driveways and other roadway features found on the corridor.

2.2       Physical Condition Write-up
The entire study section of SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) has a functional classification of Urban Principal Arterial
as shown on the graphic below. This section of roadway is approximately 1.4 miles in length and, in reviewing
several agencies and conducting traffic counts on the corridor, a corridor ADT volume of 25,330 vehicles per day was
determined. See Appendix A for traffic data and Appendix B for Synchro Reports. The percent of trucks on the
corridor per the ODOT Traffic Survey Report was around 6% trucks. The roadway is primarily a five lane roadway
with four travel lanes and one center two-way left turn lane. There are some small sections of six lanes between
Whipple Avenue and Valleyview Avenue on the western end of the corridor as documented on Figure 2.1. The
roadway has a posted speed limit of 35 MPH, with one 20 MPH School Zone located between Columbus Avenue and
Bedford Avenue Northwest. Lane widths vary throughout the corridor between 10'-14' with curbed shoulders in most
locations (some areas have limited curb or degraded curbing). The existing pavement on a majority of the corridor
based on visual appearance is in good condition. There are a total of eight (8) signalized intersections which occur at
the cross streets of Whipple; Valleyview/Wal-Mart; Raff (SR297); Bellflower; Maryland; Wertz; Broad; and Bedford.
These signals lack newer technologies such as video detection and countdown pedestrian signal heads that would
assist in making the intersections more efficient for traffic operations and safer for improving pedestrian movements.

There is a notable amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic throughout the corridor given the adjacent land uses and
the neighborhoods immediately north and south of the corridor. This pedestrian presence is noted by the fact that
there were 8 pedestrian/bicycle related crashes on this corridor, which is nearly 1.5 times higher than the State
average percent of crashes for such occurrences. Sidewalks are found in most of the corridor; however there are
some sections without sidewalks that does not provide for continuous facilities through the entire corridor. Most
existing portions of sidewalks and curb ramps appeared to have been upgraded to ADA standards, however there
were a few locations that did upon a site visit that may need some upgrades to meet current ADA standards. The
pedestrian crossings at intersections lack high visibility and would benefit from countdown pedestrian signal heads to
assist in letting pedestrians know how much time they have to cross roadways.




Based on the 2008-2010 crash data and patterns and site visits to the corridor, there are currently inadequate access
management concepts in place and limited pedestrian/bicycle facilities that are contributing to crash frequencies.

Possible Safety Concerns
Particular safety concerns with the SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor are outlined below. These were
identified through the process of reviewing the crash history data, OH-1 reports, field reviews and traffic operations.
In addition, input from the City and ODOT assisted in identifying the following issues:

·    There are a total of eight (8) signalized intersections and eighteen (18) unsignalized public roadway intersections
     on this 1.4 mile section of SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West). In addition to these 26 intersections there are
     numerous private driveway access locations throughout the corridor. Crash data indicates that nearly 63% of the
     crashes occurred at either an intersection or was intersection related. Additionally, 5.8% of the crashes occurred
     at driveway access locations. All of these driveway accesses and intersections create excessive turning conflicts
     on the corridor.

·    The numerous turning conflicts throughout this entire section of roadway (caused from private drives and public
     roadways) results in several common types of crashes associated with such conflicts. The four most common
     crash types on the corridor includes rear-end, angle, side-swipe and left turn crashes, which account for over
     84% of the corridor crashes.

·    Several intersections along the corridor have offset alignments and this creates interlocking turning conflicts
     while motorists negotiate their turning movements.

·    Improved visibility of signalized intersections as well as upgrading to the latest technologies is needed to
     optimize traffic signal operations for improved traffic flow. The signals do not currently have video detection,
     black polycarbonate signal heads per lane with reflective backplates and pedestrian countdown signal heads, all
     of which would improve intersection visibility and pedestrian safety;

·    The SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor experiences frequent pedestrian and bicycle traffic given the
     surrounding neighborhoods north and south of the corridor; a school located near Bedford Avenue; Aultman
     Hospital; and numerous retail and commercial centers. Current pedestrian/bicycle facilities do not provide
     enhanced visibility of these modes of transportation to motorists. Currently there are missing sections of
     sidewalks and there are no countdown pedestrian signal heads at signalized intersections. Intersections could
     benefit from improving curb ramps to ADA standards where deficiencies exist; installing countdown pedestrian
     signals; and improving crosswalk markings, signing and pedestrian facilities throughout the corridor. Particular
     emphasis should be focused on enhancing pedestrian/bicycle improvements on the 3,800' section from
     Bellflower to Smith Avenues since 7 of the 8 pedestrian/bicycle crashes occurred on this particular section. The
     percentage of pedestrian/bicycle crashes during the three-year period of 2008­2010 was 1.5 times higher than
     the State Average.

3.0        COLLISION DIAGRAMS (2008-2010)

The SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) 1.4 mile section of roadway from Whipple Avenue eastward to Smith Avenue,
upon a review of the CAM-Tool crash data spreadsheet and a review of OH-1 crash reports, there were a total of 383
applicable crashes, as shown on the Collision Diagrams of Figure 3.1. This figure contains eight (8) separate figures
given the large number of crashes on this corridor. The collision diagrams provide a visual representation of the types
of crashes and locations of where crashes are occurring. The crashes shown on the collision diagrams had to be
stacked given the amount of crashes on the corridor, so the first recorded crash starts near the travel lane it occurred
on SR172 in the approximate location and then as the number of crashes near that same location are recorded, they
are stacked on top of each other beyond the roadway limits. A review of the collision diagrams, OH-1 reports and
data analyzed via use of the CAM-Tool indicate the following patterns:

Summary of Crash Locations:
· Overall, the entire 1.4-mile section of SR172 from Whipple Avenue to Smith Avenue contained 383 crashes in
   the 2008-2010 timeframe and had the following general characteristics:
        o 63.2% of the crashes occurred at intersection or intersection related (within 0.1 mile of intersection)
             locations, which is well above the State average of 42.1% for such crashes;
        o Most frequent crash types involved Rear-End (43.6%); Angle (24.0%); Sideswipe-Passing (11.0%); and
             Left Turn (8.4%), which are above Statewide Averages of 30.9%, 15.6%, 8.7% and 5.2% respectively;
        o A total of 6.8% of the crashes were documented as occurring at driveway access locations, which is
             slightly above the Statewide Average of 5.5%.
· The Collision-Diagrams graphically show that the section between Whipple Avenue and Smith Avenue contains
   widespread crash patterns throughout the entire corridor, particularly at intersections and driveway accesses.
   Some of the more notable locations with a higher clustering of crashes include:
        o Raff Road (SR297) intersection shows crashes on both eastbound and westbound approaches on
             SR172, as well as on the northbound approach on Raff Road south of SR172;
        o Maryland Avenue intersection primarily on eastbound and westbound approaches on SR172; and,
        o Broad Avenue & Dartmouth Avenue offset intersections on all approaches
· The section of SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) from Poplar Avenue eastward to Smith Avenue contained a
   total of 8 pedestrian/bicycle related crashes, which accounts for 2.1% of the total crashes on the corridor. This
   percentage 1.5 times higher than the Statewide Average of 1.4%;
· The graphic below shows the location of the 8 pedestrian/bicycle crashes. There is clearly a cluster between
   Bellflower and Smith Avenues where 7 of the 8 crashes occurred on this 3,800' section of SR172.

4.0        CRASH DATA (2008-2010)

Crash data was obtained from three different sources. The City of Canton's Police Department provided hard copies
of the OH-1 Crash Reports; ODOT provided a CAM-Tool crash analysis spreadsheet; and TSASS (Traffic Safety
Analysis, Systems & Services, Inc.) provided a "scrubbed" database of crashes on the SR172 corridor. After all
non-applicable crashes (Falling From Vehicle, Workzone Related, Animal, etc.) were removed from the database,
there were a total of 383 applicable crashes on the 1.4 mile section of SR172 from Whipple Avenue eastward to
Smith Avenue with a crash rate of 8.52 crashes per MVMT. The most recent (2007-2009) HotSpot listings available
(at the time of this report) from ODOT crash listings indicate the 2-mile section of SR172 (Tuscarawas
Street West) from Whipple Avenue to Schroyer Avenue is ranked #22 in the State.

In addition to the HotSpot listing from ODOT, the Stark County Crash Report (2009) by SCATS was reviewed for high
crash locations listed on the corridor. The graphic below shows that the SR172 section from Whipple Avenue to just
east of Smith Avenue contains the #3, #9, #19 and #26 highest ranked intersections within the SCATS coverage
area. The ODOT Hotspot Listing, SCATS high crash intersection listings and current 2008-2010 crash data indicates
a crash problem remain on the corridor despite previous improvements made to the corridor as mentioned
previously.

5.0        CRASH ANALYSES

5.1      Current Crash Analyses (2008-2010)
Upon removing all non-applicable crashes from the crash data on SR172 for the years 2008-2010, there were a total
of 383 crashes on the 1.4 mile section between Whipple Ave. and Smith Ave. that yielded a section crash rate of 8.52
crashes per MVMT. This rate is nearly six times higher than the Statewide Average for a similar roadway. The
following is a highlight of the crash statistics:

Snapshot of the 383 crashes indicated the following:
   · Injury crashes accounted for nearly 26.1% of the total crashes (State Average is 25.4%)
   · The most common crash types were:
                 o 43.6% were Rear-End (State Average is 30.9%)
                 o 24.0% were Angle (State Average is 15.6%)
                 o 11.0% were Sideswipe Passing (State Average is 8.7%)
                 o 8.4% were Left Turns (State Average is 5.2%)
   · There were 8 (2.1%) crashes involving pedestrians/bicycles (State Average is 1.4%)
   · In regards to weather conditions, 79.1% occurred during no adverse weather conditions
   · 72.8% were in daylight hours and 20.9% in dark-lighted conditions
   · 63.2% occurred at intersection or intersection related locations (State Average is 42.1%)
   · In the primary action of drivers, Going Straight accounted for 57.2% of crashes
   · Access management related crashes such as the categories of Turning Left, Turning Right and Changing
       Lanes involved 26.0% of the crashes on the corridor
   · In the secondary action of drivers, 44.6% of all crashes involved a vehicle Stopped in Traffic

                                  Tuscarawas Street West (SR 172) Safety Study


                                                       The crash data shows that intersection, intersection related
                                                       (within 0.1 mile of intersection) and driveway access crashes
                                                       accounted for 70% of the total crashes. These types of locations
                                                       of crashes indicate a need for improved access management,
                                                       intersection improvements and enhanced traffic control such as
                                                       improving traffic signals.

                                                       The top four most common types of crashes shown on the table
                                                       to the left are strong indicators of access management issues on
                                                       a corridor. The Rear End crashes are results of too many
                                                       unexpected stops in traffic caused by traffic queuing at frequent
                                                       signal locations, turning vehicles to the 26 public roadway
                                                       intersections and from entering/exiting movements to the
                                                       numerous private access driveways on the corridor. The
                                                       pedestrian and bicycle crash types account for 2.1% of the
                                                       crashes on the corridor and indicates a need for improved
                                                       pedestrian/bicycle facilities and enhancing their visibility to
                                                       motorists. All these categories are above State Averages.




                                                       The contributing factors to crashes listed for the corridor indicates
                                                       that Following Too Close is the primary factor. This factor is likely
                                                       related to the frequent unexpected stops of vehicles due to
                                                       turning vehicles and also from queuing at traffic signals. The
                                                       remainder of the contributing factors is also good indications of
                                                       access management issues and also a need to potentially
                                                       enhance intersection signal and signing visibility.

                                                       show that going straight is the most common action prior to the
                                                       crash which indicates the through movement of traffic as being
                                                       most prevalent and that most likely stopped traffic impeded this
                                                       movement prior to the crash. The Turning Left, Changing Lanes
                                                       and Turning Right actions are related drivers positioning
                                                       themselves to enter/exit the mainline roadway to gain access to
                                                       side streets or the private access driveways along the corridor.




                                                       The actions of Vehicle #2 (typically the driver not at fault) clearly
                                                       show that the most common cause of vehicles striking each other
                                                       on the corridor is from being stopped in traffic. This is either
                                                       related to being in a traffic queue at a signalized intersection or
                                                       from waiting on a vehicle to make a turning movement that is
                                                       stopped and waiting on traffic.

                                                       These two tables indicate that clearly the vast majority of crashes
                                                       on the SR172 Corridor are not being caused by adverse weather
                                                       or roadway conditions. The Road-Dry condition is even higher
                                                       than the State Average of 69.3%. The Road-Wet condition is
                                                       lower than the State Average of 21.1%. The only category that is
                                                       worse than the State Average of 5.5% is Road-Snow.




                                                       The crashes on the corridor are also not being impacted by
                                                       non-light conditions since 93.7% of all crashes occurred either
                                                       during the day or at night with lighted conditions.




                                                       These two tables convey that neither Alcohol nor Drug
                                                       impairment are a substantial factor causing crashes on the
                                                       corridor. Only 7 of the 383 crashes involved an impaired alcohol
                                                       driver and 1 involved drug impairment.

SR 172 (Tuscarawas Street) Safety Study
                                  Tuscarawas Street West (SR 172) Safety Study
5.2       Key Safety Concerns and Supporting Crash Data
A review of the crash data, site visits, physical inventory, existing roadway operations and local input resulted in the
identification of several key concerns within the study limits. These concerns are listed below along with the
supporting crash data:

     Key Concern #1 ­ Intersection Safety & Operations:
     The 8 signalized intersections on the corridor lack newer technology and safety enhancements that could
     improve the visibility of the intersections for vehicles and pedestrians/bicycles, as well as improve the efficiency
     of the intersection operations to reduce traffic congestion and unexpected stopped traffic.

           Supporting Crash Data:
           The evidence that intersections are a key concern for safety on the corridor is supported by the fact that
           63.2% of the crashes were at intersections or intersection related. Intersection improvements such as video
           detection, black polycarbonate heads with backplates, countdown pedestrian signals and crosswalk
           improvements would all improve intersection visibility and operations.

     Key Concern #2 ­ Access Management:
     The entire corridor contains numerous public intersections and private access driveways that create high turning
     conflict point areas. This creates unexpected stops and slow moving traffic in the through lanes, which is leading
     to numerous Rear-End, Sideswipe-Passing, Angle and Left Turn types of crashes associated with the
     intersections and driveways.

            Supporting Crash Data:
           This is confirmed with 87% of the crashes on the corridor being Rear-End, Angle, Sideswipe-Passing, or
           Left Turn related crashes. These crash types are indicative of access management problems and too many
           turning conflicts. The collision diagrams presented previously further support the need for improved access
           management and reducing turning conflicts overall on the corridor.

     Key Concern #3 ­ Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety:
     The presence of pedestrians associated with the hospital, school, neighborhoods and retail areas along SR172
     (Tuscarawas Street West) creates frequent pedestrian/bicycle traffic on the entire corridor. The presence of
     transit riders accessing bus stops along the corridor also contribute to pedestrian traffic. This is evident by the
     fact that 8 pedestrian/bicycle related crashes occurred on the corridor over three years, which resulted in above
     State Average percents. These crashes and a review of existing conditions show a need for improved safety and
     visibility of pedestrians and bicycles. The current signalized intersections do not contain countdown pedestrian
     signals, which would improve crossing safety. There are also locations where improvements are needed to curb
     ramps so as to comply with ADA standards. The portions of SR172 with larger roadway widths could benefit
     from potential raised median resting places for pedestrians that can only cross one half of the roadway at a time.

           Supporting Crash Data:
           The key supporting crash data is the fact that there were 8 crashes in the 2008-2010 timeframe in which
           either a pedestrian or bicycle were involved. The percentages of these two categories are higher than the
           State Average. The collision diagrams indicate that these crashes occurred primarily on the 3,800' section
           from Bellflower to Smith Avenues (see previous Section 3.0 for map of locations).

                                  Tuscarawas Street West (SR 172) Safety Study
     Key Concern #4 ­ Offset Intersections:
     The SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) study corridor contains 6 public roadway offset intersections on the
     corridor. All of these offsetting intersections create interlocking left and right turn conflicts during movements that
     are leading to increased frequency of crashes on this corridor.

           Supporting Crash Data:
           The collision diagrams show all of the crashes that are occurring at the numerous intersections (including
           the offsetting intersections). A field recon during the peak hour of traffic also revealed a need to improve
           traffic flow. Traffic was found to queue between intersections especially where traffic on a north-south
           roadway that required a "jog" onto SR172 due to being an offset intersection.

The four (4) Key Concerns listed above were found to be supported by the specific crash data discussed for each
one, as well as the overall crash history. The 2008-2010 data as discussed previously in Section 5.1 indicated that
crashes on the corridor are occurring during no adverse weather conditions; on dry road conditions; during the
daytime; and that only 8 of the 383 crashes involved impaired drivers. Given the lack of weather and driver
impairment as major factors, it is interpreted from the crash patterns, existing conditions/operations, field
observations and local input that the majority of crashes on the corridor are in part a result of various contributing
factors and conditions as discussed above in the key concerns.

Now that the key concerns on the corridor have been identified, the next step involves developing specific
countermeasures to address these concerns (see Section 6.0). These countermeasures will be developed for both
short term (if funding for long term improvements are not available) and long term improvements. Before the
countermeasures are developed, the section below discusses previously implemented countermeasures.

5.3      Previous Implemented Countermeasures
The City of Canton and ODOT have implemented several improvements that have impacted the SR172 Corridor. The
most notable of these improvements include the following:

     ·     In 2007 to early 2008 the I-77 interchange with SR172 was upgraded by ODOT, which included improving
           the section of mainline SR172 from just east of Smith Avenue eastward to Schroyer Avenue. This is the
           basis for ending the current Safety Project at Smith Avenue since improvements were made to the eastern
           0.6 miles of the identified 2.0 Mile HotSpot Corridor;
     ·     The City refined signal timing and phasing in 1999 as best as possible at signalized intersections along the
           corridor given existing traffic signal technologies that was in place. Newer signal controller technologies,
           improved signal head visibility and video detection would be needed to fully take advantage of obtaining the
           most efficiency possible out of the signalized intersections;
     ·     There are several locations where pedestrians are prohibited from crossing the corridor to reduce turning
           conflicts between vehicles and pedestrian/bicycle users;
     ·     ADA curb ramps and sidewalks have had spot improvements along the corridor, however some locations
           remain that do not meet current design standards for curb ramps and pedestrian pushbuttons;
     ·     The corridor has been maintained in regards to pavement markings and resurfacing in addition to the above
           safety and improvement initiatives.

Despite the previous improvements and countermeasures listed above, the 1.4 mile section of SR172 (Tuscarawas
Street West) from Whipple Avenue eastward to Smith Avenue continues to experience higher than State Average
crash rates and frequencies for similar type facilities. In the three-year period of 2008-2010 this section of roadway
experienced a total of 383 applicable crashes once non-collision crash types such as Falling From Vehicle and
Workzone Related crashes were removed.

6.0        RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1       Development of Countermeasures
Safety improvement countermeasures for the SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor were developed based on
the 2008-2010 crash history analyses as well as existing conditions; a review of existing plans; field visits to view
existing conditions; analysis of traffic operations; and local input from City of Canton and ODOT.

The four most common types of crashes involved Rear-End, Angle, Sideswipe-Passing and Left Turn, which
accounted for 87% of all crashes. In regards to location, 63.2% of the crashes occurred at an intersection or were
intersection related. Common types of driver actions and contributing factors listed for crashes included Following
Too Close, Failure To Yield, Failure To Control, Turning Left, Changing Lanes, Going Straight and Stopped in Traffic.
These types of statistics indicate a strong need for safety countermeasures on the corridor that focus on improving
access management; enhancing the operational efficiency and visibility of intersections; and improving
pedestrian/bicycle facilities and visibility. Improvements will be developed to focus on these crash statistics and the
four (4) identified key safety concerns of the SR172 Corridor (see Section 5.2 for details):
      1. Intersection Safety & Operations
      2. Access Management
      3. Pedestrian & Bicycle Safety
      4. Offset Intersections

Therefore, the proposed improvements will focus on improving intersection operations & safety; turn lanes and
storage lengths; improving intersection geometry; improving visibility of intersections/signing; improving access
management in key areas to reduce turning conflicts; and providing safer pedestrian/bicycle travel and visibility on
the corridor. Countermeasures will be developed with guidance based on the City of Canton standards and guidance
from the ODOT L&D Manual as well as the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (OMUTCD). An updated
OMUTCD is scheduled to be released in December 2011; therefore improvements will be developed with the new
manual anticipated changes in mind.

6.2      Funding of Short Term and Long Term Countermeasures
The short term countermeasures listed in Table 6.1 are lower cost improvements with no anticipated right-of-way
involvement that could be considered as interim improvements for the corridor if full funding of the Long Term Full
Recommendations as presented is not available. The short term lower cost improvements could be implemented via
use of local funds or a combination of local funds and other sources (SCATS, ODOT Safety, etc.). Otherwise, if full
funding can be secured, it is proposed that both the Long Term Full Recommendations and also the
Alternative Broad/Dartmouth Re-Alignment Recommendation be considered as one combined project. The
City of Canton intends to submit for funding sources through SCATS for potentially CMAQ, Transportation
Enhancement and TIP funding programs. All of the long term improvements are shown on Figure 6.1 (consists of 6
separate 11x17 sheets) and are listed on Table 6.1.

6.3      Summary of Short Term and Long Term Full Recommendations
The Short Term Countermeasures are discussed below and in Table 6.1. The recommended Long Term Full
Improvements are being submitted to the Safety Funding Program (September 2011) for consideration of being
funded. In addition, the City will submit for funding consideration by SCATS through the CMAQ, Transportation
Enhancement and TIP programs when they next are accepting applications. Explanations of the improvements being
recommended are discussed below:

           Short Term Countermeasures:
           The Short Term Countermeasures involves continuing routine maintenance and low cost improvements as
           local funding allows. Routine maintenance would include such items as maintaining all pavement markings
           (including crosswalk striping) and also keeping signs up to standards. Possible lower cost improvements
           that might be considered would include installing countdown pedestrian signals where feasible; consider
           signal timing/phasing & progression updates given recent improvements at eastern end of corridor near I-77
           and turn volume data recently collected for this Safety Study; update pedestrian crossing times per new
           standards if not already implemented; provide enhanced pedestrian and school crossing signing to warn
           motorists of potential pedestrians/bicyclists; and revise striping at several intersections to provide more
           exclusive left turn storage (taken from two-way left turn lane). A more complex short term/mid-term
           improvement would be to meet with individual property owners and businesses to see if any shared drives
           can be implemented and those properties with multiple drives can eliminate some of their drives.

           Long Term Full Recommended Improvements:
           These improvements are the full recommended improvements needed to address the types and locations of
           the crashes that are occurring most frequently on the SR172 Corridor from Whipple Avenue eastward to
           Smith Avenue (1.4 miles). The section of SR172 just east of Smith Avenue was fully upgraded in
           association with the I-77 interchange that was completed in early 2008, thus no improvements to that
           section are required at this time until an evaluation of post crash data can be evaluated in several years.

                       Intersection Safety & Operation Improvements
                            It is recommended to provide full upgrades to all warranted traffic signals on the corridor to
                            provide improved traffic operations through more efficient signal controllers and detection and
                            to provide enhance visibility. The full upgrades are needed based on new technologies and
                            new design standards rather than due to a maintenance issue. The existing poles and
                            controllers based on field review and discussions with the City will not support upgrading to the
                            desired standards of providing a signal head per lane; providing reflective backplates; video
                            detection; new controllers; countdown pedestrian signal heads; ADA compliant pushbutton
                            placements; and new signal timing/phasing & progression. These improvements would add
                            weight to existing poles and would likely not meet current loading requirements.
                            Enhance intersection safety by improving signing; pavement markings; increase turning radii
                            where determined necessary and feasible; and improve left turn storage if feasible.

                       Access Management
                            Provide improved access management on corridor with such techniques as a mix of raised
                            concrete medians (with mountable curbs for emergency vehicles); turn restrictions at identified
                            crash locations; drive consolidations; drive removals; improved geometrics; and U-Turn lanes
                            where feasible;
                            Provide improved lane balancing and striping improvements throughout the corridor. Based on
                            functional classification and that this route is not a designated Federal Aid Primary route,
                            consideration can be given to reduce lane widths to 11' for travel lanes and 10' for turn lanes,
                            which may provide additional width for improved sidewalks and radii improvements;
                            These improvements will be determined during the preliminary engineering and detailed
                            design phases of the project development process once the necessary detailed

                       Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety
                            Currently there are sidewalks and curb ramps through a majority of the corridor, however there
                            are some locations (particularly west of Valleyview) where sidewalks and curb ramps are
                            missing. It is recommended that the gaps in sidewalk coverage be constructed so to provide
                            continuous sidewalks through the corridor on both sides of the roadway;
                            All curb ramps not meeting current ADA standards are also recommended to be improved to
                            current design standards;
                            Improved signing and crosswalks to provide awareness to motorists of pedestrian/bicycle
                            activity should be implemented, especially on the 3,800' section from Bellflower to Smith
                            where 7 of the 8 pedestrian/bicycle crashes occurred;
                            Incorporate transit stops into corridor as these are also locations where pedestrian/bicycle
                            activity is prevalent;
                            Consider providing solar powered LED school zone flasher sign for the school located just
                            north of SR172 between the intersections of Clarendon and Arlington Avenues.

                       Offset Intersections
                            Re-align the offset intersections found on the corridor where feasible, or control the
                            movements associated with these offsets through either the use of directional restricted drives
                            or by a raised median or other geometric improvements.

           Alternative Broad Avenue & Dartmouth Avenue Re-Alignment Improvement:
           This improvement alternative is being evaluated separately as it would involve a large re-alignment involving
           additional Right-of-Way (ROW) from the Aultman Hospital and also removing the old Dartmouth Avenue
           roadway and vacating its ROW. The new re-aligned section of Dartmouth Avenue would align with the
           signalized intersection of Broad Avenue. There are some elevation changes that will need to be addressed
           as well as coordination with the Aultman Hospital. The Aultman Hospital in the past has expressed an
           interest to the City to revise the Dartmouth Avenue so to provide a safer ingress/egress for their employees
           and hospital patient traffic. It is recommended that this improvement be considered for funding in the Full
           Recommendations as well, however it is being reviewed separately in this study with a separate Rate of
           Return (ROR) economic analysis as well as a separate cost estimate in case the project needs to be
           pursued separately if the Hospital no longer desires to implement these changes or if the ROW would make
           this portion of the project have a longer time frame to implement.

Notes:
1All improvements are conceptual and their eventual design will be determined during the preliminary engineering and design

phase of project upon completion of the required public involvement and environmental process.
2Cost estimates are for planning level purposes only given that costs have been developed based on concepts and not final

design and the fact that no detailed surveying or quantities were available during the safety study phase to develop detailed
costs. More details on the preliminary cost estimates are provided in Appendix C.
3Cost estimate reflects a cost that would apply if the projects were independent of each other, however, this safety funding

application will submit these two improvements as a combined project. Therefore there will be some cost savings on
non-construction items such as Preliminary Engineering, Environmental Screening, Design, etc. This cost savings of combining
these two projects into one project is reflected in the Funding Application financial request table of the application.

6.4       Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan Emphasis Areas being Addressed
The recommended countermeasures of this safety study are focused on improving safety on the SR172 Corridor to
address those specific patterns and crash types identified in the study. These recommendations also address three
of the five emphasis areas identified in Ohio's Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan (CHSP), including the following
three emphasis areas:

·    Emphasis Area II ­ Serious Crash Types
     The recommendations of the SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) safety study addresses the specific target area
     of "Intersection" crashes given that 63.2% of the crashes on this corridor were intersection or intersection related
     and this is well above the State percentage of 42.1% for similar facilities. Improvement strategies as outlined in
     Ohio's Safety Plan that are recommended for this corridor include:
           ·     Improved lane use & guide signs at key intersections so as to improve signs and visibility;
           ·     Signal upgrades to provide improved signal timing and visibility via use of LED signal heads with back
                 plates; video detection, countdown pedestrian signals, & new controllers;
           ·     Restrict left turns to private drives in tightly spaced intersections where feasible

·    Emphasis Area IV ­ Special Vehicles/Roadway Users (Pedestrians/Bicycles)
     The SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor was found to have a percentage of crashes 1.5 times higher than
     the State average of pedestrian/bicycle crashes. A total of 8 pedestrian/bicycle related crashes occurred on this
     section from 2008-2010. Given this, the target area of "Pedestrians/Bicycles" was targeted for improvements on
     the corridor in addition to the roadway improvements. Improvement strategies to increase pedestrian/bicycle
     safety include:
           ·     Provide continuous sidewalks throughout corridor where feasible;
           ·     Upgrade intersection curb ramps, sidewalks to ADA, & possibly provide median resting areas;
           ·     Provide countdown pedestrian signals at all signalized intersections;
           ·     Improve crosswalk visibility and prohibit crosswalks where major left turn movements possibly conflict
                 with pedestrian median resting places;

·    Emphasis Area V ­ Incident and Congestion Related Crashes
     The corridor experienced over 43.6% of the crashes as being rear-end type crashes, which is above the State
     average of 30.9% for a similar facility. Given this, the "Rear-End crashes" target of this Emphasis area was
     addressed.
           ·     Provide improved lane use & guide signs at key locations to assist the non-local drivers (primarily
                 associated with the Hospital and I-77 area);
           ·     Upgrade signal installations as necessary to provide latest technologies to improve visibility, traffic
                 signal efficiency in servicing traffic demands, overhead street name and guide signs, countdown
                 pedestrian signals, back plates, etc.;
           ·     Access management improvements;
           ·     Turn lane and turn lane storage improvements

These three emphasis areas of the State's CHSP are those primarily addressed by the recommended safety
improvements for the SR172 (Tuscarawas Street West) corridor. The SR172 identified HotSpot is currently ranked as
the 22nd highest crash HotSpot in the State (2009); and the corridor has four of the Top 30 High Crash intersections
as ranked by SCATS (2009). Given this, the corridor is routinely experiencing high crash frequencies and
implementing countermeasures on this corridor will assist the State in achieving current crash reduction goals.

7.0        RATE OF RETURN

The rate of return represents the benefits expected to be obtained by an improvement and is a measure of expected
"yield" or effective return of the safety countermeasures. The rate of return economic analyses for the SR172
(Tuscarawas Street West) Safety Study was separated into two separate evaluations since the project includes a
potential major re-alignment of two offset intersections involving Broad Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue. This
re-alignment was evaluated separately since it would require input from key stakeholders such as Aultman Hospital
as it would require significant Right-of-Way (ROW) to accomplish and vacating/removal of the old alignment of
Dartmouth Avenue. This project should ideally be considered as part of the safety countermeasures being
recommended for the corridor, however it could be separated out if it appears in the more detailed preliminary
engineering/design phase of the project that such a re-alignment is not feasible or if it would require a longer
timeframe given the amounts of ROW needed to accomplish the project. The Table 7.1 below summarizes these two
recommended long term improvements. The results of the rate of return analyses are shown on two worksheets as
presented in Figure 7.1.

                                                             between the two intersections.

           The rate of return results as displayed in the table above represent the economic benefit of the proposed
           improvements and the return on investment associated with the costs of those improvements and the
           likelihood the proposed improvements would have on reducing the types of crashes occurring. Such
           reductions in crash types would thereby reduce the financial costs associated with the severity & types of
           crashes. The higher the percent of the rate of return indicates the proposed improvements more effectively
           address the types of crashes occurring.

           The results of the rate of return analyses as shown above reflect the benefits of the proposed improvements
           for the SR172 corridor and their likelihood of reducing crashes. Given these results, both the Recommended
           Long Term Improvements and the Re-Alignment Improvement will be submitted to the ODOT Safety
           Program for a funding request as one project initially to be studied for further detail during the Preliminary
           Engineering and Design Phases. During these phases, it will be determined if the projects should be
           separated based on criteria such as costs; time frames associated with ROW acquisitions; local funding
           commitments, safety program funding availability, and SCATS funding availability. Whether or not the
           projects are combined or separated, the ROR Analyses supports either scenario as they both provide
           positive benefits on the investments.

           The City of Canton intends to also apply to SCATS (local MPO) for potential funding for improving the
           corridor. Possible additional funding sources from SCATS include CMAQ funds, Transportation
           Enhancement funds and TIP funds.

7.0        RATE OF RETURN

The rate of return represents the benefits expected to be obtained by an improvement and is a measure of expected
"yield" or effective return of the safety countermeasures. The rate of return economic analyses for the SR172
(Tuscarawas Street West) Safety Study was separated into two separate evaluations since the project includes a
potential major re-alignment of two offset intersections involving Broad Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue. This
re-alignment was evaluated separately since it would require input from key stakeholders such as Aultman Hospital
as it would require significant Right-of-Way (ROW) to accomplish and vacating/removal of the old alignment of
Dartmouth Avenue. This project should ideally be considered as part of the safety countermeasures being
recommended for the corridor, however it could be separated out if it appears in the more detailed preliminary
engineering/design phase of the project that such a re-alignment is not feasible or if it would require a longer
timeframe given the amounts of ROW needed to accomplish the project. The Table 7.1 below summarizes these two
recommended long term improvements. The results of the rate of return analyses are shown on two worksheets as
presented in Figure 7.1.

                                                             related crashes given the short distance
                                                             between the two intersections.

           The rate of return results as displayed in the table above represent the economic benefit of the proposed
           improvements and the return on investment associated with the costs of those improvements and the
           likelihood the proposed improvements would have on reducing the types of crashes occurring. Such
           reductions in crash types would thereby reduce the financial costs associated with the severity & types of
           crashes. The higher the percent of the rate of return indicates the proposed improvements more effectively
           address the types of crashes occurring.

           The results of the rate of return analyses as shown above reflect the benefits of the proposed improvements
           for the SR172 corridor and their likelihood of reducing crashes. Given these results, both the Recommended
           Long Term Improvements and the Re-Alignment Improvement will be submitted to the ODOT Safety
           Program for a funding request as one project initially to be studied for further detail during the Preliminary
           Engineering and Design Phases. During these phases, it will be determined if the projects should be
           separated based on criteria such as costs; time frames associated with ROW acquisitions; local funding
           commitments, safety program funding availability, and SCATS funding availability. Whether or not the
           projects are combined or separated, the ROR Analyses supports either scenario as they both provide
           positive benefits on the investments.

           The City of Canton intends to also apply to SCATS (local MPO) for potential funding for improving the
           corridor. Possible additional funding sources from SCATS include CMAQ funds, Transportation
           Enhancement funds and TIP funds.

    1.8 ­    Project Description

             Project Overview
             Fountain Square Development West has submitted Specific Plan and Conditional Use
             Permit applications for the design, construction, and operation of an assisted living
             facility. The facility would provide long-term residential care for seniors and persons
             with disabilities, including persons with Alzheimer's disease and other memory
             impairments. The facility, to be licensed as a Residential Care Facility for the Elderly
             (RCFE) by the California Department of Social Services, would accommodate up to 96
             residents. The Specific Plan, required by the General Plan, provides a means to
             establish unique development standards and use regulations that respond to the
             special design needs of an assisted living facility at this location.

             The facility design consists of a two-story, "H" shaped building envelope totaling
             approximately 58,000 gross square feet. The facility would have 75 residential suites,
             plus administrative offices and resident common areas for dining and socializing.
             Additional components include on-site facilities for fitness, physical therapy, and
             wellness activities; a commercial kitchen; and a commercial laundry. Common use
             gardens, patios, and sitting areas would be incorporated throughout the facility
             grounds. Table 1 (Summary of Proposed Project Uses) provides a square footage
             breakdown of the various uses. Exhibits 3 through 7 illustrate the preliminary site plan,
             including conceptual floor plans, as well as building elevations.1

                                                                Estimated Building Area
                                    Type of Use
                                                                      (Square Feet)
                   Care Units (guest rooms and suites)          31,600
                   Common Living and Social Areas               19,800
                   Staff Offices/Caretaker Areas                 2,500
                   Facility Service/Operation/Maintenance Areas  4,100
                   Total                                        58,000

             Assisted living services are intended for seniors (i.e., generally persons 60 years or
             older, as well as younger residents who may experience early on-set of debilitating
             memory issues) who need assistance with the activities of daily living, including eating,
             bathing, dressing, and medication management, but who do not require 24-hour
             medical or skilled nursing care. Each suite would range in size from approximately 325
             square feet to 625 square feet and would include one or two sleeping areas. Each
             suite consists of a bedroom area, sitting area (some in a separate room), and
             bathroom (with sink, shower and toilet); no kitchen facilities are provided since meals
             are served restaurant-style in the common dining area.

             Site Plan/Access/Circulation
             The project site would be accessed via a single ingress/egress driveway off Sierra
             Madre Boulevard. The driveway would provide immediate access to a porte cochere
             drop-off/pick-up at building's main entrance, which would face west onto the parking
             lot. The driveway would then extend to the surface parking lot located at the western
             portion of the project site. The location of the proposed driveway and curb cut would
             remain in substantially the same location as those existing today, but would be
             widened and redesigned to accommodate current building code requirements and

    Final floor plans will be reviewed/approved at the time of building plan check.


2                                                                                 November 30, 2011
                                                                 Kensington Assisted Living Facility



           proposed site grades. Pedestrian access would be accommodated from the main
           building entrance, with a paved pathway from the entrance down to Sierra Madre
           Boulevard as well. A secondary pedestrian access would be provided along Hermosa
           Avenue for staff, utility service personnel, and secondary emergency response access.

           The H-shaped building footprint would occupy the easterly portion of the project site,
           with its perimeter ringed by a garden path, landscaping, and seating areas. Two open-
           air courtyards would be provided within the recessed areas along the north and south
           faces of the building. Exhibit 3 (Proposed Project Site Plan) shows the proposed site
           layout.

           Building setbacks from residential properties along the north (rear) property line would
           vary from 21 and 50 feet. The parking area would have a minimum landscape setback
           of 10 feet from residential properties located along the north property line. Specific
           setback requirements and development standards, consistent with those proposed for
           the project, are set forth in the Specific Plan.

           Loading areas and trash enclosures would be located behind the northwest corner of
           the building and accessed directly from parking/driveway area. These facilities would
           be set back five to 10 feet from the rear property line.

           The proposed structure would be two stories high, with a building height roof line that
           peaks at 30 feet in height to screen mechanical roof-top components.

           Existing easements for power and telephone service are located at the northeast corner
           of the site. The easements would be modified to accommodate power and telephone
           services to the new building.

           Parking
           The Specific Plan proposes 43 on-site parking spaces within a paved, surface parking
           lot on the west side of the property. The parking area would be configured with stalls
           accessed from a double-loaded driveway that loops back to connect with the main
           ingress/egress site entrance.

           Architectural Treatment
           The architectural design theme of the proposed building is based on elements of
           Craftsman styles commonly used for homes in Sierra Madre. The building skin would
           include a combination of siding and shingles. Outrigger beams and exposed rafter tails
           would provide the characteristic texture and details of a Craftsman façade. The
           Specific Plan identifies the proposed architectural elements.

           Landscape and Lighting
           Proposed landscaping has been designed to complement the building architecture and
           provide spaces for programmed activities for residents. Consistent with the City's
           landscaping requirements, planting materials would consist of low-maintenance, low-
           water-use species which are either Southern California native plants and/or drought-
           tolerant ornamentals. Higher water-using plant materials, such as mown turf grass
           and seasonal color, are proposed to be used sparingly. The proposed irrigation system
           would be designed to reduce water waste and comply with applicable City codes.

           Lighting would be installed to illuminate the porte cochere, driveways, courtyards,
           walkways, and parking facility for security and safety purposes. Hooded accent lighting
           at the roof eave line would be installed to highlight building features. Exterior features


Initial Study                                                                                      3
Section 1: Project Description



          would include minimal low-impact lighting in compliance with the City's ordinance to
          avoid nuisance to other area properties.

          Operational Characteristics
          The estimated number of operating staff for the facility is approximately 75 part-time
          and full-time staff. The maximum number of staff on site at any one time would be
          approximately 25. The assisted living community would offer an environment in which
          residents enjoy communal meals, social activities, housekeeping and other services.
          As a part of this proposed assisted living community, care will be available for those
          who suffer from memory loss and dementia related diseases such as Alzheimer's.

          Signage
          Two project identification signs to identify the assisted living facility are proposed,
          including one adjacent to the main entry off Sierra Madre Boulevard and one on the
          corner of Hermosa Avenue. Neither sign would exceed 40 square feet in area size.
          Final design, size and placement of project signs will be subject to approval by the
          City. Secondary signage to assist with directional and safety messaging would also be
          provided as appropriate.

          Site Preparation and Grading
          The proposed development involves demolition of the existing vacant onsite
          institutional and residential buildings (totaling approximately 33,695 square feet
          combined) and removal of existing trees. Mature oleanders along the northern edge of
          the project that currently screen residential properties may be retained to function as a
          construction screen (as feasible). However, installation of a fence or wall between the
          project site and properties to the immediate north would most likely require removal of
          some of these oleanders and replacement with appropriate landscaping per the
          approved landscape plan.

          The project would involve grading to lower the building pad by approximate three and
          one-half feet from current grade. Grading would require the export of approximately
          9,500 cubic yards of earth from the site. Retaining walls would be incorporated to
          accommodate the cuts. The existing wall along Sierra Madre Boulevard and Hermosa
          Avenue would be rebuilt to retain the resulting grade and designed to fit the new
          building style and complement the landscape program. The existing retaining walls
          along the north property line would remain in place. A new second retaining wall
          (approximately four to six feet in height plus footing) would be installed in a manner
          stepped out approximately five feet in front of the existing walls to accommodate the
          new cut along the base of the north slope along this edge due to the lowering of the
          entire site grade by approximately three and one-half feet. The integrity of the existing
          north retaining walls would be maintained by this terrace effect. The west wall would
          be modified to accommodate the resulting grade, and a noise barrier would be
          constructed along portions of the north property line.

          Development Schedule
          Construction of the proposed project is anticipated to start during spring 2012 and be
          completed by summer/early fall 2013, 2 lasting approximately 16 to 18 months.
          Demolition of the existing structures is anticipated to start in spring 2012 and may
          require up to eight weeks for completion. Other site preparatory work and grading is
          anticipated to start in early summer 2012 and would run concurrent with demolition

                                                                  Kensington Assisted Living Facility



           efforts, lasting approximately eight weeks. Construction is anticipated to require
           approximately 10 working months for completion. Site finishing work is anticipated
           during late spring/summer 2013, with a target occupancy/opening date in September
           2013.

           Construction Staging
           Construction activities would be conducted in compliance with City requirements and in
           a manner that minimizes disruption to adjacent properties. A construction
           management plan, including details for project staging, haul routes, and erosion
           control plans, will be prepared and provided to the City for approval prior to initiation
           of any site preparation or construction activity. At a minimum, the project will comply
           with development and construction site standards established in Zoning Code Section
           17.36.190. Per code, construction activity would be limited to between the hours of
           7:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. Monday through Saturday.

           The storage of construction materials and vehicle staging would be managed entirely
           within the property boundaries. The general contractor would be required to have a
           designated community liaison on site to assist with any community concerns and
           ensure that construction activity is managed in accordance with the approved
           Construction Management Plan.

                Provide a range of services and care for senior citizens.
                Implement a project design that is embraces the positive physical features of the
                property, promotes a high quality living environment for occupants within the
                proposed development, and minimizes adverse influences on the surrounding
                community.
                Establish development standards and guidelines that are suitable for an assisted
                living community, consistent with city policy, and compatible with the surrounding
                uses.

           City objectives with respect to the project include:

                Ensure that development of the site occurs in a manner that implements General
                Plan policies and complies with applicable zoning regulations.
                Ensure that development of the site occurs in a manner that complements
                surrounding uses in terms of scale, type of use, and contribution to neighborhood
                character.

 1.10 ­ Surrounding Land Uses

           The project site is located on the northwest corner of Sierra Madre Boulevard and
           Hermosa Avenue. Immediately adjacent uses include residential uses to the north
           (including single-family and multi-family residential) and a vacant commercial property
           to the west. Immediately beyond the vacant commercial property to the west is a small
           retail commercial center. The Sierra Madre Congregational Church New Life Center is
           located to the east, across Hermosa Avenue. The Sierra Madre City Hall, fire station,
           and Memorial Park are located to the south, across Sierra Madre Boulevard.

Section 1: Project Description



    1.11 ­ Environmental Setting and Existing Conditions

           The project site is located within a built-out and completely urbanized area along Sierra
           Madre Boulevard. The property has a gentle slope that descends south-southwest from
           the north. The existing project site development pad elevation is lower than the
           adjacent residential properties to the north, with an elevation difference of
           approximately 12 to 14 feet along Hermosa Avenue (east) and six to nine feet toward
           the west end of the project site.

           The site currently is occupied by a vacant building that housed a skilled nursing care
           facility and a vacant single-story residential caretaker structure (all constructed in the
           early 1950s). Trees and landscaping surround the buildings. The majority of the site is
           covered with asphalt concrete for parking. The southern edges of the parking areas are
           supported by retaining walls along Sierra Madre Boulevard. Concrete curbing contains
           planter areas with trees in the parking area.

    1.12 ­ Required Approvals

           The City of Sierra Madre Zoning Code (Section 17.60.030) recognizes the unique
           nature of "eldercare facilities" such as "rest homes" or "homes for the aged" by
           allowing establishment of these uses in any zone within the City through approval of a
           Conditional Use Permit (CUP). Hence, to authorize the proposed assisted living facility
           use at this location and to establish appropriate conditions of approval, a CUP is
           required.

           General Plan Policy L3.1 requires preparation of a Specific Plan for proposed
           development projects on properties exceeding one acre in size. Because the project
           site totals 1.84 acres, adoption of a Specific Plan is required to address proposed uses,
           location, development standards, and project implementation. The Kensington
           (Assisted Living Facility) Specific Plan will be established as an overlay zone on the
           existing underlying C and R-3 zoning designations, but will set forth unique
           development standards and guidelines that are triggered and applicable only when an
           assisted living facility, or similar eldercare resident or interim care use, is proposed for
           development on the site. The Specific Plan will be adopted by ordinance.

           The proposed project would require an amendment to the Zoning Code to allow the
           Specific Plan to have regulatory effect on the subject site and to take precedence over
           the underlying C and R-3 zones.

           The proposed project would also include a General Plan Amendment to clearly indicate
           assisted living as a permitted use in the Commercial General Plan land use category.
           Adding an additional allowed use, assisted living facilities, to the Commercial General
           Plan land use category will itself cause no environmental impacts. The use is
           sufficiently similar to other allowed uses in the Commercial land use category.
           Institutional uses, per General Plan policy, are permitted in the commercial business
           district, although they should be limited (Policy L29.1). The proposed General Plan
           Amendment is intended to clarify existing General Plan policy only to reflect
           consistency of an assisted living use in commercially designated areas where this use
           was not specifically listed before. The General Plan Amendment serves to provide
           consistency with the Zoning Code, as this use historically has been permitted with a
           conditional use permit in all zones in the City (with the exception of the Residential
           Canyon Zone). As this component of the project would have no environmental impact,




6                                                                                November 30, 2011

           the General Plan Amendment is not be analyzed in the environmental checklist and
           subsequent sections of this Initial Study.

           Review and consideration of the CUP, Specific Plan, and General Plan Amendment will
           be accompanied by review and approval of related permits to allow demolition of
           existing structures, grading of the site, export/import of fill material, establishment of
           truck haul routes and construction staging areas, infrastructure and utility connections,
           site plan and conceptual landscape plan approval, and similar approvals to authorize
           initiation of the proposed project. Building and grading permits would be obtained
           from the City as required following approval of the project entitlements.

 2.2 ­     Determination


         I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the
         environment, and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

         I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
         environment, there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the
         project have been made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED
         NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

         I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and
         an ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.

         I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or
         "potentially significant unless mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one
         effect 1) has been adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable
         legal standards, and 2) has been addressed by mitigation measures based on the
         earlier analysis as described on attached sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT
         is required, but it must analyze only the effects that remain to be addressed.

         I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
         environment, because all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed
         adequately in an earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable
         standards, and (b) have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or
         NEGATIVE DECLARATION, including revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed
         upon the proposed project, nothing further is required.

The aesthetics impact analysis is based on review of project maps and drawings, aerial and
ground-level photographs of the project area, pictorial renderings of the proposed project, and
planning documents. The site is most visible from pedestrians and motorists along Sierra Madre
Boulevard. The site would also be visible from adjacent residences to the north with addresses on
the south side of W. Montecito Avenue (between Hermosa Avenue and Lima Street) and from
uses to the south, across Sierra Madre Boulevard, including City Hall. Exhibit 6 and 7 illustrate
simulations of proposed conditions with the project constructed.

Locations throughout Sierra Madre offer views of the San Gabriel Mountains. The General Plan
contains Objective L14 regarding view protection for Residential Low Density­Hillside areas:
"Protect the views to and from hillside areas in order to maintain the image and identity of the
City as a village of the foothills." All policies pertaining to this objective are related to
development in the hillside areas. No policies pertain to view retention of the foothills from other
parts of the City. The General Plan does not have any objectives or policies regarding
preservation of views from Commercial or Residential High Density areas.

a)      Less than Significant Impact. A significant impact would occur if the proposed project
        introduces incompatible visual elements within a public field or substantially blocks a
        scenic vista. Scenic vistas generally can be considered: 1) focal views (visual access to a
        particular object, scene, or feature of interest) and 2) panoramic views (visual access to a
        large geographic area for which the field of view can be wide and extend into the
        distance). The dominant scenic vista (focal view) visible from the project site is the San

       Gabriel Mountains to the north. The mountains rise steeply north of the City of Sierra
       Madre. The panoramic view from the San Gabriel Mountains above Sierra Madre includes
       the City and the San Gabriel Valley, with much of the City obscured by tree canopy.
       Existing conditions as of July 25, 2011 are represented in the photographs below.

                                                                  Kensington Assisted Living Facility



       At the ground level, when standing across Sierra Madre Boulevard from the project site (in
       front of City Hall and along the block), existing structures and street trees partially
       obscure views of the San Gabriel Mountains. Visual simulations of the project site, as
       viewed from the south side of Sierra Madre Boulevard, looking northeast and northwest
       (see Exhibits 6 and 7), indicate that the proposed project, due to the street frontage
       location and height of the buildings, would incrementally obscure views of the nearby
       foothills, as seen from vantage points across the street from the project site. However,
       portions of the ridgeline and major San Gabriel Mountain peaks would continue to be
       visible. While the proposed structures would be one story taller than the existing
       structures onsite, proposed grading would lower the building pad by approximately 3.5
       feet from current grade. The project would not substantially affect or alter views of the
       mountains. Impact would be less than significant.


       With regard to panoramic views from the San Gabriel Mountains, such views would be
       minimally altered by the proposed project. Current views of downtown Sierra Madre from
       higher elevations are characterized as views of an urban area with an extensive tree
       canopy. The proposed project would not significantly alter this view, as the project is
       located on an infill site within the urban core. New trees and other landscaping and
       building heights consistent with the established patterns in the area will maintain existing
       panoramic views from higher elevations. Impact would be less than significant.


b)     No Impact. There are no State-designated or eligible scenic highways within the City of
       Sierra Madre or in the vicinity.3 Thus, adoption of the Specific Plan and development of
       the proposed assisted living facility would not damage the integrity of existing visual
       resources or historic buildings located along a State Scenic Highway. Therefore, no impact
       on scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic
       buildings within a State Scenic Highway, would result.

c)     Less than Significant Impact. The majority of buildings in the immediate vicinity of the
       project site are one to two stories in height. Due to the sloping topography, south-facing
       building façades generally are taller than the north-facing façades. Native and ornamental
       trees line the streets and dot parking areas. These factors contribute to a "village"
       character of the downtown. Most uses in the downtown area are commercial, with
       buildings consisting of an eclectic mix of architectural styles, including traditional Main
       Street, Spanish eclectic, streamline, postmodern, and cottage. Several Craftsman and
       California bungalow residential buildings have been converted for commercial use.

       The proposed new construction will incorporate Craftsman-style architecture, including the
       use of wood beams, gabled roofs, and a mix of horizontal and vertical wood siding. The
       proposed architectural style is consistent with some properties in the immediate
       surrounding area and would therefore not detract from the aesthetic character of the
       district. Existing structures on the project site have been vacant and in minor disrepair for
       the past five years; the proposed project would enhance this section of Sierra Madre
       Boulevard relative to existing conditions.

       As part of project construction, all street trees (eight in total) will be retained and
       protected in place. This includes five California Sycamore (Plantus Racemosa) and three
       Red Flowering Gum (Eucalyptus ficifolia) trees. These trees are protected under the City's
       Tree Preservation and Protection Ordinance (Municipal Code Chapter 12.20). All trees on

      the property (19 in total, including one dead tree) would be removed. Species of trees on
      site to be removed are Carrotwood (Cupaniopsis anacardioides), Canary Island Date Palm
      (Phoenix canariensis), Evergreen Elm (Ulmus parvifolia), and Weeping Bottlebrush
      (Callistemon viminalis). Trees on the property range in size from nine inches in diameter
      for a carrotwood tree to 38 inches in diameter for a palm. None of these trees is protected
      under Chapter 12.20 of the Municipal Code and furthermore, do not appear to be specimen
      trees of extraordinary aesthetic quality or to be very old. All trees would be replaced on a
      one-to-one basis with minimum 24 inch box plantings for the required replacement trees.
      Tree plantings are proposed to include California Sycamore (Platanus racemosa), Coast
      Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia), Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), and Tipu tree (Tipuana
      tipu), all in 36-inch boxes. Additional evergreen vertical screening trees are proposed
      within side and rear yards adjacent to residential zones.

      To assess shade and/or shadow impacts on adjacent parcels, a shade and shadow study
      was prepared (see Appendix A). The analysis utilized a three-dimensional massing model
      for morning and evening hours on four days of the year to cover each season and assess
      project shade: spring (March 21), summer (June 5), fall (September 21), and winter
      (December 11). These dates represent the most extreme northern and southern angles of
      the sun (solar solstice) in June and December and mid-points when the tilt of the Earth's
      axis is inclined neither away from nor toward the sun (solar equinox) in March and
      September.

      The shade analysis indicates the proposed building would produce minimal shadows
      beyond the property boundaries. In the morning hours for the majority of the year, the
      proposed project's resulting shadow would occur across the associated parking lot; shade
      would not extend onto any adjacent residences. During the winter months, the morning
      shadow could extend to shade a small portion of the southern reaches of the existing
      multi-family residence to the north. However, the area of the residential property affected
      by the shadow is currently covered by a residential structure; therefore, no open portion of
      the property would be impacted.

      During evening hours, where resulting shade is to the east, project shadows generally
      would not affect properties to the north, with the exception of the winter months, where
      the rear (southern) portion of properties may be shaded. The proposed building might
      also shade the church property to the east. However, this would occur late in the evening
      (past 6:00 P.M.), as dusk begins to fall, reducing the ability to perceive the shadow.
      Properties south of the project site, including open space areas and City Hall, would not be
      affected by shade or shadow from the proposed project. Given that project-related
      shadows would be relatively imperceptible beyond the project boundaries and only result
      in minimal winter shading on properties to the north and the adjacent church property at
      dusk, potential impacts would less than significant.

d)    Less than Significant Impact. The proposed structure would be constructed primarily of
      wood and stone. Specifically, the structure would have features finished with batten board
      siding, shiplap siding, cedar shingle siding, and lattice wood panels. Wood columns and
      beams would be finished with stone bases. The roof is proposed to be of composite asphalt
      shingle. These materials would not create a substantial source of glare. In addition, the
      buildings would be screened from Sierra Madre Boulevard in part by existing street trees
      and proposed landscaping features.

      The Specific Plan requires that lighting shall be used to illuminate the porte cochere,
      driveways, courtyards, walkways, and parking lot for security and safety purposes. Hooded
      accent lighting at the roof eave line will be installed to highlight building features. Exterior

       features will include minimal low-impact lighting in compliance with the City ordinances to
       avoid damage or nuisance to other area properties. Furthermore, all lighting of the
       building, landscaping, parking lot or similar facilities must be shielded and directed away
       from adjoining properties.

       Per the Specific Plan, all parking areas used after dark will have adequate lighting to
       facilitate safe access and enhance site security. The Specific Plan requires that "no lighting
       standards shall exceed the height of twelve feet to the bottom of the reflector. Lighting
       shall be hooded and so arranged and controlled so as not to cause a nuisance either to
       roadway traffic or to the living environment." These requirements are consistent with City
       of Sierra Madre Municipal Code Section 17.68.110. Because the project would comply with
       these lighting requirements and no glare-inducing materials are proposed, impacts with
       regard to light and glare would be less than significant.

The project would be located in a fully developed, commercial area that does not contain

c-d)   No Impact. The project site does not contain any forest products, and the site is not
       zoned for timber harvest. The Land Cover Mapping and Monitoring Program (LCMMP) is a
       satellite photo survey conducted jointly by the California Department of Forestry and Fire
       Protection (CALFIRE) and the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service
       Region 5. The LCMMP identifies the project site and all immediate surroundings as non-

e)     No Impact. As noted in the above responses, the project would not encroach on
       agricultural land, and the site does not have any farmland or timberland. The majority of
       the site is currently paved or covered by buildings. While some trees would be removed to
       allow for project construction, these trees do not constitute a forest resource.
       Furthermore, all existing trees to be removed (19 in total, including one dead tree) would

     c) Result in a cumulatively
        considerable net increase of any

        under an applicable federal or
        state ambient air quality standard

 a)      Less than Significant Impact. A significant impact could occur if the proposed project
         conflicts with or obstructs implementation of the South Coast Air Basin 2007 Air Quality
         Management Plan (AQMP). Conflicts and obstructions that hinder implementation of the
         AQMP can delay efforts to meet attainment deadlines for criteria pollutants and
         maintaining existing compliance with applicable air quality standards. Pursuant to the
         methodology provided in Chapter 12 of the South Coast Air Quality Management District's
         1993 CEQA Air Quality Handbook, consistency with the South Coast Air Basin 2007 AQMP
         is affirmed when a project: 1) does not increase the frequency or severity of an air quality
         standards violation or cause a new violation, and 2) is consistent with the growth
         assumptions in the AQMP.

         The analysis below concludes that the proposed project would result in short-term
         construction and long-term pollutant emissions that are less than the CEQA significance
         emissions thresholds established by the South Coast Air Quality Management District
         (SCAQMD). Therefore, the project would not result in an increase in the frequency or



28                                                                                 November 30, 2011
                                                                    Kensington Assisted Living Facility



         severity of any air quality standards violation and would not cause a new air quality
         standard violation.


         The CEQA Air Quality Handbook indicates that consistency with AQMP growth assumptions
         must be analyzed for new or amended General Plan elements, Specific Plans, and
         "significant projects." Significant projects include airports, electrical generating facilities,
         petroleum and gas refineries, designation of oil drilling districts, water ports, solid waste
         disposal sites, and off-shore drilling facilities. Because the project is a Specific Plan, it is
         analyzed for AQMP consistency.

         The 2007 AQMP long-term emissions inventory was modeled from the growth projections
         utilized in the 2004 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) prepared by the Southern
         California Association of Governments (SCAG). RTP growth projections are developed
         utilizing a comprehensive analysis of fertility, mortality, migration, labor force, housing
         units, and local policies such as land use plans. Regional growth forecasts for the RTP
         were updated in 2008 and have been updated again to be reflected in the 2012 RTP (not
         yet adopted). Growth projections in the 2008 RTP project a 2015 population in Sierra
         Madre of 11,084 persons. The projection for 2020 is 11,089 persons, and 11,099 persons
         in 2030 (an increase of 39, 44, and 54 persons, respectively, from an estimated baseline
         11,045 persons in 2005).7

         The total growth in terms of population, as reported in the RTP, does not reflect actual
         conditions (as reported by the U.S. Census). The 2010 U.S. Census reported that Sierra
         Madre's total population was 10,917 persons. 8 The total population in Sierra Madre,
         including the population increase associated with the proposed project, would not exceed
         total population estimates identified in the RTP. The RTP projection for year 2015 is 11,084
         persons. The City's 2010 baseline population is 10,917 persons. To be conservative and
         account for any potential growth that may have occurred in the last year, the 2011
         population estimate (DOF) of 10,948 persons may be used, which yields a difference of
         136 persons (2011) or 167 persons (2010) between current and 2015 conditions. Thus,
         the proposed project population of 96 residents falls within the total population projections
         contained in the RTP and the AQMP, when compared against either the 2010 Census
         population count or 2011 DOF estimates.

         Growth projections for the 2008 RTP assume citywide employment in 2020 would total
         3,620 jobs. The 2008 RTP estimated that in 2005 and 2010, there were 3,311 jobs and
         3,445 jobs, respectively, in the City. This project's estimated 75 jobs represent
         approximately 43 percent of the difference between the estimated 2010 and 2020
         employment levels. No other 2010 or 2011 employment estimates were available at the
         time of this writing. While the proposed project's employment would theoretically
         represent a large portion of the estimated employment growth, not all of the 75 jobs
         would be full-time positions; some would be part time. Furthermore, the number of jobs
         associated with this project fall within the growth forecasts developed for the RTP.
         Therefore, the project is consistent with the RTP and AQMP.

         While the actual change in population projected by SCAG is less than the number of
         residents anticipated to live in the proposed assisted living facility, because of decreasing
         household size in the City (and/or overestimates in 2005 by SCAG), the proposed project
         would not exceed the total population assumed in the RTP. Furthermore, the proposed

      project is not a traditional residential use. Rather, it fits into an institutional use category,
      or a quasi-public use. The residents of the proposed projectgenerally seniors needing
      care for memory loss and assistance with everyday activitiesare far less likely to drive
      than a typical resident, as the factors that qualify them for occupancy in the assisted living
      facility would often limit their driving capabilities. Also, given the small size of living units
      and communal nature of the dining facilities, the per capita average use of water and
      electricity would be less than that associated with a typical residential household in Sierra
      Madre.

      Based on the consistency analysis presented above, the proposed project would not
      conflict with the AQMP; impact would be less than significant.

 b)   Less than Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporation. A project may have a
      significant impact if project-related emissions would exceed Federal, State, or regional
      standards or thresholds, or if project-related emissions would substantially contribute to
      an existing or project air quality violations.

       The proposed project is located within the South Coast Air Basin, where efforts to attain
       state and federal air quality standards are governed by the SCAQMD. Both the State of
       California and the Federal government have established health-based ambient air quality
       standards (AAQS) for seven air pollutants (known as "criteria pollutants").        These
       pollutants include ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur
       dioxide (SO2), inhalable particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10),
       fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5), and lead (Pb).
       California has also established AAQS for additional pollutants. The AAQS are designed to
       protect the health and welfare of the populace within a reasonable margin of safety.
       Where the State and Federal standards differ, California AAQS are more stringent than
       the national AAQS.

      Air pollution levels are measured at monitoring stations located throughout the air basin.
      Areas that are in nonattainment with respect to Federal or State AAQS are required to
      have plans and implement measures that will bring the region into attainment. Table 3.3-
      1 (South Coast Air Basin Attainment Status) summarizes the attainment status in the
      Basin for the criteria pollutants. Discussion of potential impacts related to short-term
      construction impacts and long-term area source and operational impacts are presented
      below.

           Construction Emissions
           The California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod) version 2011.1.1 was utilized to
           estimate emissions from the proposed demolition and construction activities (see
           Appendix B, Air Quality Modeling Data). The entire construction program is anticipated
           to be completed in a total of approximately 16 to 18 months, with an estimated 250
           working days,9 beginning in spring/summer 2012, as summarized in Table 3.3-2:

    Note: Dates have been provided by the applicant and are tentative and subject to change;
    durations are considered firm estimates.

       Key estimates utilized in CalEEMod to calculate construction emissions include:
                   9,500 cubic yards (CY) of soil export
                   190.4 tons of asphalt/concrete demolition and 33,695 square feet of building
                   demolition and disposal
                   The project would not include wood-burning stoves. All fireplaces will be gas.

       The maximum (summer or winter) results of the analysis are summarized in Table 3.3-3
       (Unmitigated Maximum Daily Construction Emissions). The model indicates that no criteria
       pollutants would exceed the daily emissions thresholds established by SCAQMD; therefore,
       construction impacts would be less than significant.

       The analysis summarized in Table 3.3-3 assumes that the 9,500 CY of soil will be required
       to be exported from the site and will be hauled no more than 15 miles. 10 , 11 The Los
       Angeles County Solid Waste Management Department was consulted to identify public
       facilities within 15 miles that could accept soil as part of the County's construction and
       demolition debris recycling program. The Azusa Land Reclamation Landfill, located at 1211
       West Gladstone Street in Azusa, lies approximately 10.1 miles from the project site. Other
       facilities located less than 15 miles from the project site include Irwindale and Montebello,
       also able to accept the soil. To ensure that emissions thresholds are not exceeded

9
  Total construction schedule (16 to 18 months) accounts for potential delays due to rain and
other unforeseen delays, although approximately 12 months of working time is estimated. As a
result, Table 3.3-2 indicates a construction completion date prior to the anticipated completion
date of September 2013.
10
   The 15-mile distance limitation applies only to hauling/disposal of export soil; a similar
limitation does not apply to disposal sites for other construction debris (that may be hauled to
specialized demolition recyclers) or disposal of hazardous material items (e.g. asbestos containing
materials or lead based paint).
11
   The air quality analysis assumes a total of 1,188 hauling trips associated with removal of the
soil associated with grading by a HHDT Vehicle Class hauling vehicle, with a maximum trip length
of 15 miles.

       (particularly the NOX threshold) due to soil export activities, Mitigation Measure A-1 will be
       incorporated into project conditions of approval to limit soil hauling to 15 miles or less.
       Incorporation of Mitigation Measure A-1 will ensure that impacts related to soil export are
       less than significant.

        Mitigation Measure A-1
        Prior to issuance of grading permits, the City Director of Public Works shall verify that
        grading plans submitted by the project proponent identify the location where exported
        soil is to be disposed of and that the identified location is 15 miles or less from the
        project site. The applicant may propose a disposal site that is more than 15 miles
        from the project site only if the applicant also proposes and documents a reduced
        number of total hauling trips equivalent to the 15-mile trip limitation (which assumes a
        total of 1,188 hauling trips). Any substitutions would be subject to approval of the
        Director of Public Works.

        This measure shall be verified in light of the performance standard that criteria
        pollutant emissions from soil hauling shall not exceed the daily emissions thresholds
        established by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The applicant shall
        bear the cost of implementing this mitigation.



       Operational Emissions
       Long-term criteria air pollutant emissions will result from the operation of the proposed
       assisted living facility. Long-term emissions are categorized as area source emissions,
       energy demand emissions, and operational emissions. Operational emissions will result
       from automobile and other vehicle sources associated with daily trips to and from the
       proposed facility. The CalEEMod model was utilized to estimate mobile source emissions.
       Trip generation (264 daily weekday trips) is based on the project traffic study prepared by
       Linscott, Law & Greenspan, Engineers (see Appendix C). Area source emissions are the

         combination of many small emission sources that include use of outdoor landscape
         maintenance equipment, use of consumer products such as cleaning products, and
         periodic repainting of the proposed building. Energy demand emissions result from use of
         electricity and natural gas. Emissions from area sources were estimated using CalEEMod
         using program default values for area and energy demand emissions.           Operational
         emissions are summarized in Table 3.3-4 (Long-Term Daily Emissions).


         Long-term emissions will not exceed the daily thresholds established by SCAQMD; impact
         would be less than significant.

 c)      Less than Significant Impact. Cumulative short-term, construction-related emissions
         and long-term, operational emissions from the project would not contribute considerably
         to any potential cumulative air quality impact because short-term project construction
         emissions and operational emissions would not exceed any SCAQMD daily threshold, and
         therefore, would be less than significant. Furthermore, other concurrent construction
         projects and operations in the region would be required to implement standard air quality
         regulations and mitigation pursuant to State CEQA requirements, just as this project would
         be. Such measures include compliance with SCAQMD Rule 403, which requires daily
         watering to limit dust and particulate matter emissions. Impacts would be less than
         significant.

 d)      Less than Significant Impact. Sensitive receptors are those segments of the population
         that are most susceptible to poor air quality, such as children, the elderly, the sick, and
         athletes who perform outdoors. Land uses associated with sensitive receptors include
         residences, schools, playgrounds, childcare centers, athletic facilities, long-term health
         care facilities, rehabilitation centers, convalescent centers, and retirement homes.

         The project is considered a sensitive use because the proposed assisted living facility is
         intended to house elderly and potentially infirm persons. Residential land uses near the
         project site and Sierra Madre Elementary School (located ¼-mile from the project site)
         are also considered to be sensitive receptors. The proposed project is located in an
         existing commercial area, adjacent to a residential neighborhood, and is not within one-
         quarter mile of any industrial uses that emit toxic air contaminants; therefore, the project
         would not be sited in an area that could expose residents to substantial point-source
         emissions. Toxic Air Contaminants (TAC), carbon monoxide hot-spots, and localized
         significance thresholds (LSTs) are discussed below.

      Toxic Air Contaminants
      The proposed assisted living facility would not generate toxic or criteria pollutant
      emissions since the quasi-residential/institutional use does not produce such emissions.
      As noted in the response to item 3.2b above, construction-phase emissions and long-term
      emissions would be below the daily thresholds for all criteria pollutants. The proposed
      assisted living facility, therefore, would not result in any point-source toxic emissions
      impacts. Section 3.8 (Hazards and Hazardous Materials) addresses the potential for
      airborne contaminants from asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint, and other
      toxic hazards that may be encountered during demolition.

      Carbon Monoxide (CO)
      A CO hotspot is an area of localized CO pollution caused by severe vehicle congestion on
      major roadways, typically near intersections. CO hotspots have the potential for violation
      of State and Federal CO standards at study area intersections, even if the broader Basin is
      in attainment for Federal and State levels. In general, SCAQMD and the California
      Department of Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol (CO Protocol)
      recommend analyzing CO hotspots when a project has the potential to result in higher CO
      concentrations within the region and increase traffic congestion at an intersection
      operating at level of service (LOS) D or worse by more than two percent. (See level of
      service discussion in Section 3.16 below.)

      The traffic study prepared by Linscott, Law & Greenspan, Engineers (Appendix C)
      determined that the two study intersections (Sierra Madre/Michillinda and Sierra
      Madre/Baldwin) currently operate and would continue to operate at LOS C in the future
      with the addition of project-related traffic. Furthermore, project-related trip generation is
      anticipated to result in a 0.3 percent increase to the volume/capacity ratio, which is
      significantly below the two percent threshold increase. See the Transportation and Traffic
      section analysis (Section 3.16) of this Initial Study for further details. Impact related to CO
      hotspots would be less than significant.

 e)   Less Than Significant Impact. According to the CEQA Air Quality Handbook, land uses
      associated with odor complaints include agricultural operations, wastewater treatment
      plants, landfills, and certain industrial operations (such as manufacturing uses that
      produce chemicals, paper, etc.). Odors are typically associated with industrial projects
      involving the use of chemicals, solvents, petroleum products, and other strong-smelling
      elements used in manufacturing processes, as well as sewage treatment facilities and
      landfills. No such uses that produce substantial odors are located near the project site;
      furthermore, the proposed assisted living facility would not release odors produced by
      small-level applications of chemical substances outside of the building. As the proposed
      project involves no elements related to industrial projects, agricultural operations,
      wastewater treatment, or landfills, no objectionable odors are anticipated.

      A common general potential source of odor comes from outdoor solid waste disposal bins.
      In accordance with current practices and City ordinances, all waste will be disposed of in
      covered receptacles and routinely removed, thereby limiting the escape of odors to the
      open air. Furthermore, the solid waste receptacles associated with the proposed project
      would be located within an enclosed structure. The bins may be emptied up to three times
      per week. Impacts related to odors would be less than significant.

        approved local, regional, or state
        habitat conservation plan?



a)       Less Than Significant Impact. The proposed project is located on an infill site in
         downtown Sierra Madre, a fully urbanized area. The project site is largely paved and
         covered with structures. No natural or disturbed native habitat exists on site. Existing
         landscaping is minimal and includes 18 trees (one of which is dead) of varying heights , all
         of which would be removed prior to construction. Trees would be replaced on a one-to-one
         basis with at least 24-inch box plantings for the required replacement trees. Some new
         trees to be planted include native species that would become protected by the City's Tree
         Protection Ordinance: California Sycamore (Plantanus racemosa) and Coast Live Oak
         (Quercus agrifolia). Impact would be less than significant.

b)       No Impact. The project site is located on land that has been previously developed in a
         primarily commercial portion of the City. No riparian habitat or other sensitive natural
         communities exist on the project site. 12 The site is covered by paving and buildings.
         Landscape planting consists mostly of ornamental plants and trees. No impact to riparian
         habitat or other sensitive natural habitat would occur.

c)       No Impact. No protected wetlands exist on the project site,13 as the entire site consists of
         paved areas, structures, and limited trees and landscaping. Therefore, the project would
         not result in the removal, fill, or hydrologic interruption of federally protected wetlands. No
         impact to wetlands would occur.

d)       Less Than Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporation. Wildlife corridors are
         features that provide connections between two or more areas of habitat that would
         otherwise be isolated and unusable. Often drainages, creeks, or riparian areas are used by
         wildlife as movement corridors, as these features can provide cover and access across
         various terrain.

         The project site is currently occupied by paving for parking areas, a single-family house,
         and a vacant skilled nursing facility, and thus does not contain any wildlife corridors.
         Construction would occur on approximately the same footprint as the skilled nursing
         facility. Therefore, the proposed project could not impede wildlife movement through the
         site.

         All migratory non-game native bird species are protected by international treaty under the
         Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918 (50 C.F.R. Section 10.13). Pursuant to
         the MBTA, it is unlawful to "take" (i.e., capture, kill, pursue, or possess) migratory birds or
         their nests. Virtually all native bird species are covered by the MBTA.

       The potential for nesting raptors to occur on the project site exists due to the existing
       mature onsite trees. Removal and disturbance of onsite trees has the potential to impact
       sensitive raptor species should they be nesting at time of construction (generally from
       February through August). As such, mitigation has been included requiring that a raptor
       nesting assessment be conducted if construction is to occur between February 1st to
       August 31st. Such assessment will ascertain the potential for nesting raptors and identify
       appropriate mitigation based on the judgment of a qualified biologist. Appropriate
       mitigation could include delay of construction activities or avoidance of the nest until the
       young have left. Incorporation of Mitigation Measure B-1 will ensure that impacts to
       raptors and their nesting sites would be less than significant.


         Mitigation Measure B-1
         Prior to commencement of demolition activities, construction activities, or tree
         removal, should these activities occur at any time between February 1st to August
         31st, a qualified biologist shall assess the project site at least 10 days, but no more
         than 30 days, in advance of initiation of demolition activities, construction activities,
         or tree removal, to determine if raptor species are actively nesting in on-site
         vegetation. If no active nests are found, no further action is required. If active raptor
         nesting is confirmed, the qualified biologist shall develop a mitigation plan and submit
         for review and approval by the Development Services Director. The plan shall identify
         measures and protocols to avoid or minimize impacts to nesting raptors and their
         young that may include, but are not limit to, avoidance and buffering of the nests
         until young have fledged, delay of demolition activities and/or construction activities
         and/or tree removal, and monitoring to ensure nest abandonment. If demolition or
         construction activities would be conducted during the non-breeding season for raptors
         (September 1 through January 31), then no site assessment shall be required. This
         mitigation measure shall be implemented at the expense of the project proponent.




e)     Less than Significant Impact. The project would involve the removal of 19 trees, one of
       which is dead. City of Sierra Madre Municipal Code Chapter 12.20, Tree Preservation and
       Protection, requires that protected trees, which include any Southern California
       Black Walnut (Juglans californica), Engelmann Oak (Quercus engelmannii), Coast Live Oak
       (Quercus agrifolia), or Western Sycamore (Platanus racemosa) tree whose trunk (or
       collective trunks) exceed a diameter of four inches measured four feet above natural
       ground level, be replaced within one year of removal by a minimum of one tree of the
       same species for each tree removed, or a suitable alternative recommended by the tree
       expert. Chapter 12.20 requires replacement trees to be at least 24-inch box.

       During project construction, all street trees, including five California Sycamore trees and
       three Red Flowering Gum trees, would be retained and protected in place. The proposed
       project applicant proposes to remove and replace the 19 other trees on site at least one-
       for-one, all of which will be at least 24-inch box and some of which would be 36-inch box.
       Trees scheduled for removal are of the species Carrotwood (Cupaniopsis anacardioides),
       Canary Island Date Palm (Phoenix canariensis), Evergreen Elm (Ulmus parvifolia), and
       Weeping Bottlebrush (Callistemon viminalis). No trees scheduled for removal have been
       identified as protected trees per Chapter 12.20 of the City's Municipal Code. As such, the
       project would comply with the City's Tree Preservation Ordinance and would not conflict
       with local policies. Impact would be less than significant.

f)     No Impact. No adopted Habitat Conservation Plan areas 14 or any Natural Community
       Conservation Plan areas 15 apply to the project site. Neither are there any Significant
       Ecological Areas, or SEAs (ecologically important land and water areas, designated by Los
       Angeles County, that are valuable as plant and/or animal communities) near the site; the
       nearest SEA is the San Gabriel Canyon SEA, about 6.3 miles to the southeast.16 No impact
       would occur.

a)       Less Than Significant Impact. The existing buildings on the project site are not listed
         on the National Register of Historic Places 17 or the California Register of Historical
         Resources. 18 Furthermore, the existing buildings are not located on the City of Sierra
         Madre's designated list of historical buildings.19 The buildings on the property were built in
         the early 1950s; however, none of the buildings are designated as a historical structure by
         the City of Sierra Madre. Moreover, none of the buildings are considered a unique historical
         resource because they were not designed with distinctive architectural characteristics, do
         not contribute to the history of California, are not associated with any historical figure, and
         would not contribute any knowledge important in history or prehistory. Therefore, impact
         to historical resources, as defined in §15064.5 of the CEQA Guidelines, would be less than
         significant.

b)       Less Than Significant Impact. As part of the City's 1996 General Plan, an archaeological
         resources records search was conducted in 1995 by consulting records at the Institute of
         Archaeology at University of California, Los Angeles and the San Bernardino County
         Museum. The records search indicated that no historic or archaeological sites have been
         identified in the City, including at the project site.20

         Implementation of the proposed project would involve soil disturbance (i.e., removal of fill,
         grading, etc.). Although no known archaeological sites are documented within the project
         site, the potential exists to encounter previously undiscovered cultural material during

          project related ground disturbing activities. The potential for uncovering such significant
          resources is considered remote, given that no such resources were discovered during prior
          development activity on the site. Furthermore, the 1995 General Plan EIR includes
          mitigation (Mitigation Measure #15),21 which states that construction activities shall cease
          if unanticipated archaeological resources are encountered on a site. That mitigation
          measure is applicable to all development within the boundary of the General Plan,
          including the project site. Impact would be less than significant.

c)        Less Than Significant Impact. As part of the City's 1996 General Plan, a literature
          review and records search on paleontological sites in the City was conducted at the San
          Bernardino County Museum, Department of Community and Cultural Resources. The
          review indicated that no paleontological resources have been recorded within the City or
          within the immediate surroundings of the City.22

          The property is a developed site in an urbanized area, with no unique geological resources
          on or near the project site. Removal of surface fill would be undertaken as part of the
          project to adjust the grade; therefore, some potential exists to uncover paleontological
          resources (fossil evidence of life from past geologic time frames); however, this is
          considered unlikely given the previously disturbed nature of the site. Furthermore, the
          1995 General Plan EIR includes mitigation (Mitigation Measure #14),23 which states that
          earthmoving activities shall cease if unanticipated paleontological resources are
          encountered on a site. That mitigation measure is applicable to all development within the
          boundary of the General Plan, including the project site. Impact would be less than
          significant.

d)        Less Than Significant Impact. It is unlikely that human remains could be uncovered
          during grading operations considering that the project site was previously disturbed during
          construction of the existing structures. Nonetheless, should suspected human remains be
          encountered, the contractor would be required to notify the County Coroner, in accordance
          with Section 7050.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, who must then determine
          whether the remains are of forensic interest. If the Coroner, with the aid of a supervising
          archaeologist, determines that the remains are or appear to be of a Native American,
          he/she would contact the Native American Heritage Commission for further investigations
          and proper recovery of such remains, if necessary. Through this existing regulatory
          procedure, impacts to human remains can be avoided. Impact would be less than
          significant with implementation of existing regulations.

Initial Study                                                                                    41
Section 3: Evaluation of Environmental Impacts



A geotechnical report was prepared for the subject property in 2006 for a proposed mixed-use
development, the Wisteria Village Mixed Use Project.24 The Wisteria Village Mixed Use project did
not proceed and has no bearing on the proposed Kensington Assisted Living proposed project.
However, the prior 2006 geotechnical study contains information that can be applied to the
analysis of geology and soils conditions since those conditions have not changed since 2006 (due
to no change in conditions on the subject property).

A new geotechnical report for the Kensington Assisted Living project has not yet been completed
because soils samples performed while the existing buildings remain on the site would be limited
to the parking area (similar to the Wisteria Village Mixed Use project geotechnical report). The
applicant will perform soils testing and complete a project-specific geotechnical report following
building demolition, but prior to construction of the proposed project. This approach will allow the
soils samples to be drilled in the area of the proposed building footprint, which is currently
inaccessible due to the existing structure. The new geotechnical report will also identify site-
specific and building-specific geotechnical engineering measures that are appropriate to
incorporate into the project design to minimize soil and seismic concerns. The new geotechnical
report will be reviewed by the City Engineer.

a.i)    Less than Significant Impact. Although the project site is located in seismically active
        Southern California, the site is not located within an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
        Zone.25 According to the City's 1996 General Plan, the Sierra Madre fault zone is an active
        fault located in the City which has the potential to cause ground rupture. However, the
        project site is not located within the Sierra Madre Fault Zone. Geotechnical evaluations
        conducted on the site for the previous project revealed that no active faults have been
        identified at the ground surface of the project site.26 Thus, hazards due to ground rupture
        are considered less than significant.

a.ii)   Less than Significant Impact. The project site is subject to strong seismic ground
        shaking, as are virtually all properties in Southern California. The project site is located
        within close proximity to the Raymond Fault. Significant ground shaking may occur27 if an
        earthquake were to occur along that fault line. The 2007 California Building Code (CBC;
        Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Part 2) contains seismic safety provisions with the
        aim of preventing building collapse during a design earthquake, so that occupants would
        be able to evacuate after the earthquake. A design earthquake is one with a two percent
        chance of exceedance in 50 years, or an average return period of 2,475 years. Compliance
        with existing CBC regulations would limit hazards from strong ground shaking to less than
        significant. Furthermore, the geotechnical report to be required by the City must include
        site-specific soils preparation and construction recommendations based on localized soil
        conditions, distance from active faults, and estimated energy levels from potential
        earthquakes. A site-specific ground motion hazard analysis will also be prepared in
        accordance with the 2007 California Building Code (CBC) and ASCE 7-05 (Minimal Design
        Loads for Buildings and Other Structures). The recommendations of the geotechnical
        report will be implemented during preparation of construction drawings for review and
        approval by the City. Compliance with the CBC and other requirements required by the

                                                                   Kensington Assisted Living Facility



         City will provide adequate safeguards in the building design to reduce potential impacts
         due to strong seismic ground shaking to a less-than-significant level.

a.iii)   No Impact. Liquefaction is a phenomenon that occurs when soil undergoes transformation
         from a solid state to a liquefied condition due to the effects of increased pore-water
         pressure. This typically occurs where susceptible soils (particularly the medium sand to
         silt range) are located over a high groundwater table. Affected soils lose all strength
         during liquefaction and foundation failure can occur.

         The geotechnical report prepared for a previous project on the current project site
         indicates that due to the absence of shallow groundwater and the presence of dense soils,
         liquefaction potential is not considered to be a design issue at this site.28 No impact would
         occur.

a.iv)    Less than Significant Impact. The project site slopes gently to the southeast, resulting
         in a grade change of approximately nine feet; street grade elevation is approximately four
         feet lower than the lowest point on the site due to a retaining wall. The site does not
         contain the steep terrain necessary to induce earthquake related landslides. According to
         the Seismic Hazard Evaluation of the Mt. Wilson 7.5 minute quadrangle, the site is not
         located in an Earthquake-Induced Landslide Zone.29 This indicates a low probability for
         landslides; therefore, impact associated with landsliding would be less than significant.
         Engineered slopes and retaining walls along the north property line would serve to stabilize
         slopes. Impact would be less than significant.

b)       Less than Significant Impact. Topsoil is used to cover surface areas for the
         establishment and maintenance of vegetation due to its high concentrations of organic
         matter and microorganisms. Little, if any, native topsoil is likely to occur on site since the
         site is covered with paving and structures. The underlying soils consist predominantly of
         silty fine to medium or fine to coarse sands, with minor quantities of clay and gravel. A
         portion of this earth will be removed to lower the site prior to building construction. Once
         removed, the surface will again largely be covered by new paving and buildings. No long-
         term impacts with regard to erosion or loss of topsoil would occur.

         The project has the potential to expose surficial soils to wind and water erosion during
         construction activities. Wind erosion will be minimized through soil stabilization measures
         required by South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 403 (Fugitive
         Dust), such as daily watering. Water erosion will be prevented through the City's standard
         erosion control practices required pursuant to the California Building Code and the National
         Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), such as silt fencing or sandbags.
         Following project construction, the site would be covered completely by paving, structures,
         and landscaping. Impacts related to soil erosion would be less than significant with
         implementation of existing regulations.

c)       Less than Significant Impact. Impacts related to liquefaction and landslides are
         discussed above in Section 3.6.a. Lateral spreading is the downslope movement of surface
         sediment due to liquefaction in a subsurface layer. The downslope movement is due to
         gravity and earthquake shaking combined. Such movement can occur on slope gradients

       of as little as one degree. Lateral spreading typically damages pipelines, utilities, bridges,
       and structures.

       Localized lateral spreading is not considered a substantial hazard, as the site is not within
       a Zone of Required Investigation for liquefaction and the project would comply with CBC
       regulations for minimizing liquefaction hazards.

       The project applicant would be required by Section 1802 of the CBC to have a preliminary
       soil report prepared and submitted to the City before the City issues a building permit. The
       soil report would need to conclude that site soils would be capable of supporting proposed
       structures after grading and compaction. The CBC includes a requirement that any City-
       approved recommendations contained in the soil report be made conditions of the building
       permit. Compliance with existing CBC regulations would limit hazard impacts arising from
       unstable soils to less than significant, and no mitigation is needed.

d)     Less than Significant Impact. As part of the prior geotechnical report, the researchers
       drew six soil samples, none of which tested to consist of expansive soils. The report
       indicates that soils on site consist of non-expansive sands that are typically in a medium
       dense to dense condition.30 The CBC requires special design considerations for foundations
       of structures built on soils with expansion indices greater than 20. The project applicant
       would be required to complete a project-specific soil report prior to project construction.
       The soil report would include testing of site soil samples within the proposed building
       footprint for expansion potential. Compliance with CBC requirements would limit hazards
       related to expansive soil to less than significant, and no mitigation is required.

e)     No Impact. The proposed project would not include the use of septic systems or other
       alternative wastewater disposal systems; rather, connection to sanitary sewers would be
       required. Therefore, no impact would result.

 a) Generate greenhouse gas
    emissions, either directly or
    indirectly, that may have a
    significant impact on the
                                                                                            
    environment?
 b) Conflict with an applicable plan,
    policy or regulation adopted for the
    purpose of reducing the emissions                                            
    of greenhouse gases?

     a)   Less than Significant Impact. Climate change is the distinct change in measures of
          climate for a long period of time.31 Climate change is the result of numerous, cumulative
          sources of greenhouse gas emissions all over the world. Natural changes in climate can be
          caused by indirect processes such as changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun or direct
          changes within the climate system itself (i.e. changes in ocean circulation). Human
          activities can affect the atmosphere through emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and
          changes to the planet's surface. Human activities that produce GHGs are the burning of
          fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas for heating and electricity, gasoline and diesel for
          transportation); methane from landfill wastes and raising livestock, deforestation
          activities; and some agricultural practices.

          Greenhouse gases differ from other emissions in that they contribute to the "greenhouse
          effect." The greenhouse effect is a natural occurrence that helps regulate the temperature
          of the planet. The majority of radiation from the Sun hits the Earth's surface and warms
          it. The surface in turn radiates heat back towards the atmosphere, known as infrared
          radiation. Gases and clouds in the atmosphere trap and prevent some of this heat from
          escaping back into space and re-radiate it in all directions. This process is essential to
          supporting life on Earth because it warms the planet by approximately 60° Fahrenheit.
          Emissions from human activities since the beginning of the industrial revolution
          (approximately 150 years ago) are adding to the natural greenhouse effect by increasing
          the gases in the atmosphere that trap heat, thereby contributing to an average increase in
          the Earth's temperature. Greenhouse gases occur naturally and from human activities.
          Greenhouse gases produced by human activities include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
          (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur
          hexafluoride (SF6). Since 1750, it is estimated that the concentrations of carbon dioxide,
          methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere have increased over 36 percent, 148
          percent, and 18 percent, respectively, primarily due to human activity. Emissions of
          greenhouse gases affect the atmosphere directly by changing its chemical composition
          while changes to the land surface indirectly affect the atmosphere by changing the way the
          Earth absorbs gases from the atmosphere.

      GHG emissions for the project were quantified utilizing the California Emissions Estimator
      Model (CalEEMod) version 2011.1.1 to determine if the project could have a cumulatively
      considerable impact related to greenhouse gas emissions (see Appendix B, Air Quality
      Modeling Data), and summarized in Table 3.7-1. The emissions inventory accounts for
      GHG emissions from construction activities and operational activities.

      Operation emissions associated with the proposed project would include GHG emissions
      from mobile sources (transportation), energy, water use and treatment, waste disposal,
      and area sources. GHG emissions from electricity use are indirect GHG emissions from the
      energy (purchased energy) that is produced offsite. Area sources are owned or controlled
      by the project (e.g., natural gas combustion, boilers, and furnaces) and produced onsite.
      Construction activities are short term and cease to emit greenhouse gases upon
      completion, unlike operational emissions that are continuous year after year until
      operation of the use ceases. Because of this difference, SCAQMD recommends amortizing
      construction emissions over a 30-year operational lifetime. This normalizes construction
      emissions so that they can be grouped with operational emissions in order to generate a
      precise project-based GHG inventory.

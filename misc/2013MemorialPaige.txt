   I.      INTRODUCTION

   Halff Associates, Inc. (Halff) conducted a Left Turn Lane Evaluation on behalf of the City of
   The Colony for the Paige Road / Memorial Drive intersection. Figure 1 below is a map detailing
   the intersection location.

The Colony, Texas

Halff is currently in the design process to widen Memorial Drive from its current 4-lane divided
cross-section to a 6-lane divided cross-section. The developer of the currently vacant tract of
land located on the southwest corner of the intersection has requested a variance from the City's
design standard of 275 feet of storage, for the eastbound left turn lane on Memorial Drive at
Paige Road. The developer is requesting this variance in order to acquire a full median opening
along Memorial Drive closer to Paige Road than would be feasible with a left turn lane designed
to City standards.

Halff conducted weekday AM and PM peak hour turning movement traffic counts at the
intersection to identify the current traffic volumes passing through the intersection. Halff then
generated trips for nearby vacant land areas, based on City Land Use and Zoning information,
and distributed those trips through the Paige Road / Memorial Drive intersection. Halff added
those new development trips to the existing traffic volumes at the intersection, and also increased
these "total" traffic volumes by an annual growth rate to project a horizon year scenario. For
each of these two sets of projected traffic volumes, Halff then analyzed the AM and PM peak
hour operations of the intersection, and conducted queuing analyses to determine the maximum
queues expected for the eastbound left turn lane. Based on these analyses, Halff developed a
recommendation for the storage length of the eastbound left turn lane on Memorial Drive at
Paige Road.

II.       EXISTING and FUTURE ROADWAY CONDITIONS

Memorial Drive is a 4-lane divided road with dedicated eastbound and westbound left turn lanes
at the Paige Road intersection. As mentioned, Halff is currently involved in the design process
to improve Memorial Drive to a 6-lane divided road. The proposed lane configurations on
Memorial Drive at Paige Road are:

      ·   Left turn lane
      ·   Two through lanes
      ·   Shared through / right turn lane

Paige Road is a 6-lane divided road with dedicated northbound and southbound left turn lanes at
the Memorial Drive intersection. There is also a northbound right turn lane in place at the
intersection. There are no planned improvements or modifications to the lane configurations on
Paige Road at Memorial Drive, as part of the Memorial Drive widening project.

The Paige Road / Memorial Drive intersection is currently signalized, and will remain signalized
after the Memorial Drive widening project is completed.

III.       EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES at STUDY INTERSECTION

Halff conducted AM and PM peak period turning movement traffic volumes at the Paige Road /
Memorial Drive intersection on Thursday, January 10, 2013. Figures 2 and 3 in the Appendix
show the AM and PM peak hour volumes at the intersection. A copy of the traffic count data
sheet is also provided in the Appendix.

IV.        LAND USE and TRIP GENERATION for NEARBY VACANT TRACTS

Halff developed trip generation estimates for three nearby tracts of land that are currently vacant,
but when developed, could contribute to traffic growth at the Paige Road / Memorial Drive
intersection. The three tracts, their approximate size, and Halff's assumptions for future land use
on the tracts, are described below:

Tract 1

       ·   Located on the southwest quadrant of the Paige Road / Memorial Drive intersection
       ·   Approximately 8.75 acres
       ·   Assumed to develop as Business Park (25% coverage)

Tract 2

       ·   Located on the east side of Blair Oaks Drive between SH 121 and Memorial Drive
       ·   Approximately 26 acres
       ·   Assumed to develop as a Top Golf facility (16 acres / 64 tee positions) and Business Park
           (10 acres / 25% coverage)

Tract 3

       ·   Located on the west side of South Colony Boulevard between SH 121 and Memorial
           Drive
       ·   Approximately 70 acres
       ·   Assumed to develop as Business Park (25% coverage)

Halff generated trips for these three tracts using the historical trip generation data published by
the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) in the publication Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition. Trips were generated for the typical weekday AM and PM peak hours. The generated
trips for these three tracts are shown in Table 1.

V.      DEVELOPMENT              OF        PROJECTED        TRAFFIC     VOLUMES         at     STUDY
        INTERSECTION

Halff distributed the trips generated by the nearby tracts, shown in Table 1, at the Paige Road /
Memorial Drive intersection. Halff then added these trips to the existing peak hour traffic
volumes at the intersection (shown in Figures 2 and 3 in the Appendix), to estimate the study
year 2013 total volumes at the intersection. These projected traffic volumes are shown in
Figures 4 and 5 in the Appendix.

To estimate a horizon year scenario, Halff increased the study year 2013 total volumes by a 2
percent annual growth factor for 10 years. These projected horizon year 2023 total volumes at
the study intersection are shown in Figures 6 and 7 in the Appendix.

VI.     INTERSECTION ANALYSES

Halff conducted AM and PM peak hour level-of-service (LOS) and queuing analyses at the Paige
Road / Memorial Drive intersection, for the study year 2013 total volumes and the horizon year
2023 total volumes. Results of the analyses were generated using standard procedures outlined
in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) through the use of the Synchro 8 software package.
For reference, all Synchro output / worksheets are provided in the Appendix. LOS and delay
have been set by the nation's transportation officials based upon the amount of delay motorists
will tolerate before reaching various degrees of frustration. The LOS criteria for signalized
intersections may be found in Table 2.

    C         Moderate delays at intersections with satisfactory to good progression of      > 20.0 and  35.0
              traffic. Light congestion; occasional backups on critical approaches.

              40-percent probability of delays of one cycle or more at every
              intersection. No progression of traffic along the roadway with 90
    D         percent probability of being stopped at every intersection experiencing        > 35.0 and  55.0
              "D" condition. Significant congestion on critical approaches, but
              intersections are functional. Vehicles required to wait through more than
              one cycle during short peaks. No long standing lines formed.

              Heavy traffic flow condition. Delays of two or more cycles are probable.
    E         No progression. 100 percent probability of stopping at intersection.           > 55.0 and  80.0
              Blockage of intersection may occur if traffic signal does not provide for
              protected turning movements.

              Unstable flow. Heavy congestion. Traffic moves in forced flow
    F         condition. Three or more cycles to pass through intersection. Total                 > 80.0
              breakdown with stop-and-go operations.


Halff conducted both the study year 2013 total volume analyses and the horizon year 2023 total
volume analyses using the proposed lane assignments and traffic controls presented below:

        ·   Eastbound ­ left turn lane, two through lanes, shared through / right turn lane
        ·   Westbound ­ left turn lane, two through lanes, shared through / right turn lane
        ·   Northbound ­ left turn lane, three through lanes, right turn lane
        ·   Southbound ­ left turn lane, two through lanes, shared through / right turn lane
        ·   Signalized intersection, with protected / permissive phasing for all left turns

For each scenario, Halff conducted LOS and queuing analyses for two cycle lengths ­ 90
seconds and 120 seconds. The Synchro software was then allowed to optimize the overall LOS
for the intersection for each cycle length.

                              intersection


The results of the intersection LOS analyses indicate that the Paige Road / Memorial Drive
intersection can operate at an overall LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours,
for both analysis year scenarios (2013 and 2023) and with either a 90-second cycle length or with
a 120-second cycle length. Furthermore, the eastbound left turn movement is projected to
operate at a LOS D or better for all analysis scenarios.

The results of the queuing analyses indicate that the maximum (95th percentile) queue projected
for the eastbound left turn movement is 191 feet, for the horizon year 2023 scenario with a 120-
second cycle length.

VII.    SUMMARY and RECOMMENDATIONS

Halff conducted a Left Turn Lane Evaluation for the Paige Road / Memorial Drive intersection
to address a request for a variance from the City of The Colony's standard left turn lane storage
requirement, 275 feet. The variance would apply specifically to the eastbound left turn lane.
Halff developed projected traffic volumes at the intersection by adding existing volumes to
projected development trips from nearby vacant properties, and by increasing the sum of these
volumes by an annual growth rate. Halff then conducted intersection LOS and queuing analyses
for the study year 2013 and horizon year 2023 projected peak hour volumes passing through the
intersection, and evaluated the results to determine an appropriate storage length for the
eastbound left turn lane.

Based on the analysis results, Halff recommends that the eastbound left turn lane provide 200
feet of storage space. This is sufficient to accommodate the projected maximum (95th percentile)
queue calculated for any of the analysis scenarios (191 feet). Assuming a storage length of 25
feet per vehicle, a 200-foot long turn lane could be expected to accommodate at least 8 vehicles
entirely within the lane itself.

It should be noted that representatives for the developer of the vacant tract on the southwest
corner of the Paige Road / Memorial Drive intersection observed the intersection during the PM
peak period on November 30, 2012. The longest queue observed during the PM peak hour was 9
vehicles, which occurred twice (a copy of this data is included in the Appendix). This observed
queue could reasonably be expected to be accommodated entirely within a 200-foot long left turn
lane, once the taper is taken into consideration. Widening Memorial Drive will allow more
flexibility with the signal timing to address the eastbound left turn demand and accommodate the
projected volumes as indicated in the analyses.

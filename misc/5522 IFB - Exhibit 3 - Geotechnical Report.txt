  Purpose and Methodology:  The principal purposes of this investigation were to evaluate the 
  general  soil  conditions  at  the  proposed  site  and  to  develop  geotechnical  engineering  design 
  recommendations.    To  accomplish  its  intended  purposes,  the  study  was  conducted  in  the 
  following  phases:    (1)  drill  sample  borings  to  evaluate  the  soil  conditions  at  the  boring 
  locations  and  to  obtain  soil  samples;  (2)  conduct  laboratory  tests  on  selected  samples 
  recovered from the borings to establish the pertinent engineering characteristics of the soils; 
  and  (3)  perform  engineering  analyses,  using  field  and  laboratory  data,  to  develop  design 
  criteria.

   Notes: 
   1. bgs = below ground surface. 
   2. Boring locations provided in Appendix B  Boring Location Diagram were not surveyed and should be 
      considered approximate.  Borings were located by recreational handheld GPS unit.  Horizontal accuracy 
      of such units is typically on the order of 20feet. 
   3. Grab sample only made in utility backfill zone. 
   
  Boring  Logs:    Subsurface  conditions  were  defined  using  the  sample  borings.    Boring  logs 
  generated during this study are included in Appendix C  Boring Logs and Laboratory Results.  
  Borings  were  advanced  between  sample  intervals  using  continuous  flight  auger  drilling 
  procedures.   
   
  Cohesive  Soil  Samples:   Cohesive  soil  samples  were  obtained  using  Shelby  tube  samplers  in 
  general  accordance  with  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials  (ASTM)  D1587.    The 
  Shelby tube sampler consists of a thinwalled steel tube with a sharp cutting edge connected 
  to  a  head  equipped  with  a  ball  valve  threaded  for  rod  connection.   The  tube  is  pushed  into 
  the  undisturbed  soils  by  the  hydraulic  pulldown  of  the  drilling  rig.   The  soil  specimens  were 
  extruded  from  the  tube  in  the  field,  logged,  tested  for  consistency  using  a  hand 
  penetrometer, sealed and packaged to maintain "in situ" moisture content. 
   
  Cohesive  Soil  Consistency  Measurement:    The  consistency  of  cohesive  soil  samples  was 
  evaluated  in  the  field  using  a  calibrated  hand  penetrometer,  for  which  a  0.25inch  diameter 
  piston is pushed into the undisturbed sample at a constant rate to a depth of 0.25inch.  The 
  results  of  these  tests  are  tabulated  at  the  respective  sample  depths  on  the  boring  logs.  
  When the capacity of the penetrometer is exceeded, the value is tabulated as 4.5+.  
   
  Granular  Soil  Sampling:    Granular  soil  samples  were  generally  obtained  using  splitbarrel 
  sampling procedures in general accordance with ASTM D1586.  In the splitbarrel procedure, 


  G&AI Project No. 120394                         Page 2 
  a  disturbed  sample  is  obtained  in  a  standard  2inch  outside  diameter  (OD)  split  barrel 
  sampling  spoon  driven  18inches  into  the  ground  using  a  140pound  (lb)  hammer  falling 
  freely  30  inches.    The  number  of  blows  for  the  last  12inches  of  a  standard  18inch 
  penetration is recorded as the Standard Penetration Test resistance (Nvalue).  The Nvalues 
  are recorded on the boring logs at the depth of sampling. Samples were sealed and returned 
  to our laboratory for further examination and testing.  
   
  Groundwater Observations:  Groundwater observations are shown on the boring logs.   
   
  Borehole  Completion:   Upon  completion  of  the  borings,  the  boreholes  were  backfilled  with 
  cementitious  grout  from  the  top  and  plugged  with  cold  mix  asphalt  at  the  surface  at  the 
  surface. 
   
   
3.0 LABORATORY TESTING 
   
  G&AI  performs  visual  classification  and  any  of  a  number  of  laboratory  tests,  as  appropriate, 
  to  define  pertinent  engineering  characteristics  of  the  soils  encountered.    Tests  are 
  performed  in  general  accordance  with  ASTM  or  other  standards  and  the  results  included  at 
  the respective sample depths on the boring logs or separately tabulated, as appropriate, and 
  included  in  Appendix  C    Boring  Logs  and  Laboratory  Results.    Laboratory  tests  and 
  procedures  routinely  utilized,  as  appropriate,  for  geotechnical  investigations  are  tabulated 
  below.

4.0 SITE CONDITIONS 
     
         4.1 General  
     
    ClientProvided Site Use History: Hickory Street from Locust Street to Railroad Avenue is part 
    of  a  renaissance  project  underway  in  this  historic  area  of  Denton.  Pavement  improvements 
    are contributory to this project for the fourlane / undivided thoroughfare with planned pull
    in 45degree parking in both directions. 
     
    Review  of  Aerial  Photographs:   Historical  aerial  photographs  of  the  site  were  not  reviewed 
    for  potential  past  alterations  to  the  site  since  the  Hickory  Street  section  proposed  for 
    reconstruction has been part of urban Denton for a considerable while.   
     
    Topography:  A  United  States  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  topographic  map  of  the  site  is 
    provided in  Appendix D  USGS Topographic Map.  The map indicates the site slopes  upward 
    toward the west end near Locust Street.  
     
     
         4.2 Geology  
     
    Geologic  Formation:    Based  on  available  surface  geology  maps  and  our  experience,  it 
    appears  this  site  is  located  generally  at  the  contact  of  the  Grayson  Formation  (Undivided  / 
    Lower  Cretaceous)  to  the  west  of  the  study  area  and  the  Woodbine  Formation  (Upper 



    G&AI Project No. 120394                           Page 4 
Cretaceous)  to  the  east.  A  geologic  atlas  and  USGS  formation  description  are  provided  in 
Appendix  E    Geologic  Atlas  and  Formation  Description.    Grayson  Marl  is  yellowish  gray  to 
light  brown  limestone  to  coarse  grained  inter  bedded  marl.  Soils  within  the  Woodbine 
Formation  generally  comprise  an  interlensing  sequence  of  nonmarine,  brackishwater,  and 
marine beds of sand, clay, sandstone, and shale with fossils.  
 
Geologic Faults:  A geologic fault study was beyond the scope of this investigation.   
 
Sulfate/Sulfide Minerals:  The following minerals can be potential naturally occurring sources 
of  sulfates/sulfides:    alunite,  bassinite,  kainite,  kierserite,  mirabilite,  thenardite,  arcanite, 
jarosite,  barite,  antlerite,  angelesite,  pyrite,  marcasite,  gypsum,  selenite,  satin  spar, 
alabaster  and  anhydrite.   The  USGS  formation  descriptions,  provided  in  Appendix  E,  for  this 
site do not identify the presence of any sulfate/sulfide minerals in the formation.

Moisture  Change  Susceptibility  of  Near  Surface  Soils:    The  soils  encountered  beneath  the 
existing  flexible  pavement  at  this  site,  especially  between  Bell  Street  and  Railroad  Avenue  in 
the  east  end  of  the  project,  are  very  susceptible  to  changes  in  moisture.    The  presence  of 
surface  water  due  to  precipitation  or  groundwater  may  result  in  decrease  in  the  ability  to 
compact  and  work  with  the  soil  for  subgrade  exposed  for  longer  periods  during 
reconstruction.    It  is  common  for  these  soils  to  pump  when  subjected  to  high  levels  of 



G&AI Project No. 120394                           Page 5 
moisture.    Soils  of  this  type  are  especially  prone  to  requiring  the  implementation  of  wet 
weather/soft subgrade recommendations provided in this report. 
 
Swell  Potential:   Atterberg  (plastic  and  liquid)  limit  determinations  were  performed  on  five 
shallow  soil  samples  obtained  at  depths  between  2  and  6feet  bgs.    The  plasticity  index 
determined  for  samples  obtained  in  Boring  Nos.  B01  thru  B03  to  the  west  end  of  the 
project was between 9 and 30 with an average of 21.  The lean clay/clayey sand with a liquid 
limit  in  the  range  25  to  45  percent  has  a  moderate  potential  for  shrinking  and  swelling  with 
changes  in  soil  moisture  content.  The  plasticity  index  determined  for  samples  obtained  in 
Boring  Nos.  B06  and  B08   to  the  east  end  of  the  project  was  at  41  and  42  for  the  fat  clay 
with  an  average  liquid  limit  61  percent  indicating  that  the  fat  clay  soils  have  a  moderate  to 
high potential for shrinking and swelling with changes in soil moisture content. 
 
 
    4.4 Groundwater 
 
Groundwater  Levels.    The  borings  were  advanced  using  auger  drilling  and  intermittent 
sampling  methods  in  order  to  observe  groundwater  seepage  levels.    Groundwater  levels 
encountered in the borings during this investigation are identified below.

Longterm  Groundwater  Monitoring.    Longterm  monitoring  of  groundwater  conditions  via 
piezometers  was  not  performed  during  this  investigation  and  was  beyond  the  scope  of  this 
study.   Longterm  monitoring  can  reveal  groundwater  levels  materially  different  than  those 
encountered during measurements taken while drilling the borings. 
 
Groundwater  Fluctuations.    Future  construction  activities  may  alter  the  surface  and 
subsurface  drainage  characteristics  of  this  site.    It  is  difficult  to  accurately  predict  the 
magnitude  of  subsurface  water  fluctuations  that  might  occur  based  upon  shortterm 
observations.   The  groundwater  level  should  be  expected  to  fluctuate  throughout  the  years 
with variations in precipitation.

5.0 ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
   
      5.1 Seismic Site Classification 
   
  The  seismic  site  classification  is  based  on  the  2012  International  Building  Code  (IBC)  and  is  a 
  classification  of  the  site  based  on  the  type  of  soils  encountered  at  the  site  and  their 
  engineering  properties.   Per  Table  20.31  of  ASCE  710,  the  seismic  site  classification  for  this 
  site is D. 
       

      5.2 Potential Vertical Soil Movements 
   
  TxDOT  Method  Tex124E:    Potential  Vertical  Rise  (PVR)  calculations  were  performed  in 
  general  accordance  with  Texas  Department  of  Transportation  (TxDOT)  Method  Tex124E.  
  The Tex124E method is empirical and is based on the Atterberg limits and moisture content 
  of the subsurface soils.   
   
  The  calculated  PVR  is  an  empirical  estimate  of  a  soil's  potential  for  swell  based  upon  the 
  soil's  plasticity  index,  applied  loading  (due  to  structures  or  overburden),  and  antecedent 
  moisture  condition.    The  wetter  a  soil's  antecedent  moisture  condition,  the  lower  its 
  calculated  PVR  will  be  for  a  given  plasticity  index  and  load.    However,  soil  with  higher 
  antecedent  moisture  content  will  be  more  susceptible  to  shrinkage  due  to  drying.  
  Maintaining  consistent  moisture  content  in  the  soil  is  the  key  to  minimizing  both  heave  and 
  shrinkage related structural problems. 
   
  Calculated  PVR  using  TxDOT  Method  Tex124E:    The  PVR  calculated  using  TxDOT  Method 
  Tex124E is provided in table below. 
   
                       Boring Nos.                                   Calculated PVR (Inches) 
                       B01 to B05                                                  1 
                     B06 and B08                                                   2 
                                                         
  The above PVR is calculated assuming an average to dry antecedent moisture condition.  The 
  calculated  PVR  is  consistent  with  soil  moisture  conditions  at  the  time  this  investigation  was 
  conducted.   
   
  Soil  Moisture  Confirmation  Prior  to  Construction:   The  calculated  PVR  can  vary  considerably 
  with prolonged wet or dry periods.  We recommend that the moisture content for the upper 
  10feet of soils within the exposed pavement subgrade be assessed for consistency with this 
  report  prior  to  construction  if:    (1)  an  extended  period  of  time  has  elapsed  between  the 
  performance  of  this  investigation  and  reconstruction  of  the  paved  street  or  (2)  unusually 




  G&AI Project No. 120394                          Page 7 
wet  or  dry  weather  is  experienced  between  the  performance  of  this  investigation  and  the 
pavement reconstruction activity.  
 
 
    5.3 Construction Excavations 
 
Sloped  Excavations:  All  sloped  shortterm  construction  excavations  onsite  should  be 
designed  in  accordance  with  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA) 
excavation  standards.    Borings  from  this  investigation  indicated  that  the  soils  may  be 
classified per OSHA regulations as Type C from the ground surface to a depth of 10feet bgs. 
Shortterm  construction  excavations  may  be  constructed  with  a  maximum  slope  of  1.5:1, 
horizontal to vertical (H:V), to a depth of 10feet.  If temporary excavations are to be deeper 
than  10feet,  we  should  be  contacted  to  evaluate  the  excavation.    Recommendations 
provided herein are not valid for any longterm or permanent slopes onsite.   
 
Shored  Excavations:    As  an  alternative  to  sloped  excavations,  vertical  shortterm 
construction  excavations  may  be  used  in  conjunction  with  trench  boxes  or  other  shoring 
systems.   Shoring  systems  should  be  designed using  an  equivalent  fluid  weight  of  65  pounds 
per  cubic  foot  (pcf).   Surcharge  pressures  at  the  ground  surface  due  to  dead  and  live  loads 
should be added to the lateral earth pressures where they may occur. 
   
Lateral surcharge pressures should be assumed to act as a uniform pressure along the upper 
10feet  of  the  excavation  based  on  a  lateral  earth  coefficient  of  0.5.    Surcharge  loads  set 
back  behind  the  excavation  at  a  horizontal  distance  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  excavation 
depth may be ignored.   
 
We  recommend  that  no  more  than  200feet  of  unshored  excavation  should  be  open  at  any 
one  time  to  prevent  the  possibility  of  failure  and  excessive  ground  movement  to  occur.   We 
also  recommend  that  unshored  excavations  do  not  remain  open  for  a  period  of  time  longer 
than 24hours. 
 
Limitations:    Recommendations  provided  herein  assume  there  are  no  nearby  structures  or 
other  improvements  which  might  be  detrimentally  affected  by  the  construction  excavation.  
Before  proceeding,  we  should  be  contacted  to  evaluate  construction  excavations  with  the 
potential to affect nearby structures or other improvements. 
 
Excavation  Monitoring:    Excavations  should  be  monitored  to  confirm  site  soil  conditions 
consistent  with  those  encountered in  the  borings  drilled  as  part  of  this  study.   Discrepancies 
in  soil  conditions  should  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  G&AI  for  review  and  revision  of 
recommendations, as appropriate.

    5.4 Groundwater Control 
 
Groundwater  was  not  encountered  to  the  maximum  depth  of  10feet  during  the  subsurface 
investigation.    If  groundwater  is  encountered  during  excavation,  dewatering  to  bring  the 
groundwater  below  the  bottom  of  excavations  may  be  required.   Dewatering  could  consist 
of  standard  sump  pits  and  pumping  procedures,  which  may  be  adequate  to  control  seepage 
on a local basis during excavation. The contractor should submit a groundwater control plan, 
prepared by a licensed engineer experienced in that type of work. 
 
 
    5.5 Earthwork 
 
            5.5.1 Site Preparation 
 
Site  preparation  in  the  area  of  proposed  pavement  reconstruction  improvements  should 
include  the  removal  of  all  existing  pavement  materials,  concrete  debris,  septic  tanks, 
abandoned  structures,  rubbish  and  any  other  undesirable  matter  beneath  the  existing 
pavement with subsequent proper disposal.  All deleterious material should be removed and 
the  exposed  surface  should  be  scarified  to  an  additional  depth  of  at  least  6  inches.  It  is  the 
intent  of  these  recommendations  to  provide  a  loose  surface  with  no  features  that  would 
tend to prevent uniform compaction by the equipment to be used.  
 
            5.5.2 Proofroll 
 
Exposed paving subgrades should be proofrolled with a fully loaded tandem axle dump truck 
or  similar  pneumatictire  equipment  to  locate  areas  of  loose  subgrade.   In  areas  to  be  cut, 
the  proofroll  should  be  performed  after  the  final  grade  is  established.   In  areas  to  be  filled, 
the  proofroll  should  be  performed  prior  to  fill  or  base  course  placement.   Areas  of  loose  or 
soft  subgrade  identified  and  encountered  in  the  proofroll  should  be  removed  and  replaced 
with  engineered  fill,  and/or  additional  subbase  which  is  moisture  conditioned  (dried  or 
wetted, as needed) and compacted in place. 
 
            5.5.3 Grading and Drainage 
 
Every  attempt  should  be  made  to  limit  the  extreme  wetting  or  drying  of  any  exposed 
subsurface  soils  or  subbase  because  swelling  and/or  shrinkage  of  these  soils  may  result, 
depending on the prevailing cycle.  Standard construction practice of providing good surface 
water  drainage  should  be  used.    A  positive  slope  of  the  ground  away  from  any  exposed 
subgrade / subbase should be provided.  Temporary ditches or swales should be provided to 
carry  the  runoff  water  during  construction.    Storm  water  runoff  should  be  collected  by 
permanent surface drainage features for final discharge in storm water sewers.  
 



G&AI Project No. 120394                          Page 9 
            5.5.4 Fill  
 
Select  Fill:    Any  fill  placed  in  as  pavement  subgrade  should  consist  of  select  fill.    Select  fill 
should  consist  of  soil  with  a  Liquid  Limit  less  than  35  percent  and  a  Plasticity  Index  between 
5 and 15.   The select fill should be placed in loose lifts not exceeding 8inches and should be 
compacted to  at  least  95  percent  maximum  dry density  (per  ASTM  D698)  and  at  a moisture 
content  between  optimum  and  3  percent  above  optimum  moisture  content.   The  subgrade 
to  receive  select  fill  should  be  scarified  to  a  depth  of  at  least  6  inches  and  compacted  to  at 
least 95 percent maximum dry density (per ASTM D698) and at a moisture content between 
optimum and 3 percent above optimum. 
 
Unsuitable  Materials:    Materials  considered  unsuitable  for  use  as  select  fill  or  general  fill 
include  low  and  high  plasticity  silt  (ML  and  MH),  silty  clay  (CLML),  organic  clay  and  silt  (OH 
and  OL)  and  highly  organic  soils  such  as  peat  (Pt).   These  soils  may  be  used  for  site  grading 
and  restoration  in  unimproved  areas  as  approved  by  the  Geotechnical  Engineer.   Soil  placed 
in  unimproved  areas  should  be  placed  in  loose  lifts  not  exceeding  10inches  and  should  be 
compacted to  at  least  92  percent  maximum  dry density  (per  ASTM  D698)  and  at  a moisture 
content within ±4 percentage points of optimum.   
 
Cautionary  Note:   It  is  extremely  important  that  select  fill  placed  within  areas  of  pavement 
improvement  be  properly  characterized  using  one  or  more  representative  proctor  samples.  
Use of a proctor sample which does not adequately represent the select fill being placed can 
lead to erroneous compaction (moisture and density) results which can significantly increase 
the potential for swelling of the select fill.  The plasticity index of select fill soils placed during 
construction  should  be  checked  every  day  to  confirm  conformance  to  the  project 
specifications and consistency with the proctor being utilized.    
 
            5.5.5 Testing  
 
Field  compaction  and  classification  tests  should  be  performed  by  a  G&AI  representative.  
Compaction  tests  should  be  performed  in  each  lift  of  the  compacted  material.    We 
recommend the following minimum soil compaction testing be performed:   
 
       One test per lift per 2,500 square feet (SF) or reconstructed pavement 
       One test per lift per 100 linear feet of utility backfill.   
 
If  the  materials  fail  to  meet  the  density  or  moisture  content  specified,  the  course  should  be 
reworked  as  necessary  to  obtain  the  specified  compaction.    At  least  one  classification  test 
(Atterberg limits) per day of placement should be performed on select fill materials (whether 
onsite  or  imported)  to  confirm  consistency  with  the  specifications.    G&AI  cannot  assume 
responsibility  or  liability  for  recommendations  provided  in  this  report  if  construction 
inspection and/or testing is performed by another party.

    5.6 Pavement  
 
Design  Methodology.  Recommendations  provided  below  are  based  on  "Traffic  Count  Data" 
provided  by  the  Client  during  the  current  study,  the  City  of  Denton  Transportation  Criteria 
Manual  and  the  1993  AASHTO  Pavement  Design  Procedures,  published  by  the  American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The "Traffic Count Data" provided 
by the Client is provided in Appendix G ­ Client Documents. 
 
The  traffic  count  data  includes  traffic  data  along  the  subject  Hickory  Street  alignment  from 
7:30 am to 5:00 pm during the day. No traffic data was provided for other times of a day. For 
design purposes, therefore, we assumed the reconstructed pavement will be subjected to an 
additional  20  percent  traffic  flow  between  5:00  PM  to  7:30  AM.  Further,  we  assumed  that 
the  reconstructed  pavement  will  be  subjected  to  18wheel  truck  traffic  flow  count  equal  to 
an additional 3 percent of the total daily vehicular traffic. 

           5.6.1 Design Parameters 
 
The  following  design  parameters  were  assumed  in  the  current  analysis.  The  assumed  values 
are  based  on  the  City  of  Denton  Transportation  Criteria  Manual,  1993  AASHTO  Pavement 
Design Manual and our experience with similar projects.

             5.6.2 Pavement Sections 
 
Both  asphalt  and  concrete  sections  are  provided  in  the  sections  below,  but  are  not 
considered  equal  in  performance.    Flexible  asphaltic  pavement  subjected  to  soilrelated 
shrinking and swelling does not perform as well as rigid pavements.  As a result, the lifespan 
of  flexible  asphaltic  pavement  can  be  reduced  substantially  when  compared  to  rigid 
pavement.   The  need  for  increased  maintenance  of  flexible  asphaltic  pavements  should  be 
considered prior to its selection.

6.0 CONSTRUCTION OBSERVATIONS 
   
  By  necessity,  geotechnical  engineering  design  recommendations  are  based  on  a  limited 
  amount  of  information  about  subsurface  conditions.    In  the  analysis,  the  geotechnical 
  engineer  must  assume  subsurface  conditions  are  similar  to  those  encountered  in  the 
  borings.  Anomalies  in  subsurface  conditions  are  often  revealed  during  construction.    G&AI 
  should  be  retained  to  observe  earthwork  and  foundation  installation  and  perform  materials 
  evaluation  and  testing  during  the  construction  phase  of  the  project.    This  enables  G&AI's 
  geotechnical  engineer  to  stay  abreast  of  the  project  and  to  be  readily  available  to  evaluate 
  unanticipated  conditions,  to  conduct  additional  tests  if  required  and,  when  necessary,  to 
  recommend alternative solutions to unanticipated conditions.   
  Until  these  construction  phase  services  are  performed  by  G&AI,  the  recommendations 
  contained  in  this  report  on  such  items  as  final  pavement  subgrade  elevations,  final  depth  of 
  undercut  of  any  deleterious  soils  or  other  such  subsurfacerelated  recommendations  should 
  be considered as preliminary.   
   
  G&AI cannot assume responsibility or liability for recommendations provided in this report if 
  construction inspection and/or testing is performed by another party.

  It  is  proposed  that  construction  phase  observation  and  materials  testing  commence  by  the 
  project  geotechnical  engineer  (G&AI)  at  the  outset  of  the  project.    Experience  has  shown 
  that  the  most  suitable  method  for  procuring  these  services  is  for  the  owner  to  contract 
  directly  with  the  project  geotechnical  engineer.    This  results  in  a  clear,  direct  line  of 
  communication  between  the  owner  and  the  owner's  design  engineers  and  the  geotechnical 
  engineer.  
   
   
7.0 GENERAL COMMENTS 
   
  The  analyses,  conclusions  and  recommendations  contained  in  this  report  are  based  on  site 
  conditions  as  they  existed  at  the  time  of  the  field  investigation  and  on  the  assumption  that 
  the  exploratory  borings  are  representative  of  the  subsurface  conditions  throughout  the  site; 
  that  is,  the  subsurface  conditions  everywhere  are  not  significantly  different  from  those 
  disclosed  by  the  borings  at  the  time  they  were  completed.   If  during  construction,  different 
  subsurface  conditions  from  those  encountered  in  our  borings  are  observed,  or  appear  to  be 
  present in excavations, we must be advised promptly so that we can review these conditions 
  and  reconsider  our  recommendations  where  necessary.    If  there  is  a  substantial  lapse  of 
  time  between  submission  of  this  report  and  the  start  of  the  work  at  the  site,  if  conditions 
  have  changed  due  either  to  natural  causes  or  to  construction  operations  at  or  adjacent  to 
  the site, or if structure locations, structural loads or finish grades are changed, we should be 
  promptly  informed  and  retained  to  review  our  report  to  determine  the  applicability  of  the 
  conclusions and recommendations, considering the changed conditions and/or time lapse. 
   
  G&AI, Inc. should be retained to review those portions of the plans and specifications for this 
  particular  project  that  pertain  to  earthwork  and  foundations  as  a  means  to  determine 
  whether  the  plans  and  specifications  are  consistent  with  the  recommendations  contained  in 
  this  report.    In  addition,  we  are  available  to  observe  construction,  particularly  the 
  compaction  of  structural  fill,  or  backfill  and  the  construction  of  foundations  as 
  recommended in the report and such other field observations as might be necessary. 
   
  This report has been prepared for the exclusive use of the Client and their designated agents 
  for  specific  application  to  design  of  this  project.   We  have  used  that  degree  of  care  and  skill 
  ordinarily  exercised  under  similar  conditions  by  reputable  members  of  our  profession 
  practicing  in  the  same  or  similar  locality.    No  warranty,  expressed  or  implied,  is  made  or 
  intended.

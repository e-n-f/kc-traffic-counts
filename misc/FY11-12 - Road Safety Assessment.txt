administrative host of the SJTPO. All provisions and requirements of the SJTA pertaining to contractual
matters will be in effect. This project is funded by the Federal Highway Administration of the United
States Department of Transportation.

II.      SCOPE OF WORK

Safety is a top priority in SJTPO's plans and programs. Along with the South Jersey Traffic Safety
Alliance (SJTSA), SJTPO is actively engaged in many safeties ­ related initiatives, including
Transportation Safety Planning, crash data analysis, Road Safety Audits and Scans, and others.

A Road Safety Audit (RSA) is the formal examination of an existing or future road or traffic project by
an independent team of trained specialists. SJTPO conducted RSAs on area roads in FY 2005, 2006, and
2007, and $1 Million in federal safety funds will be available in both FY 2011 and FY 2012 to
implement low-cost, quick turnaround safety improvements identified in the RSA's.

This RFP seeks a qualified consultant or team to provide assistance to SJTPO project sponsors in
implementing safety improvements. Work could include conducting Road Safety Audits, plan
preparation, signal design, warrant and progression analysis, etc., as needed and the following projects
are contemplated for FY 2011 and FY 2012 consultant assistance:

         Road Safety Audit of Ventnor Avenue, CR 629, in the Cities of Ventnor and Margate, Atlantic
         County
         A review of traffic signals for compliance with AASHTO and MUTCD specifications on federal
         ­ aid roads (whether under County or municipal jurisdiction) in North Wildwood, Wildwood,
         and Wildwood Crest, in Cape May County
         A Road Safety Assessment on a Cape May County road to be selected by March 2011. For
         budgeting purposes, assume a length of two miles, some of which may be covered by vehicle(s)
         if warranted
         Road Safety Audit of Brigantine Boulevard (entire length), CR 638, City of Brigantine, Atlantic
         County

The following information will be available for use by the selected consultant:

         -   A crash analysis for Ventnor Avenue (which may be downloaded from the RFP section of
             SJTPO's website www.sjtpo.org);
         -   Short duration vehicle and pedestrian counts at several Ventnor Avenue intersections (also
             available on the website);
            -   A crash analysis for Brigantine Boulevard, which will be produced in late 2010 in a similar
                fashion as the Ventnor Avenue report.

Project deliverables must be identified in the proposal and would include engineering data and products.
Also, the final Progress Report must contain a summary of all project materials delivered to sponsors.

All final products must be submitted in electronic and hard copy versions. Microsoft formats, pdf, and
ArcView are preferred, and the proposal should state the specific formats for the deliverables.

We anticipate a Notice to Proceed on or about Monday, November 8, 2010. The project must be
completed by June 30, 2012.

III.    CONSULTANT SELECTION

A review committee will evaluate each proposal and may recommend firms to present additional
information and appear for interviews. Or, the proposal may be the sole basis for the selection.

Negotiations and award of the contract will be to the firms that provide the most advantageous
proposals. The SJTPO reserves the right to reject any and all proposals.

LATE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE EVALUATED.

The submission should be stapled or bound with no loose pages. The following criteria have been
established to guide the evaluation of each consultant proposal with each criterion weighted as indicated
below. The proposal must contain the following information:

A.       Technical Proposal

       1.       Technical Approach (30 percent of the total rating): A narrative describing the understanding
                of the effort and products required, including descriptions of the specific tasks and subtasks
                to be undertaken.

                a. The issues or problems and a detailed approach to completing the work program. List and
                   description of deliverables.

                b. A project schedule indicating project milestones, deliverables, and key meetings using a
                   Notice to Proceed as "Day 0". The schedule should anticipate review time by other
                   agencies and committees, but time allotments for work under the control of the consultant
                   will be regarded as a commitment.

       2.       Firm Qualifications (25 percent of the total rating): Qualifications of the firm and any
                subcontractors:

                a. A list of similar work, including the name and telephone number of the clients, and a full
                   description of the services provided by the firm. An organizational chart and description

              b. A description of the firm's facilities, number of offices and employees in each office, any
                 special equipment and other factors, (knowledge, skills, etc.) which may affect the
                 delivery of the required services.

      3.      Staff Qualifications (30 percent of the total rating): Qualifications, experience and office
              address of firm's and any subcontractor's staff:

              a. Resumes of the professional staff.

              b. Location of office that will be performing the work on this project.

      4.      ESBE Utilization (15 percent of the total rating):

              A federal requirement that must be addressed is the mandated Emerging Small Business
              Enterprise (ESBE) participation. An ESBE is defined in 49 CFR Part 26, as "a small
              business concern (from Section 3 of the Small Business Act), which is:

              a. At least 51 percent owned by one or more socially and `economically disadvantage'
                 individual, or in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of the stock
                 of which is owned by one or more `socially and economically disadvantage' individuals:
                 and,
              b. Whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more of the
                 `socially and economically disadvantaged' individuals who own it.

The highest-ranking firms may be invited, at the option of the SJTPO, to an interview to present relevant
details of their proposals and introduce key staff.

B.         Cost Proposal

The Technical Proposals must be accompanied by the same number of copies of the Cost Proposal in a
separate, sealed envelope. The cost proposals must include a price and level of effort for the Scope of
Work. All other charges, such as fringe benefit, overhead, profit, etc., must be identified, yielding a
total project cost. Please also include a list of key personnel arranged by title and level with hourly
rates.

If an acceptable contract cannot be negotiated with the selected firm, negotiations will be terminated and
SJTPO will initiate discussions with the second ranked firm.

The consultant selection and negotiated contract are subject to approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation in accordance with its policies and procedures.

IV.    EMERGING SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION

The CONTRACTOR agrees that ESBE firms as defined in 49 CFR Part 26 shall have the maximum
opportunity to participate in the performance of contracts and subcontracts financed in whole or in part
with Federal funds provided under this Agreement, the CONTRACTOR and its subcontractors shall not
discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex in the award and performance of USDOT-
assisted contracts in accordance with 49 CFR Part 21. The SJTPO strongly encourages the use of ESBEs
in all of its contractual efforts.
A.     General

Regulations of the Department of Transportation relative to Non-Discrimination in Federally assisted
projects of the Department of Transportation (49 CFR Part 21), is made part of the Agreement. `Socially
and economically disadvantage' is defined as individuals who are citizens of the United States (or
lawfully permanent residents) and who are: "Black American," "Hispanic Americans," "Native
American," "Asian-Pacific Americans," "Asian-Indian Americans", "Women (regardless of race,
ethnicity, or origin); or "Other" (disadvantaged pursuant to Section 8 of the Small Business Act).

B.     Policy

It is the policy of SJTPO that Emerging Small Business Enterprises as defined in 49 CFR Part 23 shall
have the maximum opportunity to participate in the performance of a contract financed in whole or in
part with federal funds under this agreement. Consequently, the ESBE requirements of 49 CFR Part 23
applies to this agreement.

C.     ESBE Participation

The ESBE referred to herein is defined as a firm that has met the following criteria and obtained small
business certification as an ESBE by the State of New Jersey as follows:

       1.       A firm must meet the criteria for a small business as defined by the Small Business
                Administration in 13 CFR Part 121, which includes annual receipts from all revenues,
                including affiliate receipts which equates to the annual arithmetic average over the last
                three completed tax years, or by the number of employees.

       2.       The small business must be owned by individuals who do not exceed the personal net
                worth criteria established in 49 CFR Part 26 which is $750,000.

D.     Certified ESBE firms

A list of certified ESBE firms is compiled and is effective for contracts on a per calendar year basis. The
current list of certified ESBE firms is available on the website of the New Jersey Department of
Transportation (http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/business/civilrights/pdf/esbe_directory.pdf).

Firms who wish to be considered for ESBE certification are encouraged to contact Ms. Linda Errico at
the NJDOT Office of Civil Rights directly for information on the certification process. Once a firm is
certified, the federal portion of the dollar value of the contract or subcontract awarded to the ESBE is
generally counted toward the applicable ESBE goal. If state matching and/or non-matching funds are
also awarded to an ESBE, the total dollar value of the ESBE contract or subcontract may also be
counted toward the applicable ESBE goal.

E.     Consultants Documentation

If applicable, the Consultant must demonstrate sufficient reasonable efforts to meet the ESBE contract
goals. Additionally, SJTPO has a long-standing commitment to maximize business opportunities
available to disadvantaged and ESBE firms. The consultant's contract is subject to all federal, state, and
local laws, rules, and regulations, including but not limited to, non-discrimination in employment and
affirmative action for equal employment opportunity. The consultant's contract obligates the consultant
to aggressively pursue ESBEs for participation in the performance of contracts and subcontracts
financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. The consultant cannot discriminate on the basis of race,
color, national origin, or sex in the award and performance of federally assisted contracts. The
consultant contract specifies the ESBE goal and the ESBE participation rate for that contract, if
applicable. The prime consultant contract must document, in writing, all of the steps that led to any
selection of the ESBE firm(s). Prior to the award of a consultant contract, the consultant must
demonstrate sufficient reasonable efforts to utilize ESBE firms. SJTPO utilizes the NJDOT federally
approved ESBE goal for FY 2009 which is 15.7 percent.

If, at any time you intend to subcontract or modify any portion of the work already under contract, or
intend to purchase material or lease equipment not contemplated during the original preparation of your
cost proposal, you must notify SJTPO in writing. If, as a result of any subcontract, modification,
purchase order, or lease, the actual ESBE or participation rate for the consultant's contract is in danger
of falling below the agreed upon ESBE participation, then a request must be made for an ESBE Goal
Exemption Modification through SJTPO.

V.     EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PROVISION

A.     The Consultant and their subconsultant shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national
       origin, or sex in the award and performance of this contract.

B.     All potential Consultants must demonstrate a commitment to the effective implementation of an
       affirmative action plan or policy on equal employment opportunity. The potential Consultant
       must insure equal employment opportunity to all persons and not discriminate against any
       employee or applicant for employment opportunity because of race, color, religion, sex, national
       origin, physical disability, mental disorder, ancestry, marital status, criminal record, or political
       beliefs. The Consultant must uphold and operate in compliance with Executive Order 11246 and
       as amended in Executive Order 11375, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
       Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, and the Fair Employment Practices Act.

C.     In response to this Request for Qualifications/Request for Proposals, the Consultant should
       furnish a detailed statement relative to its Equal Employment Opportunity practices and any
       statistical employment information that it deems appropriate, relative to the composition of its
       work force or its subconsultants.

VI.    INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

A.     The consultant shall carry and maintain in full force and effect for the duration of this contract,
       and any supplement thereto, appropriate insurance. The Consultant shall submit to the SJTPO, a
       Certificate of Insurance indicating the existence of the coverage required. Policies shall be
       issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in the State of New Jersey; and
       approved by the SJTA.

B.     Insurance similar to that required by the Consultant shall be provided by or on behalf of all
       subconsultants to cover its operation(s) performed under this contract, and include in all
       subcontracts. The Consultant shall not be issued the Notice to Proceed until evidence of the

Atlantic County Route 629 (Ventnor Avenue) 




                                                                 Margate   Ventnor
                                                                                                                        

Introduction 
The  corridor  under  review  is  Atlantic  County  Route  629  (Ventnor  Avenue),  which  is  a  twolane,  Urban 
Principal Arterial. The segment of CR 629 considered in this review spans from Milepost 0.78 in Margate 
City,  which  represents  both  the  intersection  with  Coolidge  Avenue  as  well  as  the  border  with  Longport 
Boro,  the  segment  continues  through  the  Margate/Ventnor  border  (MP  2.43)  and  the  segment 
continues  to  milepost  3.39  in  Ventnor  City  where  CR  629  turns  at  Dorset  Avenue.  This  segment 
measures  2.61  miles  (approximately  13,700  feet)  in  length,  1.65  miles  in  Margate  and  0.96  miles  in 
Ventnor.  

About the Corridor 
In  the  corridor,  there  are  78  intersections  or  one  on  average  every  176  feet  (or  every  0.03  miles).  Of 
those  78  intersections  two  are  5leg  intersections,  46  are  full  4leg  intersections,  30  are  3leg 
intersections, and 20 are signalized intersections. In Ventnor there is a signalized intersection on average 
every  461  feet  (or  every  0.09  miles)  and  in  Margate,  on  average  every  968  feet  (or  every  0.18  miles). 
Through  the  entire  segment,  the  posted  speed  limit  is  25  miles  per  hour  and  the  pavement  area  is  53 
feet  in  width  no  shoulders.  There  is  room  for  onstreet  parallel  parking  throughout  most  of  the  corridor 
and  a  formal  leftturn  lane  (third  lane)  for  0.48  mile  from  Vendrome  Avenue  (MP  1.26)  to  Jerome 
Avenue/CR  563  (MP  1.74)  in  Margate  and  ample  space  for  informal  left  turn  movement  throughout  the 
remainder of the corridor.   

Sidewalks  continue  parallel  to  the  entire  length  of  the  segment  on  both  sides 
of  the  road.  Marked  pedestrian  crosswalks  are  present  in  much  of  the 
corridor,  however  with  little  consistency.  Crosswalks  cross  Ventnor  Avenue  at 
37  of  the  78  intersections,  25  of  which  are  the  more  visible  ladder  crosswalks 
and  12  are  standard  crosswalks.  53  of  the  78  intersections  have  crosswalks 
that  traverse  the  cross  street,  however  each  of  those  are  standard  crosswalks 
and many of those are substantially worn away. Most of the sidewalks appear 
to  have  ramps  at  the  crosswalks  throughout  the  corridor.  An  important  note 
about  pedestrian  accessibility  is  that  from  Vendome  Avenue  (MP  1.26)  to 
Mansfield  Avenue  (MP  1.62),  Ventnor  Avenue  has  parallel  onedirectional 
access  roads  on  each  side  of  the  street.  No  crosswalks  cross  those  roads  or 




                                                                                     Ventnor Avenue Corridor  |  1

the  cross  streets  in  that  area  and  sidewalks  that  serve  Ventnor  Avenue  in  this  segment  are  actually  on 
the outside of the access road, not directly adjacent to Ventnor Avenue. 

Crash Analysis 
Conditions 
This  analysis  of  the  performance  of  this  roadway  segment  includes  crash  data  gathered  from  2003  to 
2009,  shows  in  Figures  1  through  7,  below.  The  data  seem  to  clearly  eliminate  environmental  factors. 
From  2003  to  2009,  83  percent  of  injuries  occurred  during  clear  conditions  (Figure  1),  80  percent 
occurred in daylight (Figure 2), 84 percent occurred  on dry roads  (Figure 3), and all fatalities occurred in 
each of these conditions.

Crash Locations  
The  crash  data  show  that  58  percent  of  crash  injuries  in  this  corridor  occur  at  intersections  (Figure  4). 
However,  Figure  6  shows  that  73  percent  of  those  injuries  not  at  an  intersection  are  same  direction  ­ 
rear  end  crashes,  which  are  often  due  to  an  upcoming  intersection  movement  (i.e.  vehicle  turning, 
stopping,  waiting  in  the  intersection  queue)  where  the  vehicle  behind  simply  does  not  stop.  This  means 
that  at  as  many  as  88  percent  of  crashes  in  this  corridor  are  the  result  of  intersection  activity.  Of  the  78 


                                                                                          Ventnor Avenue Corridor  |  2

intersections,  20  are  signalized  (26  percent),  however  most  of  those  intersections  can  be  assumed  to 
have  the  highest  traffic  volume  and  therefore  a  larger  number  and  percentage  (42  percent)  of  injury 
crashes (Figure 5).

Crash Types 
Right Angle crashes are the most prevalent cause of crash injuries in unsignalized intersections, followed 
by rear end crashes, whereas at signalized intersections rear end crashes are the more common cause of 
injuries,  immediately  followed  by  right  angle  crashes.  A  significant  majority  of  nonintersection  injuries 
are caused by rear end crashes (73 percent).

Vehicles Involved 
With  only  two  fatalities  in  this  corridor,  drawing  patterns  from  fatality  statistics  can  be  difficult  if  not 
impossible;  however,  injury  data  seem  to  indicate  some  patterns.  For  example,  whereas  the  majority  of 
crash  injuries  (65  percent)  involved  two  vehicles  (Figure  8)  23  percent  only  involved  one  vehicle.  This 
should be looked into further to determine what may be causing this.

Time Factors 
The  data  indicate  some  strong  patterns  in  terms  of  when  crashes  occur,  which  points  strongly  to 
seasonal  factors.  44  percent  of  injuries  occur  in  the  middle  of  the  day,  which  likely  correlates  to  when 
the largest number of drivers go to the shore (Figure 9). 49 percent of all crash injuries for the year occur 
during  June,  July,  and  August,  the  months  with  the  majority  of  the  region's  outoftown  visitors.  This 
greatly  increases  congestion,  brings  many  drivers  unfamiliar  with  local  roads,  and  these  factors  likely 
agitate  drivers,  which  can  lead  to  additional  safety  concerns.  A  small  spike  also  occurs  on  Saturdays  (20 
percent), which would likely be the day with the highest number of shore visitors (Figure 11).

Yearly Crashes and Comparison to the Region 
Over  the  years,  the  numbers  of  annual  crash  injuries  appears  to  rise  and  fall  (Figure  12).  Although  it  is 
encouraging  to  see  the  numbers  drop,  particularly  in  2009  this  may  correlate  with  a  lower  number  of 
shore  visitors  due  to  the  economy  and  an  unusually  rainy  summer.  However,  the  2009  number  was  less 
than  half  the  number  in  2003,  which  represents  a  decline  much  greater  than  could  be  expected  to 
represent any economic decline in the region during that time. Unfortunately, even the best years (2006 
and  2009)  are  worse  in  terms  of  injuries  per  mile  (7.28  in  2006  and  7.66  in  2009)  than  should  be 




                                                                                       Ventnor Avenue Corridor  |  5

expected  from  the  regional  average  (6.92)  and  the  corridor  performs  much  worse  over  the  sevenyear 
period (9.96).

Pedestrian Crashes 
Nearly  70  percent  of  pedestrians  injured  along  the  Ventnor  Avenue  Corridor  occur  in  intersection 
crashes  (Figure  13).  Each  of  these  injuries  represent  a  failure  at  that  intersection,  whether  a  failure  of 
the  infrastructure  or  a  failure  of  the  users.  Of  those  injuries  at  intersections,  62  percent  occur  at 
signalized  intersections  (Figure  14),  despite  only  representing  only  26  percent  of  all  intersections  in  the 
corridor.  Though  it  is  certainly  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  injury  rate  would  be  higher  than  26 
percent,  as  these  intersections  can  be  assumed  to  have  higher  traffic  volumes,  only  42  percent  of 
vehicle  occupant  injuries  occur  at  signalized  intersections.  This  indicates  that  there  are  major  failures  at 
these intersections, which may include less than visible crosswalks, drivers making right turn movements 
on red that may conflict with crosswalk movements, lack of crosswalk signals at some intersections, etc.

Q&A for SJTPO FY 2011 ­ 2012 Road Safety Assessment 
Updated: Thursday, October 07, 2010 

Question 1: 
We would like to know if our MBE Certificate satisfies your requirements? 

    Answer 1: 
    To receive credit as a DBE firm during candidate selection, a consultant or subconsultant must be 
    listed as a DBE firm by the State of New Jersey. The State of New Jersey determines DBE status, not 
    SJTPO. The criteria for DBE are listed on this website: 
    http://www.state.nj.us/njbusiness/contracting/minority/dbe.shtml 
     
    Application to be considered for the New Jersey DBE firm list: 
    http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/business/civilrights/forms.shtm  
     
    A list of firms currently eligible can be found: 
    http://www.njucp.net/ 

Question 2: 
Have you conducted Road Safety Audits in the past?  If so, who provided these services and what 
standards did you use for the RSA? (NJDOT, local counties, or others)? 

    Answer 2: 
    Yes, we have, for several years, and OrthRodgers provided the services.  We do not prescribe the 
    standards; proposers should detail the procedures they will employ. 

Question 3: 
For the services associated with design services, since these are not defined yet, we cannot develop a 
fee schedule for the services.  Can we utilize time and materials basis for these services? 

    Answer 3: 
    No, unfortunately, our contracting protocols do not permit this. 

Question 4: 
Would SJTPO also provide a Crash Analysis Report for Cape May Road, similar to the Ventnor Avenue? 

    Answer 4: 
    No. 

Question 5: 
Approximately how many signals are included in on federal aid roads in North Wildwood, Wildwood, 
and Wildwood Crest, in Cape May County? 

    Answer 5: 
    We do not have that information compiled.

This traffic study presents the traffic impact analysis for the proposed Orangefair Residential
Development (the "Project") located in the City of Fullerton. The methodology and base
assumptions used in the analysis were established in conjunction with the City of Fullerton.




PROJECT LOCATION


The Project site (the "Site") is located at the northwest corner of Lemon Street & Orangefair
Avenue. The Site is bound by Orangethorpe Avenue to the north, Lemon Street to the east,
Orangefair Avenue to the south, and Harbor Boulevard to the west. The Site is located 0.20
miles north of the Riverside Freeway (SR-91), which provides primary regional access to the
Site. The Site is also located 1.0 miles south of the Fullerton Metrolink Station, which provides
rail service to Los Angeles, Oceanside, and Riverside. Access to the Site is provided via
driveways on Orangefair Avenue and Lemon Street.            The Site also lies adjacent to the
Orangefair Mall and its footprint currently serves as ground level parking on the southern portion
of the Orangefair Mall.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


Trammell Crow Residential is proposing to construct a 323-unit apartment complex adjacent to
the existing Orangefair Mall. Access to the Site will be provided via three existing driveways
located on Orangefair Avenue (two driveways) and Lemon Street (one driveway). The Project is
also proposing to construct two new multi-level parking garages to serve the future residents of
the Project, with additional shared parking for the shopping mall.      The Project site plan is
illustrated in Figure 1.




                                                                                                 1
STUDY SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY


As required by the City of Fullerton, the study intersections were analyzed using the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology (Transportation Research Board, 2000). The
Traffix software was used to calculate the overall intersection delay (seconds) and the resulting
level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative measure used to describe traffic flow conditions. Table
1 presents a description of the LOS categories, which range from excellent, nearly free-flow traffic
at LOS A to stop-and-go conditions at LOS F. For reporting of analysis results, the LOS is based
on average vehicular delay where the volume to capacity ration (V/C) is less than 1.000. If the
V/C ratio is greater than 1.000, the LOS is considered to be failing (LOS F).


The base assumptions and technical methodologies (i.e., trip generation, study locations, analysis
methodology, growth rates, related projects, etc.) were identified as part of the study approach
and were approved by the City's traffic engineer and planning department.


Additionally, variables used in the analyses, such as saturation flow rates, traffic signal timings,
and peak hour factors, were made consistent with the worksheet output from the City's General
Plan intersection calculations.


The traffic impact study evaluates the potential for impacts caused by the Project on the street
system surrounding the Project site. The following scenarios are analyzed for the Project:


       Existing Conditions (Year 2013) ­ The analysis of existing traffic conditions provides a
       basis for the assessment of existing plus project and future traffic conditions. The
       Existing Conditions analysis includes a description of key area streets and highways,
       traffic volumes, and current operating conditions.

       Intersection turning movement counts for weekday morning and afternoon peak hours
       were collected in November 2011, February 2012, and February 2013 and April 2013.
       Field review data (lane configurations, signal phasing, parking restrictions, etc.) for the
       analyzed intersections was collected in March 2013.

       Existing with Project Conditions (Year 2013) ­ The California Environmental Quality Act
       (CEQA) and the City of Fullerton require an evaluation of project traffic impacts on the
       existing environment as part of traffic impact analyses. This analysis evaluates the
       potential Project-related traffic impacts as compared to existing conditions.

       Future without Project Conditions (Opening Year 2016) ­ This analysis projects the
       future traffic growth and intersection operating conditions that could be expected as a




                                                                                                   2
         result of regional growth and related projects in the vicinity of the Site by year 2016. The
         Future without Project traffic conditions are projected by adding ambient traffic growth
         and traffic from related projects to existing conditions. This analysis provides the
         baseline conditions by which Project impacts are evaluated at the Project's opening
         year.

         Future with Project Conditions (Opening Year 2016) ­ This analysis identifies the
         potential incremental impacts of the Project at full buildout, prior to mitigation, on
         projected future traffic operating conditions by adding the Project-generated traffic to the
         Future without Project traffic forecasts (year 2016).

         Future without Project Conditions (Full Buildout Year 2030) ­ This analysis projects the
         future traffic growth and intersection operating conditions that could be expected as a
         result of regional growth and related projects in the vicinity of the Site by year 2030. The
         Future without Project traffic conditions are projected by adding ambient traffic growth
         and traffic from related projects to existing conditions. This analysis provides the
         baseline conditions by which Project impacts are evaluated at full buildout.

         Future with Project Conditions (Full Buildout Year 2030) ­ This analysis identifies the
         potential incremental impacts of the Project at full buildout, prior to mitigation, on
         projected future traffic operating conditions by adding the Project-generated traffic to the
         Future without Project traffic forecasts (year 2030).




Impact Criteria and Significance Thresholds


Based on our discussions with the City of Fullerton, a significant traffic impact occurs when the
analysis determines that traffic attributable to a proposed project decreases intersection
performance during the peak hour from an acceptable LOS (A, B, C, or D) to a deficient LOS (E
or F).




Congestion Management Program Analysis


The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is a state-mandated program that serves as the
monitoring and analytical basis for transportation funding decisions in the county made through
the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) and State Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP) processes. The CMP requires that a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)
be performed for all CMP Highway System (CMPHS) intersections where a Project would add
2,400 daily trips or 1,600 daily trips if the Project has direct access to the CMPHS.




                                                                                                    3
The CMP required for the Project has been performed, in Chapter 9, in accordance with the TIA
guidelines referenced in the Congestion Management Program Preparation Manual (Orange
County Transportation Authority [OCTA], 2011).

A comprehensive data collection effort was undertaken to develop a detailed description of
existing conditions in the Project Study Area. The existing conditions analysis relevant to this
study includes an assessment of the existing street system and an analysis of traffic volumes
and current operating conditions.




STUDY AREA


The Study Area generally includes a geographic area approximately two miles (north-south) by
approximately two miles (east-west). This Study Area was established in consultation with the
City of Fullerton and by reviewing the existing intersection/corridor operations, Project peak hour
vehicle trip generation, the anticipated distribution of Project vehicular trips, and the potential
impacts of Project traffic.


A traffic analysis study area generally comprises those locations with the greatest potential to
experience significant traffic impacts, as defined by the lead agency, due to a project. In the traffic
engineering practice, a study area generally includes those intersections that are:

    1. Immediately adjacent or in close proximity to the project site
    2. In the vicinity of the project site that are documented to have current or projected future
       adverse operational issues
    3. In the vicinity of the project site that are forecast to experience a relatively greater
       percentage of project-related vehicular turning movements (e.g., at freeway ramp
       intersections)

The Project Study Area was designed to ensure that all potentially significantly impacted
intersections, prior to any mitigation, were analyzed, and the boundary of the Study Area was
extended, as necessary, to confirm that there were no significant impacts at or outside the
boundary of the Study Area by reviewing the Project traffic's travel patterns.




                                                                                                      8
A total of 16 signalized intersections in the Study Area were identified by the City of Fullerton for
detailed analysis of the above conditions. Of the 16 intersections, 14 are located within the City
of Fullerton and two are located within the City of Anaheim. Also, the east side of Lemon Street
south of Freedom Avenue is within the City of Anaheim. Four of the 15 intersections located
within the City of Fullerton are freeway ramp locations and share jurisdiction with Caltrans. The
following 16 intersections were selected for analysis:


   1. Euclid Street & Orangethorpe Avenue
   2. Harbor Boulevard & Chapman Avenue
   3. Harbor Boulevard & Commonwealth Avenue
   4. Harbor Boulevard & Orangethorpe Avenue
   5. Harbor Boulevard & Orangefair Avenue
   6. Harbor Boulevard & SR-91 Westbound Ramps
   7. Harbor Boulevard & SR-91 Eastbound Ramps
   8. Harbor Boulevard & La Palma Avenue
   9. Lemon Street & Chapman Avenue
   10. Lemon Street & Commonwealth Avenue
   11. Lemon Street & Orangethorpe Avenue
   12. Lemon Street & Orangefair Avenue
   13. Lemon Street & SR-91 Westbound Ramps
   14. Lemon Street & SR-91 Eastbound Ramps

Figure 2 illustrates the location of the Site in relation to the surrounding street system and the 16
study intersections.




EXISTING STREET SYSTEM


The existing street system in the Study Area consists of a regional roadway system including
freeways, major arterials, primary arterials, secondary arterials, local collector streets, and
residential streets. The secondary arterials, local collectors, and selected residential streets in
the Study Area offer sub-regional and local access and circulation opportunities.             These



                                                                                                    9
transportation facilities generally provide two to six travel lanes and usually allow parking on
either side of the street. Typically, the speed limits range between 25 and 45 miles per hour
(mph) on the major, primary, and secondary arterials, collector, and local collector streets and
between 55 and 65 mph on freeways.




Freeway System


The Project Site is located 0.20 miles north of the SR-91, which runs generally in the east-west
direction and provides primary regional access to the Project Site.

EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


This section presents the existing peak hour turning movement traffic volumes for the
intersections analyzed in the study, describes the methodology used to assess the traffic




                                                                                                     12
conditions at each intersection, and analyzes the resulting operating conditions at each
intersection indicating average vehicular delay, V/C ratios, and LOS.




Existing Traffic Volumes


Intersection turning movement counts were conducted at the 16 study intersections during the
weekday morning and afternoon peak hours in November 2011, February 2012, and February
and April 2013. Intersection turning movement count worksheets are provided in Appendix B.
Traffic count data which is less than 2 years old is considered acceptable for use in analysis.
The City provided a portion of the count data for the Study Area, while the remainder of the data
was newly collected. For older data, in order to reflect year 2013 conditions, traffic volumes
conducted in 2011 were increased by 1.00% for through movements and 0.50% for turning
movements; and traffic counts conducted in 2012 were increased by 0.50% for major
movements and 0.25% for minor movements. This methodology ensures older counts are
equitably balanced with more current counts. All data used in this study is less than 2 years old.


The existing traffic volumes for the 16 study intersections are illustrated in Figure 3 and were
analyzed to determine the existing operating conditions at the 16 study intersections.




Existing Intersection Levels of Service


Table 2 summarizes the morning and afternoon average delays and the corresponding LOS for
each of the 16 study intersections under Existing Conditions. As summarized in Table 2, all 16
study intersections operate at LOS D or better during both the morning and afternoon peak
hours.


The LOS calculation worksheets can be found in Appendix C.

                                  Future without Project Traffic Conditions


Estimates of future traffic conditions both with and without the Project were developed to evaluate
the potential impacts of the Project on the local street system.      This discussion details the
assumptions used to develop the Future without Project conditions (opening year 2016 and year
2030).




CEQA GUIDELINES REGARDING FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS


The forecast of Future without Project conditions was prepared in accordance with procedures
outlined in Section 15130 of Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality
Act, Chapter 3, Title 14, California Code of Regulations (California Natural Resources Agency,
amended July 27, 2007). Specifically, Guidelines provides two options for developing the
cumulative traffic volume forecast:


         "(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
         cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of
         the [lead] agency, or

         (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted general plan or related
         planning document, or in a prior environmental document which has been adopted
         or certified, which described or evaluated regional or area wide conditions
         contributing to the cumulative impact. Any such planning document shall be
         referenced and made available to the public at a location specified by the lead
         agency."

Accordingly, the traffic analysis provides a highly conservative estimate of Future without Project
traffic volumes as it incorporates both the "A" and "B" options outlined in Guidelines for purposes
of developing the forecast.




                                                                                                 18
FUTURE BASE IMPROVEMENTS


No improvements to the existing circulation system are assumed prior to analysis, including lane
configurations and traffic controls.




FUTURE WITHOUT PROJECT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS


The Future without Project traffic projections reflect growth in traffic over existing conditions
from two sources. The first source is the ambient growth in traffic, which reflects increases in
traffic due to regional growth and development outside the Study Area. The second source is
growth due to traffic generated by projects which are proposed, approved, or under construction
within and in the vicinity of the Study Area (collectively, the "Related Projects").




Ambient Traffic Growth


Existing traffic is expected to increase as a result of regional growth and development. Based
on historic trends and in consultation with the City of Fullerton, growth factors of 1.50% for
through movements and 0.80% for turning movements were used to increase the existing traffic
volumes to reflect the effects of regional growth and development by the opening year 2016.
Growth factors of 10% for through movements and 5.0% for turn movements were applied to
the existing traffic volumes to reflect the effects of regional growth and development by the full
buildout year 2030. These growth factors were supplied by the City of Fullerton General Plan
traffic model.




Related Projects


In accordance with CEQA requirements, this study considers the effects of the Project in
relation to other developments either proposed, approved, or under construction in the Study
Area and expected to be implemented prior to the buildout date of the Project. Related Project
information was obtained from the City of Fullerton. Though the ambient growth factor described
above is intended to account for total traffic growth within the Study Area, the effect of Related



                                                                                                19
Project traffic is included as well, both to maintain a conservative analysis of future conditions
and to include the specific effects of known future traffic generators at nearby study
intersections. Related Project traffic forecasts for both the opening year 2016 and full buildout
year 2030 were developed from the City of Fullerton General Plan traffic model data for each of
the 16 study intersections. The following Related Projects were included in the traffic forecasts:


       Citrus Park Specific Plan
       Euclid Car Wash
       Valencia Grove Townhomes at Amerige Heights
       Fullerton Townhomes on Orangethorpe


The resulting Future without Project peak hour traffic volumes for opening year 2016 and full
buildout year 2030 are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5.




FUTURE WITHOUT PROJECT INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


Similar to the analysis presented in Chapter 2, the study intersections were analyzed using the
HCM methodology required by the City of Fullerton.




Future without Project (Opening Year 2016) Intersection Levels of Service


Table 3 summarizes the morning and afternoon average delays and the corresponding LOS for
each of the 16 study intersections under Future without Project (opening year 2016) conditions.
As summarized in Table 3, all 16 study intersections operate at LOS D or better during both the
morning and afternoon peak hours.




Future without Project (Full Buildout Year 2030) Intersection Levels of Service


Table 4 summarizes the morning and afternoon average delays and the corresponding LOS for
each of the 16 study intersections under Future without Project (full buildout year 2030)
conditions. As summarized in Table 4, nine of the 16 study intersections operate at LOS D or

This Chapter describes the assumptions and methodology used in developing the traffic
volumes associated with the Project within the Study Area.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION


As described in Chapter 1, the Project proposes to construct a 323-unit apartment complex
adjacent to the existing Orangefair Mall. The Project will contain a variety of market rate
apartment units that will range in size from studios to multiple-bedroom units. Access to the Site
will be provided via three existing shopping mall driveways, two driveways located on
Orangefair Avenue and one driveway located on Lemon Street.           An existing driveway on the
extreme southeastern corner of the shopping mall will be eliminated with the Project. The
Project is also proposing to construct two new multi-level parking structures to accommodate
the future residents of the Project.




PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


The first step of the forecasting process is trip generation, which estimates the total arriving and
departing vehicular trips generated by the Project on a peak hour and daily basis by applying the
appropriate vehicle trip generation equations, or rates, to the density of Project development.


The second step of the forecasting process is trip distribution, which identifies the origins and
destinations of inbound and outbound Project trips. These origins and destinations are typically
based on demographics and existing/anticipated travel patterns in the Study Area. Localized
routes of travel through the Study Area are developed based on existing traffic patterns and
relative travel times on various corridors.




                                                                                                  28
The third step of the forecasting process is traffic assignment. This involves applying the traffic
generated by the Project (the trip generation) to the intersections and street segments in the
Study Area according to the projected trip distribution patterns. These traffic volumes can then be
added to existing or future background conditions to represent traffic volumes once the Project is
complete.


With the forecasting process complete and Project traffic assignments developed, the impact of
the proposed Project is isolated by comparing operational (i.e., LOS) conditions at the study
intersections using expected future traffic volumes without and with forecast Project traffic. The
need for site-specific and/or cumulative local area traffic improvements can then be evaluated and
the significance of the Project's impacts identified.




Project Trip Generation


The most recent trip generation rate from the Trip Generation, 9th Edition (Institute of
Transportation Engineers [ITE], 2012) for Land Use Code 220 (Apartments) was used to
develop the Project trip generation estimates. A mixed-use trip generation credit was calculated
for the Project by using an ITE mixed-use and internal capture spreadsheet. This process
adjusts vehicle trips based on the potential for walking to adjacent uses or to account for
multiple destination trips. The mixed-use credit is applied to reduce double-counting of vehicles.


The ITE mixed-use output estimates an 11% reduction of Project traffic in the morning peak
hour and 28% in the evening.         However, to remain conservative, 10% was applied to the
morning and 15% to the evening. The results of the ITE mixed-use analysis is provided in
Appendix D.


As summarized in Table 5, the Project is anticipated to generate 2,081 daily trips, with 146 trips

outbound) during the afternoon peak hour.

Project Trip Distribution


Project traffic volumes both entering and exiting the Site have been distributed to the local street
system based on the location of nearby commercial and employment centers, characteristics of
the street system serving the Project Site, and land uses associated with each of the Project
driveways. The general distribution pattern was reviewed and approved by the City of Fullerton.


Project traffic was assigned to the surrounding street system based on the following distribution
pattern:


     15% was assigned to/from the north on Harbor Boulevard and Lemon Street
     25% was assigned to/from the east on SR-91 Eastbound
     5% was assigned to/from the east on Orangethorpe Avenue
     15% was assigned to/from the south on Harbor Boulevard and Lemon Street
     35% was assigned to/from the west on SR-91 Westbound
     5% was assigned to/from the west on Orangethorpe Avenue


The general and detailed distribution of Project traffic through the study intersections are
illustrated in Figure 6.




Project Trip Assignment


The trip distribution pattern was applied to the trip generation estimates summarized in Table 5
to develop the Project-only traffic through the 16 study intersections. Figure 7 illustrates the
Project-only peak hour traffic volumes at the driveways and study intersections.

                                                Existing with Project Conditions


This Chapter describes the evaluation of Project traffic on the existing environment. The
analysis of year 2013 corresponds with the Existing conditions data and analysis presented in
Chapter 2. The Existing with Project conditions are defined by the traffic volumes, roadways,
and intersection configurations that exist in year 2013.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT (YEAR 2013) TRAFFIC VOLUMES


The Project-only traffic volumes for the Project described in Chapter 5 and shown in Figure 7
were added to the Existing traffic volumes show in Figure 3. The resulting volumes are
illustrated in Figure 8. They represent Existing with Project conditions after full buildout of the
Project in year 2013. Although the Project is not expected to be constructed until 2016, this
methodology is consistent with the required Existing with Project analysis scenario.




EXISTING WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


Table 6 summarizes the results of the Existing with Project analysis at the study intersections.
As shown in Table 6, all 16 of the study intersections operate at LOS D or better during both the
morning and afternoon peak hours with the addition of Project-related traffic.

                                                     Future with Project Conditions


This Chapter describes the evaluation of the Project traffic on future background traffic. The
analysis year of 2016 corresponds with the anticipated opening year of the Project, and the
analysis year of 2030 corresponds with the full buildout year of the Project. All future background
traffic growth (i.e., ambient and related project traffic growth) presented in Chapter 3 is assumed
in this analysis.




FUTURE WITH PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES


Future with Project (Opening Year 2016) Traffic Volumes


The Project-only traffic volumes described in Chapter 5 and shown in Figure 7 were added to the
Future without Project (opening year 2016) traffic volumes shown in Figure 4. The resulting traffic
volumes are presented in Figure 9 and represent the Future with Project (opening year 2016)
conditions, i.e., future conditions after the opening of the Project in year 2016.




Future with Project (Full Buildout Year 2030) Traffic Volumes


The Project-only traffic volumes described in Chapter 5 and shown in Figure 7 were added to the
Future without Project (full buildout year 2030) traffic volumes shown in Figure 5. The resulting
traffic volumes are presented in Figure 10 and represent the Future with Project full (buildout year
2030) conditions, i.e., future conditions after full buildout of the Project in year 2030.

FUTURE WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION OPERATIONS


Future with Project (Opening Year 2016) Intersection LOS


Table 7 summarizes the results of the Future with Project (opening year 2016) analysis at the
study intersections. As shown in Table 7, all 16 study intersections operate at LOS D or better
during both the morning and afternoon peak hours under Future with Project (opening year
2016) conditions.




Future with Project (Full Buildout Year 2030) Intersection LOS


Table 8 summarizes the results of the Future with Project (full buildout year 2030) analysis at
the study intersections. As shown in Table 8, nine of the 16 study intersections operate at LOS
D or better during both the morning and afternoon peak hours under Future with Project (full
buildout year 2030) conditions. The remaining seven study intersections operate at LOS E or F
during at least one of the analyzed peak hours.

The City of El Centro coordinated the preparation of an Initial Study and Mitigated Negative
Declaration for the proposed Adams Avenue Indoor Sports Complex. The proposed project
includes the replacement of the aquatic recreational facility with a multi-purpose indoor field
complex (see Initial Study Exhibit 5, Conceptual Site Plan). The plans include demolition of two
existing swimming pools, bathroom/shower facilities, shaded bleachers, and a large façade facing
North 8th Street. The site will be graded to street level (approximately 4 feet maximum cut,
approximately 30 inches over-excavated soil preparation under flat footings).

The project site location is urban, and surrounded on all sides by development. To the north are
commercial land uses, northeast are multi-family land uses, east is a public park, southeast is
conventional single-family homes, south and west are commercial land uses (see Initial Study
Exhibit 3 ­ Local Aerial).

COMMENTS RECEIVED ON THE DRAFT INITIAL STUDY/NOTICE OF INTENT
        TO ADOPT A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION

The City of El Centro, acting as the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) prepared an Initial Study and Notice of Intent to Adopt a Mitigated Negative
Declaration (IS/NOI). The IS/NOI circulated for public review for a period of 30 days between
April 16 and May 15. One comment letter was submitted to the City and is included herein,
along with responses to comments contained in the letter.

A comment letter was received from the following agency:

             Letter A: Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD), May 22, 2009.

The comment from the ICAPCD required that a minor revision be made to the Draft Initial Study.
This revision has been made to the document and the response to the comment has been provided
to the agency.

Letter A           Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD), May 22, 2009.

Comment A-1 The ICAPCD noted that the Air Quality description on page 3 states that, "air
            quality is primarily affected by vehicle, agricultural burning and processing
            emissions..." ICAPCD further added that, "Although combustion emissions
                              from stationary sources and vehicle emissions can significantly impact the Air
                              Quality in our region, agricultural burning has a deminimus finding."
                              Therefore, since the project site is within a downtown commercial district of
                              the City and that agricultural burning would only occur in areas well outside of
                              the City and the project site, the term has thus been deleted from the
                              discussion.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

1.5 - Purpose

The City of El Centro, as Lead Agency, has prepared this Initial Study (IS) to evaluate potential
environmental impacts associated with the proposed demolition of the aquatic recreational facilities
and the development of the Adams Avenue Indoor Sports Complex ("project" or "proposed project");
and to present strategies that will lessen such impacts. This document satisfies the requirements set
forth in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and is the environmental document
prepared pursuant to the provisions of CEQA, Public Resources Code 21000, et. seq. for
consideration in conjunction with the proposed project. City officials and responsible agencies will
use this document as an aid for making sound planning decisions.

1.6 - Project Location

The project site is located in the City of El Centro, in the County of Imperial, California
(See Exhibit 1 ­ Regional Location). Specifically, the project location is on the southeast corner of
Adams Avenue and North 8th Street. Its boundaries are Adams Avenue to the north, 7th Street to the
east, Park Avenue to the south, and North 8th Street to the west (See Exhibit 2 ­ Project Vicinity).
The project site is a 2.35-acre parcel of developed land identified as (APN) 053-031-004 that is zoned
LU, limited use. The location is urban, and surrounded on all sides by development. To the north is
the Premier Inn, northeast is high density residential housing; east is a public park, southeast is
conventional single-family homes, and southwest are commercial businesses (See Exhibit 3 ­ Local
Aerial).

1.7 - Project Description

According to the City's Parks and Recreation Master Plan (September 18, 2008) the Adams Avenue
Indoor Sports Complex is the first project recommended for Phase I (within the next 5 years) of the
City's long-range plan for parks and recreation facilities. The Conrad Harrison Youth Center' will
remain at its current location. Redevelopment plans are proposed to work around the gymnasium
building. Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4 show the existing conditions on the project site.

The proposed project includes the replacement of the existing aquatic recreational facility with a
multi-purpose indoor sports field complex (see Exhibit 5, Conceptual Site Plan). The plans include
demolition of two existing swimming pools, bathroom/shower facilities, shaded bleachers, and a large
façade facing North 8th Street. The site will be graded to street level (approximately 4 feet maximum
cut) to allow for proper site drainage.

The indoor sports complex includes a multi-sport field, courts and bleachers, all enclosed within a
200-foot by 110-foot structural membrane (22,000 square feet), playing fields artificial turf, and

landscaping around the site will be low water using drought-tolerant plants. The project also includes
construction of a one-story structure that will be the main entrance for the existing gymnasium and
the new sports complex. This new structure will include bathroom/shower facilities, an office, a
kitchen/concession stand, and ticket booth and maintenance storage with covered walkways
connecting to the existing gym and the proposed sports complex. Proposed parking will consist of
118 off-street parking stalls located abutting perpendicular to the north side of Park Avenue, along the
south side (existing) of the gymnasium, and east of the existing gym.

The project is proposed to be built in three phases.

                     Phase I is the installation of the membrane structure, covered walkways and the
                        construction of the one-story structure. Most cut and fill grading will be completed
                        during this phase, and 26 parking spaces will be installed along Park Avenue;

                     Phase II includes the installation of the sports equipment and artificial turf in the
                        membrane structure; and

                     Phase III includes the development of the parking lot proposed along North 7 Street
                                                                                                        th


                        and off-street parking along Park Avenue.

In addition to the project description presented above, all zoning ordinances, permit requirements of
responsible agencies, and the mitigation measures included in this environmental document will be
made conditions of approval (COA).

1.8 - Intended Uses of this Document

This document satisfies CEQA requirements for environmental evaluation of a proposed project
where a discretionary action is required. In this case, the discretionary action is a Site Plan Review
Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for operation of the planned facilities. CEQA requires that any
qualifying project on which a municipality needs to exercise discretionary authority must first prepare
an assessment/evaluation of the environment to determine the potential impacts of the project. This
IS and Notice of Intent (NOI) to Adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) are informational
documents intended to inform the City of El Centro decision makers, responsible agencies, and
interested parties of the potential environmental effects of the proposed project and allow them to
provide comments to be considered by the City Council in their review and consideration of the
project.

1.9 - Environmental Setting

A field visit and windshield survey was conducted on January 7, 2009 by MBA staff to document
existing conditions on the site and in the general area. Exhibit 6 ­ Site Photographs is representative
of the photograph record collected on that day. The following is a description of the existing
conditions.

Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration                                              Introduction


Aesthetics - The site is set in an urban area characterized by low profile structures and mature
vegetation. The site character blends well with the surrounding businesses and residences. The
existing façade of the recreation building reflects the style of the pioneer days of the City, and was
built in 1982 to emulate a historic structure that had been destroyed at an earlier date. The Conrad
Harrison Youth Center gym is the tallest and largest building on the block. The State of California
Youth Authority (CYA) funded it and the building was dedicated in 1994.

Agricultural Resources ­ Although El Centro houses agricultural processing facilities, the project
area is urban and does not contain any agricultural resources.

Air Quality ­ The project area is currently in State non-attainment status for the criteria pollutants
Ozone, particulate matter (PM). Air quality is primarily affected by vehicle, agricultural burning and
processing emissions that are trapped by an inversion layer in the atmosphere. An Air Quality
Attainment Plan is currently being implemented b7 the County's Air Pollution Control District
(APCD) that contains both standard and discretionary minimization measures. There are no point
source emitters affecting the project.

Biological Resources ­ Due to the urban environment, there are no sensitive biological resources in
the project site or surroundings.

Cultural Resources ­ The site was reviewed by an MBA archaeologist who specializes in historic
architecture. Due to prior disturbances and modern developments onsite, there is very low potential
to find cultural resources. There are no known historic, prehistoric or paleontological resources
onsite.

Geology/Soils ­ Although no soil borings have been done on the project site, the entire City rests on a
bed of deep lacustrine (lakebed) deposits. Although the soil is suitable for agriculture, it presents
challenges for engineers on construction projects. The soils of this type typically need conditioning
to support structural footings including reinforced foundations with steel to prevent warping and
buckling.

Hazards/Hazardous Materials ­ The prior land use as a community swimming pool included pool
chemical storage, regulated by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However,
no known chemical spills have occurred onsite.

Hydrology and Water Quality ­ Currently the site drains to the east of the premises. The site drains
into storm drains off site.

Land Use ­ The aquatic facility portion of the existing complex is not in service. However, the
Conrad Harrison Youth Center gymnasium continues to operate under normal business hours.

Mineral Resources ­ There are no known mineral resources onsite, and extraction of minerals will be
inappropriate at the location.

Noise ­ Land uses in the project area are primarily commercial, which is not considered noise
sensitive; however, there is a residential neighborhood to the south. The greatest source of noise in
the vicinity is attributed to traffic along Adams Avenue and 8th Street.

Population/Housing ­ Multiple family housing exists in the project area. The project site is located
in the downtown region with a population density greater than average for the City as a whole.

Public Services ­ El Centro provides a full compliment of public services to the project area, which
currently provides services to the Conrad Harrison Youth Center.

Recreation ­ The project site is currently in stages of dilapidation with the closure of the site's
aquatic swimming pool, and with only the Youth Center remaining operational to the public.

Traffic ­ Current access to the project site is entered from off of Park Avenue (a 2-lane collector)
between North 7th Street North 8Th Street. The project site also abuts Adams Avenue to the north,
which is a 4-lane Divided Arterial.

Utilities/Service Systems ­ A full compliment of utilities are available onsite.

  1.      Aesthetics
         Would the project:
         a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic
            vista?
         b) Substantially damage scenic resources,
            including, but not limited to, trees, rock
            outcroppings, and historic building within a
            state scenic highway?
         c) Substantially degrade the existing visual
            character or quality of the site and its
            surroundings?
         d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare
            which would adversely affect day or nighttime
            views in the area?
  2.      Agriculture Resources
         In determining whether impacts to agricultural resources are significant environmental effects, lead
         agencies may refer to the California Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment Model (1997)
         prepared by the California Department of Conservation as an optional model to use in assessing
         impacts on agriculture and farmland.
         Would the project:
         a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
            Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland),
            as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the
            Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
            (FMMP) of the California Resources Agency, to
            non-agricultural use?
         b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural
            use, or a Williamson Act contract?
         c) Involve other changes in the existing
            environment which, due to their location or
            nature, could result in conversion of Farmland,
            to non-agricultural use?
  3.      Air Quality
         Where available, the significance criteria established by the applicable air quality management or air
         pollution control district may be relied upon to make the following determinations.
         Would the project:
         a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the
            applicable air quality plan?
         b) Violate any air quality standard or contribute
            substantially to an existing or projected air
            quality violation?

         b) Displace substantial numbers of existing
            housing, necessitating the construction of
            replacement housing elsewhere?
         c) Displace substantial numbers of people
            necessitating the construction of replacement
            housing elsewhere?
  13. Public Services
         Would the project result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or
         physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities,
         the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain
         acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for any of the public services:
         a) Fire Protection?
         b) Police Protection?
         c) Schools?
         d) Parks?
         e) Other public facilities?
  14. Recreation
         a) Would the project increase the use of existing
            neighborhood and regional parks or other
            recreational facilities such that substantial
            physical deterioration of the facility would
            occur or be accelerated?
         b) Does the project include recreational facilities or
            require the construction or expansion of
            recreational facilities, which might have an
            adverse physical effect on the environment?
  15. Transportation / Traffic
         Would the project:
         a) Cause an increase in traffic, which is substantial
            in relation to the existing traffic load and
            capacity of the street system (i.e., result in a
            substantial increase in either the number of
            vehicle trips, the volume to capacity ratio on
            roads, or congestion at intersections)?
         b) Exceed, either individually or cumulatively, a
            level of service standard established by the
            county congestion management agency for
            designated roads or highways?
         c) Result in a change in air traffic patterns,
            including either an increase in traffic levels or a
            change in location that results in substantial
            safety risks?

         d) Substantially increase hazards due to a design
            feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous
            intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm
            equipment)?
         e) Result in inadequate emergency access?
         f) Result in inadequate parking capacity?
         g) Conflict with adopted policies, plans or
            programs supporting alternative transportation
            (e.g. bus turnouts, bicycle racks)?
  16. Utilities / Service Systems
         Would the project:
         a) Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of
            the applicable Regional Water Quality Control
            Board (RWQCB)?
         b) Require or result in the construction of new
            water or wastewater treatment facilities or
            expansion of existing facilities, the construction
            of which could cause significant environmental
            effects?
         c) Require or result in the construction of new
            storm water drainage facilities or expansion of
            existing facilities, the construction of which
            could cause significant environmental effects?
         d) Have sufficient water supplies available to serve
            the project from existing entitlements and
            resources, or are new or expanded entitlements
            needed?
         e) Result in a determination by the wastewater
            treatment provider, which serves or may serve
            the project that it has adequate capacity to serve
            the project's projected demand in addition to the
            provider's existing commitments?
         f) Be served by a landfill with sufficient permitted
            capacity to accommodate the project's solid
            waste disposal needs?
         g) Comply with federal, state, and local statutes
            and regulations related to solid waste?
  17. Mandatory Findings of Significance
         a) Does the project have the potential to degrade
            the quality of the environment, substantially
            reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species,
            cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below
            self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a
            plant or animal community, reduce the number
            or restrict the range of a rare or endangered

                                                             Environmental Determination


On the basis of this initial evaluation:

             I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment,
             and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

             I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
             there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been
             made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE
             DECLARATION will be prepared.

             I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an
             ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.

             I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or "potentially
             significant unless mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one effect 1) has been
             adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and 2) has
             been addressed by mitigation measure based on the earlier analysis as described on attached
             sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but it must analyze only the
             effects that remain to be addressed.

             I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
             because all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earlier EIR
             or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards, and (b) have been
             avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION, including
             revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed upon the proposed project, nothing further
             is required.

SECTION 3: DISCUSSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION

3.5 - Aesthetics

Would the project:

             a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?

                    Less than Significant Impact: Scenic vistas in the region are typically thought of as
                    landscape views of open space and distant mountains. There are no scenic vistas in the
                    project area since the downtown area's focus is predominately on architectural and
                    cultural themes. State Highway 86 (Adams Avenue), which runs east to west along the
                    north side of the project site, is not registered, nor eligible for State Scenic Highway
                    status in the project area. Therefore, adverse impacts to scenic vistas are considered less
                    than significant.

             b) Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock
                outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway?

                    No Impact: As discussed in Section 1a, there is no state scenic highway in the project
                    vicinity, and no such qualifying scenic resources exist; therefore, there will be no impact.

             c) Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its
                surroundings?

                    Less than Significant Impact: Exhibit 6, Site Photographs, show existing conditions on
                    and adjacent to the project site. Downtown El Centro depends on the old town and
                    frontier elements of its architecture for its character. The existing façade onsite (see
                    Exhibit 6, Photograph 2) contributes to the theme-based ambiance and that demolition
                    could affect the visual character of downtown as viewed from Adams Avenue traveling
                    east. However, the façade is not a genuine historic landmark, but a rendition of a
                    previous, older landmark that was destroyed in an earthquake. Nevertheless, the project
                    is located within a Visual Enhancement (VE) and Façade Improvement Plan (FIP) area of
                    City. This will require the design of the project to conform to VE and FIP development
                    standards and will be subject to design review. Therefore, impacts of the proposed
                    project on visual character will be less than significant.

             d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day or
                nighttime views in the area?

                    Less than Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated: The project has the
                    potential to cause light to spill over onto adjacent multifamily residential dwellings

                    located south of the project site. The City proposes to install overhead lighting for the
                    indoor field and to utilize external wall mounted lighting from the existing gymnasium.
                    Existing pole-mounted lighting bordering the tennis courts will also be utilized for the
                    project's proposed east-end parking lot (See Exhibit 4). Any modification to existing
                    external lighting involving the increase of ambient light sources at the project site will
                    require a photometric analysis and containment of light source emissions within the
                    boundaries of the project site.

                    MM AES-1: Any modification to the project's existing Lighting Plan shall require a
                              photometric analysis prior to approval of final building plans. External
                              lighting modifications, if proposed, shall be energy-efficient and shielded,
                              filtered, or recessed so that direct glare and reflections are contained within
                              the boundaries of the project, and shall be directed downward and away
                              from adjoining properties and from public right-of-ways or open space
                              areas.

                    With mitigation incorporated, the proposed project will have a less than significant
                    impact to aesthetic resources.

3.6 - Agricultural Resources

In determining whether impacts to agricultural resources are significant environmental effects, lead
agencies may refer to the California Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment Model (1997)
prepared by the California Department of Conservation as an optional model to use in assessing
impacts on agriculture and farmland. For the proposed project, no modeling was performed because
there was no question that the property is not used for agricultural production.

Would the project:

a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland),
   as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
   (FMMP) of the California Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?

      No Impact: There is no Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide
      Importance on or adjacent to the proposed project; therefore, there will be no impact in this
      regard.

b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a Williamson Act contract?

      No Impact: The project site is not zoned for agricultural use and is not under contract for
      agricultural land use; therefore, there will be no impact.

c) Involve other changes in the existing environment, which, due to their location or nature, could
   result in conversion of Farmland, to non-agricultural use?

      No Impact: Refer to 2a and 2b, above.

3.7 - Air Quality

Where available, the significance criteria established by the applicable air quality management or air
pollution control district may be relied upon to make the following determinations. The project is
located within the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD) jurisdiction. Therefore,
guidance and thresholds recommended by the ICAPCD are utilized in the analysis.

For background information on pollutants, greenhouse gases, and regulatory information, please refer
to the Air Quality Background Information and Model Output in Appendix A.

In order to determine the type of analysis required, the ICAPCD recommends quantifying operational
emissions to determine if the emissions are below the recommended thresholds of significance.
Operational emissions as estimated using the URBEMIS2007 model for the year 2010 are shown in
Table 1, Operational Emissions (Summer, Unmitigated). The emissions shown in the table are
summer emissions, which are generally greater than winter emissions; so only summer emissions are

shown in the table. Winter emissions are included in Appendix A. As shown in Table 1, emissions
are below the ICAPCD significance thresholds. Therefore, a comprehensive air quality assessment is
not required to address air quality impacts for this project. The project will comply with the
requirements set forth in the ICAPCD CEQA Handbook.

During demolition and construction, there will be emissions from demolition, grading, building,
asphalt paving, and architectural coating. Exhaust emissions (VOC, NOx, CO, SOx, PM10, and PM2.5)
will be generated by fuel combustion from off-road construction equipment, portable auxiliary
equipment, and worker commute trips. There will also be fugitive dust (PM10 and PM2.5) from soil
disturbance. The ICAPCD CEQA Handbook recommends a qualitative analysis and implementation
of its suggested mitigation measures for Tier I projects. Therefore, construction emissions are not
estimated.

Would the project:

a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan?

      Less Than Significant Impact.

      The ICAPCD is currently updating its attainment plan. Therefore, the 1992 Air Quality
      Attainment Plan (AQAP) is to be used to determine whether the project will conflict with or
      obstruct implementation of the plan. Chapter Six of the 1992 AQAP contains transportation and
      land use strategies. The AQAP indicates that although the ICAPCD does not have direct
      authority over land use decisions, changes in land use and circulation planning are necessary to
      maintain clean air in the long term. However, the AQAP recognizes that the further urban
      development is spread out over the landscape, the greater the distance between home and work,
      school, medical care, shopping facilities, recreation and personal services (1992 AQAP, pages 6-

      8). The AQAP has strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) through the following
      policies:

             Cities and unincorporated communities should be developed at densities that reduce trips and
             travel distances and encourage the use of alternative forms of transportation;

             Urban growth should occur within the urban reserve lines of cities and unincorporated
             communities. Rural areas of the county should be maintained as open space and agricultural
             lands;

             The mixing of commercial and residential land uses should be encouraged when it will
             reduce dependence on the automobile, improve the balance between jobs and housing, and
             will not create incompatible land use relationships;

             Within cities and unincorporated communities, the gap between the availability of jobs and
             housing should be narrowed and should not be allowed to expand;

             Local planning agencies should encourage transit use by planning neighborhoods and
             commercial centers to allow for convenient access to and use of local and regional transit
             systems;

             Local planning agencies should encourage bicycling and walking by planning for existing
             and new residential and commercial areas to include a safe and interconnected system of bike
             lanes and paths, sidewalks, and pedestrian trails; and

             Local planning agencies and Caltrans should manage their street systems so that Level of
             Service (LOS) C or better is maintained along regional routes connecting communities and
             LOS D or better is maintained along arterial streets within communities.

      The proposed project is the redevelopment of an existing recreational facility in the City of
      El Centro. The project will leave the existing Conrad Harrison Youth Center' gymnasium where
      it is currently located and demolish the aquatic recreational facility. The aquatic recreational
      facility will be replaced with a multi-purpose indoor field complex. The plans include demolition
      of two existing swimming pools, bathroom/shower facilities, shaded bleachers, and a large façade
      facing North 8th Street. The site will be graded to street level (approximately 4 feet maximum
      cut, approximately 30 inches over-excavated soil preparation under flat footings). The new
      indoor sports complex will include a multi-sport field court and bleachers all enclosed within a
      200-foot by 110-foot structural membrane (22,000 square feet).

      The project also includes construction of a one-story structure that will be the main entrance for
      the existing gymnasium and the new sports complex. This new structure will include
      bathroom/shower facilities, an office, a kitchen/concession stand, and ticket booth and
      maintenance storage with covered walkways connecting to the existing gym and the proposed
      sports complex. Proposed parking will consist of 118 off-street parking stalls for the project.

      The new facilities will encourage people living and working near the project site to use the
      recreational facility, thereby reducing vehicle miles traveled going elsewhere to use playing
      fields. The project includes mitigation measures and project design features to increase bicycle
      use and to reduce vehicle miles traveled. The project will also comply with all existing APCD
      rules and regulations pertaining to the project, including Regulation 8, which has a purpose to
      reduce fugitive dust during construction. The portion of Regulation 8 (Rule 801) that applies to
      construction activities and control of fugitive dust is included in Appendix A. Rule 801 applies to
      any construction and other earthmoving activities, including, but not limited to, land clearing,
      excavation related to construction, land leveling, grading, cut and fill grading, erection or
      demolition of any structure, cutting and filling, trenching, loading or unloading of bulk materials
      from open storage piles, weed abatement through disking, back filling, travel on-site and travel on
      access roads to and from the site.

      The City and subsequently, the construction contractor shall implement the following mitigation
      measure.

      MM AQ-1                 Prior to commencement of construction activities, including demolition and
                              grading, the construction contractor shall prepare a Dust Control Plan (DCP) to be
                              implemented during all construction activities per ICAPCD Rule 801 Section F.2,
                              subject to review and approval by the City Engineer and ICAPCD.

      Implementation of the approved Dust Control Plan will make the project consistent with the
      AQAP.

      b) Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air
         quality violation?

      Less Than Significant Impact with Mitigation. Imperial County, the geographical area in
      which the project site is located, is in nonattainment for particulate matter less than 10 microns in
      diameter (PM10) and ozone. Levels of PM10 and ozone are locally high enough that contributions
      from new sources may add to the concentrations of those pollutants and contribute to a projected
      air quality violation.

      Operation
      For the purposes of this analysis, the project was assumed to resemble a commercial site in terms
      of employee trips. The ICAPCD indicates that to have a less than significant impact on air
      quality from operation, the project should implement all feasible mitigation measures as
      contained in Section 7.2 of its CEQA Handbook.

      Standard mitigation measures for commercial projects include the following site design and
      energy efficiency standards:


Michael Brandman Associates                                                                                      29

             Provide on-site bicycle lockers and/or racks;
             Provide on-site eating, refrigeration and food vending facilities to reduce lunchtime trips;
             Provide shower and locker facilities to encourage employees to bike and/or walk to work; and
             Incorporate into the design of the project measures that meet mandatory, prescriptive, and/or
             performance measures as required by Title 24.

      As a project design feature, the recreation facility is providing bathroom/shower facilities, a
      kitchen/concession stand, and covered walkways. Therefore, the ICAPCD suggested operational
      mitigation measures that apply to the project are included as mitigation measures. With
      implementation of mitigation measures, the project will not violate any air quality standard or
      contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation. This is a less than
      significant impact with mitigation.

      Construction
      As discussed above in Item 10.3a, the proposed project is the redevelopment of an existing
      recreational facility in the City of El Centro. The existing aquatic recreational facility will be
      replaced with a multi-purpose indoor field complex. The plans include demolition of existing
      facilities, site grading and construction of new sports fields and related facilities.

      Regarding construction emissions, the ICAPCD indicates that the approach of the CEQA analysis
      for construction particulate matter impacts should be qualitative as opposed to quantitative.
      While a Lead Agency may elect to quantify construction emissions, the ICAPCD recommends
      the implementation of effective and comprehensive mitigation measures as listed in its CEQA
      Handbook. In any case, regardless of the size of the project, the standard mitigation measures for
      construction equipment and fugitive PM10 must be implemented at all construction sites.

      The project must also comply with ICAPCD Regulation 8 regarding preventing fugitive dust as
      discussed above and addressed in Mitigation Measure AQ-1. CAQ-2 is designed t address
      construction and earth moving activities. AQ-3 is designed to address Title 24 requirements for
      new projects.

      Mitigation Measures
      Construction
      MM AQ-2.                The construction contractor shall comply with ICAPCD Rule 801, Construction
                              and Earthmoving Activities, sections E, F and G to the satisfaction of the City
                              Public Works Director and ICAPCD.

      Operation
      MM AQ-3.                Prior to the issuance of a building permit, to the extent feasible, the City shall
                              demonstrate that the design of the proposed buildings or structures exceed by
                              five percent 2008 Building Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and

                              Nonresidential Buildings. In addition, the project shall use roof material with a
                              solar reflectance value meeting the EPA/DOE Energy Star® rating to reduce
                              summer cooling needs. The project shall also use energy efficient lighting where
                              new lighting is to be installed. Documentation of compliance with this measure
                              shall be provided to the City of El Centro Building Official for review and approval
                              prior to issuance of building permit(s) and approval of features shall be confirmed
                              by the City of El Centro Building Official prior to certificate of occupancy.

      With implementation of and Mitigation Measure AQ-1 through AQ-3, the project will not violate
      any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation.
      This is a less than significant impact with mitigation.

      c) Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the
         project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality
         standard (including releasing emissions that exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
         precursors)?

      Less Than Significant Impact. The following tiered approach is to assess cumulative air quality
      impacts. Each of the criteria must be less than significant in order to have a less than significant
      impact on cumulative air quality.

      Regional Analysis
      If an area is in nonattainment for a criteria pollutant, then the background concentration of that
      pollutant has historically been over the ambient air quality standard. It follows that if a project
      exceeds the regional threshold for that nonattainment pollutant, then it will result in a
      cumulatively considerable net increase of that pollutant and result in a significant cumulative
      impact.

      Imperial County is in nonattainment for PM10 and ozone. Therefore, if the project exceeds the
      regional thresholds for PM10 then it contributes to a cumulatively considerable impact for PM10.
      Additionally, if the project exceeds the regional threshold for NOx or VOC, then it follows that
      the project will contribute to a cumulatively considerable impact for ozone.

      During operation, the project will not exceed the regional significance thresholds for VOC, NOx,
      PM10, or PM2.5. During construction, the construction contractors would implement all standard
      construction mitigation measures to reduce emissions per ICAPCD Rule 801. Therefore, it is
      anticipated that the project will not contribute to a cumulative air quality impact according to this

      Plan Approach
      The geographic scope for cumulative air quality impacts is the Imperial County portion of the
      Salton Sea Air Basin because that is the area in which the air pollutants generated by the sources
      within the basin circulate and are often trapped. The ICAPCD is required to prepare and maintain
      attainment plans and a State Implementation Plan to document the strategies and measures to be
      undertaken to reach attainment of ambient air quality standards. While the ICAPCD does not
      have direct authority over land use decisions, it is recognized that changes in land use and
      circulation planning are necessary to maintain clean air. As a result, the ICAPCD evaluates the
      entire basin when it develops the attainment plan. As discussed in (a), the project is consistent
      with the current AQAP. Therefore, according to this criterion, the project has a less than
      significant cumulative impact.

      Cumulative Health Impacts
      The basin is in nonattainment for ozone and PM10, which means that the background levels of
      these pollutants are at times higher than the ambient air quality standards. The air quality
      standards were set to protect public health, including the health of sensitive individuals (i.e.,
      elderly, children, and the sick). Therefore, when the concentration of those pollutants exceeds the
      standard, it is likely that some sensitive individuals in the population will experience health
      effects as described in the project's Air Quality Background Information (Appendix A).
      However, the health effects are a factor of the dose-response curve. Concentrations of the
      pollutant in the air (dose), the length of time exposed, and the response of the individual are
      factors involved in severity and nature of health impacts. If a significant health impact results
      from project emissions, it does not mean that 100 percent of the population will experience health
      effects.

      The regional significance analysis demonstrated that emissions operation would not exceed the
      regional significance thresholds; therefore, significant cumulative health impacts are not
      anticipated from project emissions.

      According to the tiered analysis, emissions will not exceed the regional significance thresholds,
      the project is consistent with the current AQAP, and project emissions will not result in
      cumulative health impacts.

d) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations?

      Less Than Significant Impact. Those who are sensitive to air pollution include children, the
      elderly, and persons with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular illness. Sensitive individuals
      refer to those segments of the population most susceptible to poor air quality (i.e., children, the
      elderly, and those with pre-existing serious health problems affected by air quality). Land uses
      where sensitive individuals are most likely to spend time include schools and schoolyards, parks
      and playgrounds, daycare centers, nursing homes, hospitals, and residential communities

      (California Air Resource Board {CARB} 2005). The proposed sport park complex would be
      considered a sensitive receptor because it will contain those who are using physical exertion,
      including children. Therefore, the project is considered a sensitive receptor for purposes of this
      analysis.

      To the north of the project site is an existing motel, northeast is multi-family residential housing,
      east is a public park, southeast is conventional single unit housing, south, and west are
      commercial businesses. The main source of air pollution near the project site is from the motor
      vehicles on the surrounding roadway network.

      Construction equipment used during project construction activities will emit diesel particulate
      matter, which is a carcinogen. The nearest sensitive receptors are residences located
      approximately 200 feet north of the project, but also people using the gymnasium that will remain
      a part of the Indoor Sports Complex. The diesel emissions from construction are short-term in
      nature and the emissions will disperse with distance. Therefore, impact will be less than
      significant.

      CARB adopted the Air Quality and Land Use Handbook: A Community Health Perspective (Land
      Use Handbook) in 2005. The Land Use Handbook provides information and guidance on siting
      sensitive receptors in relation to sources of toxic air contaminates (TACs). Sources of TACs
      identified in the Land Use Handbook are high traffic freeways and roads, distribution centers, rail
      yards, ports, refineries, chrome plating facilities, dry cleaners, and large gas dispensing facilities.
      If the project involves siting a sensitive receptor near a source of TAC discussed in the Land Use
      Handbook, siting mitigation may be added to avoid potential land use conflicts, thereby reducing
      the potential for health impacts to the sensitive receptors.

      CARB recommends avoiding new sensitive land uses within 500 feet of a freeway, urban roads
      with 100,000 vehicles per day, or rural roads with 50,000 vehicles per day. Epidemiological
      studies indicate that the distance from the roadway and truck traffic densities were key factors in
      the correlation of health effects, particularly in children. The project is located on Adams
      Avenue, which according to the project traffic study will have a traffic volume of 22,000 vehicles
      per day with the proposed project. Therefore, nearby roadways are not projected to exceed a
      volume of 50,000 vehicles per day.

      CARB recommends avoiding new sensitive land uses within 300 feet of a large fueling station (a
      facility with a throughput of 3.6 million gallons per year or greater). A 50-foot separation is
      recommended for typical gas dispensing facilities. A 7-Eleven convenience store with four gas-
      dispensing pumps is located to the west of the project site approximately 100 feet west of the
      project boundary. Fueling facilities can have benzene emissions from fuel evaporation; benzene
      is a cancer causing volatile organic compound (VOC). It is not anticipated that the fueling station
      will have a throughput of more than 3.6 million gallons per year. This is because there are six

      other fueling stations within a one-mile radius of the 7-Eleven, including a BP and a Texaco. The
      7-Eleven is considered a "typical" fueling station and is more than 50 feet from the project
      boundary. Therefore, this is a less than significant impact.

      The proposed project does not include any of the sources of TACs as identified in the Land Use
      Handbook and those uses are not located near the project site. Therefore, the project is consistent
      with the recommendations in the Land Use Handbook and will not expose sensitive receptors to
      substantial pollutant concentrations utilizing the criteria in the Land Use Handbook.

      During operation, the primary source of emissions would be from motor vehicles that will access
      the facilities. These emissions will occur along the surrounding roadway network and will
      disperse readily from the site. There is one intersection assessed in the project traffic report
      (Appendix B) that indicates that the intersection of 7th Street at Adams Avenue that will operate at
      LOS E. The remainder of the intersections will operate at LOS C or better. The increased traffic
      from the project does not change the delay at 7th Street at Adams Avenue; therefore, the project
      will not contribute to a potential CO hotspot violation at the intersections assessed in the traffic
      study. A CO hotspot analysis was not required for this project. The project will not cause or
      contribute to a violation of the CO ambient air quality standard and therefore will not expose
      sensitive receptors to substantial CO concentrations during operation.

      In summary, the proposed project will not expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
      concentrations during construction or operation of the project.

e) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people?

      Less than Significant Impact: The proposed project presents the potential for generation of
      objectionable odors in the form of diesel exhaust and VOCs in the immediate vicinity of the site
      during construction. However, these emissions will rapidly dissipate and be diluted by the
      atmosphere downwind of the emission sources. Further criteria for evaluation of odor impacts
      are found in Table 3 of the ICAPCD's CEQA Air Quality Handbook. These criteria screen out
      projects as having odor impacts if the proposed project is within one mile of a wastewater
      treatment plant, sanitary landfill, composting station, feedlot, asphalt batching plant,
      painting/coating operations (including auto body shops), or rendering plant. The project site is
      not within one mile of any of the odor generating land uses listed. Recognizing the dispersion of
      the pollutants and the distance to odor generating land uses, the project will not subject a
      substantial number of people to objectionable odors.

f)    Does the project comply with the provisions of an adopted Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan or
      Strategy? If no such Plan or Strategy is applicable, would the project significantly hinder or
      delay California's ability to meet the reduction targets contained in AB 32?

      Less Than Significant Impact with Mitigation. The California State Legislature adopted
      AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which focuses on reducing
      greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Greenhouse gases, as
      defined under AB 32, include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons,
      perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Further discussion regarding greenhouse gases and the
      regulatory environment surrounding them is discussed in the Air Quality Background
      Information, Appendix A.

      Climate change is a change in the average weather of the earth that may be measured by changes
      in wind patterns, storms, precipitation, and temperature. In California, climate change may result
      in consequences such as loss of snow-pack, increased risk of large wildfires, and reductions in the
      quality and quantity of certain agricultural products.

      There is no applicable plan or strategy prepared by the County of Imperial or City of El Centro to
      reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the assessment of whether or not the project will
      significantly hinder or delay California's ability to meet the reduction targets contained in AB 32
      is included here.

      The main sources of operational greenhouse gas emissions are presented in Table 2, Operational
      Greenhouse Gas Emissions. As shown in the table, emissions are 314 metric tons of carbon
      dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e) in the buildout year, assumed as 2010. The largest source of
      emissions is from motor vehicle exhaust from the vehicles that will access the project. The
      refrigerants include emissions from leakage from the air conditioning system(s). There will also
      be electricity generation required to transport and treat the water that will be used at the project
      site; however, these emissions are minimal. There will be minimal emissions from the landscape
      equipment.

      The project will provide recreational opportunities to the nearby residents and people who work
      in the project area, which will prevent vehicle miles traveled to other recreational facilities farther
      away. The mitigation measures presented below were selected from a variety of sources
      (CAPCOA 2008, OPR 2008, CARB 2008). Mitigation measures and project design features will
      also reduce operational emissions of greenhouse gases. Therefore, operation of the project will
      not hinder or delay California's ability to meet the reduction targets contained in AB 32 and
      impacts will be less than significant.

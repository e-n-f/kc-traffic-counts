Attention:           Mr. Shoukat Choudry
                                 Choudry, President

Dear Sir:

Re:     Traffic Impact Study
        Proposed Mosque Development
        4269 Regional Road 25
        Town of Oakville
        Our Project No. 12192

Transtech is pleased to submit the following Traffic Impact Study assessing the traffic impacts of
the proposed mosque development located at 4269 Regional Road 25, in the Town of Oakville.

The 12.7 acre site is currently a residential property with a house and separate storage building.
The proposal is to use 210 m2 (2260.4 sq sq-ft) of the house as the mosque prayer area, maintain
the storage building and relocate
                            locate the site driveway to the south on Regional Road 25,
                                                                                     25 opposite
Henderson Road.  . The driveway will connect to a new 40 space parking lot.

Our study concludes that traffic generated by the proposed mosque development can be
accommodated at the existing Regional Road 25 and Henderson Road intersection. This
includes provision of a warranted southbound l
                                             left turn lane at the proposed site driveway, which
can be included as part of the planned 2012/2013 widening of Regional
                                                                 egional Road 25.
                                                                               25

We trust the enclosed is
                       s sufficient for your needs, but please do not hesitate to contact the
undersigned should you require any additional assistance.


Yours truly,

TRANSTECH

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


1.    The proposed mosque prayer area within the existing house is 210 m2 (2260 sq-ft).

2.    There are four significant prayer periods of site arrival and departure traffic impact
      analysis:

             Early Morning Prayer: Daily at sunrise, conservatively uses the a.m. peak hour for
             background traffic volumes
             Evening Prayer: Daily at sunset, conservatively uses the p.m. peak hour for
             background traffic volumes
             Nightly Prayer: Daily from 8:00 ­ 11:00 p.m., conservatively uses the busiest hour
             during Nightly Prayer from 8:00 ­ 9:00 p.m.
             Friday Prayer: Weekly from 1:00 ­ 2:00 p.m., uses an arrival background traffic
             peak from 12:00 ­ 1:00 p.m. and a departure background traffic peak from 2:00 ­
             3:00 p.m.

3.    The site plan proposes a new full movement access driveway (with two exit lanes) on
      Regional Road 25 to be aligned with the Henderson Road centreline.

4.    A new parking lot with 40 parking spaces is planned along with two handicapped parking
      spaces in front of the existing house.

5.    Traffic counts at the Regional Road 25 intersection with Henderson Road were obtained
      using the Miovision traffic data collection system on Friday April 27, 2012.

6.    In accordance with Halton Region requirements, a horizon year of 2017 (5 year post build-
      out) was selected for the analysis to represent the future traffic conditions.

7.    A 3.0% annual growth rate was applied to existing 2012 through volumes on Regional
      Road 25 to project background traffic for the 2017 horizon year.

8.    Existing and future traffic conditions were analyzed assuming completion of the Halton
      Region scheduled Regional Road 25 road widening to four travel lanes.

9.    Mosque prayer period arrival and departure trips typically occur separately, before and
      after the scheduled prayer times (each assumed to have a duration of approximately 15
      minutes). Site trips were assumed to peak at the capacity of the parking lot, which are 40
      inbound and 40 outbound trips for each prayer period. Based on the attendance
      expected, this overstates the estimated trips for all daily prayer periods while matching the
      expected attendance for the weekly Friday Prayer period.

10.   Site generated trips were assigned 75% north and 25% south. This reflects that the
      Muslim Association of Milton mosque is currently located north in the Town of Milton, while
      the Town of Oakville and Highway 407 are in close proximity to the south.

11.   Under total 2017 traffic conditions with the addition of the site arrival trips, the unsignalized
      Regional Road 25 study intersection is expected to operate with very good to excellent
      operational characteristics and no significant queuing.
12.   Under total 2017 traffic conditions with the addition of the site departure trips, the
      unsignalized Regional Road 25 study intersection is again expected to operate with very
      good to excellent operational characteristics with exception of the westbound left turn
      movement after Early Morning Prayer. The minor queuing because of delay is however a
      very short duration and is based on a conservative estimate of trip volume in comparison
      to the expected attendance.

13.   Application of the MTO Left Turn Storage Lane, Four-Lane Divided Highways,
      Unsignalized Procedure indicates the warrant for a southbound left turn lane at the site
      driveway is satisfied and should have a minimum of 15 metre storage length and 105
      metre taper, for a 100 km/h design speed. This was confirmed by SimTraffic queuing
      analysis. The turning lane can be provided within the planned shadow lane and 2 metre
      flush median island at the Henderson Road intersection.

14.   The MTO Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis (Projected Volumes for Justification 7) confirms
      that the Regional Road 25 study intersection does not warrant traffic signals in the 2017
      horizon year.
1.0         INTRODUCTION

1.1. RETAINER AND OBJECTIVE
            Transtech was retained by The Muslim Association of Milton for the preparation of a
            Traffic Impact Study to determine the impact of the proposed mosque located at 4269
            Regional Road 25 on the adjacent road network. The subject site location is within the
            Town of Oakville at the northern limit of the municipality as shown in Figure 1.

1.2. STUDY BACKGROUND
            The proposed site has an existing house with 210 m2 (2,260 sq-ft) used for the prayer
            area. The current site access driveway will be relocated and a 40 parking space parking
            lot will be constructed to accommodate the maximum 120 mosque attendees. Four
            significant prayer periods were identified by Muslim Association of Milton officials:

            Table 1 summarizes the information provided about the significant prayer periods.

                             Table 1: SUMMARY OF MOSQUE PRAYER PERIODS

                                                                                      Average Time
            Prayer Period:      Frequency          Prayer Time       Attendees
                                                                                       on Premises

             Early Morning         Daily              Sunrise          20 ­ 30       20 ­ 30 minutes

               Evening             Daily              Sunset           60 ­ 80       20 ­ 30 minutes

                Nightly            Daily        8:00 ­ 11:00 p.m.     80 ­ 100       20 ­ 30 minutes

                Friday            Weekly         1:00 ­ 2:00 p.m.     Max 120             60 minutes


            The objective of this study is to determine the impact of anticipated traffic volumes
            generated by the proposed mosque on the surrounding road network and if necessary
            recommend improvements.

            Traffic data was collected for the intersection of Regional Road 25 and Henderson Road
            to provide background traffic conditions. A planning horizon of 5 years (2017) was
            selected for analysis of future traffic conditions.

            Transtech consulted with Halton Region staff to discuss and confirm the scope of
            assumptions for this study.

2.0         SITE CHARACTERISTICS

2.1         SITE ENVIRONS
            The proposed property is 12.7 acres located at 4269 Regional Road 25, in the Town of
            Oakville. It is northeast of the Regional Road 25 intersection with Henderson Road.
            The site is just south of the Town of Milton borderline and approximately 1.5 km north of
            Highway 407. There is an electrical transmission corridor south of the site.

            The subject property is currently a private residence. The proposal to convert it into a
            mosque assumes that 210 m2 (2260 sq-ft) will be used as prayer area. Another existing
            structure on the site will be only used for storage. The surrounding land is comprised
            primarily of agricultural uses, but also includes residential and worship land uses.

2.2         STUDY AREA
            The study area includes the intersection of:

                · Regional Road 25 at Henderson Road / Proposed Site Driveway

2.3         SITE PLAN
            Figure 2 shows the proposed mosque development site plan including the new access
            driveway. The proposed site driveway location appears to be aligned with the centreline
            of Henderson Road, but should be confirmed. The proposed parking lot contains 40
            spaces with an additional two handicap spaces in front of the existing attached garage.
            The site driveway has an internal two-way connection to the proposed parking lot and a
            one-way loop to the front of the proposed mosque.

2.4         SITE ACCESS
            The proposed site driveway is recommended to centreline align with Henderson Road as
            the east leg at the intersection on Regional Road 25. It is further recommended that the
            site driveway be stop controlled at Regional Road 25. The driveway has three lanes on
            the approach to Regional Road 25, a single entry lane and dual exits lanes, for left and
            through-right turning movements. Future plans to widen Regional Road 25 create an

3.1         ROAD NETWORK
            The following summarizes the roads within the study area.

               Regional Road 25 is a north-south major arterial rural cross-section roadway under
               the jurisdiction of Halton Region extending from the Town of Acton in the north to
               Lake Ontario in the south. In the study area it currently has a two-lane cross-section,
               however Halton Region plans improvement to a four/five-lane cross section in
               2012/13. Regional Road 25 has a posted speed limit of 80 km/h.

               Henderson Road is a north-south collector roadway under the jurisdiction of the
               Town of Milton extending from Lower Base Line in the north to Regional Road 25 in
               the south. Henderson Road has a two lane rural cross-section and currently Tee-
               intersects with stop control at Regional Road 25. The posted speed limit is 50 km/h.

3.2         EXISTING TRAFFIC DATA
            Weekday turning movement counts were undertaken by Transtech using the Miovision
            data collection system at the intersection of Regional Road 25 and Henderson Road on
            Friday April 27, 2012 from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. The data is provided in Appendix A.
            (Regional Road 25 is still a two-lane roadway, however because of the imminent timing
            of the planned improvements, the following capacity analyses under the existing traffic
            conditions adopted the widened Regional Road 25 lane configuration.)

            The weekday a.m. peak hour from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. was used to analyze the Early
            Morning Prayer period and the weekday p.m. peak hour from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. was used
            to analyze the Evening Prayer period. This produces conservative estimates due to
            sunrise and sunset variations in the actual prayer times throughout the year, which only
            occasionally completely overlap the peak traffic hours on Regional Road 25.

            Turning movement count volumes included 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. for the Nightly Prayer
            period and 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. for the Friday Prayer period arrival
            and departure peak hours, respectively.

            Table 2 summarizes prayer times/periods, estimated average prayer durations, and the
            identified study peak hours. The arrival and departure peak hours are different for the
            weekly Friday prayer period.

4.0         BACKGROUND (2017) TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

4.1         STUDY HORIZON YEAR
            Future traffic conditions are predicted for a five-year planning horizon (2017) based on
            discussions with Halton Region to represent the future traffic demands.

4.2         PLANNED STUDY AREA ROAD NETWORK
            Halton Region's Roads Capital Projects (2012 ­ 2021) schedule confirms that Regional
            Road 25 will be widened to a four travel lane cross-section in 2012/13. Existing, future
            background, and future total traffic conditions were subsequently analyzed assuming
            completion of the improvement project.

            Functional drawings for planned Regional Road 25 improvements show the exclusive
            northbound left turn lane for Henderson Road with an opposing shadow lane and 70
            metre taper.

            Figure 4 shows the Full Moves Access Draft Functional Design overlaid on the Halton
            Region planned improvements for Regional Road 25.

4.3         FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
            A review of the Town of Oakville's Active Development Applications shows there are no
            significant planned future developments contributing traffic in the study area.

4.4         FUTURE TRAFFIC GROWTH
            Based on consultation with Halton Region, a growth rate of 3.0% per annum was applied
            to northbound and southbound through movements on Regional Road 25 to project the
            background traffic conditions at the 2017 horizon year.

            Figure 5 shows the estimated background 2017 traffic volumes for Early Morning
            Prayer, Evening Prayer, Nightly Prayer and Friday Prayer arrival and departure periods,
            at the study intersection.

5.0         ESTIMATED SITE TRAFFIC

5.1         SITE TRIP GENERATION
            Site trip generation was based on full occupancy of the parking lot for each of the prayer
            periods. With the exception of the Friday Prayer arrivals and departures, the adopted
            trip volumes were therefore conservatively overstated.

            Within the context that the Muslim Association of Milton advised that vehicle occupancy
            averages three persons per vehicle, the expected number of attendees and related
            vehicle trips are summarized as follows:

               ·   Early Morning Prayer is expected to have 20 ­ 30 attendees which is 7 ­ 10
                   vehicles;
               ·   Evening Prayer is expected to have 60 ­ 80 attendees which is 20 - 27 vehicles;
               ·   Nightly Prayer is expected to have 80 ­ 100 attendees which is 27 ­ 34 vehicles;
                   and
               ·   Friday Prayer is expected to have a maximum of 120 attendees which is a
                   maximum of 40 vehicles.

            Each prayer period was analyzed based on 40 vehicles arriving and departing at
            different times before and after the typically scheduled times of the prayer periods. This
            is 80 two-way trips, or 40 inbound and 40 outbound trips. However, not only would the
            arrival and departure trips occur at different times (negligible interaction), but they are
            expected to occur over a much shorter time interval than the typical one hour analysis
            period.     Capturing the short term intensity of arrival and departure trips was
            subsequently modelled by assuming that all 40 trips occur within a 15 minute period
            (160 trips per hour).

            Table 3 summarizes the adopted arrival and departure site generated vehicle trips to for
            each prayer period.

5.2         SITE TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
            The distribution of site generated arrival and departure trips was assumed 75% to/from
            the north and 25% to/from the south. This reflects that the Muslim Association of Milton
            mosque is currently located north of the proposed site in the Town of Milton and
            therefore many attendees will be derived from this established group of people. It also
            considers that the Town of Oakville and Highway 407 are in close proximity to the south
            which can impact the future orientation of a significant volume of trips.

            Table 4 summarizes the trip distribution adopted to assign the site trips to Regional
            Road 25 for all four prayer periods.

6.0         TOTAL (2017) TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

6.1         PROJECTED TOTAL TRAFFIC
            The future background 2017 traffic volumes were combined with the estimated site
            generated vehicle trips to derive the future total 2017 traffic volumes. All traffic
            conditions assumed completion of the Regional Road 25 planned widening to four lanes
            with an exclusive northbound left turn lane at the study intersection.

            Figure 7 shows the estimated total 2017 traffic volumes for Early Morning Prayer,
            Evening Prayer, Nightly Prayer and Friday Prayer arrival and departure phases, at the
            study intersection.

6.2         WARRANT ANALYSES
            The warrant for the proposed southbound left turn lane (for the site driveway) is satisfied
            under the total 2017 traffic conditions during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.
            Using the MTO Left Turn Storage Lane, Four-Lane Divided Highways, Unsignalized
            Procedure, the critical period occurs during the weekday p.m. peak hour and requires a
            minimum storage length of 15 metres and 105 metre taper, for a 100 km/h design speed.
            This storage and taper length can be accommodated within the planned shadow lane
            and 2 metre wide flush median island at the Henderson Road intersection shown on the
            Regional Road 25 Class Environmental Assessment drawing obtained from the Region.
            This storage length was supported by a subsequent queuing analysis using SimTraffic
            software during the critical weekday p.m. peak hour traffic conditions. The warrant and
            SimTraffic reports are provided in Appendix A and B, respectively.

            The MTO Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis (Projected Volumes for Justification 7) based
            on the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, is not satisfied. The warrant report is
            provided in Appendix A.

7.0         CAPACITY ANALYSES

            Capacity analysis reports on the expected operational characteristics of the study
            intersection. The analysis contained within this report utilized the Highway Capacity
            Manual (HCM) 2000 techniques within the Synchro Version 8 Software package. The
            reported intersection volume-to-capacity ratios (v/c) are a measure of the saturation
            volume for each turning movement, while the levels-of-service (LOS) are a measure of
            the average delay for each turning movement. Queuing characteristics are reported as
            the predicted 95th percentile queue for each turning movement.

            The following tables summarize the HCM unsignalized capacity results for the study
            intersection during the peak hour periods for Early Morning Prayer (weekday a.m. peak
            hour), Evening Prayer (weekday p.m. peak hour), Nightly Prayer period hour, and Friday
            Prayer arrival and departure hours. The detailed capacity analysis summaries are
            provided in Appendix B.

            Under existing 2012 traffic conditions, the overall intersection operation is characterized
            by the northbound left turn movement. All approaches at the unsignalized intersection
            are operating with very good to excellent operational characteristics.

            Under total 2017 traffic conditions, with the addition of site generated arrival trips for
            each of the prayer periods, all approaches/movements at the unsignalized intersection
            are expected to continue to operate with very good to excellent operational
            characteristics and no significant queuing.

            Under total 2017 traffic conditions, with the addition of site generated departure trips for
            each of the prayer periods, the westbound left turn (site egress) movement can be
            expected to have the longest delays, while all other approaches/movements at the
            unsignalized intersection are expected to continue to operate with very good to excellent
            operational characteristics and no significant queuing.

            The westbound left turn delays are longest during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
            hours because of the conflicting higher volumes on Regional Road 25 including the
            northbound left turn movement to Henderson Road. The exit delay after the Early
            Morning Prayer results in the longest predicted queues of 4 vehicles. This is however
            very short duration with the least attendance. The adopted site trips at this prayer time
            are however overstated and therefore the operational characteristics are expected to be
            much better than reported.

  NOTES:       1. The warrant values are based on annumal average daily traffic (AADT) which apporximates May and October traffic
               2. For warrants 1, 2, 3 and 4, each hourly volume must exceed the minimum requirements for the warrant to be 100% satisfied
               3. For warrant 5 the 8 hour average must exceed the minimum requirements for the warrant to be 100% satisfied
               4. The crossing volume is defined as the sum of:
                      (1) Left turns from both minor street apporaches
                      (2) The heaviest through volume from the minor street
                      (3) 50% of the heavier left turn movement from major street when both of the following criteria are met:
                             (a) The left turn volume > 120 vph
                             (b) The left turn volume plus the opposing volume > 720 vph
                      (4) Pedestrians crossing the major street

INTRODUCTION
Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. was retained by Marcus Maita to prepare a traffic
study for the proposed United Indoor Sports complex at 3151 Edison Way in
unincorporated San Mateo County, CA. The proposed project will include playing areas
for soccer, football, and basketball, a restaurant, party room, arcade, batting cages, and
office space. The indoor sports complex is anticipated to operate on weekdays from 9
AM to midnight (but close earlier on weekends); therefore, the project will generate trips
during the PM peak but will not generate trips during the AM peak period.

Results of the traffic study will be used to assess the impacts of the proposed project.

The existing project site is a recently vacated beer distribution center. It is located on
the north side of Edison Way between 2nd Avenue and 5th Avenue. Figure 1 illustrates
the location of the project site in relation to Redwood City.

This traffic study was prepared based on criteria set forth by the County of San Mateo
and Redwood City. This study addresses the traffic and transportation effects of the
proposed development in order to assist the project owner and the County in project
planning and determining conditions of approval for the project.


Study Methodology
Development Conditions
Contents of the traffic study and evaluation of the following development conditions
were based on requirements contained in the County of San Mateo intersection Level of
Service (LOS) Standards and the Redwood City intersection LOS Standards:

          Existing conditions ­ Based on current traffic counts and existing roadway
          geometry and traffic control.
          Existing + Project traffic conditions ­ Based on existing plus traffic generated by
          the project.
          Existing + Approved traffic conditions ­ Based on existing plus traffic generated
          by pending and approved projects, and roadway geometry and traffic control in
          place at the time of this development condition.
          Existing + Approved + Project traffic conditions ­ Based on existing plus traffic
          generated by pending and approved projects plus traffic generated by the
          project.


Operating Conditions and Criteria
Levels of service are represented by a letter scale from LOS A to LOS F, with LOS A
representing the best performance and LOS F representing the poorest performance


EdisonSportsComplex05.FinalTrafficReport_v6.doc   3                                  12 September 2011

                   and Associates, Inc.               United Indoor Sports Complex, Redwood City, CA

under significantly congested conditions. LOS A indicates that the facility is overbuilt
for the demand. Conversely, LOS F indicates that the facility is under built for the
demand.

For the County of San Mateo, intersection level of service was based on average delay
for signalized and all-way stop-controlled intersections and based on worst approach
delay for two-way stop-controlled intersections. The County of San Mateo establishes a
level of service goal of LOS D in the unincorporated areas, unless it is designated as a
County of San Mateo Congestion Management Program (CMP) intersection. None of
the study intersections are designated as CMP intersections.

For Redwood City, intersection level of service was based on average delay for
signalized and all-way stop-controlled intersections and based on worst approach delay
for two-way stop-controlled intersections. Redwood City establishes a level of service
goal of LOS D within the City's jurisdiction.

Traffic analysis to determine level of service was completed using the Highway Capacity
Manual 2000 Methodology at all intersections using the Traffix software. The Traffix
software platform is based on the methodology of the Highway Capacity Manual and is
approved by the County of San Mateo for use in preparation of traffic impact studies.

Thresholds of Significance
For the County of San Mateo, a significant impact would occur if the addition of project
traffic causes:

          The level of service at a study intersection to drop below the established
          threshold (LOS D)
          An unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F) under baseline conditions experiences an
          increase in the critical movement volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) by 0.02 or more
          to an intersection under project conditions

For Redwood City, a significant impact would occur if the addition of project traffic
causes:

          The level of service at a study intersection to drop below the established
          thresholds (LOS D)
          An unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F) under baseline conditions experiences an
          increase in the average delay by five or more seconds for a signalized
          intersection
          An unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F) under baseline conditions experiences an
          increase in the delay by five or more seconds and satisfies the Peak Hour
          Volume warrant for an unsignalized intersection

Mitigation may be required when traffic from the project causes the intersection to
operate below acceptable levels of traffic operation. Intersections operating below the
standard without project and which are further degraded by the project would require
mitigation back to pre-project conditions.


Tables 1 and 2 describe the operational characteristics associated with each level of
service category for both signalized and unsignalized intersections.

The effects of vehicle queuing were analyzed and the 95th percentile queue is reported
for all study intersections. The 95th percentile queue length represents a condition
where 95 percent of the time during the peak period, traffic volumes and related
queuing will be at, or less, than the queue length determined by the analysis. This is
referred to as the "95th percentile queue." Average queuing is generally less. The
County does not establish a threshold that constitutes a significant queuing impact but
instead simply requires that queuing results be reported along with a recommendation
of how queuing that exceeds available storage can be addressed. For purposes of this
analysis queuing is considered a potentially significant impact since queues that exceed
turn pocket length can create a hazardous condition. Thus, for purposes of this
analysis, a queuing impact shall be considered to occur under conditions where the
queue extends beyond the turn pocket by 25 feet or more (i.e., the length of one
vehicle).


Study Intersections Included in Analysis
The proposed project will generate new vehicular trips that will increase traffic volumes
on the nearby street network. To assess changes in traffic conditions associated with
the project, the following intersections, illustrated in Figure 1, were selected for
evaluation in this traffic study based on their location in relation to the project site and
the amount of project traffic expected to pass through them. Listed below are the study
intersections and the jurisdiction in which they are located. Intersections were reviewed
and approved by the County for evaluation in this traffic report.

To address traffic patterns throughout a normal week, week-long volumes were
reviewed on the following roads:

     1. 2nd Avenue
     2. 5th Avenue
     3. Edison Way

The roadway volumes were selected at locations between the study intersections
closest to the project site.



EXISTING CONDITIONS

Existing Site Uses
The existing vacant beer distribution center is located at 3151 Edison Way on the north
side of Edison Way between 2nd Avenue and 5th Avenue. The beer distribution center is
currently 69,440 square feet, and has been vacant for less than a year. When the center
was operational, 75 employees worked multiple shifts with approximately 30 of them
starting at 7 AM and leaving by 4 PM. The remaining employees worked an evening or
later shift which affected the PM peak hour. Truck trips were also generated throughout
the day. Based on data provided by the building owner, delivery trucks would make 2
trips daily, delivery vans would make 2 trips daily, beer delivery trucks would deliver
beer to the distribution center 15 times per day and another 15 customer trucks would
pick up 15 times per day.


Existing Uses in Vicinity of Site
The lands surrounding the project site are almost entirely urbanized with a mixture of
residential, commercial, and public facility uses. Directly north of the site is a railroad
line. To the west are industrial land uses including the Palo Alto Lumber yard and a
trailer hitch installer. To the east are office land uses. The lands to the north and south

signals in the study area are located at only one study intersection.


Existing Peak Hour Turning Movement Volumes
Weekday PM intersection turning movement volumes were collected at project study
area intersections in April and July 2011. Volumes collected in April 2011 were done
during the PM peak periods of the weekday when local schools were in session, not
during Spring Break. Volumes collected in July 2011 were done during the PM peak
periods of the weekday when local schools were not in session, but were compared
against adjacent intersections collected in April 2011 and did not need to be adjusted.
AM data was not collected because the sports facility is not planned to be open during
the AM peak period. Existing volumes are shown in Figure 4 and represent evening
peak hour volumes. Traffic volume data sheets are available in the Appendix. Existing
week-long tube counts were also taken on 2nd Avenue, 5th Avenue, and Edison Way to

San Mateo County Transit (SamTrans) provides bus service in Redwood City. There
are no bus routes running directly adjacent to the project site. The closest routes are
along Bay Road and Middlefield Road, which include Routes 270, 296, 297, and 397.
These routes provide convenient connections to many locations in the city and
connections to other local and regional transit routes. There are transit stops at the
following locations in the project study area:

           On the northeast corner of Bay Road and 2nd Avenue. This is approximately 0.6
           miles from the project site.
           On the southwest corner of Bay Road and 5th Avenue. This is approximately 0.5
           miles from the project site.
           On the southwest corner of Middlefield Road and 2nd Avenue. This is
           approximately 0.4 miles from the project site.
           On the northeast corner and southwest corner of Middlefield Road and 5th
           Avenue. This is approximately 0.25 miles from the project site.

Transit near the site operates generally on a frequency of 30 to 60 minutes during the
weekdays, weekends, and holidays.


Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Sidewalks are present on Edison Way adjacent and near the project site. Sidewalks
provide walking facilities between the project site, nearby transit stops, and the adjacent
residential neighborhoods.

There are no bicycle facilities located within the study area. However, there are
numerous residential roadways with minor vehicular volumes providing a safe roadway
for bicycles.


Existing Levels of Service at Study Intersections
Traffic operations were evaluated at signalized and unsignalized intersections under
existing traffic conditions. As noted previously, intersections are to operate at a
minimum LOS D for all intersections.

Results of the analysis are presented in Table 3, along with the minimum jurisdictional
standard for acceptable levels of service (as previously described in Operating
Conditions and Criteria). Additional detail of the analysis is provided in the Appendix.

                   and Associates, Inc.                 United Indoor Sports Complex, Redwood City, CA

In Table 3, the signal control is listed as Signal for a signalized intersection, AWSC for
an all-way stop-controlled intersection and TWSC for a two-way stop-controlled
intersection. The overall level of service is reported for signalized intersections as well
as all-way stop-controlled intersections, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the
average operation for the intersection. The worst approach level of service is provided
for two-way stop-controlled intersections. Intersections operating unacceptably are
bolded.

According to the HCM results, the following intersections do not currently satisfy the
applicable operational standards:

          #5 ­ Middlefield Road / 2nd Avenue
          #11 ­ Fair Oaks Avenue / Marsh Road

It should be noted that calculations of delay at saturated conditions (i.e., LOS F)
become less reliable than at LOS E or better. Therefore, delay in excess of 80 seconds
is reported in the table to allow a relative comparison of without and with project
conditions and should not be interpreted as an exact representation of actual delay.
Furthermore, at TWSC intersections, it is possible for delay on the worst approach to be
greater than 80 seconds but still have the V/C well below 1.0 due to the HCM method of
calculating capacity of each movement of the approach.

INDOOR SPORTS COMPLEX

Proposed Site Uses
As noted previously, the existing vacant beer distribution center is 69,440 square feet.
It is proposed that the building be converted to an indoor sports complex with the same
floor area.

The proposed project will total approximately 58,000 square feet and include 2 turf fields
for soccer and/or football, 1 basketball court, 1 restaurant, a party room, an arcade, and
batting cages. The batting cages will be constructed in Phase 2 of this project. There
will also be 6,500 square feet of office space for sublease and 1,700 square feet for the
Sheriff's community offices.

This indoor sports complex is anticipated to operate from 9 AM to as late as midnight.
An estimate of the number of patrons, staff, and other guests anticipated to be on-site
during each hour is summarized below.

Weekday
9 AM ­ 11 AM: less than 75 patrons/staff/guests each hour
11AM ­ 4 PM: 75-100 patrons/staff/guests per hour
4 PM ­ 6 PM: 100-125 patrons/staff/guests per hour
6 PM ­ 10 PM: 125-150 patron/staff/guests per hour
10 PM ­ Midnight: 50-75 patrons/staff/guests per hour

Saturday
9 AM ­ 2 PM: 75-100 patrons/staff/guests per hour
2 PM ­ 5 PM: 75-100 patrons/staff/guests per hour
5 PM ­ 10 PM: 75-100 patrons/staff/guests per hour

Sunday
9 AM ­ 2 PM: 50-100 patrons/staff/guests per hour
2 PM ­ 9 PM 75-100 patrons/staff/guests per hour

These site occupancy estimates conservatively assume utilization of each of the uses in
the building at the same time. Special events including tournaments may be held at this
site; however, it is expected to be an infrequent occurrence and not generate more than
approximately twenty percent greater volumes than listed above. Because of the
infrequency of the tournament occurrence, this study evaluated the typical maximum
patronage estimated to occur at the project site.

Many of the patrons and guests will travel with others to and from the project site in the
same vehicle. Based on observations made by Kimley-Horn at other similar sports
complexes, it is conservatively assumed that average occupancy is 1.5 -2.0 persons per
vehicle.

Customers arriving or departing during 4-6 PM, when combined with other background
traffic, represents the greatest period of total traffic. On weekday late evenings the
facility may attract slightly more visitors than during the 4-6 PM weekdays, but
background traffic is lower, making the overall number of vehicles on the road lower as
well. Saturday and Sunday project patrons are also lower than other times. Therefore,
the weekday PM peak represents the worst case period to evaluate.

With the completion of the project, there will be a new parking layout.

Throat depths at the site driveways will be as follows:

          Edison Way / North Driveway ­ 16 feet
          Edison Way / South Driveway ­ 20 feet


Project Trip Generation
Trip generation for development projects is typically calculated based on rates
contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineer's (ITE) publication, Trip Generation
8th Edition. Trip Generation is a standard reference used by jurisdictions throughout
the country for the estimation of trip generation potential of proposed developments.

A trip is defined in Trip Generation as a single or one-directional vehicle movement with
either the origin or destination at the project site. In other words, a trip can be either "to"
or "from" the site. In addition, a single customer visit to a site is counted as two trips
(i.e., one to and one from the site).

For purposes of determining the worst-case impacts of traffic on the surrounding street
network, the trips generated by a proposed development are typically estimated
between the hours of 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM. Because this project is not open
during the typical AM peak, trip generation was calculated for only the PM peak period.

The ITE land use that most closely matches the proposed indoor sports complex is
Recreational Community Center ­ Land Use Code 495. "Recreational community
centers are stand-alone public facilities similar to and including YMCAs. These facilities
often include classes and clubs for adults and children; a day care or nursery school;
meeting rooms; swimming pools and whirlpools; saunas; tennis, racquetball, handball,
basketball, and volleyball courts; outdoor athletic fields/courts; exercise classes;
weightlifting and gymnastics equipment; locker rooms; and a restaurant or snack bar.
Public access is typically allowed, but a fee may be charged." The PM trip generation
rate for the recreational community center land use is 1.45 trips per 1000 square feet
gross floor area.




EdisonSportsComplex05.FinalTrafficReport_v6.doc   13                                  12 September 2011

                   and Associates, Inc.                United Indoor Sports Complex, Redwood City, CA

Because this land use type is based on a limited number of samples, Kimley-Horn
conducted surveys at two Bay Area sports facilities that are similar to the proposed
indoor sports complex. The surveys were intended to confirm the validity of the ITE rate
and its use for this analysis.

Peak hour trips were counted at the following sites:

           Silvercreek Sportsplex in San Jose, CA ­ The Silvercreek Sportsplex is located
           in San Jose, CA off of Embedded Way. It comprises an estimated 145,000
           square feet and includes 3 roller hockey rinks, 3 soccer fields, batting cages, a
           store, and a restaurant.
           Cabernet Indoor Sports facility in Livermore, CA ­ The Cabernet Indoor Sports
           facility is located in Livermore, CA off of Patterson Pass Road. It comprises an
           estimated 84,000 square feet and includes 3 soccer fields, 6 batting cages, an
           apparel store, and a party room.

An analysis of the trips inbound and outbound at the two other Bay Area sports facilities
resulted in a weighted average PM trip rate of 1.21 trips per 1000 square feet gross
floor area. The directional distribution was 73% entering and 27% exiting.

Since the recreational community center trip generation rate of 1.45 trips per 1000
square feet gross floor area is greater than the trip generation rate of the two indoor
sports complexes, it was conservatively concluded to use the ITE rate for Recreational
Community Center.

The previous beer distribution land use that was operating at the project site is most
appropriately classified as a Truck Terminal (Land Use 030) or General Light Industrial
(Land Use 110). ITE characterizes truck terminals as facilities where goods are
transferred between trucks, between trucks and railroads, or between trucks and ports
and light industrial facilities as free-standing facilities devoted to a single use with
emphasis on activities other than manufacturing and typically have minimal office
space. With the existing size of the project site, a truck terminal would generate 57 PM
peak trips, while a general light industrial land use would generate 67 PM peak trips
based on ITE Trip Generation information. Therefore, to be conservative, the truck
terminal land use was selected to model the beer distribution center. This number of
trips would have also included a large percentage of truck trips. If it is conservatively
assumed that truck trips represent 20 percent of the total vehicle trips, and the truck
trips were converted to passenger car equivalents of two passenger vehicles equal to
one truck, the number is approximately 68 vehicles in the PM peak. Beer distribution
trip generation calculations are shown in Table 4.

operation, including customer and employee trips. Additional trip generation calculations
are contained in the Appendix.

As noted in Table 5, the project will generate approximately 33 new peak PM trips.

For comparison purposes, Table 6, illustrates a comparison of the cumulative trip
generation rate based on individual activities to the Recreational Community Center
land use selected for this study. The trip estimate using individual uses is based on the
following conditions and assumptions:


          ITE Trip Generation does not list all the individual land uses proposed by the
          Project and therefore the most likely land use represented by each individual
          activity was chosen.
          The party room was calculated based on Multipurpose Recreational Facility.

          The soccer field, football field, and basketball court were all calculated as soccer
          fields.
          The restaurant was calculated as high-turnover sit-down restaurant.
          Individual activities trip generation does not account for the interaction among
          different land uses within one site and is therefore an overestimation of the
          number of likely trips generated.

The individual calculations, as well as the field surveys of the Silvercreek and Cabernet
sports facilities, confirms that the trip generation using Recreational Community Center
is valid.


Internal Capture
With multi-use development there is potential for interaction among uses within the site.
These types of trips are considered internal to the site and are "captured" within the site
and do not add to external trips on the adjacent roadway network.

However, because the trip rate for Recreational Community Center already accounts for
any internal interaction between the project's different sports venues, restaurant, etc.,
no internal capture reduction was taken.

Project Trip Pass-By
Some projects generate a specific number of vehicle trips that stop as they pass by the
project as a matter of convenience on their path to another destination. Pass-by trips
attract adjacent traffic from the project site, but are not diverted from another roadway.
Therefore pass-by trips only affect the project driveways and the roadways between
them.

However, it is not anticipated that the proposed project will generate any trips that will
already be on the road and will likely stop as they pass by the site. Therefore, there are
no pass-by trips assumed in the calculations.


Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
A project distribution was developed from a review of traffic counts, street network
connections, local land uses and similar and competing sports facilities. Figure 5
shows the traffic distribution assumed in this traffic report and additional information is
provided in the Appendix.

Based on the assumed trip distribution, new vehicle trips generated by the project were
assigned to the street network as shown in Figure 3. Figure 6 shows the project
generated trips using the above project trip generation table and project trip distribution
and assignment. It was assumed that 30% of the traffic would be coming from the
freeways via US-101 and State Route 84. Due to the confining street network within the
study area (i.e. at-grade railroad crossings at 2nd Avenue, 5th Avenue, Middlefield Road,
and Marsh Road), traffic would likely arrive to the project site via Marsh Road to Fair
Oaks Avenue and Bay Road to 2nd Avenue or 5th Avenue. It was assumed 70% of the
traffic would be from the surrounding area and likely use Middlefield Road and either 2nd
Avenue or 5th Avenue to arrive at the project site. Only nominal traffic may use other
local streets, if any.

Intersections operating unacceptably are bolded.

According to the HCM results, the following intersections do not satisfy the applicable
operational standards without and with the addition of the project trips:

          #5 ­ Middlefield Road / 2nd Avenue
          #11 ­ Fair Oaks Avenue / Marsh Road

The deficiency is a pre-existing condition independent of the sports complex with the
project only having a negligible effect. Since the project does not meet the impact
significance criteria of an increase in the critical movement volume-to-capacity ratio
(V/C) by 0.02 or more to an intersection under project conditions, the project has no
significant impact on any intersection.

It is noted that calculations of delay at saturated conditions (i.e. LOS F) become less
reliable than at LOS E or better. Therefore, delay in excess of 80 seconds is reported in
the table to allow a relative comparison of without and with project conditions and
should not be interpreted as an exact representation of actual delay. Furthermore, at
TWSC intersections, it is possible for delay on the worst approach to be greater than 80
seconds but still have the V/C well below 1.0 due to the HCM method of calculating
capacity of each movement of the approach.


Existing + Project Intersection LOS Traffic Conditions
Existing traffic volumes, combined with vehicle trips expected to be generated by the
United Indoor Sports complex, were evaluated at the study intersections and can be
seen in Figure 7. The lane geometry included in this scenario is shown in Figure 3.


EdisonSportsComplex05.FinalTrafficReport_v6.doc                   18                                           12 September 2011

                   and Associates, Inc.                United Indoor Sports Complex, Redwood City, CA

Intersection locations in the unincorporated areas of San Mateo County operating at an
unacceptable LOS and have an increase in V/C of 0.02 as a result of project traffic are
considered to be subject to a significant impact. However, there are no County
intersections that are subject to an unacceptable LOS and have an increase in V/C of
0.02 as a result of project traffic. Intersection locations in Redwood City operating at an
unacceptable LOS and have an increase in delay of 5 seconds as a result of project
traffic are considered to be subject to a significant impact. However, there are no City
intersections that are subject to an increase in delay of 5 seconds and degradation of
LOS from an acceptable to an unacceptable level as a result of project traffic.



EXISTING PLUS APPROVED CONDITIONS
Traffic operations were evaluated under the Existing + Approved traffic conditions.

Approved and Pending Development Projects in Vicinity of
Site
A number of development projects in the vicinity of the project site are in various stages
of planning, approval, or development. Projects considered for this traffic study were
identified by the County staff and nearby local agencies, such as Redwood City, the
Town of Atherton, and the City of Menlo Park, as having been approved (but not yet
completed or fully occupied), or having a development application submitted, or being
otherwise reasonably foreseeable at the time this traffic analysis for the United Sports
Complex Traffic Report was prepared in 2011. County and local agency staff provided
approved traffic studies for many of the projects, while informed estimates regarding trip
generation and assignment were prepared by Kimley-Horn for the remaining projects
without traffic studies already prepared. One particular development project of interest
is the future Stanford Medical Campus on Bay Road that is currently in the planning
stages. This project may generate numerous vehicular trips throughout the project
study area, but is not planned to begin construction before the United Sports Complex is
operational and doesn't have an ultimate completion for approximately 20 years or
more. Therefore the Stanford Medical Campus was not included as an approved or
pending project in this traffic study.

Approved and pending projects assumed in this analysis scenario are illustrated in
Figure 8 in the Appendix. Trip generation assumptions for these approved projects
based on the land use information provided are included in the Appendix.

Existing traffic volumes, combined with vehicle trips expected to be generated by the
approved and pending development projects, were evaluated at the study intersections
and are presented in Figure 9. Results of the analysis are presented in Table 8.

Note: Intersections that are operating below acceptable levels are shown in BOLD.


Intersections operating unacceptably are bolded.

According to the HCM results, the following intersections do not satisfy the applicable
operational standards without and with the addition of the project trips:

          #5 ­ Middlefield Road / 2nd Avenue
          #6 ­ Middlefield Road / 5th Avenue
          #11 ­ Fair Oaks Avenue / Marsh Road

The deficiency is a pre-existing condition independent of the sports complex with the
project only having a negligible effect. Since the project does not meet the impact
significance criteria of an increase in the critical movement volume-to-capacity ratio
(V/C) by 0.02 or more to an intersection under project conditions, the project has no
significant impact on any intersection.

It is noted that calculations of delay at saturated conditions (i.e. LOS F) become less
reliable than at LOS E or better. Therefore, delay in excess of 80 seconds is reported in
the table to allow a relative comparison of without and with project conditions and
should not be interpreted as an exact representation of actual delay. Furthermore, at
TWSC intersections, it is possible for delay on the worst approach to be greater than 80
seconds but still have the V/C well below 1.0 due to the HCM method of calculating
capacity of each movement of the approach.

Existing + Approved + Project Intersection LOS Traffic
Conditions
Existing traffic volumes, combined with vehicle trips expected to be generated by
approved and pending developments and the United Indoor Sports complex were
evaluated at the study intersections and can be seen in Figure 10. The lane geometry
included in this scenario is shown in Figure 3. Intersection locations in the
unincorporated areas of San Mateo County operating at an unacceptable LOS and have
an increase in V/C of 0.02 as a result of project traffic are considered to be subject to a
significant impact. However, there are no County intersections that are subject to an
unacceptable LOS and have an increase in V/C of 0.02 as a result of project traffic.
Intersection locations in Redwood City operating at an unacceptable LOS and have an
increase in delay of 5 seconds as a result of project traffic are considered to be subject
to a significant impact. However, there are no City intersections that are subject to an
increase in delay of 5 seconds and degradation of LOS from an acceptable to an
unacceptable level as a result of project traffic.



VEHICLE QUEUING
As congestion increases it is common for traffic at signals and stop signs to form lines of
stopped (or queued) vehicles. The term "vehicle queuing" refers to the distances that
vehicles will back up in each direction approaching an intersection. Queue lengths were
determined for each turn pocket. The 95th percentile queue length represents a
condition where 95 percent of the time during the peak period, traffic volumes and
related queuing will be at, or less, than the queue length determined by the analysis.
This is referred to as the "95th percentile queue." However, at all-way stop-controlled
intersections, 95th percentile queuing is not reported in HCM calculations; therefore, an
average queue is used at all-way stop-controlled intersections. Queuing was estimated
under the various development conditions and in consideration of the planned
intersection and signal timing improvements. A typical vehicle length of 25 feet is used
in the queuing analysis. A summary of the queuing results is included in the Appendix.
The results indicate no instances where queuing in the dedicated turn lanes may
exceed the storage limits of the turn pockets.

The County of San Mateo and Redwood City do not establish a threshold that
constitutes a significant queuing impact but instead simply requires that queuing results
be reported along with a recommendation of how queuing that exceeds available
storage can be addressed. For purposes of this analysis, queuing is considered a
significant impact since queues that exceed turn pocket length can create a hazardous
condition. Thus, for purposes of this analysis, a queuing impact was considered to
occur under conditions where the queue extends beyond the turn pocket by 25 feet, or
more (i.e., the length of one vehicle), or where the project contributes 25 feet or more to
a queue which extends beyond the turn pocket under pre-project conditions.

The analysis showed that no turn bays are exceeded under projected traffic volumes
associated with the project.



POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON TRANSIT, BICYCLE, AND
PEDESTRIAN MOBILITY
The project was evaluated to determine if it would likely conflict with adopted policies,
plans, or programs supporting alternative transportation (e.g., bus turnouts, bicycle
racks) or generate pedestrian, bicycle, or transit travel demand that would not be
accommodated by transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities and plans.

Patrons of the United Indoor Sports have the option of driving, taking transit, walking or
bicycling. For those taking transit they can reach the site via Routes 270, 296, 297 or
397 of the San Mateo County Transit (SamTrans) system.

The location of the proposed project is in unincorporated San Mateo County. However it
lies within the sphere of influence of Redwood City, according to the Redwood City
General Plan. There is no census data for unincorporated San Mateo County and
therefore Redwood City was used for this analysis. According to the U.S. Census' 2005
­ 2007 American Community Survey, 3.3% of Redwood City residents use transit to
travel to work. This typically represents the highest level of transit ridership during the
day, with other periods being lower such as when shoppers commonly travel to the
store. If it is conservatively assumed that 3.3% of customers and employees will use
transit during the peak hours of the day, it represents approximately 3 passengers in the
weekday PM peak periods. (Note: The estimated number of transit users has not been
deducted from the project traffic trip generation calculations presented in Table 5).

Data was not readily available for peak hour ridership levels on the SamTrans system
but during the weekday periods, the routes operate generally every 30 to 60 minutes
and observations indicate the sufficient capacity exists on the buses to accommodate
the potential additional transit demand. Furthermore, dispersion of the project-
generated riders to the bus routes would result in a minimal effect on transit capacity.
Thus the project impact on transit service is determined to be less than significant.

Although most pedestrians and cyclists will originate their trips from the neighborhoods
in close proximity to the sports complex, American Community Survey data suggests
that 4.8% of customers or workers are anticipated to walk or bicycle to the project than
will ride transit. This represents approximately 5 people in the weekday PM peak
periods. (Note: The estimated number of pedestrians and cyclists has not been
deducted from the project traffic trip generation calculations presented in Table 5).

There are adequate pedestrian walkways from the project site to the existing sidewalks
on Edison Way. Furthermore, pedestrians will be able to use the continuous sidewalk
facilities within the neighborhoods and on streets adjacent to the United Indoor Sports


EdisonSportsComplex05.FinalTrafficReport_v6.doc   23                                  12 September 2011

site. This will allow United Indoor Sports patrons and employees to conveniently walk
from nearby destinations or access transit services.

There are currently no existing bicycle facilities near the site or within the project study
area. However, there are community proposed bike lanes and bike routes along 2nd
Avenue, 5th Avenue, Bay Road, and Middlefield Road within the study area according to
the Redwood City General Plan. Cyclists will currently be able to use the neighborhood
streets adjacent to the project site. Bicycle access is available along both project
driveways and the north-south drive aisle that runs along the building. No capacity
deficiencies are anticipated for pedestrian or bicycle facilities.

There are adequate transit facilities adjacent to the project site with continuous
sidewalks and ramps to the transit stop locations.

In addition, the project will construct necessary on-site sidewalks, walkways, bicycle
parking, and other amenities in compliance with adopted policies, plans and programs;
thus, the project's impact on transit, pedestrian or bicycle facilities is determined to be
less than significant.



SITE ACCESS, CIRCULATION, AND PARKING
On site circulation was evaluated at the project's two driveways and within the project
site.

As noted previously, all site driveways provide single lane ingress and egress.

Throat depths at the site driveways are as follows:

          Edison Way / North Driveway ­ 16 feet
          Edison Way / South Driveway ­ 20 feet

Blocked parking isles can generate on-site congestion and inhibit efficient parking lot
circulation. However, an analysis of on-site queuing with the proposed project indicates
that vehicles are not expected to queue up beyond the depth of the driveway throats
and thus would not block parking aisles. The queuing analysis showed that the throat
depths at the site driveways were more than adequate to accommodate on-site vehicles
during the peak hours.

Parking aisles are oriented along the United Indoor Sports complex which allows
patrons to walk to their vehicles without having to pass between parked vehicles.

It is expected that only small delivery trucks will serve the United Indoor Sports complex
via the North Driveway off Edison Way. Once on site, trucks can maneuver to the north

of the building to the loading dock at the northeast corner of the building. The parking
and circulation layout provides convenient access to the loading docks.

Internal driveways have been designed to avoid congestion and hazards. Sightlines
and turning radii appear to be sufficient to provide for maneuvering by delivery trucks
and passenger vehicles. Sight distances, emergency vehicle access, delivery truck
access, and on-site circulation planned for the project appear to be generally adequate,
and would be subject to refinements as part of the design review process.


Parking
The County of San Mateo Zoning Regulations provisions for the "M-1/Edison/NFO"
Light Industrial District/Edison Way/North Fair Oaks zoning designation are applicable
to the development of the project site. Section 6119 of the Zoning Code provides the
parking requirements applicable to the proposed project. The parking requirement for
the M-1/Edison/NFO zone states: "The number of off-street parking spaces required
shall be set forth in the following table:

                           USE                              PARKING SPACES REQUIRED
                                                  1 space for each 2 employees on largest shift; in no
     All Uses Not Enumerated Above
                                                  case less than 1 space for each 2,000 sq. ft of floor
    Which Are Permitted in "M" Districts
                                                                        area.

The parking requirement of "1 space for each 2,000 sq. ft of floor area" yields a parking
requirement of 35 parking spaces for the 69,440 square feet project. The project has
provided 124 total parking spaces. Therefore, the project's parking impacts would be
less than significant.

Patrons, staff and other visitors are estimated to typically peak on weekday evenings
between 6 PM and 10 PM. During this time period the maximum number of individuals
at the sports complex is 150. Conservatively assuming that auto occupancy is 1.5
persons per vehicle, maximum parking demand for the site would be 100 vehicles. At
this level the site would still have roughly 20% of the parking spaces available. On
tournament days when demand increases by up to 20%, there would still be adequate
parking in the 124 on-site spaces. Therefore, it is not expected that parking will spill out
into adjacent residential areas.



TRAFFIC SIGNAL WARRANTS
For this study, data was available for the PM peak hour periods; therefore, Kimley-Horn
checked the traffic volumes at the unsignalized intersections against the peak hour



EdisonSportsComplex05.FinalTrafficReport_v6.doc        25                                  12 September 2011

warrant in the California Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, January 21, 2010.
The criteria for Warrant #3 are met when traffic volumes on the major and minor
approaches exceed specified thresholds for at least one hour of the day. The warrant
applies to traffic conditions during a one hour peak that are sufficiently high such that
minor street traffic experiences excessive delay in entering and crossing the street.
Warrants were evaluated in the Existing scenario with and without the project. When
intersections satisfy the peak hour volume warrant, it does not necessarily mean that a
signal will or should be installed. For example, in some instances, the intersection may
operate at an acceptable level even though volumes satisfy one or more signal warrants
such as at a right in/out driveway.

The Traffic Signal Warrant #3 ­ Peak Hour Volume Warrant was satisfied for the
following unsignalized intersections:

          Intersection #2 ­ Bay Road and 5th Avenue in the Existing Scenario
          Intersection #2 ­ Bay Road and 5th Avenue in the Existing + Project Scenario

SUMMARY   OF    PROJECT                                              IMPACTS                    AND
RECOMMENDED MITIGATION
Based on the results of the traffic analysis and evaluation of the proposed site plan
there were no impacts noted.

There are no intersections that meet the impact significance criteria for the County of
San Mateo, with the addition of project:

          The level of service at a study intersection to drop below the established
          threshold (LOS D)
          An unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F) under baseline conditions experiences an
          increase in the critical movement volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) by 0.02 or more
          to an intersection under project conditions

There are no intersections that meet the impact significance criteria for Redwood City,
with the addition of project:

          The level of service at a study intersection to drop below the established
          thresholds (LOS D)
          An unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F) under baseline conditions experiences an
          increase in the average delay by five or more seconds for a signalized
          intersection
          An unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F) under baseline conditions experiences an
          increase in the delay by five or more seconds and satisfies the Peak Hour
          Volume warrant for an unsignalized intersection

Therefore, it is concluded that the project can be implemented without creating any
significant impacts to intersection operations or queuing. All parking is expected to be
accommodated on site without affecting nearby residential areas.

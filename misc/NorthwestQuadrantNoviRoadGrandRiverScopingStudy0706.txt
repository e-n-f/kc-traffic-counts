1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1    PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In the 1990s the City of Novi received a Transportation Economic Development Funding
Category A grant for construction of a new road (Crescent Boulevard) extending west from Novi
Road from the end of the existing Fonda Drive and south to Grand River Avenue. An industrial
spur road extending west to the General Filters site was also proposed as part of the project.
Preliminary design plans were prepared by JCK & Associates. Due to delays caused by right-of-
way acquisition, the grant was rescinded in 1999. The City has now acquired the necessary
right-of-way and easements to proceed with the project and needs to determine the costs
associated with moving forward with construction. The project is being referred to as the Grand
River & Novi Road Northwest Quadrant Ring Road.

The City of Novi has contracted with Anderson, Eckstein & Westrick, Inc. to perform the
engineering consulting services for the scoping study for the Grand River & Novi Road
Northwest Quadrant Ring Road.

The following are a summary of items included in the original design of the project:
   · Four lane boulevard (Crescent Blvd) extending from Fonda Drive to Grand River Avenue
        with 5 foot wide sidewalks on both sides and a 10 foot wide center median
   · Industrial spur road extending to the west from Crescent Blvd.
   · ConSpan bridge structure (20' span; 7' rise) where the proposed roadway crossed the
        Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River
   · Retaining wall along the north side of the Industrial Spur road and portions of the east
        side of Crescent Blvd.
   · Wetland impacts resulting in offsite mitigation
   · Downstream improvements of the lower road crossing at Flint Street and the Walled
        Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River (lower Flint Street crossing)
   · Elimination of triple culverts on the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River
        behind the City Center Plaza
   · A decorative mast arm traffic signal at the new intersection of Crescent Blvd and Grand
        River Avenue and at Grande River Avenue and Novi Road.

AEW's scope of services included review of the original design plans and permits, evaluation
and recommendations regarding the proposed roadway extension, review of the original
hydraulic model for existing conditions and post-project conditions, cost estimates, and
geotechnical evaluation and recommendations. Throughout the report, we have emphasized in
boldface print recommendations and items which will require additional attention as this project
moves to the design and construction phase.

1.2    RIGHT OF WAY
Based on our review of the available data provided by the City of Novi, it appears that all rights-
of-way and easements which were proposed as part of the original project were obtained.
Across the Adell Brothers Childrens Trust Parcel (2215476045), the City of Novi was granted
the requested right-of-way, a temporary construction easement and a drainage easement.

Additionally, the preliminary hydraulic analysis recommended removal of the existing
abandoned triple culverts located between the Upper Flint Street crossing and the Lower Flint
Street crossing. Since these culverts are located in the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle
Rouge River outside the Flint Street right-of-way, removal of these culverts will require the City
Center Plaza property owner's permission or a temporary construction easement. It is our
understanding that City Center Plaza is currently proposing to construct the next phases

                                                 1
of this development. While this is part of a different project, it may be prudent for the City
to discuss the easements across the property with the property owners at this time, in
order to allow access for removal of the existing triple culverts.

1.3    GEOTECHNICAL INFORMATION
Based on the geotechnical field measurements, approximately half of the soils on the site do not
appear to be suitable for support of the roadway due to wetlands and organic materials. As part
of the construction plans and wetland mitigation requirements, all vegetation, topsoil and
unsuitable organic soils will be required to be removed in their entirety from the area of influence
for the pavement, bridge wingwall, or retaining walls.

1.4    UTILITIES
The only utilities proposed as part of the project are storm sewer to drain the roadway and
electrical conduit to allow installation of street lighting along the proposed boulevard in the
future. Stormwater is proposed to be directed to stormwater pretreatment facilities which include
a forebay on the east side of the road and a swirl concentrator chamber on the north side of the
proposed bridge. A few minor utility conflicts appear to exist along the route of the project which
will result in relocation of one existing utility pole and one existing fire hydrant.

1.5 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
FLOODPLAIN

LOWER FLINT STREET CROSSING
Review of the 2006 Flood Insurance Study indicates that the lower Flint Street crossing of the
Walled Lake Branch of the Rouge River results in an increase in the floodplain elevation of
approximately 8 feet. In order to decrease the floodplain elevation created by this restriction in
the flow we recommend replacing the lower Flint Street Crossing with a single structure that will
provide 84 to 110 square feet of flow area. This downstream investment is proposed to minimize
the upstream costs and impacts on property.

ABANDONED TRIPLE CULVERTS
Upstream of the lower Flint Street crossing, triple culverts exist which used to serve a
pedestrian crossing of the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River. The necessity of this
footbridge has been eliminated and the culverts are failing. If the lower Flint Street
improvements are performed and these culverts remain, they will likely act as a flow restriction.
We recommend that the triple culverts be removed.

PROPOSED CRESCENT BLVD. CROSSING
The preliminary hydraulic report showed that although the proposed downstream improvements
lowered the floodplain significantly, the proposed Crescent Blvd. bridge resulted in an increase
of 0.21 feet in the floodplain elevation. Offsite increases in the floodplain are not generally
acceptable. Therefore, we assumed that the proposed bridge span will be increased from the
original design of 20 foot span x 7 foot rise to a 24 foot span x 8 foot rise structure.

WETLANDS
City of Novi wetlands inventory maps are generally consistent with the wetlands depicted on the
preliminary design plans. A Previously issued MDEQ permit allowed for 1.38 acres of fill in the
regulated wetlands in consideration for 2.32 acres of offsite mitigation. These acreages will
need to be recalculated and reconfirmed by the MDEQ. It may be necessary to disturb
additional wetlands in order to construct stormwater quality features or to relocate a portion of
the stream which may require additional compensation for the impacted wetlands.


                                                 2
WALLED LAKE BRANCH OF THE MIDDLE ROUGE RIVER
We are proposing to relocate approximately 200 lineal feet of the stream. This will accomplish
the following goals:
            · Provide an area for pretreatment of stormwater discharge from the roadway
            · Minimize soil loss, soil erosion and negative impact from stream geomorphology
            · Provide floodway conveyance capacity

1.6    PERMITS
The following permits will be required to be updated or obtained in order to perform the project:
           · MDEQ Part 301 ­ Inland Lakes and Streams
           · MDEQ Part 303 ­ Wetlands
           · MDEQ Part 31 ­ Floodplain
           · FEMA Floodway Revision
           · Road Commission for Oakland County ­ New intersection & signalization
           · City of Novi - Soil Erosion & Sedimentation Control

1.7    DESIGN COMPONENTS
The following is a summary of items included in the proposed design of the project:
   · Four lane boulevard (Crescent Blvd) extending from Fonda Drive to Grand River Avenue
        with 5 foot wide sidewalks on both sides and a 12 foot wide center median
   · Mill and resurfacing of the existing Fonda Drive
   · Reconstruction of the existing Fonda Drive & Novi Road traffic signal with a decorative
        mast arm style signal with lighted street names, Autoscope cameras, pedestrian
        pushbuttons, decorative bases and street lights on the poles
   · Industrial Spur road extending to the west from Crescent Blvd. to the Progressive Tool
        service drive.
   · Precast bridge structure (24' span; 8' rise) where the proposed roadway crossed the
        Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River ­ Several decorative options are
        presented in the report
   · Retaining wall along the north side of the Industrial Spur road and portions of the east
        side of Crescent Blvd.- Several decorative options are presented in the report.
   · Wetland impacts resulting in review of offsite mitigation
   · Downstream improvements of the lower road crossing at Flint Street and the Walled
        Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River (lower Flint Street crossing)
   · Elimination of triple culverts on the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River
        behind the City Center Plaza
   · A traffic signal at the new intersection of Crescent Blvd and Grand River Avenue with
        decorative mast arm style poles with lighted street names, Autoscope cameras,
        pedestrian pushbuttons, decorative bases and street lights on the poles
   · Options for roundabouts are provided, but are not recommended due to the
        additional right-of-way requirements.

1.8    COST ESTIMATES
Construction cost estimates were prepared for the proposed construction. Various options were
presented for the bridge structures and the retaining walls. Based on these estimates, the total
estimated cost for the project will range from approximately $3.75 million to $4.22 million,
including construction, engineering, contingencies, construction staking, construction
administration, construction observation, updated wetlands flagging, updated hydraulic
modeling, topographical survey for the hydraulic modeling, and permit fees. The original cost
estimate dated prepared by JCK November 30, 1999 was approximately $1.7 million for
construction only.

                                                 3
For the sake of comparison, the following items were not included in the 1999 cost estimate:
   · Design Engineering, Contingencies, Construction Staking, Construction Administration,
       & Construction Observation.
   · Updated wetlands flagging, updated hydraulics modeling, topographical survey for
       hydraulic modeling, and permit fees.
   · Resurfacing Fonda Drive from Expo Center Drive to Novi Road.
   · Relocation of approximately 200 feet of the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge
       River.
   · Wetland plantings.
   · Stormwater pre-treatment facilities including Vortechnics structure and stormwater pre-
       treatment pond and forebay.
   · Electrical conduit and irrigation system in the proposed Crescent Boulevard median.
   · Reconstruction of the Fonda Drive & Novi Road traffic signal.
   · Reconstruction of the Fonda Drive & Novi Road intersection.

Also, the following are items which have been modified since the 1999 estimate was prepared:
   · The original estimate for the Crescent Boulevard and Novi Road traffic signal was for a
        span wire construction with two poles. The City of Novi wants to install decorative mast
        arm signals which is consistent with current signal improvements throughout the
        community.
   · The original estimate for the proposed Crescent Boulevard and Novi Road traffic signal
        was based on span wire construction and did not include decorative mast arms,
        illuminated street signs, cameras, street lighting, and other amenities which are now
        standard throughout the City of Novi.
   · The downstream improvements along the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge
        River at Flint Street included the placement of twin 48" diameter culverts. Due to
        maintenance concerns and flow capacity, the current recommendation it to replace the
        existing undersized culvert with a 6 foot by 14 foot concrete box culvert.
   · Another factor which impacts the estimate is time. The original estimate was prepared in
        1999. Material, labor, and total construction costs have increased based on an annual
        rate of inflation of 3 percent.

1.9    NEXT STEPS
In order to move forward with the design of proposed roadways and associated site work we
recommend that the following steps be taken.
    · Detailed topographical survey of the project site.
    · Engineering plan design of the project based on the detailed topographical survey.
    · Updated hydraulic modeling, including topographical survey of the stream, extending
       from just downstream of the lower Flint Street crossing of the Walled Lake Branch of the
       Middle Rouge River to upstream of the proposed bridge, which models all existing and
       proposed. The model should include floodplain and floodway impacts based on removal
       of the triple culverts and should include final sizing recommendations for the Lower Flint
       Street crossing and the Crescent Boulevard crossing. The model should also incorporate
       the 200 feet of proposed stream direction.
    · Updated wetlands flagging and topographical survey
    · Traffic signal design for the Fonda Drive and Novi Road traffic signal and the Crescent
       Blvd and Grand River Avenue Traffic Signal.
    · Study of the potential realignment of Flint Street and Grand River Avenue to align with
       the proposed Crescent Boulevard and Grand River Avenue to potentially create the
       Southwest Quadrant of Novi Road/ Grand River Avenue right-of-way.
    · Evaluate options for potential funding sources. ("see Section 8)

2.0    BACKGROUND

2.1    PROJECT HISTORY
In the 1990s the City of Novi received a Transportation Economic Development Funding
Category A grant for construction of a new road extending west from Novi Road at the end of
the existing Fonda Drive, and continuing south to Grand River Avenue. The project included a
spur road to serve the General Filters property west of the project. The plans prepared by JCK
& Associates included approximately 1800 lineal feet of a new four lane boulevard (Crescent
Boulevard) from the Fonda Drive extension to Grand River Avenue, and a two lane road
(Industrial Spur) to service the General Filters site. The project also included a crossing of the
Middle Branch of the Rouge River and concrete sidewalks on both sides of the road.

Due to delays caused by right-of-way acquisition, the grant was rescinded in 1999. Presently,
the City has acquired the necessary right-of-way and easements to proceed with the project and
needs to quantify the costs and design considerations associated with moving forward with
construction.

2.2    PROJECT SITE
The site is located northwest of the intersection of Grand River Avenue and Novi Road, as
shown below. Along the proposed roadway alignment, the site is heavily wooded or covered
within medium to heavy brush. Trees become sparser toward Grand River Avenue, and along
the west end of the proposed Industrial Spur. The Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge
River crosses the proposed Crescent Boulevard alignment just west of the existing cul-de-sac at
the end of Fonda Drive. Low-lying areas which were previously designated as wetlands on the
JCK plans are present along the north side of the proposed Industrial Spur and near the
intersection of Crescent Boulevard and Industrial Spur.

Industrial and commercial properties surround the site. The existing topographic survey of the
site was not available, however based on the City of Novi GIS contours the existing ground
elevations along centerline of the Crescent Boulevard alignment range from approximately 903
to 918 feet.

2.3    EXISTING RIGHT-OF-WAY (ROW)
Based on the preliminary layout provided by JCK, the City of Novi pursued and acquired right-
of-way, easements, and land to allow for construction of the project. The City has acquired the
right-of-way and easements as shown in the sketch below. A more detailed map of the right-of-
way and easements which were acquired or are pending is provided in Appendix D. The legal
descriptions and recorded documents, along with a corresponding sketch are contained in
Appendix A, Land Acquisition. Easements were acquired for storm drainage or temporary
construction.

A review of the available information indicates that the City obtained much of the right-of-way
and easements necessary to accommodate the proposed four lane concrete boulevard (27 foot
wide, back of curb to back of curb each direction, with a 12 foot wide median) for the proposed
Crescent Boulevard and the proposed 2 lane (27 foot wide concrete pavement section) for the
Industrial Spur.

A court order has been entered allowing the condemnation of right-of-way on the property
owned by the Adell Brothers Childrens Trust (Parcel 2215476045), and transferring the right-of-
way and easements to the City but the landowner is appealing the value of the land. Apparently,
the order had not been recorded at the time of this report. The following table provides a list of
the right-of-way pursued and the status of the easement or right of way acquisition. The items in
this table correspond to the properties shown in Figure 2, the Right of Way and Easement
Summary.

It should also be noted, the existing properties which contain Fonda Drive and Expo Center
Drive show up on the tax rolls as owned by the State of Michigan, but are City of Novi right-of-
way according to City staff.

2.4     DOWNSTREAM IMPROVEMENTS ALONG FLINT STREET
South of Grand River Avenue, the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River crosses Flint
Street in two locations. The Upper Flint Street crossing is located just south of Grand River and
the Lower Flint Street crossing is located just west of Novi Road. The preliminary hydraulic
calculations performed as part of the original design recommended downstream improvements
along the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River at the Lower Flint Street crossing, as
well as removal of the abandoned triple culverts between the Upper and Lower Flint Street
crossings.

The recommended improvements at the Lower Flint Street Crossing are proposed within the
existing Flint Street right-of-way. If there is not adequate space within the existing right-of-way,
when a final plan is developed, a temporary construction easement may be necessary from
Hunter Development Company, the downstream property owner.

Additionally, the preliminary hydraulic analysis recommended removal of the existing
abandoned triple culverts located between the Upper Flint Street crossing and the Lower Flint
Street crossing. Since these culverts are located in the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle
Rouge River outside the Flint Street right-of-way, removal of these culverts will require the City
Center Plaza property owner's permission or a temporary construction easement. It is our
understanding that City Center Plaza is currently proposing to construct the next phases
of this development. It may be prudent for the City to request easements across this
property at this time, in order to allow access for removal of the existing triple culverts.

3.0    GEOTECHNICAL INFORMATION

3.1    SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
G2 Consulting Group performed ten soil borings at the locations shown below ranging in depth
from 10 to 20 feet below existing grades. Laboratory testing was performed on samples
obtained from the soil borings. The testing included visual engineering classification, natural
moisture content, organic matter content (loss-on-ignition), Atterberg limits, and unconfined
compressive strength determinations. Test results were used to prepare the geotechnical
engineering report, which includes recommendations regarding subgrade preparation, bridge
foundation design, pavement design, and construction considerations, as they relate to the
onsite geotechnical conditions.

The groundwater conditions will fluctuate depending on the time of year, but in general
groundwater will effect construction within the wetland areas where the groundwater seepage
ranges in depth from 1 to 6 feet below the existing grades. Based on higher groundwater
elevations, we recommended that edge drain be placed along both sides of the roadway. Within
the wetland areas, there is a higher concentration of organic matter which is unsuitable for
subgrade material. This material will have to be undercut and replaced with suitable Class II
backfill or course aggregate material as needed. Areas where a higher concentration of organic
material exists, a geogrid mat may be needed in conjunction with crushed concrete to bridge
between the subgrade and base to minimize depth and area of undercutting. Outside the
wetland areas the existing material appears suitable for subgrade material but pockets of
unsuitable material may be encountered requiring subgrade undercutting.

The geotechnical engineering report can be found in its entirety in Appendix B, Geotechnical
Report.

3.2    DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

3.2.1 Pavement Section
G2 performed pavement design analyses in accordance with the "AASHTO Guide for Design of
Pavement Structures." Based on the results of the analyses, the recommended minimum
proposed Portland cement concrete pavement section consists of 8 inches of non-reinforced
MDOT P1 concrete supported on 6 inches of MDOT 21AA dense-graded aggregate.

3.2.2 Bridge
Assuming moderate foundation loads, as would be expected for the proposed short-span
culvert/bridge, the structure was recommended to be supported on shallow spread foundations.
Currently, the proposed bottom of foundation elevations are unknown; however, based on the
roadway profile sheet prepared by JCK, we anticipate the proposed bottom of foundations may
be at approximate Elevation 901.5 feet. The recommended net allowable soil bearing capacity
is 4,000 psf for foundations extending through the existing unsuitable organic soils and very
loose to loose granular soils and bearing within the underlying native very stiff silty clay.

3.2.3 Retaining Wall
The geotechnical investigation included evaluation for sloped fill embankments or mechanically
stabilized earth (MSE) walls along the alignment. If sloped fill embankments are constructed,
permanent fill slopes may be designed at inclinations as steep as 2:1 (horizontal: vertical),
provided the recommendations presented in the Site Preparation section of the report are
adhered to. It is recommended that embankment slopes be protected against erosion in
accordance with current approved MDOT standard specifications.

The full geotechnical report contains recommendations for shallow foundation or deep
foundation alternatives. In part, the type of foundation selected will depend on the type of bridge
or retaining wall selected.

3.2.4 Engineered Fill
The plan and profile sheets prepared by JCK & Associates, dated April and October 1996, were
used as an estimate of possible final grades along the roadway and bridge alignment. Based on
this information, we anticipate that site grades will have to be raised as much as 8 feet along the
centerline of the roadway alignment and at the approaches to the bridge to accommodate the
anticipated finished grades and Conspan bridge system elevations based on the Walled Lake
Branch of Middle Rouge River floodway elevations. Some small grade cuts, on the order of 2 to
3 feet, may be required along portions of the roadway alignment.

We anticipate earthwork operations will consist of removing topsoil and unsuitable organic soils
from within the vicinity of the proposed roadway alignment and bridge, excavating for
foundations for the bridge, backfilling behind the new bridge abutments and wingwalls, raising
existing grades with engineered fill, cutting grades in some areas, and preparing the roadway
alignment subgrades.

All vegetation, topsoil and unsuitable organic soils should be removed in their entirety from
within the areas to receive embankment fills or bridge wingwall backfills. The existing silty sand
fill to a depth of 2 feet within boring B-1, the peat to a depth of 3-1/2 feet within boring B-2, and
the organic silt to a depth of 13 feet within boring B-8 are not suitable for support of road
embankment and pavement; therefore, these soils should be undercut to stable, non-organic
soils. In addition to these soils, during construction the exposed subgrade should be visually
evaluated for additional unstable and/or unsuitable soil conditions. The geotechnical report

                                                  13
recommended removal of any unstable or unsuitable areas and replacement with engineered
fill. The report also provides for the event of unstable subgrade and recommends crushed
concrete, biaxial geogrid or woven geofabric to stabilize the subgrade prior to the placement of
engineered fill operations. A layer of MDOT 21AA dense-grade aggregate should be placed
over the crushed concrete prior to placement of engineered fill to minimize migration of fines
into the open voids of the crushed concrete.

Engineered fill should meet the requirements of MDOT Class II granular and should be
compacted to achieve a density of at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density as
determined by the Modified Proctor compaction test (ASTM D 1557).


4.0    UTILITIES

4.1    EXISTING UTILITY DATA
Watermain, storm sewer, and sanitary sewer currently exist along the Grand River Avenue and
Novi Road rights-of-way. Sanitary sewer extends northerly from Grand River Avenue east of the
river to the existing Novi Expo Center and Fonda Drive. It will cross the road in one location.
The preliminary plan for this project contained in Appendix C shows the existing utilities in the
vicinity of the project.

Utility poles containing electrical service exist along the west side of the proposed Crescent
Blvd. rights-of-way, approximately 250 feet north of Grand River Avenue, and run easterly
approximately 350 feet and then southerly, crossing Grand River Avenue. In order to
construct the proposed road and General Filters driveway, relocation of one utility pole
may be necessary.

In order to construct the proposed Crescent Blvd. approach onto Grand River Avenue, it
may be necessary to relocate one existing fire hydrant on the north side of Grand River.

4.2    PROPOSED UNDERGROUND UTILITIES
Sanitary Sewer and Water Main
Based on the original design plans and subsequent conversations with City Engineering staff,
water main and sanitary sewer were not intended to be extended along Crescent Boulevard.
The properties along the proposed road have access to sanitary sewer and water main along
Grand River Avenue and Novi Road.

For future consideration, underground utilities cannot be located within the specified setback of
the fill required for the chosen wall system. This is because the wall tieback grid system and
structural backfill will be located within the designated setback area.

Storm Sewer
In order to properly drain the road and right-of-way, storm sewer is proposed in the center
median along the proposed road. The preliminary design layout is a crowned roadway with
catch basins along the curb and gutter. Catch basin drainage is proposed to be directed to a
storm sewer located under the center median.

Since the majority of the bedding and road base will be engineered fill, we recommend that the
fill placed under the center median consist of pervious materials to allow for groundwater
infiltration for stormwater drainage from the center median. Additionally, the preliminary design
concept for the storm sewer is a perforated pipe which will allow for infiltration of the stormwater
and groundwater recharge.

                                                 14
Electric, Gas, Cable, Telephone
Similar to the sanitary and watermain, all parcels along the proposed roadway currently have
access to electric, gas, cable and telephone service. We anticipate that final design plans will
incorporate decorative street lighting in the center median, which will require electric service.
Location of shallow electrical conduit in the center median should not pose a problem. However,
if the final design plans propose street lighting on both sides of the road, rather than in the
center median, the location of the conduit will have to take into consideration the necessary
clearances between the proposed utility and the retaining wall structural elements. For
estimating purposes, we have included conduit for the street lighting. Street lighting costs can
vary greatly depending on the style, brand, dimensions, and frequency of the lights, therefore
the cost of street lights was not included in the estimates.

Irrigation System
The final design of the roadway should also include an irrigation system within the
proposed boulevard for future landscaping. Location of shallow irrigation lines and
control boxes in the center median should not be problematic for the retaining wall
tieback system.


5.0    ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
There are several environmental aspects that must be considered in order to assess the overall
feasibility of the northwest quadrant ring road. These include Floodplain and Floodway
Hydraulics, Wetlands, Streambank Stabilization, Storm Sewer Pretreatment, and Permitting. As
part of this scoping study, we have performed field reconnaissance as well as evaluated
published data and reports which affect the environment of the Walled Lake Branch of the
Rouge River.

Our recommendations are based upon the review of data from the following sources:
  · October, 1997 Hydraulic Report from JCK & Associates
  · July, 1998 Permit from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality
  · September, 2006 Flood Insurance Study from the Federal Emergency Management
      Agency
  · March, 2007 Geotechnical Report from G2 Consulting Group

5.1    FLOODPLAIN AND FLOODWAY HYDRAULICS

5.1.1 Floodplain
In October, 1997, JCK & Associates prepared a Hydraulic Report which recommended
downstream improvements on the Walled Lake Branch of the Rouge River. These proposed
improvements would lower the 100-year water surface profile and would allow the construction
of the proposed northwest quadrant ring road crossing. JCK's review provided an analysis of
the potential effects of the proposed channel alterations on the Walled Lake Branch of the
Rouge River. The analysis studies the river from Flint Street (lower reach crossing), northerly
approximately 3,350 ft, to the culvert enclosure under the Paragon Steel Corporation building.

The study analyzed the existing conditions, proposed altered conditions, and the resulting
impacts on the floodplain. Their proposed channel modifications included:
   · Downstream hydraulic improvements to lower the floodplain at the ring road site.
   · Filling in floodplain and floodway in the project area to construct the ring road.
   · Constructing the ring road crossing, located approximately 1,060 ft upstream of Grand
       River Avenue.

                                                15
Since JCK's report, downstream changes have occurred which may also affect the
constructability of the ring road. These include:
   · Replacement of the Grand River Avenue crossing and roadway realignment.
   · Construction of a gas station within the floodway at Grand River Avenue.

These impacts are discussed in greater detail within this section of the scoping report.

In order to complete their Hydraulic Report, JCK used information from the 1993 Flood
Insurance Study, and HEC-2 input/output data provided by the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality. Additionally, JCK performed cross section survey within the study area.
It is our understanding that the actual hydraulic models and field survey are no longer available,
but since the model output is available, we are able to review the suitability of their analysis.

The 10-, 50- and 100-year peak flood discharges used in the analysis for the altered portion of
the reach were 460, 695, and 820 cfs respectively. These flows were obtained from the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Novi, revised May 3, 1993. That FIS has since been
superseded by the FIS for Oakland County (all jurisdictions), dated September 29, 2006. Flows
from the current FIS are unchanged from the previous FIS:




5.1.2 Proposed Downstream Hydraulic Improvements
As illustrated below, the flood profile in the 2006 FIS shows that the lower Flint Street crossing
increases the floodplain elevation by approximately 8 feet. This backwater continues upstream
through an abandoned triple culvert crossing, the upper Flint Street crossing, the Grand River
Avenue Crossing, and onto the proposed ring road crossing site.



                                        Prop. crossing location




Figure 5. Flint Street Flood Profiles
                                                   16
In 1997, JCK recommended making hydraulic improvements to the lower Flint Street crossing
and removing the abandoned triple culvert crossing immediately upstream of Flint Street. These
actions reduce the backwater influencing the proposed ring road site. JCK's recommendation
was to install twin 48 in diameter corrugated metal pipe overflow culverts on either side of the
existing 7 ft diameter reinforced concrete pipe culvert at the lower Flint Street crossing and to
remove the abandoned triple culvert crossing, restoring the banks to match the trapezoidal
sections immediately upstream and downstream.

JCK's calculations show, that with these improvements, the 100-year flood stage upstream of
Grand River Avenue would be lowered by approximately 2.4 ft. We support JCK's
recommendation to remove the abandoned triple culvert crossing, but it is our
recommendation that alternative designs be considered to relieve the backwater
condition at the lower Flint Street crossing. We make this recommendation for the following
reasons:
   · JCK's proposed design at the lower Flint Street crossing provides a total flow area of
       63.6 sq. ft. The 100-year flood flow is 820 cfs. The flow velocity required to pass the
       flood flow through the proposed culverts is nearly 13 ft/s. This is an extremely high and
       erosive velocity which creates the potential for washout of the road in a flood.
   · Multiple culvert crossings such as this often perform inadequately because the overflow
       culverts become clogged with sediment and debris. Since the culverts are infrequently
       used, trees and other brush block off the entrance and reduce the conveyance capacity
       of the culverts.
   · It may be necessary to further reduce the backwater influence affecting the proposed
       ring road site in order to permit the road construction. JCK's proposed design still causes
       about a 6 foot increase in the 100-year flood elevation.

While it is not possible to provide an exact sizing recommendation without updating the
hydraulic model, we believe the lower Flint Street crossing should be replaced with a
single structure that will provide approximately 84 to 110 sq. ft. of flow area. For
estimating purposes, we have assumed a 6' x 14' concrete box culvert with wingwalls at
this location. This will lower the velocity is the structure to 7.5 to 9.5 ft/s and lower the head
loss created by the crossing to approximately 2 to 4 ft. This recommendation is based on a
preliminary evaluation of the hydraulic effects the new structure will have on the Upper Flint
Street crossing and on the Grand River Avenue crossing. Though the entire culvert and
wingwalls will be placed within the existing right-of-way, a temporary construction easement me
be required for the installation.

The recommended improvements at the Lower Flint Street Crossing are proposed within the
existing Flint Street right-of-way as discussed in Section 2.3 of this report. MDEQ permits will
also be required as discussed in Section 5.5 of this report.

A hydraulic improvement to the Lower Flint Street crossing also lowers the flood risk in the
vicinity of Grand River Avenue. Both the Upper Flint Street and Grand River Avenue are
overtopped during the 100-year flood. Lowering the backwater on these crossings by replacing
the Lower Flint Street crossing reduces the depth of flooding affecting properties on the south
side of Grand River Avenue.

5.1.3 Proposed Fill in the Floodplain
The proposed ring road extends westerly off of the end of the existing Crescent Blvd., across
the Walled Lake Branch of the Rouge River, then turns southerly, parallel to the river,
terminating at Grand River Avenue. The majority of this proposed road alignment encroaches
into the floodplain and floodway as shown on the 2006 Floodplain map below. The portion of the
proposed road that is parallel to the river will have a retaining wall along the easterly portion of

                                                 17
the roadway. This retaining wall is proposed to be constructed within 10 ft of the west river bank.
JCK's proposed conditions analysis included this encroachment into the floodplain.




                                                      Project Location




                                                                   Lower Flint St.




Figure 6. Floodplain Map

5.1.4 Proposed Ring Road (Crescent Blvd) Crossing
Based on the assumption of a lower tailwater condition due to downstream improvements, JCK
determined a structure size for the proposed ring road crossing. The conceptual design which
was modeled consisted of a single 90 ft long, 20 ft span by 6 ft rise Con-Span bridge with a 1 ft
depressed inlet. JCK depressed the inlet to allow for sufficient cover due to the road grade
elevation constraints. The improved channel beneath the bridge consisted of a trapezoidal
shape, 10 ft bottom width with vertical to 2 horizontal side slopes. The proposed bottom width
compares favorably with the existing bottom widths upstream and downstream from the
crossing which varies from 8 ft to 10 ft wide.

Combining the effects of downstream improvements, the roadway edge retaining wall
encroachment and the proposed bridge, JCK's proposed conditions model results in a 100-year
flood stage increase of 0.21 ft located approximately 35 ft upstream of the proposed bridge. The
model shows that this increase will dissipate 760 ft upstream of the proposed structure. Based
upon review of existing topographical information and a visual inspection, it was JCK's opinion
that the proposed increase is not harmful.



                                                 18
It is important to note that the permit issued by the MDEQ in July of 1998 did not include Part 31
(floodplain) provisions. It is not clear if the MDEQ was aware of, or accepted the increase in the
flood stage that would be caused by this project as proposed by JCK.

As the property upstream of the bridge structure is not owned by the City of Novi, an increase to
the floodplain elevation at this location, while not harmful, may be difficult to permit. Therefore,
we recommend that the cross sectional area of the proposed bridge be increased in order to
help mitigate the overall upstream impact of the proposed bridge. For purposes of this
project, we have made the assumption that the bridge span crossing Crescent Blvd. will
increase to a 24 foot wide, 8 foot rise structure.

5.1.5 Downstream Changes Since JCK's Report
Downstream changes have occurred since JCK's report which may also affect the
constructability of the ring road.

The Grand River Avenue crossing and roadway realignment have likely affected both the
floodplain elevation and the floodway width just downstream of the proposed project location.
Prior to the widening of Grand River Avenue, the old structure was twin 5 ft culverts 66 feet
long. The new structure is an18ft x 4ft three sided box 102.7 feet long. The vertical alignment
was essentially unchanged, raised by only .05 ft.

A gas station redevelopment constructed at the intersection of Grand River Avenue and Flint
Street may also affect the flood elevation since site grades have been altered.

These changes should be included in a new model of the floodplain and floodway
characteristics of the Walled Lake Branch of the Rouge River from downstream of the
Lower Flint Street crossing to upstream of the proposed ring road.

5.1.6 Floodway
JCK's hydraulic model and report do not appear to have adequately studied the proposed
project impacts on the regulatory floodway of Walled Lake Branch of the Rouge River. Some
concerns which must be addressed are:
    · Changes to the regulatory floodway must be approved by the Federal Emergency
        Management Agency by an official Letter of Map Revision. In addition, National Flood
        Insurance regulations require the City to prohibit all construction activity within a
        floodway which causes an increase in the water surface elevation.
    · It appears that assumptions were made that if the floodplain elevation did not change,
        the floodway impacts would also be minimal. The impact of the proposed bridge
        structure on the floodway width will require detailed topographical survey and detailed
        hydraulic analysis.
    · The new 2006 Floodway maps locate the gas station at the southeast corner of Grand
        River and Flint Street within the floodway. The effective Floodway map at the time the
        gas station redevelopment occurred did not map the same floodway line.


5.2 WETLANDS
The wetland delineation depicted on the current City of Novi GIS mapping, as shown below,
appears to be consistent with the wetland mapping which was done when JCK performed their
original conceptual design plans. However, we recommend that the City have a qualified
wetland consultant re-flag the regulatory wetlands on site prior to performing detailed
topographical survey.



                                                 19
Figure 7. Existing Wetlands Map

It is our understanding that an MDEQ permit issued in 1998 allowing for 1.38 acres of fill in the
regulated wetlands in consideration for 2.32 acres of offsite mitigation. These acreages will
need to be recalculated and reconfirmed by the MDEQ. It may be necessary to disturb
additional wetlands in order to construct stormwater quality features such as a stormwater
pretreatment forebay. Alternate stormwater quality features such as use of a vortechs separator,
or a depressed median could be considered to minimize impacts to existing wetlands. This,
along with the stream relocation may require additional compensation for the impacted
wetlands.

5.3     STREAMBANK STABILIZATION ELEMENTS
In the area where the proposed retaining wall will be within 10 feet of the bank, there is the
potential for serious bank erosion and accelerated geomorphology downstream. Field
investigation showed that the existing streambank is already eroded and appears sensitive to
additional stressors. The proposed roadway will constrict the floodway, reflect overbank flow
back to the streambank during high flows, and likely accelerate bank failure.

After our preliminary review of the project site, we strongly believe that employment of both
resistive and redirective bioengineering techniques would be most effective in ensuring bank
stability in the vicinity of the retaining wall and bridge crossing.


                                                20
Resistive bank stabilization methods are applied directly to the streambank or toe and offer
resistance to river or stream forces. Some examples of resistive methods are: rip rap (with or
without live staking), boulder blankets, retaining walls, soil encapsulated revetments, root wads,
lunkers, longitudinal peaked stone toe protection (LPSTP), and longitudinal fill stone (LFSTP).
Below are two examples of possible resistive bank stabilization methods which could be
considered in this project:




Figure 8. Bank Stabilization Methods

Redirective methods are based on energy management which requires extensive knowledge of
the stream hydraulics. These methods are a proactive approach which if applied properly and in
conjunction with resistive bank stabilization methods, will result in a permanent solution. Some
examples of redirective methods are: stream relocation, bendway weirs, and rock vanes. Below
is a sketch of multiple bendway weirs constructed in succession to redirect the energy of the
stream and a rock vane, which when properly designed, will also provide aquatic habitat.

                                                21
Figure 9. Weir Details and Sections

We are proposing to relocate approximately 200 lineal feet of the stream. This will accomplish
the following goals:

           ·   Provide an area for pretreatment of stormwater discharge from the roadway
           ·   Minimize soil loss, soil erosion and negative impact from stream geomorphology
           ·   Provide floodway conveyance capacity

The final hydraulic analysis will also depict the floodway impacts. Relocation of the stream
further from the retaining wall will allow for lowering of the bank and additional floodway
conveyance capacity which is necessary to offset the impact of filling the floodway for the
roadway construction.

5.4    STORM SEWER SYSTEM AND PRETREATMENT
Since issuance of the original permits for work in the floodplain and wetlands, regulatory
agencies have modified their standards. Presently, it is typical for Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to require a demonstration and analysis of all feasible
alternatives to minimize impacts on the floodplain or wetland, prior to approval of the plans. As a
four lane boulevard requires more fill in the floodplain and wetland than a four lane road with no
boulevard, we recommend incorporating stormwater treatment elements into the project.
Additionally, incorporation of these elements into the project is consistent with the City's efforts
regarding stormwater pretreatment.

Several concepts were considered to incorporate stormwater pretreatment for runoff from the
proposed road. One concept was to direct all surface water into the center median of the
boulevard where rain gardens or bioswales would intercept the water for pretreatment and

                                                 22
discharge via infiltration to an underdrain pipe. Due to the roadway geometrics necessary to
direct water toward the center median (reverse crown), this option was not pursued. However
one element of the original concept has been retained in our final recommendation.

Based on the proximity to the river and the requirement for engineered fill, we recommend that
the fill placed under the center median consist of pervious materials which will allow for
groundwater infiltration for stormwater drainage from the proposed roadway. Additionally, all
stormwater from the roadway catch basins is proposed to be directed to a Vortechnics
interceptor (or acceptable alternative) through concrete pipes located in the roadway. Another
option may be to install perforated pipe under the center median which will allow for infiltration of
the stormwater and groundwater recharge.

Stormwater discharge to the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River is proposed at
several locations, to minimize the amount of flow from any one discharge point. Near the bridge
structure, we are proposing to tap the bridge under the proposed roadway. Where the
stormwater will discharge directly into the culvert, we have proposed stormwater pretreatment
through a structural swirl concentrator (Vortechnics Interceptor). On parcel 221546053, we are
proposing to discharge to a stormwater forebay on the east side of the proposed roadway
between the proposed retaining wall and the river. The proposed roadway layout provided in
Appendix C contains the preliminary storm sewer layout and storm water treatment concept
plan.

5.5       PERMIT REVIEW AND REQUIREMENTS

It is important to note that the permit issued by the MDEQ in July of 1998 only included Part 301
and 303 provisions. It is unlikely that the MDEQ will permit the increase in the flood stage as
was proposed by JCK under Part 31. In addition, National Flood Insurance regulations require
the City to prohibit all construction activity within a floodway which causes an increase in the
water surface elevation.
Environmental permits which will need to be obtained include:

      ·   MDEQ PERMIT PART 301 ­ Inland Lakes and Streams. This permit is required for
          activities that occur within an inland lake or stream. The MDEQ will evaluate the impacts
          to the watercourse associated with this project, including the Lower Flint Street crossing
          modifications, the stream relocation, the storm water discharges, and the construction of
          the ring road crossing. Implementation of stormwater BMP's will be required such as
          those described in sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this report.

      ·   MDEQ PERMIT PART 303 ­ Wetlands Protection. This permit is required for activities
          within wetlands. The MDEQ will evaluate the impacts to the regulated wetlands affected
          by the construction of the ring road. Wetland mitigation will be required as discussed in
          section 5.2 of this report.

      ·   MDEQ PERMIT PART 31 ­ Floodplain Regulatory Authority. A permit is required for
          activities within the 100-year floodplain and floodway. The MDEQ will require an up to
          date hydraulic report to evaluate the cumulative effects of the proposed project on the
          floodplain and floodway as discussed in section 5.1 of this report.

      ·   FEMA FLOODWAY REVISION ­ Letter of Map Revision. Changes to the regulatory
          floodway must be approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency by an
          official Letter of Map Revision. The City will need to officially revise the regulatory
          floodway and redelineate the floodplain as a result of this project.

                                                   23
6.0    PRELIMINARY DESIGN REVIEW
6.1    ROADWAY GEOMETRICS
The original concept plans prepared by JCK & Associates along Crescent Boulevard provided a
four lane boulevard which consisted of two twelve foot lanes with 2 foot curb and gutter on
either side of a ten foot wide median, with a five foot wide sidewalk on each side. In order to
maximize the width of the center median, while maintaining the same dimensions from back of
walk to back of walk (88 feet), we have proposed that the curb and gutter be reduced to 1.5 feet.
This allows the center median to be 12 feet wide, rather than 10 feet wide. The figure below
depicts the proposed cross section for Crescent Boulevard. Appendix D contains a full size
sketch for reference. An additional option as shown in Figure 11 would provide a reverse cross
slope toward the center median. This option would provide additional storm water pretreatment
within the median prior to out letting into the existing wetlands but does not affect the overall
geometrics of the roadway. The City of Novi may consider eliminating the sidewalk on one side
of the road to save cost at the time of construction.




Figure 10. Crescent Boulevard Proposed Cross Section 1




Figure 11. Crescent Boulevard Proposed Cross Section 2 ­ Reverse Cross Slope

Along the Industrial Spur, the original concept plans had a road width which varied from 28 feet
wide at the west end to 43 feet wide with a left turn lane at the intersection of Crescent
Boulevard. Based on a proposed roadway cross section with two twelve foot wide lanes from
the Progressive Tool & Ind. Service road to the left turn lane at Crescent Blvd. where the road
                                                24
widens to three lanes or thirty three feet wide with 1 1/2 foot wide curb and gutter on each side.
We are recommending a road cross section of 27 feet wide along the Industrial Spur road from
Progressive Tool & Ind. to Crescent Boulevard based on current Road Commission for Oakland
County standards for Commercial/Industrial roadways. The figure below depicts the proposed
cross section for the Industrial Spur. Appendix D contains a full size sketch for reference.




Figure 12. Industrial Spur Proposed Cross Section 1

Since it has been more than ten years since the existing Fonda Drive was constructed, as part
of the final design plans, we recommend that the portion of Fonda Drive which is not proposed
to be modified by milling and resurfacing the existing concrete pavement. Additional pavement
replacement and/or patching must also be considered extend the life of the road and provide a
better transition into the new roadway. Engineering estimates include milling and resurfacing the
existing concrete pavement along Fonda Drive from the Expo Center road to Novi Road as part
of the project.


6.2    GRAND RIVER & CRESCENT BLVD. INTERSECTION GEOMETRICS
The original concept plans prepared by JCK & Associates at the intersection of Crescent
Boulevard and Grand River Avenue included widening the boulevard to five lanes at the
intersection. It is our understanding that this intersection will remain a tee intersection, with the
need for right and left turns, but no through traffic at this time although we recommend
additional studies be performed for a Flint Street realignment to allow through traffic. Therefore
to accommodate the pedestrian pathway, ADA pedestrian ramps, and traffic signals and
controllers, we are recommending that Crescent Drive remain a four lane boulevard at this
intersection. The schematic plan contained in Appendix C shows the proposed roadway and
intersection geometrics and dimensions.

The existing driveway for Country Building Supplies, 43755 Grand River Avenue (Parcels
2215477005 and 2215477006) appears to be in direct conflict with the proposed southbound
lanes of Crescent Boulevard. This will result in potential turning conflicts between the Crescent
Boulevard traffic and traffic for this business. When full topographical survey of the project is
performed, the locations of all driveway approaches along the south side of Grand River Avenue
should be included in the survey.

                                                  25
6.3    DESIGN SPEED AND ROAD CLASSIFICATION
Based on the proposed geometric features, cross sections, topography, general use of adjacent
properties along Crescent Blvd. and the Industrial Spur road, and anticipated traffic flow from
Grand River Ave. and Novi Road, a design speed of 40 MPH was used. An operating speed of
35 MPH would be used for both Crescent Blvd. and Industrial Spur road.

We do not anticipate the need to superelevate either Crescent Blvd. or the Industrial Spur road
based on current AASHTO guidelines given the proposed radii of 500 feet and 425 feet
respectively, design speed of 40 MPH and operating speed of 35 MPH. This recommendation is
base on using the operating speed for the design criteria. The use of other methods in which the
design speed is used for the evaluation may result in the need for superelevation of the
roadways. Additional evaluation of road grades, cross slopes and side friction during design of
the roadway must be considered when determining the necessity for a superelevated roadway.
Additionally the design speed could be lowered to 35 MPH and operating speed to 30 MPH to
eliminate any consideration for a superelevated road.

We recommend that the City of Novi request to SEMCOG that they classify the roadways as "All
Weather" based on the proposed 8" concrete pavement section and 6" aggregate base material
and general use of the roadways.

6.4    TRAFFIC

6.4.1 Existing Conditions
The intersection of Novi Road with Grand River Avenue and the surrounding area is heavily
used by both commuters and local traffic. Commuters from the vicinity travel through this
intersection to access the I-96 interchange on Novi Road, north of the Grand River intersection,
to travel to work elsewhere in Metro Detroit. Drivers commuting to work in Novi pass through the
intersection on their way from other Detroit suburbs. Local traffic passes through the intersection
to access the numerous commercial businesses in the area.

As such, the intersection of Novi Road with Grand River Avenue typically experiences excessive
delay at morning and afternoon peak hours. As part of our scoping study, we explored what
benefit, if any, the extension of Crescent Boulevard to Grand River Avenue would have on the
Novi/Grand River intersection.

6.4.2 Traffic Counts & Background Information
The City of Novi and Oakland County Road Commission supplied us with background
information in the form of existing traffic counts and an existing traffic study that was recently
performed for a property rezoning before City Council. The counts provided to us by the
Oakland County Road Commission were collected on May 16, 2007. The study, known as
"Automotive Mall Traffic Impact Study," was performed by Tetra Tech in August of 2006. Since
the Tetra Tech counts were fairly recent and had a more definitive breakdown of right turns at
the intersection, those counts were used to establish the level of service at the Novi/Grand River
intersection.

AEW also obtained a complete traffic count at the intersection of Novi Road with
Crescent/Fonda and a right turn count for traffic turning right from southbound (SB) Novi Road
to WB Grand River Avenue. The counts were performed by Traffic Data Collection on May 12,
2007.

All traffic counts are located in Appendix G.


                                                 26
6.4.3 Existing Level of Service
Level of Service (LOS) is a measure by which the congestion and service associated with
transportation devices or transportation infrastructure is determined. The transportation LOS
system uses the letters A through F, with A being best and F being worst.

The Highway Capacity Manual and AASHTO Geometric Design of Highways and Streets list the
following level of service:

       A       Free flow condition
       B       Reasonably free flow
       C       Stable flow
       D       Approaching unstable flow
       E       Unstable flow (at or near roadway capacity)
       F       Forced or breakdown flow (stop and go conditions)

LOS D is perhaps the level of service of a busy shopping corridor in the middle of a weekday, or
a functional urban highway during commuting hours. Speeds are somewhat reduced and
motorists are hemmed in by other cars and trucks. In urban areas, this level of service is
sometime the goal for peak hours.

The tables and figures below present the existing condition of these intersections and the
morning and afternoon rush hours. The figures present both AM and PM levels of service; the
AM LOS is presented in normal font, and the PM LOS is italicized. The tables throughout this
section of the scoping study utilize the following abbreviations:

LT = Left Turn
T = Through
RT = Right Turn
L/T = Shared through/left turn lane
O = Overall LOS for a leg of the intersection

The letters in bold in the tables below indicate movements that experience excessive delay
during peak hours. As growth continues to occur in the area, and traffic congestion increases,
the situation will worsen.

Figure 13. Existing Level of Service for Novi/Grand River Intersection

In the morning, the majority of vehicles travel southbound or east bound through the
intersection. A large number of eastbound vehicles turn left onto NB Novi Road. Based on the
analysis, it appears that the large number of EB left turns is accommodated at the expense of
EB/WB Thru traffic. In other words, the large volume of EB left turns requires substantial green
time, so that significant back-ups are avoided. To compensate, other movements through the
intersection are given less green time, which results in a poor level of service in all directions.

In the afternoon, heavy traffic appears to be traveling through the intersection from all directions.
Of those traveling EB, nearly half turn left onto NB Novi Road. Of those traveling SB on Novi
Road, many turn right onto WB Grand River Avenue. The right turns create a problem for
through traffic, because there is no dedicated right turn lane to accommodate this movement.

Figure 14. Existing Level of Service for Novi/Crescent/Fonda Intersection

In both the morning and afternoon, heavy traffic travels north and south through this
intersection. Many SB vehicles turn left onto EB Crescent. In the morning, EB Fonda is given
very little green time, because there are few vehicles which approach the intersection from this
direction. In the afternoon, a large number of drivers turn left from SB Novi Road to EB
Crescent, rather than proceeding to Grand River to make the left turn.

It should be noted that, in the afternoon, there was a significant spike in vehicles approaching
this intersection using EB Fonda. The notable thing about this spike is that the Novi Expo
Center, previously a major traffic generator, is currently vacant. There are smaller businesses
which use Fonda as their only outlet to Novi Road, but they do not seem large enough to
generate the spike in traffic noticed on Fonda.

The aerial map of the area indicates there may be connections through the Expo Center parking
lot to industrial buildings located to the southwest, along Grand River Avenue. Perhaps the
spike noticed at Fonda is a function of frustrated drivers cutting through parking lots from Grand
River Avenue to Fonda, to expedite access to Novi Road. This theory should be further explored
by the City. If this proves to be the case, construction of the Crescent Boulevard extension will
alleviate this problem.

6.4.4 Trip Assignment
Given the geometrics of the area and the existing conditions at the intersection of Novi Road
with Grand River Avenue, it is clear the proposed Crescent Boulevard extension will be widely
used by motorists. This is evidenced by the large amount of traffic that uses the existing
components of the "ring road" to avoid traveling through the Novi/Grand River intersection. To
determine the benefit that will be realized by travelers in the area, an estimate of how many trips
will be diverted to the proposed Crescent Drive extension must be developed.

Drivers typically find a balance when selecting their route. Drivers, sometimes subconsciously,
weigh factors such as travel distance, travel time, number of stops, road condition, convenience


                                                 29
and congestion to determine which way to proceed. With these factors in mind, we analyzed the
existing intersection of Novi Road and Grand River Avenue.

The geometrics of this intersection are an indicator that drivers may opt to use the Crescent
Boulevard extension. Grand River does not intersect Novi Road perpendicularly. The horizontal
angle between the two roads creates a tight right turn from SB Novi to WB Grand River. A tight
turn such as this may make some drivers feel uncomfortable, especially trucks, buses and large
vehicles. Additionally, lack of a dedicated right turn lane for this movement creates additional
delay.

The traffic counts also provide an indicator that drivers may choose Crescent. The volume of left
turns from EB Grand River to NB Novi, particularly in the afternoon peak hours, cause
excessive delay and back-ups for left-turning cars. Often, the left turn queue extends past the
proposed intersection of Crescent with Grand River. Clearly, a large proportion of these
travelers will use Crescent to proceed to Novi Road.

For both of the turning movements described above, the proposed Crescent extension will act
as a "short cut" for those drivers. They will arrive at Crescent first along their routes, and will be
able to proceed to their destinations without having to travel further to the Novi/Grand River
intersection. However, not all drivers will use Crescent because, as stated above, drivers
typically find a balance. As more drivers use Crescent, just as many drivers will continue to use
the Novi/Grand River intersection because it will become less congested (due to vehicles using
Crescent).

As such, we assumed half of those currently turning right from SB Novi to WB Grand River and
turning left from EB Grand River to NB Novi will use the Crescent extension to complete these
movements. Using this logic, traffic was redistributed and each intersection was re-analyzed.

6.4.5 Proposed Conditions

6.4.5.1 Novi/Grand River Intersection
The Novi/Grand River intersection was re-analyzed with half of those currently turning right from
SB Novi to WB Grand River and turning left from EB Grand River to NB Novi removed. Timing
was adjusted slightly to account for fewer left turns. The results are tabulated below.

                                         Table 4

Figure 15. Proposed Level of Service for Novi/Grand River Intersection

By shifting vehicles to the proposed Crescent extension and adjusting signal timing
accordingly, the intersection operates at an acceptable peak hour level of service in all
directions.

6.4.5.2 Novi/Crescent/Fonda Intersection
The Novi/Crescent/Fonda intersection was adjusted to reflect the shift of trips to Fonda Drive.
The signal timing was adjusted to provide more green time to the increased number of vehicles
turning left from EB Fonda to NB Novi Road and the decreased number of cars approaching
from the south. Table 5 summarizes the proposed level of service for the Novi/Crescent/Fonda
intersection.

                                         Table 5

Figure 16. Proposed Level of Service for Novi/Crescent/Fonda Intersection

Even though northbound and southbound Novi Road would still exhibit some delay during the
afternoon peak hour, the results of our analysis show that the intersection improved overall. The
LOS E for NB Novi was LOS F prior to traffic redistribution at this intersection. Southbound Novi
Road has improved from an overall LOS E to a LOS D.

6.4.5.3 Grand River/Crescent Intersection
The proposed intersection of Crescent Boulevard with Grand River Avenue was analyzed to
determine whether it will work at an acceptable level of service at morning and afternoon peak
hours. It should be noted that a single left turn lane was assumed at this intersection. The
results are tabulated below.

                                           Table 6

Figure 17. Proposed Level of Service for Grand River/Crescent Intersection

The proposed intersection works well with the traffic and signal timing assigned. Because it
appears to function better than the intersection of Novi Road with Grand River Avenue, more
traffic than what was assumed for this analysis may choose to use this intersection instead. As
discussed above, drivers will ultimately find a balance between intersections. For purposes of
this study, the assumption that was made shows that the construction of the Crescent
Boulevard extension will improve the function of the Novi/Grand River intersection.

As mentioned above, a single left turn lane on Grand River Avenue was assumed. With the
single left turn lane, the intersection appears to function well. The City may wish to consider a
second left turn lane at the proposed Grand River/Crescent intersection, to accommodate future
growth, if sufficient right of way exists.

6.4.6 Other Traffic Impacts and Options
The proposed Crescent extension will form a tee intersection with Grand River Avenue. The SW
Quadrant of the ring road, otherwise known as Flint Street currently forms an unsignalized tee
intersection with Grand River, east of the proposed Crescent/Grand River Intersection.

Although traffic counts were unavailable for the intersection of Flint Street with Grand River
Avenue, traffic counts were provided for the Flint Street/Novi Road intersection. Those counts
clearly indicate that Flint Street is not widely used to travel from Novi Road to Grand River
Avenue. Using the available counts, we assumed a similar pattern on Flint Street at Grand River
to that at the Flint/Novi intersection. The east/west traffic split at peak hours was used to
determine whether traffic turning from Flint would choose to proceed easterly or westerly. Using
these assumptions, a level of service analysis was performed.

                                           Table 7
                 Existing Level of Service for Flint/Grand River Intersection

Figure 18. Existing Level of Service for Flint/Grand River Intersection

As currently exists, the intersection operates at an acceptable level of service. However, left
turns from Flint to WB Grand River are difficult due to the volume of traffic on EB Grand River.
The proposed Crescent extension should alleviate this difficulty because it will divert traffic from

With the extension of Crescent Boulevard to Grand River Avenue, traffic operations at this
intersection would improve. As growth continues, and if Flint Street is ever improved, the City
may want to explore aligning Flint Street with Crescent Boulevard.

6.4.7 Conclusions and Recommendations
The extension of Crescent Boulevard to Grand River Avenue will provide immediate and future
benefit to the entire area. Immediately after construction and signal re-timing, the number of
vehicles turning left from EB Grand River to NB Novi Road could be significantly reduced,
allowing for more green time to be given to other movements at the Grand River/Novi
intersection.

Since there is no dedicated SB right turn lane at the Novi/Grand River intersection, those
proceeding through the intersection are slowed by the volume of traffic turning right. Upon
completion of Crescent Boulevard, a significant number of vehicles that would turn right from SB
Novi Road to WB Grand River Avenue could be diverted to Crescent. Therefore, the benefit at
the Novi/ Grand River intersection should also be realized immediately after construction.

In addition to improving the overall levels of service at Novi Road's intersections with Crescent
and Grand River, the level of service would be improved at Grand River's intersection with Flint
Street. This improvement is a result of the diversion of traffic to the Crescent extension. In
addition to Flint Street, this benefit will likely extend to the driveways of the businesses located
along Grand River Avenue between Crescent Boulevard and Novi Road.

It should be noted there is vacant property in the area. As vacant property develops or
redevelops, the City should require a traffic impact study from the developer. Studies such as
this will allow for mitigation measures or adjustments in response to traffic increases cause by
development.

With the above in mind, tangible benefits of the Crescent Boulevard extension should include:
        Decreased congestion and delay throughout the area, especially at Novi Road's
           intersection with Grand River Avenue.
        Positive economic impact due to decreased congestion and improved traffic
           circulation through the area.
        Reduced traffic enforcement issues due to a decrease in driver frustration.
        Although a crash analysis was not part of the scope of this study, decreased
           congestion and driver frustration should reduce crashes in the area.
        Improved air quality due to a reduction in vehicular delay and idling.

The following items require further study by the City:
         Although the single left turn lane on EB Grand River to NB Crescent will operate
           within acceptable limits initially, the City may want to consider a dual left turn lane
           from Grand River onto Crescent Boulevard to accommodate future growth.
         The City may want to study aligning Flint Street with proposed Crescent Boulevard at
           Grand River Avenue, in regard to future traffic growth and land development.
         Signal timing should be studied carefully prior to and after construction of Crescent
           Boulevard to ensure timing is optimized.

6.5    TRAFFIC SIGNALS
The City of Novi intends to add a traffic signal at the intersection of Grand River Avenue and
Crescent Boulevard. Additionally, the existing Fonda Drive and Novi Road traffic signal is
proposed to be replaced with a decorative mast arm style traffic signal.

Road Commission for Oakland County (RCOC) has jurisdiction over Grand River Avenue in the
vicinity of the proposed traffic signal. The possibility of replacing the current span wire signal at
the Novi Road and Fonda Drive intersection was discussed with RCOC Traffic Department.
Though the existing signalization is functioning adequately, they would not object with the
replacement of the span wire with the "Mast Arm" signalization as long as they do not have to
participate in the funding of the signal. Based on observation and lack of structural information
for the current pole foundations, they recommend the current poles could not be used for the
new mast arm signals. The current design standards are more stringent than previous
standards especially since mast arm signals are becoming more popular with communities such
as the City of Novi. During final design of the project, the location will have to be evaluated to
determine if the intersection warrants a new signal and signal and required geometrics.




Figure 20.   Sample Decorative Mast Arm Signal located along Grand River in the City of
             Novi at the Rock Financial Showplace Entrance.

At the Crescent Blvd. and Grand River intersection, preliminary evaluation of the proposed
traffic signal location (approximately 1000 feet west of the Novi Road intersection) indicates that
while it is closer to the Grand River and Novi Road intersection than a quarter mile signal, the
location should not result in conflicts with the Novi Road intersection. Additionally, the traffic
signal will be part of the Oakland County FAST-TRAC (Faster And Safer Travel Through
Routing and Advanced Controls) system, which will allow for real time adjustments in the
signals to accommodate traffic flow. For estimating purposes, we have assumed that the
proposed traffic signal will consist of mast arm style poles with lighted street signs, FAST-TRAC
Autoscope cameras, pedestrian signals with pushbuttons, decorative bases and street lights on
the poles. Again the RCOC would not object with a new signal at the Crescent Blvd. and Grand
River intersection. Findings from previous studies at Crescent Blvd. and Grand River show that
the location of the signal would not be in conflict with the Novi Road and Grand River
intersection. The signal design and layout would be very similar to the recently constructed


                                                  36
Rock Financial and Grand River intersection approximately one mile west of proposed Crescent
Blvd..

It appears from field review of the proposed traffic signal location that power is available along
the west side of the proposed Crescent Blvd, approximately 250 feet north of the proposed
intersection. Another alternative is a pole approximately 250 feet west of the proposed
intersection along the north side of Grand River Avenue right-of-way.

For purposes of this study, the intersection was treated as a tee intersection, however
realignment of the driveway for Country Building Supplies will have to be considered in
the final intersection design and signal layout due to potential conflicts with traffic pole
locations and the driveway, and turning conflicts.




Figure 21. Grand River Ave. and Crescent Boulevard Intersection

6.6    EXISTING DRIVEWAYS ALONG FONDA DRIVE

As part of the potential design of Crescent Blvd. and the Industrial Spur, improvements are also
proposed for existing Fonda Drive from Novi Road to Expo Center Drive. In addition to the
resurfacing of the concrete section of roadway, and replacement of the asphalt section road,
attention should be given to the existing approaches from businesses currently along Fonda
Drive such as Blinds To Go and Big Boys, Wendy's and Melting Pot Restaurants and how they
will be impacted by the road extension to Grand River.

6.6.1 Left Turn Movements and Driveway Alternates
Currently the only access road for the Big Boy restaurant is Fonda Drive. Because of the
proximity to Novi road and existing boulevard geometrics, left turns or not permitted onto Fonda
Drive from the Big Boy Restaurant, traffic must turn right out of both approaches and use the
existing turnaround at the Expo Center Drive as shown in Figure 22. When the road is extended
the turnaround will be eliminated minimizing access options to Novi Road. The proposed road
widths and minimal turning radius at the potential median will not permit u-turns for west bound
traffic back to Novi Road.

                                                37
One option would include constructing an approach onto the Expo Center Drive similar to
Melting Pot Restaurant, but this may require additional easement acquisition. Additional
research will be required to determine an adequate driveway location and easement
requirements.

A second option would be the construction of a roundabout at the intersection of Fonda Drive
and the Expo Center Drive. This again will require additional research to determine an
acceptable roundabout configuration alignment, and necessary easement acquisition. This
option is further discussed in section 6.7.




Figure 22. Turning conflicts onto Fonda Drive

Turning movements will also be effected at the approaches for Blinds To Go and Wendy's
Restaurant. Currently traffic at both businesses may only turn right onto Fonda Drive. Because
of the proximity to Novi Road and potential stacking problems for turning onto Novi Road, left
turns onto Fonda Drive will likely not be permitted. If left turns onto Fonda Drive are desired,
additional options must be considered.


                                               38
6.7       ROUNDABOUT OPTION
In accordance with the Federal Highway Administration and US Department of Transportation
"Roundabouts Informational Guide" manual, based on the proposed design parameters and
roadway classification, the minimum recommended inscribed diameter (outside diameter) for
the roundabout is 150 feet to 230 feet. Based on the potential traffic volumes and proposed
design speeds a two lane roundabout will be required. A two lane roundabout will require a
pavement width of 32 feet from back of curb to back of curb inside the roundabout. It is also
recommended that a 6 foot wide apron be installed on the inside of the roundabout adjacent to a
mountable curb to accommodate the turning movements for commercial vehicles.

The sketches below are three options for preliminary layouts of a 180 foot inscribed diameter
roundabout in the vicinity of Expo Center Drive and Fonda Drive. Based on these preliminary
layouts, the following concerns are noted:

      ·   Right-of-way acquisition will be required for the proposed roundabout, relocated
          sidewalks, and extension of the proposed bridge crossing the Walled Lake Branch of the
          Middle Rouge River.
      ·   Right-of-way acquisition will be required from the Adell Brothers Children's Trust (Parcel
          2215476045)
      ·   Right-of-way acquisition will be required from the Elias Brothers Big Boy site (Parcel
          2215476042)
      ·   The proximity of the proposed roundabout to the Fonda Drive and Novi Road signalized
          intersection will likely cause traffic to back up in the roundabout
      ·   During events at the Novi Expo Center the roundabout may not function as intended.

Due to the issues listed above, it may not be desirable to pursue a roundabout at this
location unless the City is willing to pursue additional right-of-way. The previous right-of-
way acquisition process with the Adell Brothers ChildrensTrust of parcel 2215476045 has
resulted in years of delay to the originally proposed plan. Based on the City's prior experience,
additional right-of-way acquisition from this parcel is anticipated to result in further delay.




Figure 23. Roundabout Option 1

Option 1 - Will maximize a potential right-of-way acquisition to the small residential parcel
(2215476013) immediately south of the round-about. Although this layout avoided any right-of-
way needs from the Big Boy Restaurant parcel (2214476036), it still impacts the former Adell

                                                   39
Brother's Children's Trust parcel (2215476045) significantly, requiring both right-of-way and
sidewalk easement acquisition.




Figure 24. Roundabout Option 2

Option 2 - Will "center" the roundabout island in the middle of the right-of way to the east,
requiring less right-of-way acquisition from the small residential parcel (2215476013)
immediately south of the round-about. This layout places the back of curb very close to the
southwest corner of the Big Boy Restaurant parcel (2215476036), but still avoids any right-of-
way needs from that property owner. The sidewalk in that vicinity already encroaches, so a
slight re-alignment of the walk, as needed, could be constructed in generally the same area.
This layout still impacts the Adell Brother's Children's Trust parcel (2215476045), but requires a
little less right-of-way and sidewalk easement acquisition than roundabout Option 1.




                                                40
Figure 25. Roundabout Option 3

Option 3 - Will minimize right-of way acquisition needs from the former Adell Brother's
Children's Trust parcel (2215476045). This layout still requires right-of-way acquisition, but is
limited to an extension of the proposed 45 ft. right-of-way curve projected from the southwest to
the easterly line of this parcel. A separate sidewalk easement will still be required from the
former Novi Expo Center, if in fact a sidewalk is ever constructed on this side of the round-
about. This layout significantly reduces the right-of-way and sidewalk easement acquisition
needs on the residential parcel (2215476046) immediately to the south. The major impact of
this Sketch option is the need to acquire right-of-way and sidewalk easements from the
southwest corner of the Big Boy Restaurant parcel (2215476036), which is not required for
roundabout options 1 and 2.

6.8    BRIDGE RECOMMENDATIONS
The original concept design for the Crescent Boulevard crossing of the Walled Lake Branch of
the Rouge River proposed a 20 foot wide, 7 foot rise Con-Span culvert. While detailed design
and topographical survey performed at the next phase of this project will provide detail for
design of the structure. However, based on the hydraulic conditions and preliminary review of
the culvert size, we recommend that a 24 foot span, with 8 foot rise.

The Crescent Boulevard road will cross the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge River and
therefore will require a bridge. In accordance with the preliminary hydraulic requirements, we
anticipate a 24 feet span and 8 feet high bridge structure will be needed to bring the road
across the stream. The most economical bridge system for this site is a precast concrete arch
structure or precast concrete three sided box structure.

According to our estimate, the precast concrete arch costs approximately 15% more than the
precast three sided box. Many communities prefer the look of the arch shape. Additional
architectural features can also be added to these types of structures. It should be noted that the
existing bridge at Grand River Avenue downstream from this site is a precast three sided box.
Examples of the concrete arch and the three sided box are shown below.

6.9    RETAINING WALL RECOMMENDATIONS
The plans prepared by JCK and Associates, Inc. in 1996 were used as a basis for the retaining
wall study. All quantities developed for the retaining wall estimate were derived from the JCK
plans. Additional assumptions were based on the design parameters provided in the
geotechnical engineering report.

Using the road profile and alignment depicted on the plans, the majority of Crescent Boulevard
will require engineered fill to bring the road up to the proposed plan grade. At some locations,
engineered fill will have to be placed up to a height of 12 feet. In order to minimize the amount
of floodplain fill; minimize disturbance to the wetlands; and avoid obtaining additional right-of-
way, it will be necessary to construct retaining walls for the proposed project.

Our retaining wall quantity estimate is based on constructing a retaining wall when the grade
separation is 4 feet or higher. It is assumed that grade separations less than 4 feet can be
constructed by sloping the embankment inside the existing right-of-way with minimal wetland
and floodplain impact. Using these parameters it will be necessary to construct a retaining wall
on both sides of Crescent Boulevard and along the north side of the Industrial Spur Road.




                                                42
Using the stationing identified on the referenced plans, we have identified the need to construct
a retaining wall at the following locations:

Figure 27. Retaining Wall Locations

Retaining Wall System Alternates
We have evaluated three retaining wall systems for this project. There are many different
aesthetic options that can be incorporated into each retaining wall system. Below is a general
description for each retaining wall system and the types of aesthetic enhancements that can be
applied to each system.


6.9.1 Mechanically Stabilized Earth Slope (MSE) Wall
This retaining wall system involves utilizing modular precast concrete panels. The panels are
approximately 5 feet by 5 feet square in dimension (refer to photos below) and are tied into
engineered backfill by a system of reinforcing strips. The reinforcing strips are attached to the
back of the panels and are generally vertically spaced at 2 feet on center along the full wall
height.
This system is an economical alternative to the conventional concrete retaining wall but there
are a few disadvantages. It is not recommended to install underground utilities behind the wall

                                                43
within the reinforcing strip region of the engineered backfill. If there is a need to excavate the
utility in the future, it is likely the reinforcing strips would have to be cut to access the buried
utility. The strips cannot be cut or the wall will fail. Therefore, it is not recommended to locate
buried utilities directly behind a MSE Wall. This project is a good candidate for the MSE wall
because the only proposed utilities are storm sewer and electrical. Along Crescent Blvd. these
utilities are proposed to be installed under the center median. Along the Industrial Spur the
storm sewer is proposed under the center of the roadway.

Based on the proximity of the proposed wall to the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge
River and the potential for the stream to saturate the wall in various flood stages, we
recommend continuous heavy riprap with fabric along the entire length of the wall, up to the 100
year floodplain elevation. This recommended stabilization measure is to protect the engineered
fill and structural tieback system from soil loss and erosion, which could impact the structural
stability of the wall system.

A potential disadvantage to MSE walls can be that during construction, additional time must be
spent inspecting the individual components of a MSE wall system, including, but not limited to,
modular panels, reinforcement strips, joint tolerances, joint sealant, engineered fill material
testing, joint cover fabric, as well as the proper installation of MSE components.

An abundance of aesthetic enhancements can be applied to the wall panels. Through the use of
architectural form liners, there are numerous textured patterns that can be created. These
patterns can be used in combination with colored concrete to create a wall with a unique
architectural appearance. A few examples of MSE walls with various aesthetic enhancements
are shown below.




Figure 28. Mechanically Stabilized Earth Retaining Wall Examples

                                                 44
6.9.2 Segmental Block Retaining Wall (SBR)

This retaining wall system utilizes concrete masonry block units in conjunction with
reinforcement strips that are tied into the engineered backfill behind the wall. The tie back
system is very similar to the one for the MSE wall and therefore, has the same considerations
for utility location.

Based on the proximity of the proposed wall to the Walled Lake Branch of the Middle Rouge
River and the potential for the stream to saturate the wall in various flood stages, we
recommend continuous heavy riprap with fabric along the entire length of the wall, up to the 100
year floodplain elevation. This recommended stabilization measure is to protect the engineered
fill and structural tieback system from soil loss and erosion, which could impact the structural
stability of the wall system.

This system is another economical alternative to conventional concrete retaining wall. Another
advantage to the SBR wall is that it does not require heavy construction equipment to build. The
SBR wall disadvantages are the same as those mentioned for the MSE walls due to the tie back
grid system behind the wall.

There are many different block types, sizes, combinations, and colors available which allow for
a customized aesthetic appearance. Some examples of the variety of SBR walls are shown
below.




                                                             Segmental Block Retaining
                                                                  Wall Examples



Figure 29. Segmented Block Retaining Wall Examples

                                               45
6.9.3 Cast in Place (CIP) Concrete Retaining Wall

This retaining wall system is probably the most common type of retaining wall. It is constructed
by building a system of forms, installing steel reinforcement, placing concrete into the forms,
and removing the forms after the concrete has cured.

This system is generally considered the strongest but is typically the most costly of the three
retaining wall systems. It should be noted that the CIP wall is the strongest system, doesn't
require tie back strips, and has the most flexibility in terms of constructing utilities near it or
through it. The CIP wall contains fewer joints than the other two wall types. A reduction in the
number of joints reduces the potential for problems due to leaking and/or soil loss in the future.
In addition, there is less effort required for the placement of the engineered fill behind the wall
because tie back strips are not present.

As with the MSE wall there are
numerous aesthetic enhancements
which can be applied to the wall
surface including the use of colored
concrete and architectural form liner
patterns. An example of a CIP
Concrete wall which includes brick
infill and integral circular piers is
shown in the photo.

While we have provided three wall
choices, the City may want to
consider the architectural elements
or aesthetics for the wall system. We
have provided cost estimates for all
three options, along with additional
preliminary estimates for aesthetic
and architectural elements.

7.0    COST ESTIMATES

7.1    PRELIMINARY CONSTRUCTION COST ESTIMATES
Detailed preliminary construction cost estimates are provided in Appendix E. They include the
construction costs, as well as estimates of the fees for additional engineering and services
required to complete the design and construction of the project plans. The estimates provided
are based on the following assumptions:
    · Right-of-Way and easement acquisition for the remaining parcels was not included in the
       cost estimates.
    · For estimating purposes, conduit for the street lighting was included. However, since
       street lighting costs can vary greatly depending on the style, brand, dimensions, and
       placement of the lights the cost of street lights was not included in the estimates.
    · The final hydraulic analysis for the Walled Lake Branch of the Rouge River may result in
       modification to the sizes of the proposed Flint Street crossing and the proposed

                                                 46
         Crescent Boulevard crossing. Cost estimates for these structures are based on our
         preliminary analysis of the original hydraulic report.
    ·    No sanitary sewer or water main is proposed along the route of the proposed Crescent
         Boulevard or Industrial Spur right-of-way.

The following is a summary of the cost estimates. We have provided a proposed total cost
range of costs because many of the design features estimated provided alternatives to allow the
City flexibility.

8.0    FUNDING ALTERNATIVES

Various types of funding resources were reviewed for both design and construction of
the project. The descriptions and viability are as follows:

8.0.1 Federal Aid from Federal Transportation Program
Various types of federal aid funding are provided to counties for eligible roadways.
Projects are listed in the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) as projects
the state intends to fund with federal aid provided under the federal transportation
program. Projects are listed in various categories, such as STPU (widening, reconstruct,
rehabilitation), 3R (Rehabilitation), 4R (Reconstruction), pave gravel. In order to be
eligible to receive these funds, the roadway must be shown on the National Functional
Classification Map as a rural major collector or an urban collector or higher and shall not
be a county local or city local street. Federal Aid funds are only available to roads which
exist and are shown on the federal map. Therefore, we believe federal aid funds are
probably not available for this project.


8.0.2 Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
CMAQ funds are available for transportation and other related projects that contribute to
air quality benefits. CMAQ funding has a 20% local match for geometric modifications
and a 0% local match for traffic signalization projects. If the traffic signal work is part of
a larger project, signal work will be subject to the 20% local match.

This project may be eligible for CMAQ funding if an air quality benefit can be
demonstrated. Based on the preliminary traffic study performed, the queuing for left and
right turns at the Grand River and Novi Road intersection would be reduced by this
project. The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) will be issuing a
call for 2009 CMAQ projects in August of 2007. We recommend that the City submit an
application for CMAQ funds for this project at that time.

8.0.3 Transportation Economic Development Fund (TEDF)
TEDF was created to assist in the funding of transportation projects necessary to
support economic growth. These funds are broken into Categories A through F and
provide a means for government and business to work together to provide
transportation solutions for growing industries. Category A funds are for road projects
related to target industry development and redevelopment opportunities. Category C
funds are for reduction of traffic congestion in urban counties.

This project may be a candidate for Category C funds, based on the air quality benefits
associated with relocation of turning movements at the Grand River and Novi Road
intersection.

Additionally, depending on the redevelopment of the former Expo Center and the
transportation needs of the existing industrial businesses, Category A funds may also
be an avenue to pursue for this project.



                                              48
9.0    RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the data reviewed, collected and analyzed, we recommend that the City of Novi
proceed with the next steps in the process of designing this project. The following steps are
recommended to proceed toward the construction of the proposed roadway. The italicized items
on the list are not required for the project, but we recommend that the City consider them as
they proceed with the project.

   ·   Detailed topographical survey of the project site.
   ·   Engineering plan design of the project based on the detailed topographical survey.
   ·   Updated hydraulic modeling, including topographical survey of the stream, extending
       from just downstream of the lower Flint Street crossing of the Walled Lake Branch of the
       Middle Rouge River to upstream of the proposed bridge, which models all existing and
       proposed. The model should include floodplain and floodway impacts based on removal
       of the triple culverts and should include final sizing recommendations for the Lower Flint
       Street crossing and the Crescent Boulevard crossing. The model should also incorporate
       the 200 feet of proposed stream direction.
   ·   Updated wetlands flagging and topographical survey.
   ·   Permits from MDEQ for wetlands, floodplain, floodway, stream relocation.
   ·   Permits from RCOC for the Crescent Boulevard approach and traffic signals.
   ·   Traffic signal design for the Fonda Drive and Novi Road traffic signal and the Crescent
       Drive and Grand River Avenue Traffic Signal.
   ·   Study of the potential realignment of Flint Street and Grand River Avenue intersection to
       align with the proposed Crescent Boulevard and Grand River Avenue.
   ·   Research the feasibility of Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) funding for this
       project and prepare application for the 2009 call to projects in August 2007.
   ·   Research further the feasibility of Transportation Economic Development Category A
       and Category C funding and prepare application

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We understand the project includes the construction of a new 4-lane boulevard (Crescent Boulevard)
extending west from Novi Road (at the end of the existing Fonda Drive) and south to Grand River
Avenue in Novi, Michigan. A 2-lane spur road (E. Wisne Drive) will also extend to the west to serve the
General Filters property. The project will include construction of a culvert/bridge crossing of the Rouge
River. At the time of this investigation, the type of bridge or culvert for the river crossing had not been
determined; however, a CON/SPAN bridge system, consisting of pre-cast abutment, wingwall and arch
units, supported on strip foundations, was being considered.

Approximately 3 to 14 inches of topsoil are present at the soil boring location. Fill soils, consisting of
very loose to loose silty sand and stiff to very stiff silty clay with a trace amount of organic matter,
underlie the topsoil within borings B-1, and B-8 through B-10, and extend to depths ranging from 3 to 6
feet below existing grades. Very loose peat underlies the topsoil within boring B-2, and extends to an
approximate depth of 3-1/2 feet below existing grade. Native very loose to loose silty sand underlies the
topsoil and peat within borings B-2 and B-3, and extends to depths ranging from 6-1/2 to 7 feet below
existing grades. Very loose to loose organic silt underlies the silty sand fill within boring B-8, and
extends to an approximate depth of 13 feet below existing grade. In general, native cohesive soils,
consisting of stiff to hard silty clay and clayey silt, underlie the topsoil, fill, and/or native granular soils,
and extend to the explored depths of the borings. However, within borings B-3, B-5 and B-9, occasional
layers of medium compact native granular soils are interbedded within the cohesive soils. Groundwater
seepage was encountered within borings B-1 through B-3, B-5, B-6, and B-8 through B-10 at
approximate depths ranging from 1 to 6 feet below existing grades, corresponding to approximate
Elevations 897-1/2 to 911 feet. Upon completion of drilling operations, groundwater was measured
within borings B-1 through B-3, B-5, B-6, and B-8 through B-10 at depths ranging from 5 to 32 feet
below existing grades, corresponding to approximate Elevations 871-1/2 to 908-1/2 feet. The remaining
borings were dry during and upon completion of drilling operations.

At the time of the investigation, site grading plans were not available. However, we were provided plan
and profile sheets prepared by JCK & Associates, dated April and October 1996, as an estimate of
possible final grades along the roadway and bridge alignment. We anticipate that site grades will have to
be raised as much as 8 feet along the centerline of the roadway alignment and at the approaches to the
bridge to accommodate the anticipated finished grades. Some small grade cuts, on the order of 2 to 3 feet,
may be required along portions of the roadway alignment.

Assuming moderate foundation loads, as would be expected for the proposed short-span culvert/bridge,
we recommend the structure be supported on shallow spread foundations. At the time of the
investigation, the proposed bottom of foundation elevations were unknown; however, based on the
roadway profile sheet prepared by JCK, we anticipate the proposed bottom of foundations may be at
approximate Elevation 901-1/2 feet. We recommend a net allowable soil bearing capacity of 4,000 psf
for foundations extending through the existing unsuitable organic soils and very loose to loose granular
soils and bearing within the underlying native very stiff silty clay.

We performed pavement design analyses in accordance with the "AASHTO Guide for Design of
Pavement Structures". Based on the results of our analyses, we recommend the proposed Portland cement
concrete pavement section consist of 8 inches of non-reinforced MDOT P1 concrete supported on 6
inches of MDOT 21AA dense-graded aggregate.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE

We understand the project includes the construction of a new 4-lane boulevard (Crescent Boulevard)
extending west from Novi Road (at the end of the existing Fonda Drive) and south to Grand River
Avenue in Novi, Michigan. A 2-lane spur road (E. Wisne Drive) will also extend to the west to serve the
General Filters property. The project will include construction of a culvert/bridge crossing of the Rouge
River. At the time of this investigation, the type of bridge or culvert for the river crossing had not been
determined; however, a CON/SPAN bridge system, consisting of pre-cast abutment, wingwall and arch
units, supported on strip foundations, was being considered. In addition, a retaining wall along a portion
of the east side of the proposed boulevard, a new traffic signal at the intersection with Grand River
Avenue, and concrete paths on both sides of the boulevard are proposed. It is possible that a retaining
wall may also be required on the west side of the boulevard adjacent to the existing wetland area. The
purpose of the geotechnical investigation is to determine and evaluate the general subsurface conditions
along the alignments of the proposed roads, culvert/bridge structure, retaining wall and traffic signal, and
to develop geotechnical design recommendations and related construction considerations.

SCOPE OF SERVICES

The field operations, laboratory testing, and engineering report preparation were performed under the
direction and supervision of a licensed professional engineer. Our services were performed according to
generally accepted standards and procedures in the practice of geotechnical engineering in this area. Our
scope of services for this project consists of the following specific items:

1. We performed ten soil borings. Soil borings B-2 and B-3 were performed at the proposed river
   crossing, and were extended to an approximate depth of 50 feet below the existing grade. Soil boring
   B-7 was performed near the intersection of Grand River Avenue, and was extended to an approximate
   depth of 20 feet below existing grade. Soil borings B-4 through B-6, B-8 and B-9 were performed
   within the roadway alignment adjacent to the existing wetland and Rouge River flood plain, and were
   extended to an approximate depth of 15 feet below existing grades. Soil borings B-1 and B-10 were
   performed along the roadway alignment and were extended to an approximate depth of 10 feet below
   existing grades.

2. We performed laboratory testing on samples obtained from the soil borings. Laboratory testing
   included visual engineering classification, natural moisture content, organic matter content (loss-on-
   ignition), Atterberg limits, and unconfined compressive strength determinations.

3. We prepared this engineering report. The report includes recommendations regarding subgrade
   preparation, bridge foundation design, pavement design, and construction considerations, as they
   relate to the geotechnical conditions at the site.

FIELD INVESTIGATION

G2 Consulting Group (G2), in conjunction with Anderson, Eckstein and Westrick, Inc. (AEW) selected
the number, depth, and location of the soil borings. The soil borings were staked in the field by
representatives of AEW. The approximate soil boring locations are shown on the Soil Boring Location
Plans, Plate No. 1. Ground surface elevations at the boring locations were provided by AEW.

Page No. 3

The soil borings were advanced using an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) rotary-drilling rig. Continuous flight,
2-1/4-inch inside diameter, hollow-stem augers were used to advance the boreholes. Within each soil
boring, soil samples were obtained at intervals of 2-1/2 feet within the upper 10 feet, and every 5 feet
below that depth. These samples were obtained by the Standard Penetration Test method (ASTM D
1586), which involves driving a 2-inch diameter split-spoon sampler into the soil with a 140-pound
weight falling 30 inches. The sampler is generally driven three successive 6-inch increments with the
number of blows for each increment recorded. The number of blows required to advance the sampler the
last 12 inches is termed the Standard Penetration Resistance (N). Blow counts for each 6-inch increment
and the resulting N-values are presented on the individual soil boring logs.

The soil samples were placed in sealed containers in the field and brought to the laboratory for testing and
classification. During the drilling and coring operations, the drilling crew maintained logs of the
encountered subsurface conditions, including changes in stratigraphy and observed groundwater levels of
the soil borings. The final boring logs are based on the field logs and laboratory soil classification of
these results. After completion of the soil borings, auger cuttings were used to backfill the boring
locations.

LABORATORY TESTING

Representative soil samples were subjected to laboratory testing to determine soil parameters pertinent to
bridge and pavement design and site preparation. An experienced geotechnical engineer classified the
samples in general conformance with the Unified Soil Classification System.

Laboratory testing included natural moisture content, organic matter content (loss-on-ignition), Atterberg
limits, dry density, and unconfined compressive strength determinations. The organic matter content of
representative samples was determined in accordance with ASTM Test Method D2974, "Standard Test
Methods for Moisture, Ash, and Organic Matter of Peat and Other Organic Soils". Atterberg Limits were
performed in general conformance with ASTM D 4318 method of testing. The unconfined compressive
strengths were determined by ASTM Test Method D 2166 and using a spring-loaded hand penetrometer.
The unconfined compressive strength of cohesive soils is determined by axially loading a small
cylindrical soil sample under a slow rate of strain. The unconfined compressive strength is defined as the
maximum stress applied to the soil sample before shear failure. If shear failure does not occur prior to a
total strain of 15 percent, the unconfined compressive strength is defined as the stress at a total strain of
15 percent. The hand penetrometer estimates the unconfined compressive strength to a maximum of
9,000 pounds per square foot (psf) by measuring the resistance of the soil sample to the penetration of a
calibrated spring loaded cylinder.

The results of the laboratory tests are indicated on the soil boring logs at the depths the samples were

No. 13 in the Appendix. We will hold the soil samples for 60 days from the date of this report. If you
would like the samples, please let us know.

SITE CONDITIONS

Along the proposed roadway alignment, the site is heavily wooded or covered within medium to heavy
brush. The trees become sparser toward Grand River Avenue, and along the west end of the proposed
Industrial Spur (E. Wisne Drive). The Rouge River crosses the proposed Crescent Boulevard alignment
just west of Fonda Drive. Low-lying areas are present along the north side of the proposed Industrial
Spur and near the intersection of Crescent Boulevard and E. Wisne Drive.

Industrial and commercial properties surround the site. At the time of the investigation, a topographic
survey of the site was not available. However, based on Roadway Profile Sheet prepared by JCK &
Associates, the existing ground surface elevations along centerline of the Crescent Boulevard alignment
range from approximately 903 to 918 feet, and the boring elevations range from 904 to 915 feet.

GEOTECHNICAL CONDITIONS

Soil Conditions

Approximately 3 to 14 inches of topsoil are present at the soil boring location. Fill soils, consisting of
silty sand and silty clay with a trace amount of organic matter, underlie the topsoil within borings B-1,
and B-8 through B-10, and extend to depths ranging from 3 to 6 feet below existing grades. Peat
underlies the topsoil within boring B-2, and extends to an approximate depth of 3-1/2 feet below existing
grade. Native silty sand underlies the topsoil and peat within borings B-2 and B-3, and extends to depths
ranging from 6-1/2 to 7 feet below existing grades. Organic silt underlies the silty sand fill within boring
B-8, and extends to an approximate depth of 13 feet below existing grade. The native granular soils
within the upper 6-1/2 feet and 3-1/2 feet within borings B-2 and B-3, respectively, contain a trace
amount of organic matter. In general, native cohesive soils, consisting of silty clay and clayey silt,
underlie the topsoil, fill, and/or native granular soils and extend to the explored depths of the borings.
However, within borings B-3, B-5 and B-9, occasional layers of native granular soils are interbedded
within the cohesive soils.

The silty clay fill soils are stiff to very stiff in consistency with moisture contents ranging from 13 to 19
percent, unconfined compressive strengths ranging from 2,000 to 7,500 pounds per square foot (psf), and
organic matter contents ranging from 2.1 to 3.5 percent. The silty sand fill soils are very loose to loose in
compactness with Standard Penetration Test N-values ranging from 4 to 9 blows per foot (bpf) and
organic matter contents ranging from 4.0 to 7.1 percent. The peat within boring B-2 is very loose in
compactness with an N-value of 3 bpf and an organic content of 8.9 percent. The organic silt within
boring B-8 is very loose to loose in compactness with N-values ranging from 4 to 6 bpf and organic
matter contents ranging from 3.6 to 5.8 percent. The upper native granular soils within borings B-2 and
B-3 are very loose to loose in compactness with N-values ranging from 2 to 6 bpf and organic matter
contents ranging from 2.7 to 3.5 percent. In general, the native silty clay and clayey silt are stiff to hard
in consistency with natural moisture contents ranging from 9 to 25 percent, dry densities ranging from
112 to 138 pounds per cubic foot (pcf), unconfined compressive strengths ranging from 2,000 to 14,550
psf, a liquid limit of 36 percent, and a plasticity index of 17 percent. However, within boring B-4 and B-
9, the native silty clay and clayey silt within the upper 5-1/2 feet within boring B-4 and between the
depths of 6 and 10-1/2 feet within boring B-9 are medium in consistency with natural moisture contents
ranging from 17 to 25 percent and unconfined compressive strengths ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 psf.
March 29, 2007
G2 Project No. 073005
Page No. 5

The interbedded layers of granular soil below a depth of 6 feet are medium compact with N-values
ranging from 12 to 21 bpf.

The stratification depths shown on the soil boring log represent the soil conditions at the boring location.
Variations may occur away from the boring location. Additionally, the stratigraphic lines represent the
approximate boundaries between soil types. The transition may be more gradual than what is shown. We
have prepared the boring log on the basis of the field log of the materials encountered supplemented by
laboratory classification and testing.

Groundwater Conditions

Groundwater seepage was encountered within borings B-1 through B-3, B-5, B-6, and B-8 through B-10
at approximate depths ranging from 1 to 6 feet below existing grades, corresponding to approximate
Elevations 897-1/2 to 911 feet. Upon completion of drilling operations, groundwater was measured
within borings B-1 through B-3, B-5, B-6, and B-8 through B-10 at depths ranging from 5 to 32 feet
below existing grades, corresponding to approximate Elevations 871-1/2 to 908-1/2 feet. The remaining
borings were dry during and upon completion of drilling operations. Typically, a further estimate of the
historical groundwater levels may be made based on the soil color change from browns (aerobic condition
where free oxygen is available) to grays (anaerobic condition where free oxygen is not available). The
transition from brown to gray was observed at an approximate depths ranging from 4-1/2 to 13 feet below
existing grades, corresponding to approximate Elevations 896-1/2 to 900-1/2 feet.

Fluctuations in perched and long-term groundwater levels should also be anticipated due to seasonal
variations and following periods of prolonged precipitation. Groundwater observations made during
drilling operations in predominantly cohesive soils, such as were encountered at this site, are not
necessarily indicative of the static groundwater level. This is due to the low permeability of such soils
and the tendency of drilling operations to seal off the natural paths of groundwater flow.

SITE PREPARATION

At the time of the investigation, site grading plans were not available. However, we were provided plan
and profile sheets prepared by JCK & Associates, dated April and October 1996, as an estimate of
possible final grades along the roadway and bridge alignment. We anticipate that site grades will have to
be raised as much as 8 feet along the centerline of the roadway alignment and at the approaches to the
bridge to accommodate the anticipated finished grades. Some small grade cuts, on the order of 2 to 3 feet,
may be required along portions of the roadway alignment.

We anticipate earthwork operations will consist of removing topsoil and unsuitable organic soils from
within the vicinity of the proposed roadway alignment and bridge, excavating for foundations for the
bridge, backfilling behind the new bridge abutments and wingwalls, raising existing grades with
engineered fill, cutting grades in some areas, and preparing the roadway alignment subgrades. We
recommend all earthwork operations be performed in accordance with comprehensive specifications and
be observed in the field by qualified technical personnel working under the direction of a professional
engineer.
March 29, 2007
G2 Project No. 073005
Page No. 6

All vegetation, topsoil and unsuitable organic soils should be removed in their entirety from within the
areas to receive embankment fills (if required) or bridge wingwall backfills. The existing silty sand fill to
a depth of 2 feet within boring B-1, the peat to a depth of 3-1/2 feet within boring B-2, and the organic silt
to a depth of 13 feet within boring B-8 are not suitable for support of road embankment and pavement;
therefore, these soils should be undercut to stable, non-organic soils. The exposed subgrade should be
visually evaluated for additional unstable and/or unsuitable soil conditions. Any remaining unstable or
unsuitable areas noted should be removed and replaced with engineered fill. In the event the subgrade
becomes unstable, a layer of 1-inch by 3-inch crushed concrete, biaxial geogrid or woven geofabric could
be placed to stabilize the subgrade prior to the placement of engineered fill operations. A layer of MDOT
21AA dense-grade aggregate should be placed over the crushed concrete prior to placement of engineered
fill to minimize migration of fines into the open voids of the crushed concrete.

Engineered fill should be free of organic matter, frozen soil, clods, or other harmful material. We
recommend a soil, which meets the requirements of MDOT Class II granular material, be used as backfill
for the bridge abutments and wingwalls. We recommend soil embankments (if required) consist of
granular soils meeting the requirements of MDOT Class III material. The fill soils should be placed in
uniform horizontal layers that are not more than 9 inches in loose thickness. The engineered fill should
be compacted to achieve a density of at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density as determined by the
Modified Proctor compaction test (ASTM D 1557). All engineered fill material should be placed and
compacted at approximately the optimum moisture content. Frozen soil should not be used as fill, nor
should fill be placed on a frozen subgrade.

TEMPORARY EXCAVATIONS AND SLOPES

Where space is available for open-cut excavations, temporary unsurcharged slopes above groundwater
may be sloped back without shoring at ¾:1 (h:v) within the existing stiff to hard cohesive soils and 1-
1/4:1 (h:v) within the existing loose granular soils. If groundwater seepage is encountered, the slopes will
have to be flattened as necessary to maintain a stable excavation, but should not be left any steeper than
2:1(h:v) below the seepage level. Where sloped excavations are used, the tops of the slopes should be
barricaded to prevent vehicles and storage loads within five feet of the tops of the slopes. Berms are
recommended along the tops of slopes as necessary to prevent runoff water from entering the excavations
and eroding the slope faces.

Where sloped excavations are not possible, shoring will be required to support vertical cuts. For design
of cantilevered shoring, a triangular distribution of lateral earth pressure may be used. It may be assumed
that the retained soils with a level surface behind the cantilevered shoring will exert a lateral pressure
equal to that developed by a fluid with a density of 35 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) for soils above water
level. Soils below the water level should be modeled as a fluid with a density of 85 pcf. If construction
traffic or material storage is allowed within 10 feet of the excavation, a uniform lateral pressure of 200
pounds per square foot should be added to the design lateral loads.

For design of braced or tied-back shoring, we recommend the use of a rectangular distribution of lateral
earth pressure. It may be assumed that the retained soils with a level surface behind the braced shoring
will exert a lateral pressure equal to 24H in pounds per square foot, where H is the height of the shoring
in feet. Where shoring extends below the water table, an additional triangular distribution of hydrostatic
pressure should be added to the design lateral load.

Page No. 7

Due to the presence of the existing Rouge River, temporary cofferdams will be required to reduce water
infiltration into foundation excavations for the proposed bridge and to facilitate construction in dry
conditions. The cofferdam(s) may consist of interlocking steel sheet piling. The preferred type of sheet
piling consists of hot-rolled steel sheets, since the tight interlocks will not leak as much as cold-rolled
steel sheet piling interlocks. However, the type of sheet piling may be left to the discretion of the
contractor with the understanding that additional internal dewatering may be required for cold-rolled
sheeting. Since the retained soils will not be drained, cofferdams should be designed to include a
hydrostatic load as described above for shoring design.

The design of temporary cofferdams or shoring is typically the responsibility of the contractor. However,
we recommend that the design of the cofferdam(s) or shoring be developed by a registered professional
engineer with substantial experience in geotechnical engineering with respect to these types of structures.
If the cofferdam(s) include temporary bracing, the top elevation, tip elevation, and alignment of the steel
sheet piling must be designed to prevent interference with new foundation locations

All excavations should be safely sheeted, shored, sloped, or braced in accordance with MI-OSHA
requirements. If material is stored or equipment is operated near an excavation, stronger shoring must be
used to resist the extra pressure due to the superimposed loads. Care should always be exercised when
excavating near existing roadways or utilities to avoid undermining.

PERMANENT FILL EMBANKMENTS

At the time of this investigation, it was unknown whether sloped fill embankments would be possible
adjacent to the roadway alignment, or whether mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls would be
required constructed along the entire alignment. If sloped fill embankments are constructed, permanent
fill slopes may be designed at inclinations as steep as 2:1 (horizontal:vertical), provided the
recommendations presented in the Site Preparation section of this report are adhered to. In view of the
anticipated granular nature of the embankment fill material, slope erosion could occur, particularly if the
fill slopes are left unprotected. Accordingly, it is recommended that embankment slopes be protected
against erosion in accordance with current approved MDOT standard specifications.

FOUNDATION RECOMMNEDATIONS

Shallow Foundation Option

Assuming moderate foundation loads, as would typically be expected for the proposed short-span
culvert/bridge, we recommend the structure be supported on shallow spread foundations. At the time of
the investigation, the proposed bottom of foundation elevations were unknown; however, based on the
roadway profile sheet prepared by JCK, we anticipate the proposed bottom of foundations may be at
approximate Elevation 901-1/2 feet. We recommend a net allowable soil bearing capacity of 4,000 psf
for foundations extending through the existing unsuitable organic soils and very loose to loose granular
soils and bearing within the underlying native very stiff silty clay.
March 29, 2007
G2 Project No. 073005
Page No. 8

Foundations should bear a minimum of 3-1/2 feet below finished grade for protection against frost heave.
Continuous wall or strip foundations should be at least 16 inches in width. To achieve a change in the
level of a strip foundation, the foundation should be gradually stepped at a grade no steeper than two units
horizontal to one unit vertical. We recommend all spread foundations be suitably reinforced to minimize
the effects of differential settlements associated with local variations in soil conditions.

Due to the close proximity to the River Rouge, water will be encountered in foundation excavations.
Even with cofferdam shoring, we expect some accumulations of groundwater seepage in such
excavations, which should be controllable with normal pumping from properly constructed sumps.

Caving and/or sloughing of the native loose granular soils may occur during foundation excavation. As
such, the contractor should be prepared to over excavate and form footings within the granular soils, as
necessary. The sides of the spread and/or strip foundations should be constructed straight and vertical to
reduce the risk of frozen soil adhering to the concrete and raising the foundations.

Deep Foundation Alternative

If higher than normal loading conditions for the culvert/bridge are expected, then the structure could be
supported on a deep foundation system consisting of auger-cast piles. A deep foundation will provide
improved support and reduced potential for settlement as compared to shallow spread foundations. For
preliminary design of auger-cast pile foundations, we estimate an allowable capacity of 50 tons for 30-
inch diameter auger-cast piles bearing within the hard silty clay soils below an approximate Elevation 865
feet. When loading conditions have been determined for the proposed bridge structure, G2 can provide
additional deep foundation recommendations, if appropriate.

Drilled Pier for Traffic Signal

Based on MDOT standards, the foundations for the traffic signals consist of 3-foot diameter drilled
concrete pier foundations, which typically bear at a depth of 11-1/2 feet. Soil boring B-7 is located in the
vicinity of the proposed traffic signal. The soils encountered within boring B-7 consist of very stiff to
hard silty clay to the explored depth of 20 feet. We recommend the following soil parameters be used for
traffic signal drilled pier design:

    x   Unit Weight = 120 pcf
    x   Cohesion = 3,500 psf
    x   Allowable Bearing Pressure = 7,000 psf

Settlement

If the recommendations outlined in this report are adhered to, total and differential settlements for the
completed bridge structure should be within 1 inch and 1/2 inch, respectively. We expect settlements of
these magnitudes are within tolerable limits for the type of bridge structure proposed.
March 29, 2007
G2 Project No. 073005
Page No. 9

LATERAL EARTH LOADS

Based on the proposed anticipated bridge finished elevations and existing site grades, existing grades will
be raised approximately 9 feet above existing grades adjacent to the proposed bridge. We recommend
abutments and wingwalls be designed to resist a triangular distribution of lateral earth pressure, plus the
surcharge pressure that results from anticipated vehicular traffic. For design, it may be assumed that the
retained soils will exert a lateral pressure equal to that developed by a fluid with a density of 35 pounds
per cubic foot (pcf).

We recommend the use of well-drained, properly compacted fill, consisting of MDOT Class II granular
fill material, behind wingwalls. Wingwall drainage should be provided along the base of the heel
footings in accordance with the current approved MDOT Standard Detail.

PAVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Pavement Subgrade Preparation

The existing vegetation, topsoil, and unsuitable fill and organic soils should be removed within the
proposed roadway alignment. After removal of the unsuitable soils, all exposed subgrade soils should be
evaluated for stability before placing engineered fill and/or constructing the new pavement cross-section.
After rough grade has been achieved, the exposed subgrade should be thoroughly proof rolled using a
heavily loaded, rubber-tired, tandem-axle dump truck. Unsuitable soils or soils exhibiting excessive
instability, such as severe rutting or pumping under construction traffic, should be removed by
undercutting to expose stable soils. Any remaining unstable or unsuitable areas noted should be
improved by additional compaction or removed and replaced with engineered fill. In the event the
subgrade becomes unstable, the subgrade may be undercut an additional one foot, then a one-foot layer of
1-inch by 3-inch crushed concrete or stone can be placed atop a woven geotextile, such as Mirafi 500X, to
stabilize the subgrade.

Within areas where the subgrade is undercut, engineered fill should consist of imported sand meeting the
gradation requirements of MDOT Class II structural fill. All engineered fill should be compacted to a
density of a least 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable by the Modified Proctor (ASTM D 1557)
method of testing.

Pavement Design

We performed pavement design analyses in accordance with the "AASHTO Guide for Design of
Pavement Structures". At the time of the investigation, the proposed finished grades were not available.
However, based on the preliminary roadway profile sheets, we anticipate the subgrade soils will be
variable in nature, consisting of cohesive and granular fill with a trace amount of organic matter, native
silty clay, and engineered fill. Based on the presence of the silty clay fill with a trace amount of organic
matter subgrade soils, we have provided design pavement sections based on a subgrade California
Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of 4 percent.
March 29, 2007
G2 Project No. 073005
Page No. 10

At the time of the investigation, the anticipated average daily traffic (ADT) was not available. However,
we estimated the 18-kip equivalent single-axle loads (ESALs) to be approximately 1,000,000 over a 20-
year design life. For evaluation purposes, we estimated a serviceability loss of 2.0, a standard deviation
of 0.35, a reliability factor of 0.85, concrete strength of 4,000 pounds per square inch (psi), and an
effective modulus of subgrade reaction of 120 pci.

Based on the results of our analyses, we recommend the proposed Portland cement concrete pavement
section consist of 8 inches of non-reinforced MDOT P1 concrete supported on 6 inches of MDOT 21AA
dense-graded aggregate. All pavement materials are specified within the 2003 Standard Specifications for
Construction from the Michigan Department of Transportation. The concrete pavement materials are
described in Section 601. The aggregate materials for the subbase and concrete are described in Section
902.

Pavement Drainage

We recommend edge drains be provided along curbs, since they can become a source of water infiltration
into the pavement subgrade. Such drains should extend to a minimum depth of 4 inches below the bottom
of the granular subbase layer. These drains could be connected to nearby catch basins. In addition, we
recommend finger drains be installed at the catch basin locations. The pavement should be properly
sloped to promote effective surface drainage and prevent water from ponding.

Pavement Maintenance

Regular timely maintenance should be performed on the pavement to reduce the potential deterioration
associated with moisture infiltration through surface cracks. The owner should be prepared to seal the
cracks with a hot-applied elastic crack filler as soon as possible after cracking develops and as often as
necessary to block the passage of water to the subgrade soils.
.
GENERAL COMMENTS

We have formulated the evaluations and recommendations presented in this report relative to site
preparation and foundations without the benefit of data related to the bridge loading conditions and
proposed finished grades for the roadway alignment. When this data becomes available, G2 should be
notified so that we can review the recommendations presented herein.

The scope of the present investigation was limited to evaluation of subsurface conditions for the support
of the commercial structures and other related aspects of the development. No chemical, environmental,
or hydrogeological testing or analyses were included in the scope of this investigation.

We have based the analyses and recommendations submitted in this report upon the data from soil borings
performed at the approximate locations shown on the Soil Boring Location Plan, Plate 1. This report does
not reflect variations that may occur between the actual soil boring locations and the actual structure
locations.
March 29, 2007
G2 Project No. 073005
Page No. 11

Soil conditions at the site could vary from those generalized on the basis of soil borings made at specific
locations. It is, therefore, recommended that G2 Consulting Group, LLC be retained to provide soil
engineering services during the site preparation, foundation excavation, and roadway construction phases
of the proposed project. This is to observe compliance with the design concepts, specifications, and
recommendations. Also, this allows design changes to be made in the event that subsurface conditions
differ from those anticipated prior to the start of construction.

Boulders                  - greater than 12 inches                The major soil constituent is the principal noun, i.e. clay, silt,
Cobbles                   - 3 inches to 12 inches                 sand, gravel. The second major soil constituent and other
Gravel - Coarse           - 3/4 inches to 3 inches                minor constituents are reported as follows:
         - Fine           - No. 4 to 3/4 inches
Sand     - Coarse         - No. 10 to No. 4                       Second Major Constituent                Minor Constituent
         - Medium         - No. 40 to No. 10                         (percent by weight)                  (percent by weight)
         - Fine           - No. 200 to No. 40                          Trace - 1 to 12%                     Trace - 1 to 12%

Clay                      - Less than 0.005mm                          And - over 35%                      Some - 23 to 33%

                                                     COHESIVE SOILS
If clay content is sufficient so that clay dominates soil properties, clay becomes the principal noun with the other
major soil constituent as modifier, i.e. sandy clay. Other minor soil constituents may be included in accordance
with the classification breakdown for cohesionless soils, i.e. silty clay, trace sand, little gravel.

Relative Density of cohesionless soils is based upon the evaluation of the Standard Penetration Resistance (N),
modified as required for depth effects, sampling effects, etc.

                                                 SAMPLE DESIGNATIONS
AS -     Auger Sample ­ Cuttings directly from auger flight
BS -     Bottle or Bag Samples
S -      Spilt Spoon Sample - ASTM D 1586
LS -     Liner Sample with liner insert 3 inches in length
ST -     Shelby Tube sample - 3 inch diameter unless otherwise noted
PS -     Piston Sample - 3 inch diameter unless otherwise noted
RC -     Rock Core - NX core unless otherwise noted

STANDARD PENETRATION TEST (ASTM D 1586) - A 2.0 inch outside-diameter, 1-3/8 inch inside-diameter split barrel
sampler is driven into undisturbed soil by means of a 140-pound weight falling freely through a vertical distance of 30 inches.
The sampler is normally driven three successive 6-inch increments. The total number of blows required for the final 12 inches of
penetration is the Standard Penetration Resistance (N).

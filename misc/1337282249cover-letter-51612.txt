RE:     St. Francis Apartments 

On behalf of the Diocesan Bureau of Housing, Inc and St. Francis Apartments, Inc., we are pleased to 
submit this Application for Final Site Plan Review regarding the development of the St. Francis Church 
property into 58 Senior Apartments. This project will fill a critical  demand for affordable rental housing for 
the residents of Waterville.  We are confident that the final project is appropriate to the site and will fit 
within the neighborhood context and provide benefits for Waterville residents for many years to come. 
 
As previously presented, the project entails demolition and removal of the existing St. Francis Church, 
Rectory, and Parish Hall.  The proposed removal of these buildings has not come only after considerable 
discussion within the Diocese, extensive marketing the property for over 4 years, and exploration of 
options regarding renovation of the church building.  The bottom line is that the parish population base is 
dwindling to numbers that cannot support the operating costs, the real estate market has shown little 
interest in purchasing for adaptive reuse, and the building size and shape is not conducive to apartment 
renovation.  Recognizing its importance in the community, the Owners and Architect are proposing to 
salvage and reuse a number of key elements from the church building, such as windows, doors, plaques, 
woodwork and cabinets, and other elements.  We are proposing to reuse a portion of the steeple as a 
gazebo in the front yard, providing an honorable memory of the previous building.  A memo from CWS 
Architects is included with this letter that describes in detail the approach taken to review, catalog, and 
reuse these elements. 
 
The proposed project is envisioned to be completed in two phases, with the first phase of 40 apartments 
being located facing primarily on Elm Street and a second phase of 18 attached units attached at the rear 
of the building.  Phase one has been funded by HUD  and the hope is that construction will begin this fall, 
with occupancy by late summer, 2013.  The second phase will be dependent on phasing, but it is our hope 
htat its funding can come on the coattails of this first phase.  We are therefore requesting an extension of 
the completion date for the approved project for five years to allow for the application and funding cycle 
to take place. 
 
Access to the site will be from two locations a oneway driveway entrance off of Elm Street approximately 
75 feet south of Winter Street, and twoway egress from Percival Court which is located just south of the 
Elm Street/ Spring Street intersection.  Percival Court is a 15 foot wide twoway public way that has its 
own signal at the intersection.  Neighbors have voiced concerns about  our use of this street for egress, 
and accordingly we have completed  a traffic impact analysis  of the intersection which is also attached to 
this letter.  In it, Diane Morabito determines that a total of  15 oneway trips are projected during the peak 
hour of traffic flow, and should have `no measurable impact offsite on traffic operations beyond the 
access drives".  We believe that the limited vehicular use attributed to this project is below that of  the 
church when it was operating.

Understanding the limitations that the City has with respect to maintaining Percival Court, we are 
proposing to transfer an abutting parcel of land to the City that will allow expansion of Percival Court  to 
accommodate two way traffic (2 12 ft lanes), utility infrastructure, and snowplowing.   
 
We are also proposing to transfer a parcel of land (3,207 sf) at the southwest corner of the parcel to an 
abutter (Alan Rancourt), who has historically parked on the church property.  This will allow his tenants to 
continue to park in their historical location, as well as preserve an existing lawn area and buffer between 
the church property and Mr. Rancourt's property.  A draft  agreement  for this transfer is attached to this 
letter.  Finally, we are proposing ot reserve the rear portion of the site (7,342 SF) for either sale to an 
abutter (School) or use by the development.   
 
The project will provide a total of 58 parking spaces on the property for the tenants and staff, of which 47 
will be constructed in Phase One.  Six spaces will be located at the front of the building providing handicap 
access at the front door and room for visitors.  Another four spaces are located along te south side of the 
building, providing close proximity to the main entrance and community room.  Five spaces are located off 
of Winter Street, which will provide access to those tenants located in the north end of the building, as 
well as provide access and parking for service vehicles.  The remaining parking will be located to the rear 
of the property.  Eleven spaces are associated with Phase Two and are not proposed to be constructed 
until the additional  building is constructed and/or  it is determined that they are needed.  Our experience 
on many senior housing projects indicates that a parking ratio of 1:1 is not necessary to meet the needs of 
the project as many tenants do not drive or own autos. 
 
Service access to the site is proposed to occur from the drive on Winter Street.  The mechanical rooms and 
a waste storage room are located on this side of the building and this drive will provide easy and secure 
access to these facilities.  Emergency access to the site will be from all driveways, as well as use of the 
existing church driveway on Elm Street, which will be restricted to fire/ emergency vehicles only, plowed 
during the winter, and  the existing driveway into the site from Elm Street.  Snowplowing and snow 
storage will occur in several locations in the rear of the site during Phase One, and once Phase Two is 
completed the snow will either be stored on site or transported offsite for disposal id=f there is not 
adequate space available on the property. 
 
We are proposing an extensive landscape plan that is intended to provide a strong street edge along Elm 
and Winter streets, buffering along the north property line where we abut a residential neighborhood, and 
trees in the parking areas to soften the parking lots and provide some shade.  In addition,  6 foot vinyl solid 
board fence is proposed to be installed along the north property line to further screen the project form its 
neighbors.  It is noted that the proposed buildings is are located further from the property line than the 
existing church in all directions. 
 
A lighting plan has been submitted that proposes a number of highly efficient LED type lights strategically 
located throughout the site.  The lighting consists of pole lights for the parking and roadway lighting, 
bollard lights along the sidewalks adjacent to the building, and a single building mounted cutoff fixture in 
the rear service area.  A photometric plan has also been submitted that illustrates how the lighting will 
provide safe levels of light on the property but not spill off onto the neighboring lands.

Corpus Christi Parish is proposing to repurpose the former St. Francis de Sales Church property located at 52 Elm Street in
Waterville, Maine as affordable rental elderly housing. This proposal is the result of more than 5 years of seeking a future use
for the site of the former Catholic Parish facilities that included an attempt to sell the property on the market for almost 4
years with very limited interest and no offers.

Following this period of inactivity, the Parish began to pursue opportunities to redevelop the parcel themselves with a use
compatible with their mission. The Diocesan Bureau of Housing has been successful developing and operating affordable
rental housing over many years. Since it was highly unlikely that any other use or user would be found, the Parish has
concluded that keeping the property in the "church family" and redeveloping it as a high quality 58 unit affordable senior
housing community (built over 2 phases) was the best way to preserve the Parish's 150 years of history on the site.

In the summer of 2010, CWS met with representatives of the Parish to visit the property and discuss opportunities to reuse
the facilities and/or site as elderly housing. The preliminary building program requirements included a development of a) one
building (potentially 2 phases) with 40 one-bedroom apartment units, and b) one future addition of 18 one-bedroom
apartments so as to provide the development with construction and operating cost efficiencies necessary for the facility's
long term financial health.

The first consideration was to explore the feasibility of repurposing the existing facilities as elderly apartments. The result of
this study concluded that repurposing the existing church structure into elderly housing was not feasible for many reasons.
For example:
      The width of the church is too narrow and bay spacing is too small to allow for appropriate sized units.
      The existing window patterns would have to be considerably modified to work as residential units.
      A second floor would need to be added inside the church at an unaffordable cost.
      The cost of heating the existing volume of heated space within the church would be unaffordable.
      The cost of renovating such a large and ornate historic structure would far exceed reasonable budgets.
      The cost of maintaining the building's exterior components would be extensive and unaffordable.

Having ruled out repurposing the building as affordable housing, the focus of the study shifted to repurposing the site for the
same use. In so doing, the Parish desires that the "presence" of property's historic use be preserved and incorporated into
the redevelopment of the site and new facilities to the extent feasible. To achieve this purpose, components of the existing
church will be incorporated into the fabric of the site and the new building, both interior and exterior, so as to preserve the
memory of the Parish's 150 years on the site. Some of the items that have been considered initially include:
      Incorporating the church's stained glass windows into the building's faуade and interior common spaces.
      Relocating the lower base of the steeple as an exterior gazebo located near the sidewalk on Elm Street.
      Utilizing some of the pews as perimeter seating in the community spaces.
      Incorporating some of the doors and door hardware in the common areas where possible.
      Restoring and utilizing some of the ornate interior woodwork in the building's common areas and corridors.
      Resetting the statue of St. Francis de Sales in a prominent location on the site.
      Inventorying other existing built-in features to be reinstalled in the buildings common areas.
      Document the existing structure through historical photographs for display in the new structure.

In conclusion, the Parish has endorsed the latter site redevelopment plan that includes a new senior housing use as the most
appropriate and sound approach to repurposing the historic St. Francis de Sales church site as a long term, valuable
contributing asset to the Waterville community for many decades to come.

Introduction

        The purpose of this report is to assess the traffic impacts of a proposed elderly
housing development, St. Francis Apartments, in Waterville, Maine. The site location is
shown on the map in Figure 1. Access will be provided by a one-way entrance drive from
Elm Street and by Percival Court. The proposed housing development will provide for a
total of fifty-eight (58) senior apartments, to be developed in two phases. Forty (40) units
will be developed in Phase 1 with eighteen (18) additional units in Phase 2. It is
understood that construction will begin in 2012 with occupancy planned for Fall of 2013.
As a result, 2013 was used as a study year for traffic analysis purposes.


Existing Conditions

        Elm Street is a paved two-lane roadway with separate right and left-turn lanes at
the intersection of Spring Street/Percival Court. The speed limit is posted at 25 mph on
Elm Street.


Trip Generation

         The number of trips which will be generated by the proposed elderly apartments
was estimated using the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) "Trip Generation, 8th
Edition" report, the most recent edition. Both land use codes (LUCs) 251 Г Senior Adult
Housing Г Detached and 252 Г Senior Adult Housing Г Attached were evaluated. The
results for fifty-eight (58) dwelling units are summarized below:

        As can be seen above, the detached home trip rates yielded higher estimates than
the attached land use code. An average of the detached and attached results will be used
to be conservative even though the proposed facility will be attached apartments and not
detached single cottage units.

        The St. Francis apartments, based upon the analysis, are expected to generate 204
one-way or 102 round-trips per day. The peak hour for the elderly housing project is
expected to be the weekday PM peak hour period. A total of 15 one-way trips are
projected for this peak hour, 8 entering and 7 exiting the site. Based upon this limited trip
generation, the residential apartments should have no measurable impact off-site on traffic
operations beyond the access drives. Generally, no traffic operational impacts, on level of
service or capacity, are expected unless there are greater than 25 trips in a lane in an hour.
This senior housing development is expected to generate a maximum of 3 lane trips in any
hour.


Traffic Volumes

        A turning movement count was conducted by Maine Traffic Resources at the
intersection of Elm Street, Spring Street and Percival Court during the PM peak hour
period on Tuesday, May 15, 2012 to determine existing traffic volumes. The PM peak
hour was selected since it is the highest hour for the intersection based upon 2009 AM,
mid-day and PM peak hour counts, conducted by Maine Traffic Resources for the
Waterville-Winslow MaineDOT signal improvement project, and also since it is the
highest hour for the senior apartments. The PM peak hour occurred from 3:45 to 4:45
PM. The count summary is included in the appendix. The count was factored to 30th
highest hour volumes using published MaineDOT group mean factors. The results,
expected to be representative of peak summer volumes, are shown in Figure 2.

       Existing average annual daily traffic (AADT) data for the vicinity of the site was
obtained from "Traffic Volume Counts, 2011 Annual Report", published by MaineDOT.
This data is summarized below:

                                                     Average Annual Daily Traffic

        As can be seen in the preceding table, traffic volumes within the vicinity of the
proposed apartments have increased at an average annual rate of approximately 1 % over
the recent period 2008 to 2011. To be conservative, a 2 % growth rate was used to
project the existing 2012 volumes to base 2013 conditions. The resulting 2013 volumes
are also shown in Figure 2. The trip assignments, based upon the traffic patterns recorded
during the turning movement count, are shown in Figure 3. The projected 2013 build
volumes, with all 58 residential units fully occupied, are also shown in Figure 3.


Capacity Analysis

        Traffic operations are evaluated in terms of level of service (LOS). Level of
service is a qualitative measure that describes operations by letter designation. The levels
range from A - very little delay to F - extreme delays. Level of service "D" is generally
considered acceptable in urban locations while LOS "E" is generally considered the
capacity of a facility and the minimum tolerable level. The level of service for signalized
intersections is based upon average control delay per vehicle, as defined in the following
table excerpted from the 2000 "Highway Capacity Manual":

                         Signalized Intersection Level of Service
                         LOS              Control Delay per Vehicle
                         A                < = 10.0 seconds
                         B                > 10.0 and <= 20.0
                         C                > 20.0 and <= 35.0
                         D                > 35.0 and <= 55.0
                         E                > 55.0 and <= 80.0
                         F                > 80.0

        Even though limited impact is expected on the signalized intersection, a quick level
of service analysis was performed to assure that the signalized intersection is operating at
an acceptable LOS "D" or better as required by Waterville's ordinance. The analysis was
based upon signal timing measurements recorded during the turning movement count.
The level of service was calculated for existing 2012 and projected 2013 no-build and
build conditions for the signalized intersection of Elm Street, Spring Street and Percival
Court using Highway Capacity Plus software (HCS+) and the measured existing
timings/phasings. The results are summarized as follows:

         As can be seen above, the signalized access intersection of Elm and Spring Streets
currently operates at a LOS "C" overall, based upon the existing operations measured in
the field. This same level of service is expected in 2013 with the proposed St. Francis
Apartments fully occupied, showing that the residential project will have minimal impact
on this intersection.

        It is important to note that the detection for the Percival Court approach did not
always operate properly during the turning movement count. There was one occasion
when the detection did not trip and the driver ultimately exited on red. There were also
several circumstances when vehicles exited Percival Court on red, prior to the signal
change (on these occasions the detection functioned but the drivers did not wait for
green). It is recommended that the City of Waterville inspect the detection and adjust the
timing as needed to try to correct this situation.


Safety Analysis
Accident Review

         The Maine Department of Transportation uses two criteria to determine high crash
locations (HCLs). The first is the critical rate factor (CRF), which is a measure of the
accident rate. A CRF greater than one indicates a location which has a higher than
expected accident rate. The expected rate is calculated as a statewide average of similar
facilities.

        The second criterion, which must also be met, is based upon the number of
accidents that occur at a particular location. Eight or more accidents must also occur over
the three-year study period for the location to be considered a high crash location.
Accident data was obtained from MaineDOT for Elm Street, Spring Street and Percival
Court within the vicinity of the site for the most recent three-year period, 2009 - 2011.
This data is summarized by location in the following table:

                                           Page 4
St. Francis Apartments                                                                5/16/2012

Intersection of Elm Street and Western Avenue                            11        0.68
Elm Street between Western Avenue and Elm Court                           2        0.34
Elm Street between School Street and Percival Court                       1        0.33
Elm Street between Winter Street and Park/Appleton Streets                1        0.21
Intersection of Elm Street and Park/Appleton Streets                      9        0.54
Intersection of Spring Street, Silver Street and Concourse               3         0.25
Spring Street between the Concourse/Silver Street and Elm Street         1         0.94

        As can be seen above, there are no locations within the vicinity of the proposed
apartments that meet the high crash criteria. As a result, no additional accident review or
evaluation is necessary.


Driveway Sight Distance

       One of the most important safety factors to consider for a project with limited trip
generation, such as this, is sight distance from the access drive. This sight distance is
measured ten feet back from the edge of travel way at a driver's eye height of 3.5 feet to
an object height of 4.25 feet. Maine Traffic Resources recommend a minimum sight
distance of 250' for the 25 mph speed limit. Since this drive is signalized the sight
distance will also be necessary when the traffic signal is operating on flash, such as during
power failures. Sight distance was measured from the Percival Court exit drive. Sight
distance exceeds 300' in both the right and left directions. Since the sight distances
exceed the minimum there are no sight distance concerns.



SUMMARY

        To summarize, given projected peak trip generation of only 15 one-way trips per
hour, no traffic operational impacts on level of service or capacity would be expected.
Capacity analysis showed that the signalized intersection of Elm Street, Spring Street and
Percival Court currently operates at LOS "C" overall and is expected to remain at this
level with the proposed St. Francis Apartments fully occupied. In terms of safety, no high
crash locations were identified within the vicinity of the proposed elderly apartments.
Sight distance from the exit at Percival Court exceeds the recommended minimum for the
event that the traffic signal is not operating. Some detection and timing issues were
observed for vehicles exiting Percival Court. It is recommended that the City of
Waterville inspect and adjust the detection/timings to try to correct the current situation.

Francis Apartments,      Inc. with respect to the proposed transfer;

          Mr. Rancourt paying for any title research or title insurance he may wish to undertake
or obtain on the property and, in that regard, I would note that we have had title to the Church
property examined by Central Maine Title Company which I'm sure would be happy to issue
a title insurance policy to him; .1

6,      Mr. Rancourt and any lenders holding mortgages on his property executing a release
deed to St. Francis Apartments, Inc. releasing any and all claims he and they may have
against the remainder of the Church property.

I trust this letter is responsive to your request for confirmation of St. Francis Apartments,
Inc.'s agreement on this matter but please get back to me if you or Mr. Rancourt have any
questions.

Also, I would appreciate your having Mr. Rancourt sign this letter below and returning a
signed version to me.

With best regards.

-Very truly yours,




         David P. Twomey

         Patrick Carroll
         Ben Walter

Seen and agreed to as of the 15'" day of May, 2012.




Allan L. Rancourt


'ou    will note, by the way, that there is a strip of land approximately five (5) feet in width that extends into the
Church property from Percival Court. Old Republic Title has authorized Central Maine Title Company to issue a
policy to St. Francis Apartments, Inc. without exception for lack of title to this strip and I assume that they will be
willing to issue the same coverage to Mr. Rancourt but you may want to check with Don Guild at Central Maine
Title Company to confirm that to be the case.

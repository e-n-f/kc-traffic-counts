EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
SR 99 is currently a two-lane facility between US 341 and Interstate 95. Between SR 25 Spur
and I-95, SR 99 is classified as a Rural Major Collector. To the west, between SR 25 Spur and
US 341, SR 99 is classified as an Urban Minor Arterial. SR 99 is a designated Glynn County
Hurricane Evacuation Route.

A great deal of development is planned in the area, much of which is currently underway. The
Long Range Transportation Plan for the Glynn County area is scheduled to be updated in the
next year and a half. Local planners estimate that the Glynn County region will grow by an
annual rate of approximately 2.5 to 3 percent. This rate would equate to approximately 20,000 to
26,000 new households within the County by 2035.

The Gateway Glynn area, which is generally located around Interstate 95 between and adjacent
to exits 38 and 42, is anticipated to eventually develop with approximately 40,000 dwelling
units, 16.3 million square feet of commercial facilities, 15 million square feet of industrial use,
and various supporting public facilities. Much of the development in Glynn County will be
focused on this area, which will impact SR 99.

By 2035, approximately 8,000 new residential units are anticipated to be constructed in the areas
immediately surrounding SR 99. These units, along with planned commercial and industrial
sites, could generate upwards of 130,000 new trips. Volumes along SR 99 are projected to reach
approximately 25,000 vehicles per day in a design year of 2035. To accommodate this rise in
traffic, SR 99 will require widening to a four lane facility.

There is an existing at-grade crossing of a Norfolk Southern Railroad approximately 850 feet
west of Chanslor Road. By the design year, the estimated crossing exposure (the product of the
number of trains per day and the AADT) will be 375,000. The Federal Highway
Administration's Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook states that highway-rail grade
crossings should be considered for grade separation whenever the crossing exposure is greater
than 250,000 in rural areas. Given the potential for rail and vehicular conflicts, consideration
should be given to incorporating a grade separation into the widening of SR 99.

This study provides preliminary design considerations for existing and planned intersections
along SR 99. As the area develops, new intersections will be required at development access
points. These new intersections should be evaluated in future traffic impact studies. With
widening and appropriate intersection controls, SR 99 should continue to operate at efficient
levels of service.

INTRODUCTION
SR 99 is currently a two-lane facility. East of SR 25 Spur, SR 99 is currently classified as a
Rural Major Collector; west of SR 25 Spur, SR 99 is currently classified as an Urban Minor
Arterial. A great deal of development is planned on the surrounding parcels, much of which is
currently underway. Current and future development will increase traffic volumes on SR 99 and
in the surrounding area. This study aims to quantify the anticipated development and predict the
improvement needs for the SR 99 corridor.

The length of the study area is approximately 5.5 miles, from Interstate 95 exit 42 to
US 341/US 25. The US 341/US 25 intersection is signalized with auxiliary turn lanes on SR 99
for each directional movement. All of the other intersections along the route are stop controlled,
without auxiliary turn lanes. The SR 99/SR 25 Spur intersection is planned to be widened as part
of GDOT project STP- 0000-000(421), which will widen SR 25 Spur from two lanes to four. A
location map of the study area is shown in Figure 1.

Peak hour turning movement counts were taken at the major intersections along SR 99 in the fall
of 2008. Daily machine counts were also taken at several locations along the corridor.

Intersections included in this analysis are:

   1.    SR 99 and US 341/US 25
   2.    SR 99 and Chris Road
   3.    SR 99 and Chanslor Road
   4.    SR 99 and Georgia Pacific access
   5.    SR 99 and Coastal Pines Golf Course access
   6.    SR 99 and SR 25 Spur

Access points to future development will create other intersections along SR 99. As master plans
for these parcels are more clearly defined, additional traffic analysis and traffic impact studies
will be needed. In general, the location of future signals and other development access points
should be planned in accordance with standard principles outlined in the Transportation Research
Board publication Access Management Manual and GDOT policy.

EXISTING VOLUMES
Peak hour turning movement counts were taken at the study intersections in the fall of 2008,
along with daily machine counts at several locations along SR 99. A capacity analysis for the
existing conditions was performed using the current counts; results are shown in Table 1.

Daily counts indicate that the volume along SR 99 is approximately 2,500-3,000 vehicles per day
(vpd) east of SR 25 Spur and 4,000-4,500 vpd near US 341. Volumes on US 341 are
approximately 16,500-17,000 vpd. Peak volumes along SR 99 were approximately 250- 300
vehicles per hour (vph) near I-95 and 400-450 vph near US 341.

GDOT count station data supports these volumes, estimating that the 2007Average Annual Daily
Volume on SR 99 at approximately 3,970 vehicles per day near US 341 (count station 181) and
2,260 vehicles per day just west of Interstate 95 (count station 183).

These volumes indicate that the roadway is currently functioning at a LOS A-B.

PLANNED ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
A section of GA 99 (approximately 0.4 miles on each side of GA 25 Spur) will be widened as
part of the SR 25 Spur widening project (P.I. 0000421). These sections are included in the SR
25 Spur project to improve operations at the intersection of the two major roadways. The
planned improvements set up GA 99 for an eventual widening to become a four lane divided
section similar to SR 25 Spur.

Project NHIMO-0095-01(117) is currently underway to widen and reconstruct Interstate 95
through portions of Glynn and McIntosh Counties. A separate GDOT project (STP-0001-
00(422)) proposes to widen GA 99 east of I-95 to US 17 and improve the interchange. This
proposed project is in the long range plan but is not currently funded.

A proposed extension of SR 25 Spur is planned through the Northwest Quadrant development to
eventually connect west to US 341. Approximately 2 miles of this extension, as a 2 lane
roadway, has been constructed north of SR 99 by area developers.


AREA DEVELOPMENT
GATEWAY GLYNN
This area of Glynn County has experienced tremendous growth pressures in the recent past.
With so much available land and easy access to Interstate 95, the aggressive pace of development
surrounding SR 99 is anticipated to continue. Figure 2 shows the area surrounding SR 99 and
the development anticipated to occur.

Multiple major developments are currently in various stages of planning and construction nearby
SR 99. On the east side of SR 25 Spur south of SR 99, the Tradewinds development is planning
the construction of commercial, residential, and industrial uses on a 680 acre tract. On the north
side of SR 99 where SR 25 terminates, a group of landowners has begun "The Estates at Gol den
Isles," which is currently permitted to include over 500 residential units. To serve this and other
projects, developers have constructed a two-lane extension of SR 25 Spur (with right of way for
future widening) north of SR 99 for approximately two miles. Other residential developments
currently underway in the immediate vicinity of SR 99 include Odyssey Lake (232 units), Grants
Ferry Cove (115 units), Sweetwater (524 units), Autumns Wood (219 units), and Tanglewood
(137 units) developments. Most of the traffic associated with these developments will either
access directly on to SR 99 or SR 25 Spur.

Other tracts adjacent to SR 99 are also planned to be developed prior to the 2035 design year. A
master plan for the "Northwest Quadrant" area has been developed to include the area referred to
as the Satilla Forest, Altama, and DMR tracts. These properties are located (generally) on the
north side of SR 99 and west of Interstate 95. Though the details of the master plan are not fully
defined, the development is envisioned as a large mixed use project with multiple residential
tracts, a village center, a school site, and numerous commercial pods. Bordering I-95 and GA
99, a large "highway commercial" and retail area is envisioned. Up to 17,300 reside ntial units
and 9.2 million square feet of commercial space are planned.

In all, the "Gateway Glynn" developments, which consist of approximately 14,500 acres, are
envisioned to develop approximately 40,000 dwelling units, 16.3 million square feet of
commercial facilities, 15 million square feet of industrial use, and various supporting public
facilities. The development is generally located around Interstate 95 between and adjacent to
exits 38 and 42. A Development of Regional Impact for the Gateway Glynn area was completed
in 2008.

DEVELOPMENT ASSUMPTIONS
For areas that have defined master plans, the actual number of units and square footages included
in the plans are used. For undeveloped parcels that are anticipated to be developed but do not
have specific master plans, the following assumptions are made:

       For residential only areas ­ 3.0 units per gross acre
       For retail only areas ­ 3,000 sf per gross acre
       For mixed use areas ­ 1.5 residential units and 1,000 square foot retail per gross acre
       For industrial area ­ 5 employees per gross acre

RATE OF GROWTH
The pace of development will obviously depend on market conditions and other unknown
factors. The regional transportation planning agency, the Brunswick Area Transportation Study
(BATS) is beginning the process of updating the Long Range Transportation Plan. According to
local planners, this update of the BATS report will anticipate a growth factor for Glynn County
of approximately 2.5 to 3 percent per year. Most of this growth, 70 to 80 percent, is predicted to
occur on the mainland portions of Glynn County.

With the anticipated growth rate, the number of households in Glynn County could increase by
20,000 to 26,000 by 2035. The Gateway Glynn area is expected to represent a significant
portion of the new development within the County.

For the purposes of this study and in order to estimate the future roadway needs along SR 99, an
anticipated rate of growth within each development parcel is considered. The assumptions made
imply that approximately 40 to 50 percent of new growth in the County will occur within the
Gateway Glynn area.


TRIP GENERATION
In order to estimate the site traffic generated by new development, several assumptions are made
regarding land use types and densities. The density assumptions roughly follow those included
in established master plan agreements, within Development of Regional Impact (DRI)
submittals, and assumptions used by local planners.

Trip generation calculations could be better estimated once more detailed information is known
about each specific land use within the area. For this study, trip generation for the overall area is
broken down into sections based on location.

Trip generation estimates are based on equations outlined in the Institute of Transportation
Engineers, Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, 2008. General land use categories, as opposed
to specific use categories (i.e. condominiums or supermarket), are utilized in order to estimate a
daily trip count.

For residential uses, ITE land use category 270 (Residential PUD) is used. This land use
category is characterized by ITE as "containing any combination of residential land uses. These
developments might also contain supporting services such as limited retail and recreational
facilities."

ITE land use category 820 (Shopping Center), is used for the retail and commercial areas.
Shopping Centers are described as "an integrated group of commercial establishments that is

planned, developed, owned and managed as a unit. A shopping center's composition is related to
its market area in terms of size, location and type of store."

Trips shown in the following table represent the overall number of trips generated, not
necessarily the amount of new traffic added to the roadway system. An estimate of the
percentage of each development to be constructed by 2035 is also shown in Table 2.

Since this is such a large mixed use area, many of the trips will be captured internally within
each section and within the overall development. Many of the trips shown to and from the retail
areas will come from the existing traffic already on the surrounding roadways and interstate
("pass-by" trips).

TRIP DISTRIBUTION
With such a large area, many of the trips generated will begin and end within the region. Given
the size and location of the developments, the Gateway Glynn region could become a small
municipality in and of itself.

The amount of trips "captured" within the adjoining developments could represent a significant
amount of the overall number generated. The amount of internal trips within each development
will vary depending on the size, location, and mix of uses within each area. For the purposes of
this study, trips are distributed along SR 99 and the surrounding roadways based on access
location and the following general distribution patterns.

Area A (Northwest Quadrant development)
      20% to SR 99 east
      20% to SR 99 west
      20% to SR 25 Spur
      40% internal and to adjacent developments

Area B (2,000 acre mixed use)
       5% to SR 99 east
       5% to SR 99 west

TRAFFIC VOLUME PREDICTIONS
CURRENT
Current volumes along SR 99 are relatively low, as would be expected for an area that has so
much undeveloped land. With the land use changes expected in the region, future volumes
should be based more on anticipated development than on recent counts. Historical data
indicates some significant recent growth. Volumes along SR 99 have approximately doubled
over the past 5 years, from 2,000 vehicles per day (vpd) in 2002 to 4,000 vpd in 2007.

Volumes on US 341 have also seen significant growth over the same time period. In 2002, the
ADT on US 341 was approximately 14,960 vpd; by 2007 volumes had grown to approximately
19,400 vpd (a 5% annual increase). Such an increase on a principal arterial such as US 341 is a
prime indicator of the growth that the area is experiencing.

Estimates of the 2008 daily volumes at the study intersections are shown in Figure 3.

BUILD (2015) AND DESIGN (2035) YEAR VOLUMES
As mentioned in the development assumptions, only a portion of each proposed development is
assumed to be constructed. The volumes predicted in this report do not represent an ultimate
(50+ years) development scenario, but are based on development assumptions coordinated with
local planners. Other internal connections and arterial roadways will be needed within several of
the developments to accommodate an ultimate build out scenario.

To estimate a design year volume, trips generated by the anticipated development are assigned to
the roadway network. Volumes at each intersection and along SR 99 were estimated for the
2035 design year. Based on the distribution assumptions mentioned earlier, the average daily
volume along SR 99 is predicted to be approximately 25,000 vehicles per day in 2035.

The 2015 estimates will obviously depend more on the short term economy than will the ultimate
build out plans. To estimate the build year volumes in 2015, the development assumptions
mentioned are reduced by 2/3rds; daily estimates on SR 99 are in the 8,000 to 10,000 vehicle per
day range. The daily build and design year volumes are shown in Figures 4A and 4B.

Peak hour estimates are derived from the daily 2035 estimates. Each peak hour is assumed to
represent approximately 10% of the daily volume. In accordance with current patterns, a 60%-
40% split is assumed during the morning and afternoon peak hours. More vehicles are typically
headed eastbound in the morning and westbound in the afternoon. The design year peak hour
volumes are shown in Figures 5A and 5B.

GDOT DESIGN CRITERIA
To accommodate the anticipated volumes, a four-lane section along SR 99 will be needed.

As mentioned earlier, east of SR 25 Spur, SR 99 is classified as a Rural Major Collector. West
of SR 25 Spur, SR 99 is classified as an Urban Minor Arterial.

The length and design of the turn lanes at each median opening will depend on the type of
median crossover used. GDOT provides guidance for three types of median crossovers, Type A,
Type B and Type C. As part of the SR 25 Spur widening, a Type B median crossover was
designed along SR 99 for both approaches to SR 25 Spur. The SR 25 Spur project was designed
to include Type B median crossovers at all median openings.

The overall SR 99 corridor should provide a consistent design and consistent median width; the
design specifics of the cross section should be determined in coordination with GDOT. For this
preliminary study, the cross section is assumed to match the concept for the SR 25 Spur
widening. It is assumed that all median openings and turn lanes are designed with Type B
median crossovers for 55 mph; a 44 foot median width is assumed. Should a different cross
section or median width be chosen, the lengths indicated in this report would change.

GDOT guidelines provide distances for the taper, striping, and storage at median openings (see
GDOT construction detail in the appendix). Type B median crossovers recommend a minimum
deceleration length of 150 feet (300 feet desirable), a 240 foot transition, and a 180 foot taper for
left turn lanes (55 mph and 44 foot median). Storage requirements are added to the deceleration
lengths to determine the overall design lengths.

For right turn lanes, the GDOT Driveway and Encroachment Manual recommends 250 feet of
storage and 100 feet of taper for roadways with 55 mph speeds.

The 95th percentile traffic queues for each intersection are estimated using Synchro and
Simtraffic software. The calculated queues are evaluated to determine the storage distances
recommended at each median opening.

RAILROAD CROSSING
A Norfolk Southern Railroad crosses SR 99 approximately 850 feet west of Chanslor Road.
According to rail officials, approximately 8 to 10 trains currently cross SR 99 daily. By 2035,
crossings are anticipated to increase to 12 to 15 times per day. If a new container port facility is
developed in Brunswick, this number could potentially be much higher.

The Federal Highway Administration's Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook is
consulted with regard to determining the appropriate treatment of the crossing. The handbook
states that highway-rail grade crossings should be considered for grade separation or otherwise
eliminated across the railroad right of way whenever the crossing exposure (the product of the
number of trains per day and the AADT) exceeds 1 million in urban areas or 250,000 in rural
areas (the full section of the "Technical Working Group Guidance" in the Handbook is attached
in the Appendix).



       SR 99 Traffic Study                                                                 Page | 17
       Glynn County, Georgia                                                              J ­ 21089
With an expected 15 trains per day and a design year AADT of 25,000 vehicles per day, the
crossing exposure at this location would be 375,000. Since this number is over the 250,000
threshold for rural areas, consideration should be given to incorporating a grade separation into
the widening of SR 99.

SIGNALS
The design year volumes are analyzed under unsignalized and signalized scenarios using
Synchro software. None of the study intersections warrant new signalization based on the
current volumes.

The 8-hour warrant (Warrant 1A and 1B) is evaluated in accordance with the GDOT Design
Manual, where the 8th highest hourly volume is estimated as representing 6.25% of the daily
volumes. The peak hour warrant (Warrant 3) is evaluated using the highest peak hour volume.
Warrants 4 (pedestrian), 5 (school crossing), 6 (coordinated systems), and 8 (roadway network)
either do not apply or cannot be evaluated. Warrant 7 (crash experience) is not met for any of
the intersections.

Signal warrant analyses all assume that the main road and the minor street approaches are both
"2 or more" lanes. Reduced volume thresholds are used because speed limits along the major
street will be greater than 40 mph. A summary of the warrant analyses is included at the end of
the report.

CAPACITY
Capacity analyses are completed for the morning and afternoon design year peak hours. Levels
of Service (LOS) and delay at each intersection are determined based on the recommended lane
configurations and mentioned intersection control. Results are shown in the Table 3.

NEW INTERSECTIONS
As mentioned earlier, new development in the area will require several new access point
intersections along SR 99. Access points to the Northwest Quadrant (Figure 2-Area A) and the
Tradewinds (Figure 2-Area D) developments will likely require additional signalized
intersections on SR 99 east of SR 25 Spur. Access points to these developments should align
with each other to minimize the number of signals needed.

Access points to the commercial area along the south side of SR 99 west of SR 25 Spur (Figure
2-Area G) may also require a signalized access. A signalized access to this parcel should align
with the main access to area H (shown as intersection 5, Coastal Pines access).

The overall plan for signalized and unsignalized access points along SR 99 will be developed
over time as master plans for each specific area are defined. As these plans unfold, an overall
access management plan should be developed to ensure that proper intersection and signal
spacing is provided.

INTERSECTION ANALYSIS
As mentioned, several new intersections will be created as master plans for particular
developments are established. Traffic impact studies for future developments can better define
the location and design of these new intersections. This study provides analysis of the existing
intersections based on current plans and the assumptions mentioned earlier in this report.


INTERSECTION 1 ­ SR 99 AND US 341 (SR 25)
The existing signalized intersection provides separate turn bays for all movements. US 341
provides two through lanes for north and south bound movements, along with auxiliary turn
lanes for each movement. Intersection improvements on SR 99 should include widening the east
and west bound (SR 99) approaches to include two through lanes. Auxiliary turn lanes for each
directional movement should be retained.

As mentioned, a Type B median opening approach is assumed for SR 99. Storage length is
added to the minimum 150 foot deceleration length. Standard 240 foot transition and 180 tapers
are assumed. Recommended turn lane lengths are as follows.

                                  Expected Queue          Total storage and         transition / taper

Given the anticipated volumes with lane improvements and modifications to signal timing, the
intersection should continue to function adequately in the future. Figure 6 shows a sketch of the
proposed improvements.

INTERSECTION 2 ­ SR 99 AND CHRIS ROAD
The existing intersection provides access to a small residential neighborhood. The intersection is
approximately 700 feet east of the US 341 intersection and intersects SR 99 at a very skewed
angle. This road is not anticipated to serve additional development in the foreseeable future.

The length of an eastbound left turn lane into Chris Road may be restricted by the proximity to
US 341. This intersection will need to remain under stop control. Ideally, the intersection
should be relocated to the east to correct the existing skew and intersect at an angle closer to 90
degrees. Relocation would improve sight distances and provide a greater separation from
US 341.

Recommended turn lane lengths are as follows, though the actual length will be restricted by the
proximity to US 341. Figure 7 provides an intersection sketch.

INTERSECTION 3 ­ SR 99 AND CHANSLOR ROAD
The existing intersection is planned to provide the sole access to a planned 890 unit residential
PUD. This road may also provide a secondary access to the commercial tracts along the south
side and adjacent to SR 99.

The intersection is approximately 850 feet east of the Norfolk Southern railroad crossing. With a
grade separation at the railroad tracks, the elevation of this intersection may need to be adjusted
to accommodate the approach grade of the bridge. Further study will be required to properly
design the intersection with regard to the vertical alignment and sight distance. Turn lane
recommendations, based on a Type B median opening, are as follows.

                                Expected Queue         Total storage and         transition / taper

Traffic volumes may meet several of the signal warrants in the design year. When (and whether)
this happens will depend on the pace of development and the potential for internal connection
with the commercial areas adjacent to SR 99 (Area "G" on Figure 2). Given the anticipated
volumes, the intersection should initially be stop controlled.

A sketch of the intersection is provided in Figure 8.

INTERSECTION 4 ­ SR 99 AND GEORGIA PACIFIC ENTRANCE
The existing intersection provides access to a Georgia Pacific timber facility. Turning
movements into and out of the complex are relatively low, and are likely to remain low in the
future. It is anticipated that signal warrants would not be met under build-out conditions, as the
side street volumes are relatively minor.

This intersection is approximately 1,000 feet east of Chanslor Road. A grade separation at the
Norfolk Southern railroad track could likely be accommodated without significant impacts to the
vertical alignment of this access. The minimum tapers and storage for a 55 mph design speed
should be sufficient to accommodate the small amount of turning traffic. Figure 9 shows the
intersection layout; turn lane recommendations are as follows:

                                  Expected Queue             Total storage and             transition / taper

 INTERSECTION 5 ­ SR 99 AND COASTAL PINES ACCESS
An existing unsignalized intersection provides access to the Coastal Pines golf course and
development. This access will likely be a secondary access point to the residential areas on the
north side of SR 99. Another access point, west of the golf course, will likely serve as the main
access to the residential developments on the north side of SR 99. Given the scale of the
residential development planned, a signal may be needed at the main access to accommodate the
anticipated volumes.

A commercial area is planned on the south side of SR 99, though no official master plans have
been developed. As these plans are defined, the development on the south side should align with
the main accesses to the residential areas on the north side of SR 99.

Traffic impact studies for future development should identify access locations and account for
proper signal and intersection spacing. A sketch of the intersection is shown in Figure 10.

INTERSECTION 6 ­ SR 99 AND SR 25 SPUR
This intersection has been designed as part of the project to widen SR 25 Spur (P.I. 0000421).
The SR 25 Spur project planned to include Type B median crossovers for both of the SR 99
approaches to SR 25 Spur.

Figure 11 shows the anticipate design of the intersection.

WARRANTS ANALYSIS
Signal warrant analyses are conducted using the design year volumes. The 8-hour warrant
(Warrant 1A and 1B) is evaluated in accordance with the GDOT Design Manual, where the 8 th
highest hourly volume is estimated as representing 6.25% of the daily volumes. The peak hour
warrant (Warrant 3) is evaluated using the highest peak hour volume. Warrants 4 (pedestrian), 5
(school crossing), 6 (coordinated systems), 7 (crash experience) and 8 (roadway network) either
do not apply or were not evaluated. The signal warrant analysis assumes that the major and
minor roads consist of "2 or more" lanes. Reduced volume thresholds are utilized since the
anticipated design speed will be greater than 40 mph.

Based on an initial warrant analysis, signals may be needed at the intersections of SR 99 with
SR 25 Spur, the access to the Coastal Pines development, and Chanslor Road. As master plans
for other developments along SR 99 are finalized, additional signals may be needed. Future
access points to new development should strive to achieve efficient signal spacing, as outlined in
the Transportation Research Board's Access Management Manual (ideally a 1/2 mile apart).

When signal warrants are met will depend on the pace of development within the area and should
be evaluated as traffic impact studies for particular parcels are completed. None of the
intersections, with the exception of SR 25 Spur / SR 99, will likely require signalization by the
2015 build year. A summary of the warrant analysis is shown in the following table.

Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook--Revised Second Edition




       Technical Working Group Guidance
       1. Minimum Devices

       All highway-rail grade crossings of railroads and public streets or highways should be equipped with
       approved passive devices. For street-running railroads/transit systems, refer to MUTCD Parts 8 and 10.

       2. Minimum Widths

       All highway-rail grade crossing surfaces should be a minimum of 1 foot beyond the edge of the roadway
       shoulder, measured perpendicular to the roadway centerline, and should provide for any existing pedestrian
       facilities.

       3. Passive--Minimum Traffic Control Applications

            a. A circular railroad advance warning (W10-1) sign shall be used on each roadway in advance of every
               highway-rail grade crossing except as described in MUTCD.
            b. An emergency phone number should be posted at the crossing, including the U.S. DOT highway-rail
               grade crossing identification number, highway or street name or number, railroad milepost, and
               other pertinent information.
            c. Where the roadway approaches to the crossing are paved, pavement markings are to be installed as
               described in MUTCD, subject to engineering evaluation.
            d. Where applicable, the "Tracks Out Of Service" sign should be placed to notify drivers that track use
               has been discontinued.
            e. One reflectorized crossbuck sign shall be used on each roadway approach to a highway-rail grade
               crossing.

                i.   If there are two or more tracks, the number of tracks shall be indicated on a supplemental sign
                     (R15-2) of inverted T shape mounted below the crossbuck.
                ii. Strips of retroreflective white material not less than 2 inches in width shall be used on the back
                     of each blade of each crossbuck sign for the length of each blade, unless the crossbucks are
                     mounted back to back.
                iii. A strip of retroreflective white material not less than 2 inches in width shall be used on the full
                     length of the front and back of each support from the crossbuck sign to near ground level or just
                     above the top breakaway hole on the post.

            f. Supplemental passive traffic control applications (subject to engineering evaluation):

                i.   Inadequate stopping sight distance:

                     a.   Improve the roadway geometry.
                     b.   Install appropriate warning signs (including consideration of active types).
                     c.   Reduce the posted roadway speed in advance of the crossing:

                          i. Advisory signing as a minimum.
                          ii. Regulatory posted limit if it can be effectively enforced.




                                                              146
    d.   Close the crossing.
    e.   Reconfigure/relocate the crossing.
    f.   Grade separate the crossing.

ii. Inadequate approach (corner) sight distance (assuming adequate clearing sight distance):

    a.   Remove the sight distance obstruction.
    b.   Install appropriate warning signs.
    c.   Reduce the posted roadway speed in advance of the crossing:

         i. Advisory signing as a minimum.
         ii. Regulatory posted limit if it can be effectively enforced.

    d.   Install a YIELD (R1-2) sign, with advance warning sign (W3-2a) where warranted by
         MUTCD (restricted visibility reduces safe approach speed to 16­24 kilometers per hour
         (10­15 miles per hour)).
    e.   Install a STOP (R1-1) sign, with advance warning sign (W3-1a) where warranted by
         MUTCD (restricted visibility requires drivers to stop at the crossing).
    f.   Install active devices.
    g.   Close the crossing.
    h.   Reconfigure/relocate the crossing.
    i.   Grade separate the crossing.

iii. Deficient clearing sight distances (for one or more classes of vehicles):

    a.   Remove the sight distance obstruction.
    b.   Permanently restrict use of the roadway by the class of vehicle not having sufficient
         clearing sight distance.
    c.   Install active devices with gates.
    d.   Close the crossing.
    e.   Reconfigure/relocate the crossing.
    f.   Grade separate the crossing.
    g.   Multiple railroad tracks and/or two or more highway approach lanes in the same direction
         should be evaluated with regard to possible sight obstruction from other trains (moving or
         standing on another track or siding) or highway vehicles.

iv. Stopping and corner sight distance deficiencies may be treated immediately with warning
    or regulatory traffic control signs, such as a STOP sign, with appropriate advance warning
    signs. However, until such time as permanent corrective measures are implemented to correct
    deficient clearing sight distance, interim measures should be taken, which may include:

    a.   Temporarily close the crossing.
    b.   Temporarily restrict use of the roadway by the classes of vehicles.

        4. Active

        If active devices are selected, the following devices should be considered:
              a. Active devices with automatic gates should be considered at highway-rail grade crossings whenever
                  an engineering study by a diagnostic team determines one or more of the following conditions exist:

                  i.  All crossings on the National Highway System, "U.S." marked routes, or principal arterials not
                      otherwise grade separated.
                  ii. If inadequate clearing sight distance exists in one or more approach quadrants, AND it is
                      determined ALL of the following apply:

                       a.   It is not physically or economically feasible to correct the sight distance deficiency.
                       b.   An acceptable alternate access does not exist.
                       c.   On a life-cycle cost basis, the cost of providing acceptable alternate access or grade separation
                            would exceed the cost of installing active devices with gates.

                  iii. Regularly scheduled passenger trains operate in close proximity to industrial facilities, such as
                       stone quarries, log mills, cement plants, steel mills, oil refineries, chemical plants, and land fills.




                                                                  148
    iv. In close proximity to schools, industrial plants, or commercial areas where there is
         substantially higher than normal usage by school buses, heavy trucks, or trucks carrying
         dangerous or hazardous materials.
    v. Based upon the number of passenger trains and/or the number and type of trucks, a
         diagnostic team determines a significantly higher than normal risk exists that a train-vehicle
         collision could result in death of or serious injury to rail passengers.
    vi. Multiple main or running tracks through the crossing.
    vii. The expected accident frequency for active devices without gates, as calculated by the U.S.
         DOT Accident Prediction Formula including five-year accident history, exceeds 0.1.
    viii.In close proximity to a highway intersection or other highway-rail crossings and the traffic
         control devices at the nearby intersection cause traffic to queue on or across the tracks (in
         such instances, if a nearby intersection has traffic signal control, it should be interconnected
         to provide preempted operation, and consider traffic signal control, if none).
    ix. As otherwise recommended by an engineering study or diagnostic team.

b. Active devices with automatic gates should be considered as an option at public highway-rail
   grade crossings whenever they can be economically justified based on fully allocated life-cycle
   costs and one or more of the following conditions exist:

    i.   Multiple tracks exist at or in the immediate crossing vicinity where the presence of a moving
         or standing train on one track effectively reduces the clearing sight distance below the
         minimum relative to a train approaching the crossing on an adjacent track (absent some
         other acceptable means of warning drivers to be alert for the possibility of a second train).
    ii. An average of 20 or more trains per day.
    iii. Posted highway speed exceeds 64 km/hr. (40 mph) in urban areas or exceeds 88 km/hr. (55
         mph) in rural areas.
    iv. Annual average daily traffic (AADT) exceeds 2,000 in urban areas or 500 in rural areas.
    v. Multiple lanes of traffic in the same direction of travel (usually this will include cantilevered
         signals).
    vi. The crossing exposure (the product of the number of trains per day and AADT) exceeds
         5,000 in urban areas or 4,000 in rural areas.
    vii. The expected accident frequency as calculated by the U.S. DOT Accident Prediction formula,
         including five-year accident history, exceeds 0.075.
    viii.An engineering study indicates that the absence of active devices would result in the highway
         facility performing at a level of service below level C.
    ix. Any new project or installation of active devices to significantly replace or upgrade existing
         non-gated active devices. For purposes of this item, replacements or upgrades should be
         considered "significant" whenever the cost of the otherwise intended improvement (without
         gates) equals or exceeds one-half the cost of a comparable new installation, and should
         exclude maintenance replacement of individual system components and/or emergency
         replacement of damaged units.
    x. As otherwise recommended by an engineering study or diagnostic team.

c. Warning/barrier gate systems should be considered as supplemental safety devices at:

    i.     Crossings with passenger trains;
    ii.    Crossings with high-speed trains;
    iii.   Crossings in quiet zones; or
    iv.    As otherwise recommended by an engineering study or diagnostic team.

d. Enhancements for pedestrian treatments:

    i. Design to avoid stranding pedestrians between sets of tracks.
    ii. Add audible devices, based on an engineering study.

Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook--Revised Second Edition




                 iii. Consider swing gates carefully; the operation of the swing gate should be consistent with
                      the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act; the gate should be checked for
                      pedestrian safety within the limits of its operation.
                 iv. Provide for crossing control at pedestrian crossings where a station is located within the
                      proximity of a crossing or within the crossing approach track circuit for the highway-rail
                      crossing.
                 v. Utilize a Train-to-Wayside Controller to reduce traffic delays in areas of stations.
                 vi. Delay the activation of the gates, flashers, and bells for a period of time at the highway-rail
                      grade crossing in station areas, based on an engineering study.

        5. Closure

        Highway-rail grade crossings should be considered for closure and vacated across the railroad right of
        way whenever one or more of the following apply:

             a. An engineering study determines a nearby crossing otherwise required to be improved or grade
                separated already has acceptable alternate vehicular access, and pedestrian access can continue
                at the subject crossing, if existing.
             b. On a life-cycle cost basis, the cost of implementing the recommended improvement would exceed
                the cost of providing an acceptable alternate access.
             c. If an engineering study determines any of the following apply:

                 i.   FRA Class 1, 2, or 3 track with daily train movements:

                      a.   AADT less than 500 in urban areas, acceptable alternate access across the rail line
                           exists within .4 km (one-quarter-mile), and the median trip length normally made over
                           the subject crossing would not increase by more than .8 km (one-half-mile).
                      b.   AADT less than 50 in rural areas, acceptable alternate access across the rail line exists
                           within .8 km (one-half-mile), and the median trip length normally made over the subject
                           crossing would not increase by more than 2.4 km (1.5 miles).

                 ii. FRA Class 4 or 5 track with active rail traffic:

                      a.   AADT less than 1,000 in urban areas, acceptable alternate access across the rail line
                           exists within .4 km (one-quarter-mile), and the median trip length normally made over
                           the subject crossing would not increase by more than 1.2 km (three-quarters-mile).
                      b.   AADT less than 100 in rural areas, acceptable alternate access across the rail line
                           exists within 1.61 km (1 mile), and the median trip length normally made over the
                           subject crossing would not increase by more than 4.8 km (3 miles).

                 iii. FRA Class 6 or higher track with active rail traffic, AADT less than 250 in rural areas, an
                      acceptable alternate access across the rail line exists within 2.4 km (1.5 miles), and the
                      median trip length normally made over the subject crossing would not increase by more than
                      6.4 km (4 miles).

             d. An engineering study determines the crossing should be closed to vehicular and pedestrian
                traffic when railroad operations will occupy or block the crossing for extended periods of time
                on a routine basis and it is determined that it is not physically or economically feasible to either
                construct a grade separation or shift the train operation to another location. Such locations
                would typically include:

                 i. Rail yards.
                 ii. Passing tracks primarily used for holding trains while waiting to meet or be passed by other
                     trains.




                                                             150
         iii. locations where train crews are routinely required to stop their trains because of cross traffic
              on intersecting rail lines or to pick up or set out blocks of cars or switch local industries en
              route.
         iv. switching leads at the ends of classification yards.
         v. where trains are required to "double" in or out of yards and terminals.
         vi. in the proximity of stations where long distance passenger trains are required to make extended
              stops to transfer baggage, pick up, or set out equipment or be serviced en route.
         vii. locations where trains must stop or wait for crew changes.

6. Grade Separation

     a.  Highway-rail grade crossings should be considered for grade separation or otherwise eliminated
         across the railroad right of way whenever one or more of the following conditions exist:

         i.   The highway is a part of the designated Interstate Highway System.
         ii.  The highway is otherwise designed to have full controlled access.
         iii. The posted highway speed equals or exceeds 113 km/hr. (70 mph).

         xi. Vehicle delay exceeds 40 vehicle hours per day.

     b. Highway-rail grade crossings should be considered for grade separation across the railroad right
        of way whenever the cost of grade separation can be economically justified based on fully allocated
        life-cycle costs and one or more of the following conditions exist:

         i.   The highway is a part of the designated National Highway System.
         ii.  The highway is otherwise designed to have partial controlled access.
         iii. The posted highway speed exceeds 88 km/hr. (55 mph).
         iv.  AADT exceeds 50,000 in urban areas or 25,000 in rural areas.

            c. Whenever a new grade separation is constructed, whether replacing an existing highway-rail
               grade crossing or otherwise, consideration should be given to the possibility of closing one or more
               adjacent grade crossings.
            d. Utilize Table 43 for LRT grade separation:

        7. New Crossings

            a. Should only be permitted to cross existing railroad tracks at grade when it can be demonstrated:

                i.   For new public highways or streets where there is a clear and compelling public need (other
                     than enhancing the value or development potential of the adjoining property);
                ii. Grade separation cannot be economically justified, i.e. benefit-to-cost ratio on a fully allocated
                     cost basis is less than 1.0 (generally, when the crossing exposure exceeds 50,000 in urban areas
                     or exceeds 25,000 in rural areas); and
                iii. There are no other viable alternatives.

            b. If a crossing is permitted, the following conditions should apply:

                i. If it is a main track, the crossing will be equipped with active devices with gates.
                ii. The plans and specifications should be subject to the approval of the highway agency
                     having jurisdiction over the roadway (if other than a state agency), the state department of
                     transportation or other state agency vested with the authority to approve new crossings, and
                     the operating railroad.
                iii. All costs associated with the construction of the new crossing should be borne by the party
                     or parties requesting the new crossing, including providing financially for the ongoing
                     maintenance of the crossing surface and traffic control devices where no crossing closures are
                     included in the project.
                iv. Whenever new public highway-rail crossings are permitted, they should fully comply with all
                     applicable provisions of this proposed recommended practice.
                v. Whenever a new highway-rail crossing is constructed, consideration should be given to closing
                     one or more adjacent crossings.

8. Traffic Control Device Selection Procedure

Step 1--Minimum highway-rail grade crossing criteria (see report for full description):

    a. Gather preliminary crossing data:

        i.   Highway:

             a.   Geometric (number of approach lanes, alignment, median).
             b.   AADT.
             c.   Speed (posted limit or operating).
             d.   Functional classification.
             e.   Desired level of service.
             f.   Proximity of other intersections (note active device interconnection).
             g.   Availability and proximity of alternate routes and/or crossings.

        ii. Railroad:

             a.   Number of tracks (type: FRA classification, mainline, siding, spur).
             b.   Number of trains (passenger, freight, other).
             c.   Maximum train speed and variability.
             d.   Proximity of rail yards, stations, and terminals.
             e.   Crossing signal control circuitry.

        iii. Traffic control device:

             a.   Passive or active.
             b.   Advance.
             c.   At crossing.
             d.   Supplemental.

        iv. Prior collision history

    b. Based on one or more of the above, determine whether any of the recommended thresholds for
       closure, installing active devices (if passive), or separation have been met based on highway or rail
       system operational requirements.
    c. Consider crossing closure or consolidation:

        i. If acceptable alternate route(s) is/are available; or
        ii. If an adjacent crossing is improved, can this crossing be closed? or
        iii. If this crossing is improved, can an adjacent crossing be closed?

    d. For all crossings, evaluate stopping and clearing sight distances. If the conditions are inadequate for
       the existing control device, correct or compensate for the condition (see Step 3 below).
    e. If a passive crossing, evaluate corner sight distance. If less than the required for the posted or legal
       approach speed, correct or compensate for the condition (see Step 3 below).

Step 2--Evaluate highway traffic flow characteristics:

    a. Consider the required motorist response to the existing (or proposed) type of traffic control device.
       At passive crossings, determine the degree to which traffic may need to slow or stop based on
       evaluation of available corner sight distances.

Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Handbook--Revised Second Edition




            b. Determine whether the existing (or proposed) type of traffic control device and railroad operations
               will allow highway traffic to perform at an acceptable level of service for the functional classification
               of the highway.

       Step 3--Possible revision to the highway-rail grade crossing:

            a. If there is inadequate sight distance related to the type of control device, consider measures such as:

                i. Try to correct the sight distance limitation.
                ii. If stopping sight distance is less than "ideal" for the posted or operating vehicle approach speed
                     and cannot be corrected, determine the safe approach speed and consider either posting an
                     advisory speed plate at the advance warning sign or reduce the regulatory speed limit on the
                     approach.
                iii. If corner sight distance is inadequate and cannot be corrected, determine the safe approach
                     speed and consider posting an advisory speed plate at the advance warning sign, or reduce the
                     regulatory speed limit on the approach, or install STOP or YIELD signs at the crossing.
                iv. If clearing sight distance is inadequate, upgrade a passive or flashing light-only traffic control
                     device to active with gates, or close (consolidate) the crossing, or grade separate.

            b. If highway and/or train volumes and/or speeds will not allow the highway to perform at an
               acceptable level of service, consider traffic control device upgrade to active (possibly with additional
               devices such as gates and medians), or closure (consolidation), or separation.
            c. If crossing closure or consolidation is being considered, determine the feasibility and cost of
               providing of an acceptable alternate route and compare this to the feasibility and cost of improving
               the existing crossing.
            d. If grade separation is being considered:

                i. Economic analysis should consider fully allocated life-cycle costs.
                ii. Consider highway classification and level of service.
                iii. Consider the possibility of closing one or more adjacent grade crossings.

       Step 4--Interim measures and/or documentation:

           a.   If the above analysis indicates a change or improvement in the crossing or type of traffic control
                devices, determine what, if any, interim measures can or should be taken until such time as
                recommended improvement can be implemented.
           b.   If the above analysis indicates a change or improvement in the crossing or type of traffic control
                devices, but there are other compelling reasons or circumstances for not implementing them,
                document the reasons and circumstances for your decision.
           c.   If the above analysis indicates no change or improvement in the crossing or type of traffic control
                devices, document the fact that the crossing was evaluated and determined to be adequate.

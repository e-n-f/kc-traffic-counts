EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




Dermot J. Kelly Associates, Inc. (DJK) has conducted a Traffic Impact and Access Study for a proposed
residential development project to be located adjacent to and north of Berry Street, east of the Route
114/Berry Street intersection in North Andover, Massachusetts. This report identifies existing traffic
operating parameters on the adjacent roadway system, evaluates the potential traffic-related impacts
associated with the proposed project and identifies potential traffic mitigation measures necessary to
minimize the impact of the proposed project.



PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project proponent is presently planning for the construction of an approximate 240-unit residential
apartment development project in North Andover, Massachusetts. The 240-unit apartment project would
include 442 parking spaces. Two access driveways are proposed for the project along Berry Street with
one driveway, the West Drive located 400 feet east of Route 114 and a second driveway, the East Drive
located an additional 750 feet from the West Drive. Each driveway would consist of a minimum 25-foot
wide cross section.



ALTERNATIVE STUDIES

For the purposes of this report, the following alternatives were evaluated:

     o     No-Build - The No-Build alternative was examined to establish the 2012 baseline traffic-volume
           conditions. The incremental impacts of the proposed project may be determined by making
           comparisons to the No-Build alternative. The No-Build alternative assumes that the project is not
           built.

     o     Build - The Build alternative includes the development of the proposed project. The Build
           alternative is evaluated in this report and is compared to the No-Build analysis condition. The
           Build condition represents the increase in traffic from the previous condition to the proposed
           condition (i.e., the delta impact). The Build condition includes the construction of the proposed
           residential development project.

STUDY AREA

The study area includes the intersections of the Proposed Site Access Drives with Berry Street and the
Route 114/Berry Street intersection.



EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUME CONDITIONS

Analysis of the recent traffic counts indicates that weekday volumes are 23,999 vpd (vehicles per day)
along Route 114 north of Berry Street during October 2012. During the two peak travel demand periods,
which generally occurred between 7 and 9 AM and between 4 and 6 PM an average of 1,945 and 2,047
vph were observed along Route 114 during the weekday morning and evening peak hours, respectively.
Similarly, Berry Street carries 923 vpd and 95 vph during the morning peak hour and 93 vph during the
evening peak hour.



FUTURE TRAFFIC VOLUME CONDITIONS

Background Traffic Growth

To represent future 2012 No-Build traffic-volume conditions, the existing traffic volumes were increased to
account for background traffic growth. Accordingly, the existing traffic volumes were increased to
account for the development of the following other projects:

     o     Congregate Care Facility located along Route 114 opposite Johnson Street (Boston Hill); and

     o     52 residential condominiums to be located along Route 114 south of Berry Street.

Additionally, the existing traffic volumes along Route 114 were increased by +1.0 percent per year up
through 2017.

Site-Generated Traffic

Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates, it is anticipated that a 240-
unit residential development project would generate approximately 1,578 vehicle-trips per day. This daily
volume would be split evenly with 789 vehicle-trips entering and 789 vehicle-trips exiting the site over the
course of the entire 24-hour day.

More importantly, during the weekday morning peak hour, the proposed development project would
generate a total of 121 vehicle-trips with 24 vehicle-trips entering and 97 vehicle-trips exiting the project
site. Similarly, during the evening peak hour, it is anticipated that 150 vehicle-trips would be generated.
The 150 vehicle-trips would consist of 97 vehicle-trips entering and 53 vehicle-trips exiting the
development during the peak 60-minute period. The remaining vehicle-trips would occur over the course
of the day.

Trip Distribution

Trip-distribution patterns were developed specifically for this study and are summarized as follows:

                o     Route 114 to/from the North          52%
                o     Route 114 to/from the South          48%
                TOTAL                                     100%

TRAFFIC OPERATION ANALYSIS

Unsignalized intersection capacity analysis was performed for the study area intersections. The capacity
analysis is summarized below by location.

Berry Street at the Proposed Site Drives

Under 2017 Build with development traffic volume conditions, the left-turn entering movements and the
left/right turn exiting movements would operate at LOS B or better during the morning peak hour and
evening peak hours.

Route 114 at Berry Street and Nursing Home Drive

The side street movements at the Route 114/Berry Street/Nursing Home Drive intersection currently
operate at LOS D/F and will continue to operate at LOS F under 2017 Build with development traffic
volume conditions. The left-turn movements from Route 114 currently operate at LOS B during the
morning and evening peak hours will continue to operate at LOS B with the proposed project.



MITIGATION MEASURES

The final phase of the analysis process is to identify the mitigation measures necessary to minimize the
impact of the project on the transportation system. The proponent has made a commitment to implement
all mitigation measures listed below subject to the project receiving all necessary permits and approvals
to construct the project and the mitigation measures listed below:

·    At the proposed driveway intersections with Berry Street, the egress movements are suggested to be
     placed under stop sign control with a painted STOP bar. Overhead street lighting should be
     considered at the proposed driveway locations.

·    The main site access driveway is suggested to consist of a minimum 24-foot wide cross section with
     one 12-foot wide lane for entering traffic and one 12-foot wide lane for exiting traffic. Intersection
     corner radii are suggested to be 5- to 30-foot radius.

·    To enhance the overall sight distances at the intersection of the Proposed Driveways with Berry
     Street, it is recommended that roadside vegetation and topographic ground elevations adjacent to the
     access/egress driveways be maintained such that sufficient safety sight lines are provided in both
     directions throughout the life of the project. Along Berry Street, the triangular area across the project
     frontage should extend 10 feet back from the existing edge of the roadway (representing an existing
     vehicle) and extend to a maximum possible location (300 feet minimum to the east and west) in each
     direction along Berry Street representing an approaching vehicle.

·    Intersection advanced warning signs are suggested to be placed along Berry Street in advance of the
     access/egress driveway.

THE EXISTING BUILT ENVIRONMENT




FIELD SURVEY

A comprehensive field inventory of the adjacent roadway system was conducted during October 2012.
The field inventory included collection of existing roadway geometrics, traffic volumes, and safety data for
the roadway adjacent to the site.

Traffic volumes were measured by means of an automatic traffic recorder (ATR) counters along Route
114 and Berry Street and manual turning-movement counts at the Route 114/Berry Street intersection.
Safety inventories included vehicle speed observations and a detailed evaluation of the safety sight lines
at the proposed site driveway locations along Berry Street adjacent to the site.



GEOMETRICS

Route 114

Route 114 in the immediate vicinity of the site is generally a three-lane roadway with one through lane for
each direction of travel and a dual use center left-turn lane located opposite the site. The travel lanes are
generally 12 feet wide with a 6-foot to 10-foot gravel shoulder on each side of the roadway. Route 114
provides access/egress to numerous adjacent highway commercial/retail and residential land uses along
its entire length.

Route 114 consists of bituminous concrete pavement in fair condition with no major pavement break-up
of edge raveling noted during the field inventory period. Horizontal and vertical alignments are fair along
Route 114 with the roadway passing Berry Street over relatively level/tangent alignment. Vehicular
movements along Route 114 in the immediate vicinity of the site are generally uncontrolled with side
streets and driveways under STOP control.


Berry Street

Berry Street is a two lane roadway with one through lane for each direction of travel. The roadway is
approximately 22 feet wide and provides access to an adjacent commercial project located opposite the
project parcel and other residential land uses along its entire length. Horizontal and vertical alignments

are fair along Berry Street with the roadway passing the proposed project driveways over relatively
level/tangent alignment with a large radius curve located between the proposed site drives.


TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Existing traffic volumes were recorded mechanically over a 48 hour period during Thursday and Friday
October 25 and 26, 2012. These traffic volumes were reviewed to determine average daily and peak-
hour traffic volumes along Route 114 and Berry Street adjacent to the site. Table 1 summarizes the 2012
traffic-volume data collected along Route 114 and Berry Street adjacent to the site with the actual traffic
volume data reproduced in the appendix of this report.

Analysis of the recent traffic counts indicates that weekday volumes are 23,999 vpd (vehicles per day)
along Route 114 adjacent to the site during October 2012. During the two peak travel demand periods,
which generally occurred between 7 and 9 AM and between 4 and 6 PM an average of 1,945 and 2,047
vph were observed along Route 114 during the weekday morning and evening peak hours, respectively.
Similarly, Berry Street carries 923 vpd and 95 vph during the morning peak hour and 93 vph during the
evening peak hour.

Figure 1 graphically presents the results of the traffic volume inventory for the weekday morning and
evening peak hours.

 VEHICLE SPEEDS

 Spot speeds were also recorded by an automatic traffic recorder (ATR) placed along Berry Street over a
 48-hour period. The results of the speed measurements are summarized in Table 2. As shown, the
 mean speed along Berry Street eastbound was observed at 32 mph. The 85th percentile speed varied

FUTURE TRAFFIC VOLUME CONDITIONS




INTRODUCTION

This section of the report determines the future traffic volume levels along the study area roadways and
intersections. To determine the impact of site-generated traffic volumes on the roadway network under
future conditions, the existing traffic volumes in the study area were projected to the year 2017 to be
consistent with Massachusetts State guidelines for Traffic Impact Assessments. Traffic volumes on the
roadway network at that time will include all existing traffic, background traffic growth, and the site-
generated traffic volumes.



BACKGROUND TRAFFIC GROWTH

Traffic growth on area roadways is a function of the expected land development in the immediate area as
well as the surrounding region. Several methods can be used to estimate this growth. A procedure
frequently employed is to identify the location and type of new developments planned to occur during the
designated planning horizon, estimate the traffic to be generated and assign it to the area roadway
network. This method usually produces a realistic estimate of growth for local traffic.

The surrounding area was investigated during the preparation of this Study to identify existing and
projected development projects anticipated to occur by 2017. Based on this information and other
background information, it was assumed for traffic planning purposes that the following projects are
constructed and operational by 2017:

     o     Congregate Care Facility located along Route 114 opposite Johnson Street (Boston Hill); and

     o     52 residential condominiums (Merrimac Commons) to be located along Route 114 south of Berry
           Street.

In addition to the development projects noted above, existing traffic volumes were increased by 1% per
year up through 2017 to account for background traffic growth which may occur from other development
projects not anticipated at this time.

Figure 2 graphically presents the 2017 No Build weekday morning and evening peak-hour traffic volumes.

VEHICLE-TRIP GENERATION

Traffic volumes generated by residential developments normally follow well established patterns with
respect to magnitude and temporal distribution. Measurements of numerous such developments
conducted by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) have established trip generation rates which
have been standardized for analysis purposes. The rates at which residential projects generate vehicle-
trips depends on the type of residential project; i.e., single-family units versus apartments. Accordingly,
the ITE Trip Generation Manual was researched with the appropriate vehicle-trip generation
characteristics applied to the proposed project.

Based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates, it is anticipated that a 240-
unit residential development project would generate approximately 1,578 vehicle-trips per day. This daily
volume would be split evenly with 789 vehicle-trips entering and 789 vehicle-trips exiting the site over the
course of the entire 24-hour day.

More importantly, during the weekday morning peak hour, the proposed development project would
generate a total of 121 vehicle-trips with 24 vehicle-trips entering and 97 vehicle-trips exiting the project
site. Similarly, during the evening peak hour, it is anticipated that 150 vehicle-trips would be generated.
The 150 vehicle-trips would consist of 97 vehicle-trips entering and 53 vehicle-trips exiting the
development during the peak 60-minute period. The remaining vehicle-trips would occur over the course
of the day.

Table 3 summarizes the peak-hour and daily project-generated traffic volumes for the entire project.

TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION/ASSIGNMENT

Directional distribution of generated trips to and from the proposed development is expected to follow
existing traffic patterns which, in turn, are a function of population densities, shopping opportunities, areas
of employment and recreational activities. Accordingly, the directional split of the new trips originating
from, or destined to, the development were based on existing traffic patterns as observed for this study.

The site-generated traffic volumes were superimposed onto the 2017 No Build traffic volume networks
creating the 2017 Build traffic volume networks. Figure 3 graphically presents the 2017 Build weekday
morning and evening peak-hour traffic volume networks.

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS




Previous sections of this report have summarized existing traffic patterns, future peak-hour traffic-volume
levels, expected traffic generation, and expected trip distribution and assignment for the proposed
development project under weekday morning and evening peak-hour traffic-volume conditions. The next
step in the study is to determine the impact the proposed development project will have on the adjacent
roadway system. The analysis assumes no roadway improvements in the study area except for the
construction of the proposed access driveway located along Berry Street.



TRAFFIC FLOW AND OPERATION CHARACTERISTICS

Traffic flow and operating characteristics are measured in terms of level of service both without and with
the proposed development project. The without development traffic volumes were developed from the
traffic-volume data collected specifically for this study. Traffic-volume data collected during October 2012
were summarized to produce a composite picture of the existing peak-hour traffic-volume conditions. The
existing 2012 traffic volumes along Route 114 were increased to account for two other known
development projects discussed earlier plus an additional +1.0 percent per year increase in traffic to
account for background traffic growth that may occur up through 2017 (project filing year plus 5 years).

The Build, with-development, traffic volumes include the existing peak-hour traffic volumes, plus
background traffic growth, plus the site-generated peak-hour traffic volumes.

METHODOLOGY

Level of Service

The primary result of capacity analysis is the assignment of level of service to traffic facilities under
various traffic-flow conditions.1 The concept of level of service is defined as a qualitative measure
describing operational conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by motorists and/or
passengers. A level-of-service definition provides an index to quality of traffic flow in terms of such
factors as speed, travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort, safety, and
convenience.

Six levels of service are defined for each type of facility. They are given letter designations from A to F,
with level-of-service (LOS) A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst.

Since the level of service of a traffic facility is a function of the traffic flows placed upon it, such a facility
may operate at a wide range of levels of service, depending on the time of day, day of week, or period of
year.

Unsignalized Intersections

The level of service for an unsignalized intersection is determined by the application of a procedure
described in the HCM 2010 Highway Capacity Manual.2 The procedure accounts for lane configuration
on both the minor and major approaches, conflicting traffic stream volumes, and type of intersection
control (STOP versus YIELD). First, theoretical maximum or capacity flow of vehicles for each minor
approach lane is calculated. The capacities are then compared to the demand at the respective minor
approaches. The delay is then calculated based on the critical gap time, move-up time as well as other
various factors. Table 4 summarizes the relationship between level of service and expected delay to
minor street traffic.

SIGHT DISTANCE




SIGHT DISTANCE

In the vicinity of the proposed project site, Berry Street approaches the Proposed Site Drives over a
generally level/tangent alignment adjacent to the proposed driveways. Detailed Sight Distance
measurements were conducted with respect to the Berry Street approaches to the proposed intersections
to identify any potential mitigation measures, which would enhance the available Sight Distance.


Stopping Sight Distance (SSD)

SSD is the distance required for an approaching vehicle to perceive and react accordingly to an exiting or
entering vehicle. The values are based upon a perception and reaction time of 2.5 seconds and a
braking distance calculated for wet level pavement. When the roadway is either on an upgrade or
downgrade, grade correction factors are applied.

Table 6 compares the measured SSD with the minimum SSD requirements for both the observed vehicle
speeds as well as the speed limit along Berry Street in the vicinity of the site. As can be seen in Table 6,
the available SSD exceeds the minimum SSD requirements for the speed limit of 30 mph as well as the
observed speed of up to 38 mph.

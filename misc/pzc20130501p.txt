Dental
                      Tim Felstrup, Planning Services Team, gave an overview of the request.

                      Planning and Zoning Commission inquired about:
                         · What is the main reason for the rezoning? Fesltrup responded that the
                             main reason is for the petitioner to have more options to update the
                             signage in the future.
                         · Are there unintended uses that could occur on the site as a result of the
                             rezoning? Felstrup clarified the permitted uses in the TU district.
                         · What is the status of the TU district? Liu responded that that the
                             Downtown Naperville2030 plan recommends that the TU district be re-
                             evaluated and staff aims at working on the TU text amendment in the
     Naperville Planning and Zoning Commission

                                next fiscal year.
                            ·   What are the adjacent zoning designations? Felstrup responded that there
                                are a couple properties in the block that are also zoned TU and the others
                                are either zoned R2 or OCI.
                            ·   Why not to rezone the whole block to TU? Liu indicated there are still
                                some residential uses in the block and the City prefers to rezone the
                                properties upon the property owner's request.
                            ·   Restrictions on the type and size of the signs. Felstrup clarified that
                                signage in the TU district is controlled by both the sign code and the
                                Downtown Design Standards.
                            ·   Is there a restriction on the number of signs? Felstrup clarified only one
                                sign is permitted if the parcel has at least 50' of frontage on a public
                                right-of-way.

                        Jill Pasinski and Angelica Van Dyke, owner of the business, spoke on behalf of
                        the petitioner:
                             · The petitioner requests to rezone the property to TU in order to update
                                the sign in the future.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission inquired about:
                           · Has the sign been designed? The petitioner responded that they haven't
                               designed the sign yet.

                        Public Testimony: None

                        Planning and Zoning Commission Discussion:
                           · Dabareiner ­ The proposal is consistent with the Downtown 2030 plan.
                           · Hastings ­ Hasting understands the need for a sign, having visited the
                              area.
                           · Meyer ­ It is a wonderful idea. We want to support the existing
                              businesses on Aurora Avenue.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission inquired about:
                           · Do you anticipate any overflow parking or traffic issue from the
                               development? Smith responded no.

                        Steve Havoc and Mark Deetjen, owners of the business, spoke on behalf of the
                        petitioner:
                            · It will be a by-appointment only training studio and won't be open to
                                walk-in customers. The petitioner doesn't anticipate a big crowd.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission inquired about:
                           · What kind of training will occur on site? The petitioner will provide
                               general training and athletics training.
                           · Number of employees at any given time? The petitioner anticipates no
                               more than 5 employees will be working on site.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission closed the public hearing.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission Discussion:
                           · Hastings ­ Congratulations on the new business.
                           · Williams ­ We have approved similar conditional uses before. Parking
                              appears to be sufficient.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission moved to recommend approval of PZC case
                        13-1-022.
                        Motion by: Meyer                                              Approved

Wax Branded
                        Ying Liu, Planning Services Team, gave an overview of the request.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission inquired about:
                           · Why did Council limit the square footage for this use in the past? Liu
                               responded that the existing 6,400 square foot limitation for training
                               studios were in place because that was the combined square footage for
                               the existing users.
                           · Are there any parking issues on the property? Liu responded no.
                           · From a technical point of view, is personal training treated different from
                               a dancing studio? Liu responded not from a zoning perspective.

                        Len Monson, Attorney with Kuhn, Heap and Monson, spoke on behalf of the
                        petitioner:
                            · Monson gave an overview of the request.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission inquired about:
                           · Are you okay with the conditions of approval recommended by staff?
                               Monson confirmed yes.
                           · Does 1707 Quincy Avenue have enough parking? Monson indicated that
                               there is ample parking for the neighboring property at 1707 Quincy
                               Avenue.
                           · The existing businesses are mostly service oriented and the training
                               studio uses bring clients for them.

                        Public Testimony: None

                        Planning and Zoning Commission closed the public hearing.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission Discussion:
                           · Dabareiner ­ Dabareiner was concerned about parking. But the concern
                              has been alleviated by the testimony about the existing mix of uses and
                              how the facility will be used,
                           · Frost ­ This building is filled with conditional uses rather than permitted
                              uses under the zoning district. Perhaps the zoning of the building needs
                              to be reevaluated.
                           · Coyne ­ Agrees with Frost.
                           · Gustin ­ Gustin had concern regarding the 6,400 SF limit. But with the
                              conditions of approval regarding the maximum square footage and the
                              parking requirement, Gustin would support the case.
                           · Hastings ­ The proposed use is similar to many existing uses in the
                              community.
                           · Bruno ­ The request meets the standards for granting a conditional use.
                           · Williams ­ The proposed use is very similar to the existing uses on the
                              property. The only issue is parking and we haven't heard any parking
                              issues out there.

                        Planning and Zoning Commission moved to recommend approval of PZC case

PLANNING SERVICES TEAM REVIEW        REVIEW:
Section 5-4-5:2.1 (Commercial
                     Commercial Signs; Monument Signs;) of the Naperville Municipal Munic     Code
limits properties with less than five hundred feet (500') of street frontage to one monument sign.

There is currently one existing nonconforming (off premise) multi-tenant tenant monument sign
installed on the 1688 Quincy Avenue property for the identification of existing tenants located in
the 1680, 1684, 1688 and 1692 Quincy Avenue buildings. Goldfish Swim School does not have

identification on the existing nonconforming multi-tenant monument sign, as there are no free
panels available, and would like to install a separate 5.7' tall 27.5 square foot single tenant
monument sign on their property to identify the swim school. The proposed sign will be located
approximately 85' to the west of the existing nonconforming sign and will meet the minimum
setback requirements. The proposed sign is both shorter and of a smaller area than the Code
allowance for a single tenant monument sign; however a variance is required in order to
construct a second monument sign at the subject property.

Staff Summary
The purpose of the Street Graphics Ordinance is to create the framework for a comprehensive
balanced system of signage, to promote communication between people and their environment
and to avoid the usual clutter that is potentially harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety, property
values, business opportunities, and community appearance.

Staff finds that the variance, if granted, would not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or be a detriment to the adjacent properties. The sign as designed would allow for
clear identification of the new Goldfish Swim School, while allowing the existing multi-tenant
monument sign to remain in place for the remaining Quincy Avenue businesses. In addition, staff
finds the proposed monument sign appropriate given its reduced height and sign area as well as
the quality of the sign.

Staff has reviewed the requested variance and finds that the petitioner does meet the standards
for granting a variance to the Street Graphics Control Ordinance as there is a clear hardship for
the property owner that they have not created. As a result, staff recommends approval of a
variance from Section 5-4-5:2.1 (Commercial Signs; Monument Signs) of the Naperville
Municipal Code.

EXISTING ZONING, LAND USE, AND LOCATION     LOCATION:
The subject property consists of 17.35 acres and is generally located east of Route
                                                                              Ro    59 and north

PLANNING    G SERVICES TEAM REVIEW   REVIEW:
The developer for Mayfair, M/I Homes Chicago, LLC ("petitioner"), proposes to develop 152
townhome dwelling units on the subject property as an extension to the existing Mayfair
development. The new development w       will connect to Blakely
                                                               ely Lane in Mayfair and Route 59
through an existing stub street on the south side of the Penny Mustard Furniture store. The T
petitioner requests approval of the following for the subject property:
Mayfair Phase 2 ­ PZC 12-1-154

Page 2 of 5

    ·   Rezoning from B2 to R3 (Medium Density Multifamily District),
    ·   A conditional use to establish a planned unit development (PUD) for Mayfair Phase 2,
    ·   A preliminary PUD plat for Mayfair Phase 2,
    ·   A preliminary subdivision plat for Mayfair Phase 2, and
    ·   Deviations to Section 6-6E-7 (R3: Yard Requirements) of the Naperville Municipal Code
        to reduce the front and rear yard setback requirements.

Land Use
The Northwest Sector Update to the Comprehensive Plan (1996) identifies the future land use of
the property as "Commercial". The Plan states that commercial activities in Naperville is
essential to the City's economic base and provides residents with the goods and services vital to
daily living.
The subject property was initially included in the original Mayfair development, as proposed by
Kimball Hill Homes, in 2006. Upon review, the City Council expressed the following concerns
regarding the development:
    · The conflict between the "Commercial" future land use designation of the subject
        property and the proposed residential use;
    · The lack of buffer between residential and commercial uses.
    · The desire to have a transitional use such as offices between the proposed townhomes
        and existing commercial development along Route 59; and
    · The desire to keep the frontage along Audrey Lane as commercial.

To address Council's concerns, Kimball Hill Homes removed the subject property from the
original Mayfair development and retained the property's B2 commercial zoning. Now, the
petitioner, M/I Homes, proposes again to rezone the subject property from B2 to R3 to allow for
residential uses on the property. While staff understands that the market conditions have
changed since 2006, Council's concerns from 2006 remain valid and should be addressed.

Given a number of physical challenges that significantly limit this property's potential for
commercial uses, including lack of frontage/visibility from Route 59, Ogden Avenue and Audrey
Lane, no access from Ogden Avenue and restricted access from Route 59, staff finds that an
extension of the Mayfair development to a portion of the subject property is appropriate.
However, staff also finds that the location, scale and layout of the proposed townhome
development need to be carefully considered in order to address the concerns outlined above
(further discussed below).

Impact on Adjacent Commercially Zoned Land
The subject property is part of the larger Route 59 commercial corridor and the Comprehensive
Plan is clear with respect to maintaining a commercial frontage along Route 59 between Ogden
Avenue and Audrey Lane. However, land ownership in this area is segmented and coordinated
development has not happened on a large scale. For example, the Penny Mustard furniture store
on Route 59 was developed in 2004, largely restricting the visibility of the subject property from
Route 59 and its commercial prospective. Similarly, without careful consideration, the
development of Mayfair Phase 2 could have a negative impact on the B2-zoned land at the
Mayfair Phase 2 ­ PZC 12-1-154
May 1, 2013
Page 3 of 5

northeast corner of Route 59 and Audrey Lane and staff believes such impact should be
proactively addressed.

As shown on the aerial photo (Attachment 1), the remaining commercially zoned land at the
corner of Route 59 and Audrey Lane consists of an existing single family home (owned by the
Urbanek family), the Back to Bed store and the Barbarottas property (the vacant parcel on
Audrey Lane) with a combined 550' frontage along Route 59. Including the subject property,
the 550' commercial frontage has a depth of 730' to 1130', which is consistent with the relative
depth of commercially zoned land along the Route 59 corridor. The proposed rezoning would
reduce the depth of commercially zoned land at the corner of Route 59 and Audrey Lane to
approximately 260', thereby significantly limiting the possibility of future commercial
development at this location. To address such negative impact, staff believes that the scale of the
proposed Mayfair Phase 2 development should be reduced to leave sufficient B2-zoned land to
allow for a consolidated commercial development at the northeast corner of Route 59 and
Audrey Lane in the future.

In addition, if the proposed residential zoning is approved, the existing and future commercial
development in the area will become subject to a 12' minimum setback requirement and full
landscaping and screening requirements. As these properties currently abut commercially-zoned
land, they are only subject to a 5' utility easement requirement. The new setback and landscape
requirements would affect how buildings and parking can be located in future commercial
development and redevelopment in the area. Therefore, staff recommends minimizing the
frontage of the proposed residential development on future commercial properties by reducing
the scale of the development as well as providing sufficient screening and buffering on the
Mayfair Phase 2 property. The petitioner has proposed to provide a 6' solid wood fence along
most of the perimeter of the site, which will fulfill part of the screening requirements that would
be required for the adjacent commercial properties. Staff has requested that the petitioner
complete the fence by extending it behind the single-family home on Route 59. Both the owners
of the Barbarottas property and the Urbanek family have voiced similar concerns in the letters
included in Attachment 12.

Density and Layout
The petitioner proposes R3 zoning for the proposed Mayfair Phase 2 even though the existing
Mayfair, as well as the adjacent Vintage Club townhomes, are zoned R3A (Medium Density
Multifamily District). As shown in the chart below, R3 permits a higher density than R3A. If
zoned R3A, the 17-acre subject property would be permitted a maximum of 139 dwelling units,
instead of the proposed 152 units.

Staff does not agree with the proposed density or R3 zoning:

·   The proposed density of Mayfair Phase 2, which will serve as an extension of the existing
    Mayfair development, is well in excess of the density of Mayfair. The petitioner has not
    presented a compelling reason to support the increased density or more intensive R3 zoning.

·   As currently proposed, the development requires a deviation to reduce the R3 front yard
    setback requirement from 25' to 15' for all buildings on the north and west sides of Henley
    Lane (Buildings 10, 15-17, 19-21, 23, 25, 27) and a deviation to reduce the rear yard setback
    requirement from 25' to 15' for Buildings 4-6. Staff finds that the proposed deviations do
    not meet the standards contained in Section 6-4-3:12.1 (Planned Unit Development Design
    Standards and Criteria: Deviations) of the Municipal Code. The substandard setbacks create
    less open space/buffer from adjacent properties as well as a discontinuous streetscape from
    the existing Mayfair development. Such deviation could be eliminated by reducing the
    number of units and/or building footprints being proposed.

·   The current layout utilizes private streets to provide access to Buildings 11-14, which staff
    does not support. The lack of frontage on a public right-of-way could lead to future
    problems with emergency response, maintenance, and garbage pickup. Staff recommends
    reorientation of Buildings 10-18 in a similar fashion as Buildings 19-27 in order to provide
    direct access from Henley Lane. Such reconfiguration will likely reduce the number of units,
    but will also result in a better design that will facilitate long-term maintenance of the
    development.

·   The location of residential units immediately adjacent to commercial development could
    create a situation of inherent incompatibility due to conflicting neighborhood characters (i.e.,
    hours of operation, garbage, noise, etc.) The Mayfair Phase 2 development currently
    maintains the minimum 25' rear setback from the existing commercial uses along Ogden
    Avenue (e.g., FCA Flooring and Carpet, Q's Cabinet Shoppe, Pep Boys, Islamic Center),
    while a wider setback is maintained from the furniture store on Route 59. Staff recommends
    incorporation of a wider buffer especially on the north side (behind the Ogden commercial
    uses) and south/west sides (behind future commercial uses) in order to mitigate the land use
    conflicts.

·   There are generally less usable open space/amenities in Mayfair Phase 2 than the existing
    Mayfair, even though both developments provide approximately 43% of the land as open
    space (see the overall site plan in Attachment 3). Compared to Mayfair, the buildings in
    Mayfair Phase 2 are more closely located and there are less distance between buildings. In
    order to remain compatible with the existing Mayfair as well as to fulfill the intent of the
    PUD requirements, staff recommends that the petitioner investigate opportunities to provide
    additional amenities and open space in Mayfair Phase 2.

Building Design
The Mayfair Phase 2 development will include a total of 27 townhome buildings consisting of
six (6) in the Grant Park series (with front load units) and 21 in the Uptown series (with rear load
Mayfair Phase 2 ­ PZC 12-1-154

Page 5 of 5

units). Both unit types incorporate four-sided building design and a combination of brick and
vinyl siding materials in compliance with the 50% masonry requirement for attached single-
family buildings. Specifically, the Grant Park façade is comprised of 50% brick material and the
Uptown façade is comprised of 63% brick material. The proposed building elevations are
consistent with the buildings in the existing Mayfair development.

Minor Change to Mayfair
In order to provide access for the proposed Mayfair Phase 2, the petitioner proposes to eliminate
one townhome building and reconfigure Blakely Lane in the existing Mayfair development to
allow a connection of Henley Lane to Blakely Lane. Such change will require a minor change to
the Mayfair PUD subject to the City Council's review only. The petitioner intends to process the
minor change to the Mayfair PUD concurrent with the final PUD plat for Mayfair Phase 2 at a
future date.

Conclusion
As proposed, staff does not support the Mayfair Phase 2 development due to its excessive density
that leads to problematic site design and layout, as well as its negative impacts on the Route 59
commercial corridor in the area.

Open the public hearing and direct the petitioner to work with staff to resolve the issues

Section 6-4-7: Standards for Granting a Planned Unit Development


1. The design of the planned unit development presents an innovative and creative approach to
  the development of land and living environments.
  Our plan is to provide a medium density character that accommodates a variety of housing types and
  promotes good architectural design and livability.

2. The planned unit development meets the requirements and standards of the planned unit
  development regulations.
  We have provided a plan that promotes creative and attractive architectural design and building
  configuration to encourage a higher level of design than a typical townhome community. The plan
  allows flexibility to provide more efficient use of land and preserves both the natural features and
  outdoor recreation areas of the site.

3. The physical design of the planned unit development efficiently utilizes the land and
  adequately provides for transportation and public facilities while preserving the natural
  features of the site.
  Given how surrounding land has developed, one of the challenges of this property has been access.
  It's somewhat land-locked and to address this we have re-designed an efficient road network that
  logically continues our Mayfair community west to provide full access. A small wetland exists in the
  northeast corner of the site which will be kept as a natural feature in our plan.

4. Open space, outdoor common area, and recreational facilities are provided.
  The focal point of this second phase is the existing retention pond. This open space feature and
  common area has been planned to accommodate any future development of this property, so the
  existing running path and exercise stations will of course remain to service the new phase. Logical
  path connections have been designed in the plan to connect to this pathway system.

5. The modifications in design standards from the subdivision control regulations and the
  waivers in bulk regulations from the zoning regulations fulfill the intent of those regulations.
  The intent of the R3 zoning district is providing multiple-family areas of a medium density character
  that accommodates a variety of housing types and compatible uses. This plan and the requested
  modifications will fulfill the intent of providing good character elevations and planning design.

6. The planned unit development is compatible with the adjacent properties and nearby land
  uses.
  The plan unit development will be consistent and in character with surrounding land uses and
  adjacent property. Given the continuing residential character of the area, a townhome development
  is appropriate for this site.




                                                                                  ATTACHMENT 11
7. The planned unit development fulfills the objectives of the comprehensive plan and planning
  policies of the city.
  First adopted in 1985 and since updated in 1996 the Northwest Sector Area Plan has guided
  development in Naperville. We believe our plan does utilize the Planned Unit Development to
  encourage a residential project that provides diversity in the size and type of unit at varying densities,
  which is a guiding principle. Such variety is particularly meaningful for empty-nesters, newly married
  couples, single persons and senior citizens that want to remain or be new residents in Naperville. It's
  also important to remember that planning is a process and the Comprehensive Master Plan needs to
  remain current so as to reflect changes, concepts, market conditions, and attitudes.




                                                                                    ATTACHMENT 11
EXHIBIT 3
Section 6-3-7:2: Standards for Granting a Map Amendment (Rezoning)


1. The amendment promotes the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general
  welfare and complies with the policies and official land use plan and other official plans
  of the city.
  The rezoning amendment will not only promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and
  general welfare of its residents, but will significantly add to the City's tax base compared to its current
  tax yield.

2. The trend of development in the area of the subject property is consistent with the requested
  amendment.
  The trend of development north of Audrey Lane and west of Fort Hill Dr. is dominated by M/I Homes'
  townhome community called Mayfair. The marketplace has embraced this new community and sales
  have been successful. M/I Homes would like to continue the residential trend which we believe is not
  only appropriate but compliments and supports the pedestrian shopping within walking distance.

3. The requested zoning classification permits uses which are more suitable than the uses
  permitted under the existing zoning classification.
  The B2 zoning district requires you to build shopping centers offering either retail or service
  businesses. Given the location, visibility, access and far superior existing retail properties in the area,
  this property is not ideal for B2 zoning. An R3 zoning classification permits uses that are more
  suitable.

4. The property cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the
  conditions allowed under the existing zoning classification.
  Ideal retail/service shopping properties that compete with this property, which have either developed
  or will be developed with a shopping district zoning classification, out-position this property with
  respect to its current B2 zoning. There exists today both big box and in-line retail alternatives at far
  superior locations. For this property to develop and yield a return, another use will have to be
  considered.

5. The subject property has not been utilized under the existing zoning classification for a
  substantial period of time.
  The property was originally zoned R-4 in DuPage County and 10 years ago in 2003, whereby the City
  of Naperville involuntary annexed the site as B-2 community shopping district. Today the property
  remains vacant farmland.

6. The amendment, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and will
  not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property.
  The zoning amendment will be consistent and in character with surrounding land uses and adjacent
  property. Given the continuing residential character of the area, a townhome development is
  appropriate for this site.




                                                                                     ATTACHMENT 11
EXHIBIT 6
Section 7-1-13: Standards for Granting a Deviation from Platted Setback

1. The requested deviation is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Title.
  The requested deviations to both front and rear yard setbacks are limited in its application and its
  purpose is to promote community architecture where appropriate.

2. The applicant has demonstrated that strict enforcement of the platted building or setback
  line would result in practical difficulties or impose exceptional hardship.
  The application of a rear setback deviation for building 5 will maintain the same setback to all
  adjacent townhome buildings along the pond. In this case the existing pond acts as the control by
  which we determine the appropriate setback, not an arbitrary property line which will only affect this
  building.
  In the case of our Uptown Series of homes (rear-load, courtyard style), we want the most design
  flexibility of the building to provide different home types to the marketplace and different architecture
  for the community. Because a building can have different end unit livability, we will have different
  interpretations of corner-side or front yard setback, hence our request to be consistent with a front
  yard setback of 15 feet.

3. The deviation, if granted will not alter or destroy the essential character of the neighborhood
  and will not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property.
  These deviations (specifically, the front yard setback condition) will by design have the strongest
  character elevation of each building on the streetscape which promotes better looking community.

PREPARED BY:          Ying Liu, AICP, Planning Services Team

EXISTING ZONING, LAND USE, AND LOCATION     LOCATION:
The subject property consists of 13.2 acres and is located on Abriter Court north of Diehl Road,
south of Interstate 88 and west of the Freedom Commons shopping center. Also located on
Abriter Court between the subject property and Diehl Road are three hotels including the
Fairfield Inn, Marriott Country Inn and Suite
                                          Suites, and Hampton Inn. The property is currently
vacant and zoned ORI (Office, Research and Light Industry District). On December 19, 2011,
the City Council passed Ordinances 11  11-185 through 11-190 approving the following for the
subject property:
    · Vacation of a portion of the Abriter Court right of way,
    · A preliminary plat of subdivision to create five (5) lots,
    · A conditional use to establish the Freedom Plaza Planned Unit Development (PUD), and
Freedom Plaza ­ PZC 13-1-004
May 1, 2013
Page 2 of 6

    ·    A conditional use for a full service hotel (including a hotel and a restaurant) on Lots 1
         and 2 and associated deviations.

At the same time, the City Council denied a request for rezoning from ORI to OCI (Office,
Commercial and Institutional District) and a conditional use to allow for the construction of a
nursing home (CRL Assisted Living Facility) on the previously designated Lot 3.

PLANNING SERVICES TEAM REVIEW:
The petitioner, Lakhany Group Investments, LLC, requests approval of the following for the
subject property:
    · Revocation of Ordinances 11-187 and 11-190,
    · Resubdivision of the property into seven (7) lots,
    · A conditional use to establish a new PUD for Freedom Plaza and approval of a
        preliminary PUD plat,
    · A conditional use for a full service hotel/conference center in the ORI district, which
        encompasses a hotel/conference center on Lot 5 and four (4) free-standing restaurant
        buildings on Lots 1-4 in a campus setting, and
    · Multiple landscape, zoning, and subdivision deviations and sign variances associated
        with the development.

Revocation of Previous Ordinances
The petitioner wishes to revoke Ordinances 11-187 and 11-190 pertaining to the previous PUD
and conditional use approvals due to the significant changes between the current proposal and
the previous one (e.g., removal of CRL, inclusion of additional restaurants and re-design of the
entire PUD).

Conditional Use
The petitioner proposes to construct a 156,000 square foot full service hotel/conference center,
Embassy Suites, on Lot 5 of Freedom Plaza, which will include 168 rooms, a 1,500 square foot
restaurant and a 13,000 square foot banquet facility/meeting space with a capacity to
accommodate up to 1,080 people. In addition, four (4) freestanding restaurants with a total gross
floor area of 28,000 square feet are proposed on Lots 1-4 to support the hotel/conference center
as accessory uses. The Freedom Plaza development as a whole complies with the definition for
full service hotels* which allows multiple buildings located in a campus setting (defined as a
PUD). In the ORI District, a full service hotel requires approval of a conditional use.

The 1998 East Sector Update to the Comprehensive Master Plan designates the future land use
for this property as "Office, Research and Development". The Plan also identifies properties
along I-88 as the "Research and Development Corridor". Staff finds that the property's future
land use is consistent with the city's long-term vision for the corridor, and that maintaining such

*
  Definition: Full service hotels shall include at least 150,000 square feet of hotel, commercial, or service floor area,
banquet and/or meeting space, either within a single building or multiple buildings located in a campus setting
(defined as a single lot or planned unit development), and shall include all of the following components: 1). Banquet
and/or meeting space for at least 500 persons; and 2). A swimming pool and/or exercise facilities; and 3). A
restaurant within the physical confines of the hotel and provide room service that is accessory to the restaurant use.
Freedom Plaza ­ PZC 13-1-004

use is critical to employment and economic development opportunities in the City of Naperville.
Furthermore, the Plan indicates that commercial uses such as hotels, which support the
underlying land uses of office/research developments, may be permitted provided their presence
blends in with the existing development in the area.

Staff finds that the proposed full service hotel along with its accessory restaurant uses are
consistent with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan. Freedom Plaza will provide a
large event meeting space (1,080 people) that is currently not available in the City, as well as
accommodation services to support the business needs of the I-88 Research and Development
Corridor. The location of Freedom Plaza is appropriate, being adjacent to three existing hotels
on Abriter Court and the Freedom Commons commercial development.

Planned Unit Development
The petitioner proposes to develop Freedom Plaza as a planned unit development (PUD) in order
to provide flexibility from the zoning/subdivision regulations to facilitate a higher level of design
and amenity. The proposed preliminary PUD plat and landscape plan meet the design standards
and criteria for PUD's.
· A detention pond is currently located in the middle of the subject property. The petitioner
    proposes to move the detention pond to the northwest corner of the site to allow for
    clustering of the buildings and parking facilities east and south of the detention pond. The
    relocated detention area will be improved with a walking trail, a gazebo, a perennial garden,
    a seating area, native plantings and decorative trees. The detention pond will also afford the
    opportunities for outdoor dining areas overlooking the pond for Restaurants 1 and 4.
· Walkways are provided throughout the development to connect parking lots, buildings, and
    open space as well as connect the development to adjacent properties. A major east-west
    pedestrian route is provided through the parking lot which will be lined with a row of shrubs
    and perennial mix.
· Landscaping treatments are incorporated throughout the development in compliance with
    Section 5-10-3 (Landscaping and Screening) of the Municipal Code with the exception of the
    deviations sought (see Attachment 1) and subject to minor modifications to add additional
    trees and shrubs north of the Fairfield Inn property.
· An open area is provided in between restaurants 2 and 3 that will be improved with a
    courtyard/dining area including special pavement and landscaping enhancements (e.g., trellis,
    raised planters, etc.) Such arrangement compliments the courtyards provided in the adjacent
    Freedom Commons development. The landscape plan currently shows a green area between
    Restaurants 2 and 3. The petitioner has agreed to change the green area to a courtyard with
    the details of this courtyard to be provided during the final plat process.
· Overall, the development provides 24.5% (3.16 acres) of the site as common open area and
    site amenities, exceeding the 20% minimum requirement for a nonresidential PUD.

Cross Access with Fairfield Inn
The subject property currently has only one point of access from Diehl Road through Abriter
Court. To provide the required second point of access, an ingress/egress easement is proposed
across the Fairfield Inn property to connect the development to Independence Avenue (a private
drive in Freedom Commons). The petitioner has secured the access easement through an
Freedom Plaza ­ PZC 13-1-004
May 1, 2013
Page 4 of 6

agreement that has been signed by the Fairfield Inn property owner (Attachment 2). The
development will maintain a controlled emergency access to Freedom Commons through an
existing emergency access easement on the Maggianno's lot.

Fairfield Inn is currently zoned ORI and is part of the Diehl Road Office Campus Unit 3 PUD.
The proposed access easement for Freedom Plaza will result in reconfiguration of the parking lot
and a loss of parking spaces on the Fairfield Inn property. Concurrent with the Freedom Plaza
request, the owner of Fairfield Inn is requesting a major change to the Diehl Road Office
Campus Unit 3 PUD in order to reflect the new access for Freedom Plaza and resultant changes
(PZC 13-1-037).

Parking
Freedom Plaza provides a total of 703 parking spaces, all of which are included in a blanket
cross access and shared parking easement benefiting all lots in the development. In order to
compensate for the loss of parking spaces on the Fairfield Inn property, the petitioner proposes to
dedicate 12 parking spaces to Fairfield Inn, thereby reducing the parking supply for Freedom
Plaza to 691 spaces. As demonstrated in Table 6 (Page 21) of the Traffic Impact Study and
Parking Analysis (Attachment 10), a total of 605 parking spaces would be required for the full
service hotel and restaurants based on the City's parking requirements, which can be met with
the 691-space parking supply. The Parking Analysis further indicated that in case of large events
when additional parking may be necessary, a potential site for off-site parking has been
identified south of the property across Diehl Road at the Northern Illinois University-Naperville
campus (see the letter from NIU Naperville in Attachment 14).

Building Elevations
The proposed hotel/conference center exhibits contemporary design elements and an earth tone
color palette that are compatible with the adjacent Freedom Commons development. The ground
level of the building incorporates primarily traditional stone and brick materials while the upper
stories utilize a mixture of stone, brick, and fiber cement panels. Staff agrees with the
application of fiber cement panels on the upper stories based on the location of the material
above the pedestrian level and the flexibility it offers in high-rise application. The overall
massing of the building is softened by incorporating vertical projecting bays, horizontal banding
and material separations to break up the facade. Staff generally agrees with the proposed
building elevations, but has requested additional articulations be provided to further break up the
long walls on the ground floor of the rear façade and that the use of louvers on the upper levels
be reduced. Staff will work with the petitioner to address these concerns prior to Council's
review.

The elevations for the four restaurants will be provided at the time of final PUD plat approval.
The Statement of Intent and Concept for the Freedom Plaza PUD states that the restaurants
buildings will comply with the Building Design Guidelines and incorporate similar architectural
style and color palates complementary with the hotel.

Landscape, Zoning and Subdivision Deviations
The development requires a number of landscape, zoning and subdivision deviations (listed in
Attachment 1) in order to address the physical restrictions of the subject property (i.e., limited
Freedom Plaza ­ PZC 13-1-004
May 1, 2013
Page 5 of 6

roadway frontage), provide design flexibility to locate buildings/parking closer to the lot lines
and facilitate provision of combined parking facilities. The proposed building and parking
setbacks are consistent with the surrounding developments including Freedom Commons. Staff
agrees with the proposed deviations.

Sign Variance
The petitioner intends to install three signs for the Freedom Plaza development, including:

1) A 25' tall, 115 square foot Tollway sign along I-88 in Lot 6. A Tollway sign for Country Inn
   and Suites is currently located in a sign easement at the northeast corner of the subject
   property. The petitioner requests a variance from Section 5-4-9:2 (Street Graphics Control:
   Tollway Corridor) in order to install a second Tollway sign along I-88. The sign code allows
   a Tollway sign up to 25' in height, which may be appropriate along sections of the Tollway
   that are elevated. However, as shown in the perspective drawings (Attachment 9), there is
   little grade change between the proposed sign and the Tollway, and therefore staff does not
   find that the 25' tall sign is necessary to achieve visibility from the Tollway. Furthermore,
   while most Tollway signs include a single panel on a pole, the proposed sign has a
   substantially larger profile, containing five tenant panels on a 7.7' wide masonry base. As
   such, staff recommends that the petitioner reduce the height of the sign to no more than 20'
   in order to maintain a compatible scale to the surrounding buildings. Staff also recommends
   that a decorative arch be added to the top of the sign (with a total height of 20') to be
   consistent with the other two proposed monument signs in the development.

2) A 10' tall, 48 square foot monument sign in the median of Abriter Court at 30' from Diehl
   Road. The petitioner requests a variance from Section 5-4-3:5 (Prohibited Signs: Off
   Premises Signs) in order to locate the sign off-site in the median of Arbiter Court along Diehl
   Road. The sign will include panels for all Freedom Plaza tenants and Fairfield Inn and
   Suites. Its location provides appropriate separation from the existing Hampton Inn pole sign
   just north of Lot 7 and allows motorists to make proper turns in front of the sign. Staff
   agrees with the location of the sign in the public right-of-way subject to an encroachment
   agreement between the City and the petitioner. However, staff does not support the size of
   the sign, which is three (3) square feet over the 45 square foot allowance for a monument
   sign along Diehl Road. The petitioner has agreed to reduce the size of the sign to meet the
   code requirement.

3) A 5.6' tall monument sign at the southeast corner of Fairfield Inn facing Independence
   Avenue. The purpose of the sign is to direct traffic entering through Independence Avenue
   to Freedom Plaza. Per Section 5-4-4:19 (Exempt Signs), the sign is exempt from the
   requirement of the sign code as it is located within a business campus and is not visible from
   the public right-of-way.

Conditions of Approval
Staff recommends the following conditions of approval:
    · Construction of the full service hotel site shall be underway prior to issuance of any
        building permits for the remaining restaurant lots; specifics regarding this timing
Freedom Plaza ­ PZC 13-1-004
May 1, 2013
Page 6 of 6

       requirement will be included in the preliminary PUD ordinance submitted to City Council
       for review.
   ·   The petitioner shall be required to submit a plat of easement depicting the cross access
       easement over the Fairfield Inn property, which must be processed and recorded
       concurrently with the final plat of subdivision for Freedom Plaza or any final PUD plat
       for Lots 1-5, whichever occurs first.
   ·   The petitioner shall be required to establish a shared parking agreement with a
       surrounding property owner to provide off-site overflow parking for large events at the
       conference center. The petitioner shall submit a copy of the signed agreement during the
       final PUD plat process for Lot 5.
   ·   The sign along the Tollway shall be reduced and an architectural feature be added to be
       top consistent with the other two proposed signs so that the total height of the sign
       doesn't exceed 20'.
   ·   No additional ground/monument signs shall be allowed within the development other
       than the three proposed signs.

Conclusion
The proposed Freedom Plaza development complies with the City's Comprehensive Plan and the
design standards and criteria for PUD's. Staff supports the development subject to the
modifications noted in the staff memo and the above conditions of approval.

The Freedom Plaza planned unit development consists of a Full Service Hotel/Conference Center and
four restaurants in a business campus setting on an approximately thirteen acre site.

The primary use permitted use of the planned unit development is a full service hotel/conference
center. The proposed Embassy Suites satisfies the City's definition of a "Full Service Hotel" with 168
rooms, an internal restaurant with associated room service, pool and exercise facilities. The hotel will
also include an approximately 13,000 square foot conference center with capacity for 1,000 person
banquet style events. This conference center fulfills a long-term planning objective of the City and will
serve as a regional draw supporting nearby commercial and office uses while fortifying the backbone of
the City's economic base. Ancillary to the primary permitted use of the planned unit development are
four free-standing restaurant buildings (eating and drinking establishments). The location of the four
free-standing restaurants in the eastern half of the property serves as a natural transition from the
Freedom Commons development located immediately east of the Subject Property. Freedom Plaza is
consistent with the objectives of the City's Comprehensive Plan.

The design, layout and character of Freedom Plaza integrates the development with the adjacent
Freedom Commons and is consistent with best planning practices. Freedom Plaza provides easements
necessary to activate the platted cross-access easement at Independence Avenue that was as part of the
comprehensive planning of Freedom Commons. This cross-access facilitates free-flow of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic between three existing limited service hotels, the proposed Freedom Plaza and the
commercial development at Freedom Commons.

The design of Freedom Plaza utilizes a central spine similar in concept to the adjacent Freedom
Commons. This central spine aligns and interconnects the proposed Embassy Suites with Freedom
Commons. Different than Freedom Commons, the proposed central spin at Freedom Plaza integrates a
unique and creative pedestrian walkway to facilitate pedestrian access within Freedom Plaza and
between adjacent developments and to minimize vehicular conflicts.

The character of Freedom Plaza is driven by the hotel elevations. The hotel elevations are consistent
with the Naperville Building Design Guidelines. The elevations utilize modern design elements and
materials while integrating traditional brick and stone materials. The restaurants buildings will also
comply with the Building Design Guidelines. They should incorporate similar architectural style and
color palates complementary with the hotel while maintaining unique design elements consistent with
essential brand identities.

TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY AND PARKING ANALYSIS                           FREEDOM PLAZA ­ NAPERVILLE


I.      INTRODUCTION

Superhost Hospitality is planning to develop a site located on Abriter Court, just south of the Ronald
Reagan Memorial Tollway (I-88), north of Diehl Road, and west of Freedom Drive in Naperville,
Illinois. A site location map is included as Figure 1. The project site is approximately 15 acres and
the mixed-use development will consist of an Embassy Suites hotel with 168 rooms, a 1,500 square
foot restaurant servicing guests only, and an attached banquet facility of approximately 13,000
square feet, and four stand-alone restaurants of 6,000, 9,500, 5,500, and 7,000 square feet. The
conceptual site plan for the proposed development is provided in Figure 2.

Access to the project site will be provided by Abriter Court through the intersection of Diehl Road
and Abriter Court. Abriter Court currently provides access to three existing hotel properties and
dead-ends at the project site. In addition, a second point of access is proposed to the project site
by extending Independence Avenue west of Freedom Drive to Abriter Court through the existing
Fairfield Inn hotel property. The access would allow ingress/egress to the site from the east at the
existing signalized intersection of Freedom Drive and Independence Avenue. A controlled
emergency access point is also proposed at the northeast portion of the site.

The purpose of this report is to evaluate the anticipated traffic impacts and conduct a parking
analysis for the proposed project. Traffic estimates were determined for the year 2019, which is five
years beyond the anticipated project completion of 2014. The study area consisted of the following
existing intersections:

        Freedom Drive / Independence Avenue
        Diehl Road / Abriter Court

This report includes a description of existing conditions, data collection and analysis, evaluation of
data, parking assessment, and conclusions and recommendations.

II.    PROJECT CONDITIONS

Land Uses

A variety of land uses exist near the project site which include residential, industrial, institutional,
and other mixed-use properties. The land uses and locations are presented in Figure 3.

Roadway System

The characteristics of the roadways in the vicinity of the site are presented below. The existing lane
configurations are illustrated in Figure 4.

Freedom Drive is a north-south roadway just east of the project site, extending from Warrenville
Road to Diehl Road. Freedom Drive provides access to and from the Ronald Reagan Memorial
Tollway (I-88). At the intersection with Independence Avenue, both the north and south approaches
contain two through lanes and an exclusive left-turn lane. South of Independence Avenue, the
southbound approach widens from two lanes to a five-lane section providing a single through lane,
dual lefts, and dual right-turn lanes at the Diehl Road intersection. The approaches are separated
by a corrugated concrete median. An asphalt shared-use path is located along the west side of the
roadway and ends at the Freedom Drive/Diehl Road intersection. The posted speed limit is 35
miles per hour.

Diehl Road is an east-west roadway just south of the project site. At the intersection with Abriter
Court, both the east and west approaches contain two through lanes and exclusive left-turn lanes.
At the intersection of Freedom Drive and Diehl Road, the eastbound approach contains two through
lanes and an exclusive left-turn lane and the westbound approach contains two through lanes, an
exclusive left-turn lane, and a channelized exclusive right-turn lane. Curb and gutter and sidewalk
are located along both sides of the roadway and the posted speed limit is 40 miles per hour. There
are pedestrian crosswalks along all four legs of the intersection.

Independence Avenue is an east-west access roadway for the mixed use properties east and west
of Freedom Drive. The intersection with Freedom Drive is signalized and maintained by DuPage
County. Both the eastbound and westbound approaches contain a shared through/right-turn lane
and an exclusive left-turn lane. Independence Avenue has curb and gutter and sidewalk along both
sides of the roadway. There are pedestrian crosswalks along all four legs of the intersection.

Abriter Court is a north-south roadway providing access to existing hotels north of Diehl Road and
commercial office land uses south of Diehl Road. Abriter Court dead-ends north of Diehl Road.
Although pavement markings do not clarify the number of lanes, field observations indicated that
there is enough pavement for a shared through/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane for
both approaches. The proceeding analysis reflects the field observations. Abriter Court has curb
and gutter along both sides of the roadway. There is a sidewalk along the east side of Abriter
Court, north of Diehl Road.

Traffic Volumes

To assist in the evaluation of the traffic impacts on the roadway system resulting from the proposed
development, existing intersection traffic volumes were collected during the times and dates listed
below:
     Freedom Drive / Independence Avenue
            Wednesday (11/10/2010) ­ 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM
            Wednesday (11/10/2010) ­ 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM
            Saturday (11/20/2010) ­ 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM
     Diehl Road / Abriter Court
            Wednesday (11/10/2010) ­ 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM
            Wednesday (11/10/2010) ­ 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM
            Saturday (11/20/2010) ­ 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM

The weekday AM, weekday PM and Saturday mid-day peak hours at the Freedom Drive /
Independence Avenue intersection occurred between 7:15 AM ­ 8:15 AM, 5:00 PM ­ 6:00 PM and
12:00 PM ­ 1:00 PM, respectively.

The weekday AM, weekday PM and Saturday mid-day peak hours at the Diehl Road / Abriter Court
intersection occurred between 7:30 AM ­ 8:30 AM, 4:45 PM ­ 5:45 PM and 12:15 PM ­ 1:15 PM,
respectively.

The existing peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 5. A summary of the traffic volumes
in fifteen minute increments are provided in Appendix A.

III.      TRAFFIC FORECASTS

Site Generated Traffic Volumes

Trip Generation

The proposed project will consist of four standalone restaurants of 6,000 square feet, 9,500 square
feet, 5,500 square feet, and 7,000 square feet, and a hotel with 168 rooms. The hotel also includes
a 1,500 square foot restaurant and a 13,000 square foot conference center/banquet facility. Since
the hotel restaurant caters specifically to hotel guests, it is not included as a trip generator. Project
traffic and inbound/outbound percentages for the site was estimated using the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. The following categories were
used to determine project traffic:

       Hotel (Land Use Code 310) ­ Hotels are places of lodging that provide sleeping
       accommodations and supporting facilities such as restaurants; cocktail lounges; meeting
       and banquet rooms or convention facilities; limited recreational facilities (pool, fitness room);
       and/or other retail and services shops. Some of the sites included in this land use category
       are actually large motels providing the hotel facilities notes above.

       High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant (Land Use Code 932) ­ This land use consist of sit-
       down, full-service eating establishments with turnover rates of approximately one hour or
       less. This type of restaurant is usually moderately priced and frequently belongs to a
       restaurant chain. Generally, these restaurants serve lunch and dinner; they may also be
       open for breakfast and are sometimes open 24 hours per day. These restaurants typically
       do not take reservations. Patrons may commonly wait to be seated, are served by a
       waiter/waitress, order from menus and pay for their meal after they eat. Some facilities
       contained within this land use may also contain a bar area for serving food and alcoholic
       drinks.

Table 1 provides the total site generated trips for the proposed mixed-use development.

Trips were not generated for the High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant (932) category in the AM
peak hour because the type of restaurants proposed will not be open during the AM peak hour.

Based on the hotel land use description provided in ITE's Trip Generation, the trips associated with
the hotel conference center/banquet facility are included in the hotel trip generation. However, it

should be noted that the data used to generate the trip rates does not provide the number of hotels
with this ancillary use or the size of it.

Trip Reductions

Considering the mix of hotel and restaurant land uses within this proposed mixed-use development,
it is reasonable to expect that trip interaction will occur between the uses. To account for this
interaction, the methodology for estimating internally captured trips in ITE's Trip Generation
Handbook was used. Internal capture trips are those made within a mixed-use development that
travel on an internal roadway only and do not use adjacent main roadways or use a mode of
transportation other than driving, such as walking. This results in a reduction of external trips for
the site. The worksheets calculating internal capture using the ITE method and the resulting
internal trip generation are located in Appendix B.

As documented in ITE's Trip Generation Handbook, restaurant land uses do not typically generate
all new traffic on a roadway system. The total traffic generation is a combination of pass-by trips, or
traffic drawn directly from the passing traffic flow on the adjacent streets, and primary trips, which
represent new traffic drawn to the facility. It provides a pass-by reduction factor of 43 percent
during the PM peak hour for a high-turnover (sit-down) restaurant. Based on the location of the
restaurants and to provide a conservative analysis, this pass-by reduction was not applied to the
site external trip generation.

In addition, to be conservative, no additional reduction factors have been applied to account for
alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, bicycling, or public transportation.

Trip Distribution and Assignment

The direction from which traffic will approach and depart a site is a function of numerous variables,
including location of residences, employment centers, and commercial/retail centers, available
roadway systems, location and number of access points, and levels of congestion on the adjacent
road systems.

The directional distribution of project traffic determined for this study was based on existing travel
patterns in the area and modified slightly for the close proximity of the project site to I-88 and the
ramp configurations between Freedom Drive and Naperville Road. The directional distribution and
assignment of project traffic is illustrated in Figure 6.

Background Traffic Volumes

Background traffic volumes were estimated for the year 2019, which is five years beyond the
expected project completion of 2014. These volumes account for future (non-project related) growth
in the area. A growth rate of 1.0 percent per year was applied to the existing traffic volumes. The
background traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 7.

Future Traffic Volumes

To obtain future year 2019 traffic volumes, the site generated traffic volumes were added to the
background traffic volumes. Due to the new cross access between Abriter Court and Independence
Avenue, it is expected that traffic associated with the existing hotels along Abriter Court will also
utilize this access. Therefore, a percentage of the existing traffic at the intersection of Diehl Road
and Abriter Court is redistributed to this intersection (similar to the distributions shown in Figure 6).
Figure 8 depicts the future traffic volumes for the year 2019.

IV.    TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

Capacity Analysis

The operation of a facility is based on level of service (LOS) calculations using analytical methods
defined in the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 Edition. The concept
of LOS is defined as a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream and
the perception of motorists

Typically, various state and local governments adopt standards varying between LOS C and LOS E,
depending on the area's size and roadway characteristics. Based on our past experience in the City of
Naperville and DuPage County, a LOS D or better has been the accepted operating standard. For
purposes of this analysis, a LOS D has been assumed to be the threshold.

There are six LOS letter designations, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best range of
operating conditions. In general, the various LOS are defined as follows:
    LOS A represents free flow. Individual users are virtually unaffected by the presence of
       others in the traffic stream. Freedom to select desired speeds and to maneuver within the
       traffic stream is extremely high. The general level of comfort and convenience provided to
       the motorist, passenger, or pedestrian is excellent.
    LOS B is in the range of stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream
       begins to be noticeable. Freedom to select desired speed is relatively unaffected, but there
       is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from LOS A. The
       level of comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less than at LOS A, because the
       presence of others in the traffic stream begins to affect individual behavior.
    LOS C is in the range of stable flow, but marks the beginning of the range of flow in which
       the operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions with others in
       the traffic stream. The selection of speed is now affected by the presence of others, and
       maneuvering within the traffic stream requires vigilance on the part of the user. The general
       level of comfort and convenience declines at this level.
    LOS D represents high-density, but stable flow. Speed and freedom to maneuver are
       restricted and the driver or pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of comfort and
       convenience. Small increases in traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at this
       level.
    LOS E represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level. All speeds are reduced
       to a low, but relatively uniform value. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is
       difficult, and it is generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian to "give way" to
       accommodate such maneuvers. Comfort and convenience levels are poor, and driver or
       pedestrian frustration is generally high. Operations at this level are usually unstable,
       because small increases in flow or minor disturbances within the traffic stream will cause
       breakdowns.
    LOS F is used to define forced or breakdown flow. This condition exists wherever the
       amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount, which can traverse the point.
       Queues form behind such locations. Operations within the queue are characterized by stop-
       and-go waves, and they are extremely unstable. Vehicles may progress at reasonable
       speeds for several hundred feet or more, and then be required to stop in a cyclic fashion.
       LOS F is used to describe the operating conditions within the queue, as well as the point of
       breakdown. It should be noted, however, that in many cases operating conditions of
                                                  15


                                                                              ATTACHMENT 10

       vehicles or pedestrians discharged from the queue may be quite good. Nevertheless, it is
       the point at which arrival flow exceeds discharge flow, which causes the queue to form.

The LOS of an intersection is based on the average control delay per vehicle. For a signalized
intersection, the delay is calculated for each lane group and then aggregated for each approach
and for the intersection as a whole. Generally, the LOS is reported for the intersection as a whole.
For an unsignalized intersection, the delay is only calculated and reported for each minor
movement. An overall intersection LOS is not calculated.

There are different LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections primarily due to driver
perceptions of transportation facilities. The perception is that a signalized intersection is expected
to carry higher traffic volumes and experience a greater average delay than an unsignalized
intersection. The LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections are provided in Table 2.

A capacity analysis was performed for the existing, background, and future traffic conditions using
the Highway Capacity Software (HCS+). Existing signal timings were obtained from the City of
Naperville and were field verified. LOS evaluations were performed at the following intersections:
     Freedom Drive / Independence Avenue
     Diehl Road / Abriter Court

Reported in Table 3 are the weekday AM, weekday PM, and Saturday mid-day peak hour capacity
analysis results. Supporting analysis worksheets from HCS+ for the existing, background, and
future traffic conditions are provided in Appendices C, D, and E, respectively.

A review of Table 3 indicates that both intersections of Freedom Drive and Independence Avenue
and Diehl Road and Abriter Court will operate at a LOS D or better under future traffic conditions
with no geometric or signal phasing/timing modifications for nearly all time periods. All approaches
of the intersections will continue to operate similar to existing conditions. It should be noted that
delay times decrease for the southbound movement at the intersection of Diehl Road and Arbiter
Court due to re-routing existing traffic to the new access point at Freedom Drive and Independence
Avenue.

The northbound approach of Abriter Court does degrade to LOS E during the future PM peak
period. This is a minor approach to an unsignalized intersection, with only 16 total vehicles during
the PM peak hour. Additionally, it is expected that the traffic signal on Diehl Road at Freedom Drive
will continue to create gaps (similar to existing conditions) in the traffic flow allowing vehicles on
Abriter Court to make their maneuvers. Therefore, no modifications are recommended at Diehl
Road and Abriter Court.

Queue Length Analysis

Table 4 summarizes the 95th percentile queue lengths for the existing, background, and future
analyses during the weekday AM, weekday PM, and Saturday mid-day peak hours at the signalized
intersection of Freedom Drive and Independence Avenue.

A review of Table 4 indicates that this project has minimal impacts to the queue lengths at the
intersection of Freedom Drive and Independence Avenue. One of the potentially impacted
approaches at this signalized intersection is in the eastbound direction. The estimated 95th
percentile queue length increases from 78 feet to 165 feet during the weekday PM peak hour and
from 63 feet to 195 feet during the Saturday mid-day peak hour. The first internal drive aisle on
Independence Avenue west of Freedom Drive is approximately 125 feet from the stop bar.

Based on the future queue length, it is possible that an eastbound vehicle may block the internal
drive aisle on occasion. Some options to mitigate the potential queuing include:

        Modify raised island on west leg of intersection to extend left turn bay to internal drive aisle
        to provide additional storage length for eastbound left turning vehicles
        Re-time traffic signal to minimize eastbound queue lengths while still providing adequate
        and efficient timing for all vehicles traveling through intersection
        Stripe internal drive aisle intersection and place signage to deter vehicles from queuing in

Special Event Assessment ­ Traffic

As previously stated, the hotel land use description in ITE Trip Generation Manual includes
supporting facilities such as meeting and banquet rooms or convention facilities. The data provided
by ITE is somewhat limited, however, since the data for estimating trips does not specify the level of
activity or the sizes of the supporting facilities. These factors could have additional traffic impacts to
the adjacent roadways and intersections during special events (i.e. use of the conference
center/banquet facility).

According to Superhost Hospitality, Table 5 summarizes the anticipated use of the banquet facility.

                                  Table 5 ­ Summary of Anticipated Events

                 Size of Event (people)             Occurrence                    Multiple Events
                       40 ­ 100                 8 to 12 events/month                    Yes
                       100 ­ 250                4 to 5 events/month                     Yes
                       250 ­ 400                3 to 4 events/month                     Yes
                       400 ­ 600                  2 events/month                            No

The occurrence data is estimated based on similar hotels in the area and the industry. The multiple
events data indicates that, given the size of the event and the configuration of the conference

                                                           18

center/banquet facility, more than one of those sized events could be accommodated at the same
time.

Based on this event data and the overall size of the conference center/banquet facility, the trip
generation rates utilized in this analysis for the hotel may not fully take into account vehicle trips
generated for certain special events. It is important to note, however, that event traffic will not be an
everyday occurrence as demonstrated in the table.

It is our understanding that, typically, the weekday conferences and banquets held at similar
Embassy Suites hotels are planned to occur between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM. These are specifically
planned so that conference and banquet patrons are not traveling to and from the site during the
typical weekday commuter peak hours, thus also minimizing the traffic impacts and delays in the
area. It is expected that a majority of the larger events will occur on the weekends primarily in the
afternoon and evening hours when traffic along Diehl Road and Freedom Drive will be much lower
than during the weekday. On the rare occasion when an event will begin or end during the
weekday peak hours, there will be additional delays experienced at the study area intersections
than the delays shown in Table 3.

Superhost Hospitality has had discussions with American Parking Service to discuss event traffic
operations. Since events are planned well in advance, a traffic circulation and management plan
would be developed by the parking service to provide the most efficient traffic flow throughout the
site. With the proposed accesses to Diehl Road and Freedom Drive, events under 250 people that
end during the weekday evening peak hour could be accommodated under normal operations but
will experience delay. Events over 250 people would require some assistance to access both Diehl
Road and Freedom Drive. Strategies to assist vehicles could include one or more of the following:
      Police directing vehicles at the unsignalized intersection of Diehl Road and Abriter Court
      Police control of the traffic signal at the signalized intersection of Freedom Drive and
        Independence Avenue
      Temporary directional signing on-site to direct people traveling west and south to Diehl
        Road and north and east to Independence Avenue
      Turning restrictions on Abriter Court by temporary signing
      Shuttle service to the BNSF Naperville train station

V.      PARKING ASSESSMENT

This parking assessment has been prepared to determine the adequacy of the proposed number of
parking spaces for the entire development. Provided in this assessment is a parking analysis
based on city code and a review of parking facilities at other area hotels with banquet facilities.
Parking for the various land uses is located in the following lots:

        Lot 1 ­ Proposed 6,000 square foot restaurant pad
        Lot 2 ­ Proposed 9,500 square foot restaurant pad
        Lot 3 ­ Proposed 5,500 square foot restaurant pad
        Lot 4 ­ Proposed 7,000 square foot restaurant pad
        Lot 5 ­ Proposed 168 room full service hotel with 13,000 square foot hotel conference
        center/banquet facility and 1,500 square foot restaurant
        Lot 6 ­ Open Space
        Lot 7 ­ Open Space

Parking Requirements per City of Naperville Municipal Code

The City of Naperville's Municipal Code, Title 6, Chapter 9, Section 3, provides a schedule of off-
street parking ratios to determine the required number of parking spaces corresponding to its
specified land use. Table 6 provides a breakdown of the required parking spaces for Freedom
Plaza.

As Table 6 illustrates, Freedom Plaza would require 605 parking spaces based on the municipal
code. The required number of parking spaces for the hotel is cumulative and also accounts for the
number of employees, the banquet facility, and the restaurant. Based on information from
Superhost Hospitality regarding the proposed hotel model and number of rooms, it is expected that
the maximum number of hotel employees on site at any given time of the day would range from 8 to
12 employees.

For the purposes of this analysis, 12 employees were assumed and included in the required parking
space calculations. Per the City code, the parking for the conference center employees is included
in the requirement for conference centers.

The proposed restaurants are expected to be sit-down restaurants and will not include drive-thru
facilities. The hotel restaurant is expected to be only marketed to and frequented by hotel guests;
however, for the purposes of this analysis, the hotel restaurant is assumed to be a stand-alone use.

With the extension of Independence Avenue through the adjacent Fairfield Inn hotel property,
twelve parking spaces will have to be removed from the Fairfield Inn supply to provide the access to
Freedom Drive. Freedom Plaza has provided a parking easement to Fairfield Inn for twelve spaces
so that the adjacent hotel can meet the City parking requirement.

The site plan for Freedom Plaza includes 703 surface parking spaces, providing a surplus of 86
parking spaces with twelve spaced designated for Fairfield Inn based on Naperville's code
requirements.

Local Hotel Comparison

Parking data from local hotels with conference centers was obtained to compare the parking ratios
between existing facilities and the proposed hotel. Table 7 details five area hotels with significant
banquet space and outlines available parking using hotel rooms and banquet space as the
independent variables.

The parking analysis for the local hotels with conference centers is evaluated using the City of
Naperville hotel parking requirement of one parking space per hotel room with the balance of
spaces assigned to the conference center (this ignores the restaurant area and employee parking
components of Naperville code). The average existing parking supply for the hotel conference
centers evaluated is 5.43 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet, which is approximately one half of
the City's code requirement. The highest parking ratio evaluated was 11.80 spaces per 1,000
square feet of conference center at the Wyndham Lisle-Chicago Hotel and Executive Meeting
Center. While the parking ratio for the proposed Embassy Suites is comparable to the Wyndham,
the parking ratio shown for the Wyndham is the clear outlier in our analysis. It should be noted that
the parking ratio is artificially inflated due to the parking supply being available for the attached six-
story corporate office building.

* Number of parking spaces accounts for on-site parking only. Additional parking spaces may be associated with shared parking agreements, but
the actual number of spaces were not provided for the purposes of this analysis

** The Marriott Conference Hotel in Lisle has recently closed. The hotel and parking data were provided by the Village of Lisle prior to closure and
include data while still open.
Notes:

1. For comparison purposes, a portion of the available parking spaces for the hotel uses are based on a 1 space/room parking
requirement. The remaining parking spaces were assumed to be available for banquet use.
2. For the Wyndham Hotel, the parking space count includes significant supply dedicated to the attached six-story office tower.


The parking supply provided for the convention center/banquet facility portion of the proposed
Embassy Suites Hotel at Freedom Plaza could include up to 231 parking spaces if the hotel
restaurant and surplus parking were utilized (130 spaces for banquet facility, 15 spaces for hotel
restaurant, and the 86 space surplus). This results in a parking rate of 17.8 spaces per 1,000
square feet of convention center/banquet facility space, over 50 percent higher than the highest rate
illustrated in Table 7.

Special Event Assessment and Overflow Parking Plan

As previously discussed, Superhost Hospitality has provided a summary of the anticipated use of
the hotel conference center/banquet facility and the occurrence of each size of event. The
information is again provided for reference in Table 8.

As previously stated, Freedom Plaza could include 231 parking spaces for use by the banquet
facility (130 spaces for banquet facility, 15 spaces for hotel restaurant, and the 86 space surplus).
While this parking supply is more than sufficient to accommodate the vast majority of events that
will occur at the banquet facility, further analysis is warranted for operation of the large 1,080
person events.

A number of factors can combine to accommodate adequate parking on-site to meet the parking
needs of a large 1,080 person event. First, the ability of parking spaces to be shared between uses
is applicable for this mixed-use development due to variances in peak parking demand. Based on
the proposed uses within the development, it is highly unlikely that all Freedom Plaza uses would
operate at peak parking operations simultaneously. Based on Urban Land Institute's Shared
Parking, a hotel does not experience full parking capacity until 11:00 PM with parking occupancy as
low as 65 percent throughout the day. This would provide additional parking spaces for convention
center/banquet facility patrons.

Second, the hotel and conference center are complementary uses - the conference center will
generate room stays for the hotel and the hotel will serve guests at the conference center.
Therefore, it can be expected that a percentage of conference center patrons will be guests at the
hotel and will not generate independent parking demands from the hotel use. This is particularly
true with respect to large conferences and events such as weddings. In addition, it is likely that
patrons of large events may also be guests at the adjacent hotels and park in their respective
parking lots. This will decrease the demand for dedicated parking at the banquet facility.

However, even with the additional available parking, there may be times where additional parking
may be necessary for large events. All large events require significant coordination and are
planned well in advance. Accordingly, the hotel operator may consider implementing an overflow
parking strategy plan if any parking issues are anticipated at the hotel. An overflow parking plan
describes the management strategies that will be applied when parking facilities are expected to be
full and may include the following:

       Provide signs with directions to nearby alternative parking facilities
       Shared parking arrangements during peak special event times
       Use of remote parking facilities with shuttle service
       Promotion of alternative travel modes such as public transit and ridesharing to major events
       Encourage employees to use alternative modes during peak special events
       Utilize valet parking services to increase parking facility capacity
       Provide adequate parking management staff during special events

A potential site for off-site parking has been identified south of the site across Diehl Road at
Northern Illinois University ­ Naperville (NIU-N) campus, as illustrated in Figure 9. A preliminary
agreement for overflow parking at NIU-N is currently being developed. In addition, Superhost
Hospitality has had discussions with American Parking Service that provides event management

services. They can identify and negotiate lease arrangements with off-site lots that are typically
underutilized during evenings and weekends.

We believe that sufficient parking can be accommodated for 1,080 person events at Freedom Plaza
based on the combination of 1) the surplus parking at Freedom Plaza; 2) the availability of shared-
parking among complementary uses at Freedom Plaza; and 3) the hotel operators dedication to off-
site parking management plans for large events.

V.     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This study analyzed the traffic impacts for the proposed development consisting of a hotel with an
attached banquet facility and four free-standing restaurant pads. A capacity analysis was
performed for the existing, background, and future traffic conditions for the weekday AM, weekday
PM and Saturday mid-day peak hours. Traffic was estimated to the year 2019, which is five years
beyond the expected project completion of 2014.

Based on the results of the traffic analysis, no intersection and signal timing improvements are
necessary. The existing lane configurations and intersection controls at the intersections of
Freedom Drive and Independence Avenue and Diehl Road and Abriter Court will accommodate the
traffic generated by the proposed development.

The City of Naperville's Municipal Code provides a schedule of off-street parking ratios to determine
the required number of parking spaces corresponding to its specified land use. Freedom Plaza
would require 605 parking spaces based on the municipal code. The site plan for Freedom Plaza
includes 703 surface parking spaces, providing a surplus of 86 parking spaces with twelve spaces
designated for Fairfield Inn based on Naperville's code requirements.

PREPARED BY:          Ying Liu, AICP, Planning Services Team

EXISTING ZONING, LAND USE, AND LOCATION    LOCATION:
The subject property consists of approximately 2 acres and is located at 1820 Abriter Court north
of Diehl Road and south of Interstate 88
                                      88. The property is zoned ORI (Office, Research and Light
Industry District) and is part of the Diehl Road Campus Unit 3 Planned Unit Development
(PUD). It is currently improved with a hotel, Fairfield Inn Naperville.

PLANNING SERVICES TEAM REVIEW       REVIEW:
A developer, Lakhany Group Investments, LL      LLC, has proposed to develop a full service
hotel/conference center and four restaurants oon the 13-acre vacant parcel adjacent to the north
side of the subject property. The development, known as Freedom Plaz Plaza, has only one point of
access from Abriter Court.  t. To provide the required second point of access, the developer of
Freedom Plaza seeks to obtain an ingress/egress easement across the subject property to connect
Freedom Plaza to Independence Avenue (a private drive in Freedom Commons).
                                                                      Commons) The owner of
the subject property has agreed to grant the access easement (a signed copy of the access
easement agreement is included in Attachment 1);     ; a plat depicting the cross-access
                                                                             cross       will be
submitted at a future date.

The proposed access easement for Freedom Plaza will result in reconfiguration of the parking lot
and a loss of 11 parking spaces on the subject property. Therefore, the petitioner is requesting a
major change to the Diehl Road Office Campus Unit 3 PUD in order to reflect the new access for
Freedom Plaza and the resultant changes. While the petitioner has submitted a site plan
depicting the changes, the formal final PUD plat depicting the same changes will be processed
concurrently with the final PUD plat for Freedom Plaza.

Parking
As show in the table below, Fairfield Inn is required to provide a total of 113 parking spaces
based on the City's parking requirement for hotels. The subject property currently provides a
total of 112 parking spaces, which will be reduced to 101 spaces in order to accommodate the
new access for Freedom Plaza. To compensate for the loss of parking, the developer of Freedom
Plaza will dedicate 12 parking spaces in the proposed Freedom Plaza development for Fairfield
Inn's use. The 12 parking spaces will be located in an exclusive parking easement immediately
north of the subject property within 300' of Fairfield Inn, in compliance with Section 6-9-2:2
(Collective Off Street Parking Facilities). As a result, Fairfield Inn will have a parking supply of
113 spaces, meeting the City's parking requirement. Freedom Plaza will continue to meet their
parking requirements after the dedication of the 13 spaces for exclusive use by Fairfield Inn.

Fairfield Inn           Parking Requirement      Parking Required
105 rooms               1 space/room             105 spaces
8 employees             1 space/employee         8 spaces
Total                                            113 spaces

Sign Variance
The developer of Freedom Plaza has proposed to install an off-premise monument sign in the
median of Abriter Court at a distance of 30' from Diehl Road. The petitioner requests a variance
from Section 5-4-3:5 (Prohibited Signs: Off Premises Signs) in order to co-locate a tenant panel
on the sign. Overall, the proposed monument sign will be 10' tall, 48 square feet in size, and
include a panel for Fairfield Inn and five (5) other panels for the Freedom Plaza tenants. The
current size of the sign proposed is three (3) square feet over the 45 square foot allowance for a
monument sign along Diehl Road; however, the developer of Freedom Plaza has agreed to
reduce the size of the sign to meet the code requirement.

Staff agrees with the location of the sign in the public right-of-way subject to an encroachment
agreement between the City and the petitioner. Furthermore, given Fairfield Inn's lack of
frontage on Diehl Road, staff supports the petitioner's request to co-locate a panel on the
monument sign in order to help direct customers to the hotel.

Finally, the petitioner will allow installation of a monument sign for Freedom Plaza in a
landscape island at the southeast corner of the hotel facing Independent Avenue. The purpose of
the sign is to direct traffic entering through Independence Avenue to Freedom Plaza. Per Section
5-4-4:19 (Exempt Signs), the sign is exempt from the requirement of the sign code as it is located
within a business campus and is not visible from the public right-of-way.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION:
In recent years, the City has received and processed numerous requests to locate training studios
and automotive uses on properties that first require approval of a conditional use prior to
occupancy. After a preliminary review of these cases and their ap  approval
                                                                      proval records, staff believes
that some of the existing conditional use requirement
                                               requirements may be overly burdensome and that
additional code requirements may be put in place to ensure the appropriateness of these uses as
of right. Members

                                                               or these uses in the Business and

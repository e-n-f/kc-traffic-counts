                                                                   Intersection Study

 Introduction

In 2012, the town of Somerset requested an examination of the intersection of
Read Street and Brayton Avenue. Traffic patterns in Somerset have dramatically
changed due to the opening of the Veteran's Memorial Bridge in 2011,
with an influx of traffic onto Brayton Avenue. The town has raised concerns
regarding excessive vehicle delay and queues at this intersection. Southeastern
Regional Planning and Economic Development District (SRPEDD) examined the
existing signalized intersection, identified congestion issues and recommends
improvements to enhance traffic flow, reduce vehicle emissions and address any
other transportation issues related to this location.

Existing Conditions

The intersection of Read Street and Brayton Avenue is a four-legged, two-phase
signalized intersection in the town of Somerset. As Shown in Figure 1 on the
following page, the neighborhood is primarily residential with the exception of
two businesses directly adjacent to the intersection; the Healthy Way on the
northeast corner and Correia & Son's Market at the northwest corner. Other
land uses surrounding the area include St. John of God Church and Somerset
Middle School which are located north of the intersection. Route 6 connects to
Brayton Avenue and leads to the Veteran's Memorial Bridge. South Elementary
School is located on Read Street to the west and Route 138 intersects with Read
Street to the east. Figure 2 on page 3 illustrates that intersection's location along
with the nearby routes and the Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Read Street is an east/west running road classified as an urban minor arterial
road with an average daily traffic volume (ADT) of 4,600 vehicles per day. When
approaching Read Street from Route 138, the posted speed limit is 35 mph, but
drops to 30 mph at the intersection. The Read Street eastbound approach has a
surface width of 35 feet and widens to 46 feet at the stop line. The shoulder is 3
feet wide on the northern edge of the road and 4.5 feet wide along the southern
edge. The westbound approach is 35 feet and widens to 50 feet at the stop line.
The shoulder along the northern edge of the road is 3 feet and 4 feet along the
southern edge. "No Parking Here to Corner" signs are located at the northeast
corner of the intersection and a SRTA bus stop (which also prohibits parking) is
located at the southwest corner.

                                           Brayton Avenue is a north/south running road that is classified as an urban
                                           minor arterial. The average daily traffic (ADT) is 7,800 vehicles per day with
                                           a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour (mph). Brayton Avenue consists of
                                           a single lane approach northbound with a total road width of 34 feet at the
                                           intersection and 38 feet at the stop line. The southbound approach is 34 feet
                                           wide at Somerset Middle School, widens to 39 feet at the intersection and
                                           48 feet at the stop line. There are sidewalks present on both sides of Brayton
                                           Avenue. There is signage located on the northbound portion of Brayton Avenue
                                           indicating that this area is thickly settled. Signs indicating "No Parking at
                                           Anytime" are located on both approaches of Brayton Avenue.

                                             There are sidewalks present at the intersection with the exception of the
                                             westbound side of Read Street. The eastbound approach only has a sidewalk
                                             on the northern edge. Although one curb ramp is present at each approach,
                                             placement of the ramps is not consistent throughout the intersection. The only
                                             curb ramp that aligns with the crosswalk is located on the southwest corner. The
                                             curb ramps located at the northeast and northwest corners of the intersection
                                             are placed near the stop line rather than at the crosswalk. The Read Street
                                             westbound approach from Riverside Avenue (Route 138) to Brayton Avenue was
                                             recently repaved along with new pavement markings. The pavement conditions
                                             surrounding the majority of the crosswalks at the intersection are forming
                                             cracks and are uneven making wheelchair accessibility a problem. Figure 3 and
                                             4 display the existing pavement markings and conditions at the northeast and
                                             northwest corners.

Traffic Volume data (Existing Volumes and Operations)

To determine average daily traffic and speed, automated traffic counters were
placed on Brayton Avenue south of Read Street and on Read Street, west of
Riverside Avenue. As previously mentioned, the ADT on Brayton Avenue, south
of Read Street was approximately 7,800 vehicles per day and 4,600 on Read
Street west of Riverside Avenue. The data displayed in Table 1 includes the 85th
percentile speed; the speed at or below which 85 percent of vehicles travel and
is typically used to determine a roadway's posted speed limit.

Table 1:
Existing Traffic Count Data

             LOCATION                     Direction        ADT        85th Percentile Speed
        BRAYTON AVENUE                       NB            3,777             37 MPH
       South of Read Street                  SB            3,980             38MPH
            READ STREET                      EB            2,364             39 MPH
      West of Riverside Avenue               WB            2,212             37 MPH

A turning movement count (TMC) was also conducted at the intersection during
both the AM and PM peak hours to determine Level of Service (LOS). The peak
hour is the time in which the highest volume of traffic is recorded and tends
to occur during commuting times. The Level of Service (LOS) determines the
severity of congestion at an intersection. Six categories are used to determine a
locations' LOS, ranging from A to F; A representing the best operating conditions
and F representing the worst. For planning purposes, LOS A thru C is considered
acceptable while LOS D indicates traffic flow is worsening and LOS E and LOS F
are considered unacceptable.

The intersection's traffic signal permit indicates that it was originally installed
with a two phase full actuation signal system with pedestrian push buttons
included. Loop detectors are embedded in the pavement but were not triggered
during the analysis period. Currently the intersection is operating as a pretimed
two phase system. The total cycle length during the analysis period was 70
seconds. The northbound and southbound phase consisted of 30 seconds of
green time, 4 seconds of yellow and 1 second for the all red phase to clear the
intersection. The eastbound and westbound phase consisted of 30 seconds of
green time, 4 seconds of yellow and 1 second for the all red phase. There is no
right turn on red restrictions.

The AM peak hour, which occurred from 7:30 to 8:30 AM, resulted in a total
volume of 928 vehicles. A detailed analysis of this intersection was conducted
using techniques defined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Synchro
software was used to perform these calculations and reported a LOS B with an
average delay of 16.2 seconds per vehicle. The PM peak hour, which occurred
from 4:30 to 5:30 PM, resulted in a total volume of 1,335 vehicles and reported
a LOS C with an average delay of 20.8 seconds per vehicle.

Vehicle Crash Data

                          Crash reports were provided by the Somerset Police Department for the 3 year
                          period of 2010 to 2012. During this period, a total of 14 crashes occurred at the
                          intersection. Five of these were injury crashes, the remaining 10 were property
                          damage only. Of the 14 crashes, 4 were right angle crashes; 2 were thru vs. left;
                          8 were rear-end crashes (one involving 3 vehicles) and 1 was a head on collision.
                          Four of the reported crashes occurred due to a motorist running a red light.
                          The numerous rear-end crashes may also be a sign of an issue in regards to the
                          existing signal operation and may be influencing the motorists in running red
                          lights. Figure 5 displays these crashes.




Figure 5: Crash Diagram
                          To determine if there is a significant crash problem at the intersection, the
                          Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO) and the Accidents per Million Entering
                          Vehicles (ACC/MEV) crash rates were used.

                          Using an EPDO index allows intersections to be ranked based on the severity of
                          collisions. A point system is applied to the crashes based on the severity of the
                          crash (property damage only, personal injury, or where a fatality occurred). An
                          EPDO rate exceeding 17.7 (the regional average) is considered unacceptable
                          in the SRPEDD area. Calculations indicate that the EPDO crash rate for the
                          intersection is 11.8 which is considered acceptable as it is below the regional
                          average.

                          ACC/MEV is a calculated crash rate that compares vehicle crashes to the volume
                          of traffic at a given intersection. Where locations have higher crash rates, it is
                          considered to have greater danger. It provides a comparison of intersections
                          with different traffic characteristics, ultimately providing a probability of being in
                          a collision at a given intersection; the higher the rate, the greater the danger. An
                          ACC/MEV crash rate exceeding 0.77 is considered unacceptable in the SRPEDD
                          region. Calculations indicate that the ACC/MEV crash rate for the intersection

         6                             Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District
is 1.03, which exceeds the regional average and identifies this intersection as a
safety problem. The calculated rates and regional average rates are displayed in
Table 2. Although most of the accidents tend to be minor collisions, there are
still too many accidents occurring at the intersection.

  Bicycle Accommodations

Bicycle accommodations have been proposed for all approaches to this
intersection, with the northbound and eastbound approaches included as part
of the South Coast Bikeway. The proposed South Coast Bikeway will be a 50-mile
continuous system of multi-use paths and bike lanes that will connect Rhode
Island to Cape Cod. As shown in Figure 6, the intersection's eastbound path on
Read Street will connect to the existing on-road path on Elm Street in Swansea.
The northbound path on Brayton Avenue will connect to the Pvt. Michael E.
Bouthot Memorial Bike Path along the Veteran's Memorial Bridge on Route
6 in Somerset. The Pvt. Michael E. Bouthot Memorial Bike Path will connect
the South Coast Bikeway to the proposed Taunton River Trail. The westbound
approach on Brayton Avenue will also connect the South Coast Bikeway to the
proposed Taunton River Trail.

Traffic Volume data (Future Volumes and Operations)

                                  Future traffic volumes for this intersection were projected to the year 2035 and
                                  were evaluated using Synchro. Compared to the Existing PM peak hour, the
                                  projected volume increases from 1,335 to 1,507. The analysis for the year 2035
                                  volumes results in a LOS C for the existing conditions with an average delay
                                  of 28.8 seconds per vehicle. Besides the existing conditions, three separate
                                  scenarios were analyzed during the PM peak hour for the existing and future
                                  traffic volumes. Scenario one includes a protected phase for eastbound and
                                  westbound left turns. Scenario two includes both permitted and protected
                                  phases for eastbound and westbound left turns. Scenario three used a fully
                                  actuated signal operation which was the original design indicated in the permit.
                                  LOS and delays for the existing and projected scenarios are displayed in Table 3.
                                  Based on this analysis, changes to this intersection's traffic signal along with an
                                  exclusive left turn will affect the existing operation, but it is expected to maintain
                                  an acceptable level of operation in the future.

Conclusions and Recommendations
                                   Full Actuation Signal

                                   Of the three alternate scenarios, the greatest improvement to the intersection's
                                   operation was that of a fully actuated signal under the existing geometric
                                   conditions. For the analysis of the fully actuated signal, the intersection's delay
                                   decreased by about 5 seconds for the current volume and about 6 seconds
                                   for the projected volume when compared to the existing pretimed signal
                                   configuration. The LOS also improved from C to B when compared to current
                                   volume. In comparison to the scenarios with the exclusive left turn, the existing
                                   geometric conditions with a fully actuated signal had a greater improvement. In
                                   order to allow the intersection to properly function, optimizing the signals timing
                                   may be required in order to achieve the best results. Since the intersection
                                   originally operated with a fully actuated signal system as indicated in the signal
                                   permit, repairing and/or reconnecting the loop detectors is required assuming
                                   that they are still embedded in the pavement.

                                   Exclusive Left Turn Lanes

                                   When looking at the other scenarios, implementing a protected left lane and
                                   phase in the signal system on Read Street will increase the average vehicle delay.
                                   However, when implementing a permitted and protected left phase, the

      8                                         Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District
 intersection's average vehicle delay and LOS improve. If a decision is made to
proceed with an exclusive left turn lane, the intersection's dimensions should be
taken into account. The current road width at Read Street is 35 feet. In order to
include an exclusive left turn lane at the eastbound and westbound approach, a
sufficient surface width is required. The lane width for an urban minor arterial
road can span from 10 to 12 feet. The eastbound and westbound surface width
would require a minimum of 30 feet for these improvements. This would allow a
lane for through traffic in each direction as well as an exclusive left storage lane
at the intersection.

With the proposed South Coast Bikeway included at the eastbound approach
and the connection to the Taunton River Trail at the westbound approach,
additional road surface width to accommodate bike lanes is required. The lane
width for a bicycle path can range from 4 to 7 feet depending on the roadway
conditions and constraints. For this intersection, a bike lane width of 5 feet
is recommended due to curbing and higher volumes of traffic. In order to
implement both the exclusive left turn lane and the bike path, a minimum
of 40 feet is required. There is currently not enough space to include all the
design recommendations. With no change to the current roadway layout on the
eastbound and westbound approaches, the road could accommodate either a
bike path or an exclusive left turn lane, but not both.

Signal Timing

The present yellow interval is 4 seconds on all approaches. Based on ITE
clearance formula calculations the yellow interval should be 3.5 seconds on all
approaches. The present all-red interval is 1 second for all approaches. Based
on the ITE clearance formula, the present calculation for the all red interval is
inadequate and should be increased. A table of the existing and revised intervals
is displayed in Table 4.

It is important to provide proper timing of clearance intervals to allow for
efficient traffic flow and safety. Clearance intervals that are too short create a
dilemma for left turning motorists, trapping them in the path of opposing traffic
and preventing them from stopping or proceeding safely. Clearance intervals
that are too long create the illusion that a motorist has more time to clear
the intersection and encourage motorists to proceed through the intersection
instead of stopping. A solid yellow signal denotes "You must stop if it is safe".
Unfortunately, many motorists choose to increase their speed to avoid having to
wait for the next green phase.

                                        Consideration should be given to adjusting the yellow and all-red intervals to
                                        provide proper timings according to appropriate engineering standards. Proper
                                        timings are essential to intersection safety and will assist in reducing the danger
                                        of both angle and rear-end crashes. Additional analysis should be conducted by
                                        a registered engineer to calculate appropriate adjustments before any changes
                                        are made to the signal system.

                                        Pavement, Pavement Markings and Curb Ramps

                                        In order to insure safety at the intersection, pavement markings and signage
                                        are required throughout the intersection. New curb ramps should be included
                                        to adhere to ADA requirements as well as realigning the crosswalks to the curb
                                        ramps at each approach. Figure 7 displays the current state of the crosswalk
                                        and curb ramps. Figure 8 and 9 on the next page are two acceptable designs
                                        provided on the Federal Highway Administration website for crosswalk
                                        pavement markings including curb ramps. The current pavement conditions near
                                        the curb ramps should also be taken into consideration. The cracks and uneven
                                        pavement may become a safety concern at the intersection for pedestrians,
                                        bicycles and wheel chairs.

The intersection is eligible for federal funding and therefore, improvements
could be funded through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) using a
variety of sources, including:

         · Surface Transportation Funds
         · Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Funds for
           projects that demonstrate an air quality improvement
         · Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) for projects that
           demonstrate the potential for reduction in crashes

The town should consult SRPEDD's Transportation Project Funding Guide for
further guidance on funding sources and project development using the
Transportation Improvement Program. Utilizing TIP funds requires design
approval and project oversight by MassDOT. The town also has the option of
using Chapter 90 funds to implement the recommended improvements,
allowing for the greatest flexibility of implementation. Somerset will need to
commit to the redesign and replacement of the signal system that will address
both traffic and pedestrian/bicyclists needs.

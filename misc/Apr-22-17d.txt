SUBJECT:            Vidler Avenue at Kerr Avenue Traffic Control Study
                    Community of Erieau


RECOMMENDATIONS

It is recommended that:

1.    A Stop sign be installed on Kerr Avenue at Vidler Avenue in the Community of
      Erieau to create an All-Way Stop control at the intersection.

2.    The flashing red beacon be removed from the westbound Stop sign on Vidler
      Avenue at Kerr Avenue in the Community of Erieau.

3.    Nichols Avenue be designated a northbound One Way highway between
      Mariners Road (Northerly junction) and Ross Lane in the Community of Erieau.

4.    Chatham-Kent Traffic and Parking By-law 245-2004 be amended to:

      a)     Account for recommendations 1 and 3,
      b)     Replace the eastbound Yield sign control designation at the intersection of
             Mariners Road and Nichols Avenue (northerly junction) with an All-Way
             Stop control designation,
      c)     Add the northbound Stop sign designation at the intersection of Mariners
             Road and Nichols Avenue (southerly junction),
      d)     Remove the intersection of Post Point Lane and Powell Lane from the
             Yield Sign Schedule.

BACKGROUND

The Engineering and Transportation Division received a request from Council and
residents of the Community of Erieau to determine if a Stop sign control is required on
Kerr Avenue at Vidler Avenue. The addition of a Stop sign on Kerr Avenue would

create an All-Way stop condition at the intersection.

COMMENTS

Study Location

The intersection of Vidler Avenue and Kerr Avenue in the Community of Erieau is a
multi-leg type (greater than four legs) intersection. Nichols Avenue, Stass Lane, and
Ross Lane also form part of the intersection and were therefore included in the All-Way
Stop study. The intersection has an approximately 15 m offset between the north and
south legs plus an approximately 40 degree intersect angle between Kerr Avenue and
Vidler Avenue. Figure 1 illustrates the geometric alignment of the intersection.




          Figure 1 ­ Intersection Alignment with Existing and Proposed Traffic Controls


As shown in Figure 1, the current traffic control at the intersection consists of a
northbound stop sign on Nichols Avenue, a southbound stop sign on Stass Lane, and a
westbound stop sign on Vidler Avenue. A flashing red beacon is mounted above the
westbound stop sign. Ross Lane is designated as a One Way highway in the
Vidler Avenue at Kerr Avenue Traffic Control Study, Community of Erieau                     3

westbound direction and therefore does not require a stop or yield sign. Street lights
are installed to provide illumination at the intersection.

Intersection no parking zones are established on the north side of Vidler Avenue up to
approximately 45 m east of the intersection. Angle parking spaces are located within
the intersection on the south side of Vidler Avenue just east of Nichols Avenue and the
north side of Ross Lane just west of the Kerr Avenue. The angle parking spaces are
located primarily on private property.

All roadways in Erieau have a posted speed limit of 50 km/h. In addition, heavy
vehicles are prohibited on all roadways in Erieau except for the purpose of driving to or
from a delivery destination or base of operation. Heavy vehicles typically use Mariners
Road, Nichols Avenue, Ross Lane, and Vidler Avenue to service Erieau businesses.

Sidewalks enter the intersection on both sides of Nichols Avenue and the north side of
Kerr Avenue. Nichols Avenue and Ross Lane have asphalt surfaces while Vidler
Avenue, Kerr Avenue, and Stass Lane have an asphalt "tar and chip" surface treatment.

A seasonal CK Transit inter-urban bus operates through the intersection from June to
September. A bus stop is located on Mariners Road just west of Nichols Avenue.

Land development near the intersection consists of residential properties, retail
businesses, and restaurants. A variety store is located on the southeast corner of the
intersection and a new brewery and restaurant business was recently opened on the
northwest corner of the intersection. To the east of the intersection there are marine
docking facilities, a fishery operation, and additional retail business. To the south there
are seasonal recreation facilities, marine docking facilities, and a fishery operation.

Traffic Data

A turning movement traffic count was completed at the intersection of Vidler Avenue
and Kerr Avenue on Friday, October 19, 2012. For simplicity, all Stass Lane traffic was
recorded as Vidler Avenue traffic. Details of the traffic count data are shown in
Appendix A.

The traffic count data indicates that the Nichols Avenue approach provides
approximately 55% of the total intersection traffic vehicle volume. The remaining
vehicle traffic volume is split between Vidler Avenue and Kerr Avenue at 27% and 18%,
respectively.

Collision data for the intersection was obtained from Engineering and Transportation
Division records. Over the five year period from January 1, 2007 to December 31,
2011, one rear-end type collision with reported no injuries occurred in August 2008.

All-Way Stop Warrant

The method used to evaluate the need for an All-way Stop traffic control device at the
intersection of Vidler Avenue and Kerr Avenue is based on the Ontario Traffic Manual
(Book 5: Regulatory Signs) All-Way Stop Warrant for major roads. Vehicle and
pedestrian traffic volumes and collision data are required for the All-Way Stop Warrant
analysis.

Only collision types that are considered correctable by implementing an All-Way Stop
traffic control are applied to the warrant. Applicable types include right angle and
turning movement collisions. Non-applicable types include approaching, rear-end,
sideswipe, and single motor vehicle collisions.

The All-Way Stop Warrant consists of a Minimum Volume warrant and a Collision
warrant. An All-Way stop is considered justified if either warrant is met. The results of
the All-Way Stop Warrant analysis are shown in Appendix B and summarized in Table
1.

Based on the All-way Stop Warrant analysis completed for the intersection of Vidler
Avenue and Kerr Avenue, an All-Way Stop control is not warranted.

General Discussion

The current traffic control at the intersection provides a free flow condition on Kerr
Avenue and a controlled (Stop sign) condition on Vidler Avenue. The traffic volume split
between Vidler Avenue and Kerr Avenue suggests that Vidler Avenue is the major
Vidler Avenue at Kerr Avenue Traffic Control Study, Community of Erieau                        5

roadway. As the major roadway, Vidler Avenue would typically have the free flow
condition and therefore Kerr Avenue would be the controlled roadway.

A row of cedar trees are located on private property along the north side of Vidler
Avenue east of the intersection. This sight obstruction plus the approach angle of Kerr
Avenue as it intersects Vidler Avenue limits the sight distance for southbound motorists
on Kerr Avenue and Stass Lane. The sight distance along Vidler Avenue to the east of
Kerr Avenue is approximately 52 meters, which is below the minimum safe stopping
distance for a 50 km/h roadway.

The geometric alignment of the intersection and the location of angle parking spaces
within the intersection create multiple potential conflict points that demand motorist
attention. An All-Way Stop will help provide motorists entering the intersection or
parking inside the intersection with additional decision time to avoid a potential conflict.

The westbound stop sign is currently enhanced by a flashing red beacon. According to
the Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM), flashing beacons are typically installed when
horizontal or vertical alignment conditions limit visibility of the stop sign. Flashing
beacons may also be considered when greater emphasis of the stop condition is
required due to a frequency of collisions caused by failure to obey the traffic control or
failure to yield right of way. The OTM also warns that overuse of flashing beacons can
cause a reduction in their overall impact and can also turn them into a driver distraction.
The conditions that would typically warrant a flashing red beacon are not present on
Vidler Avenue.

Regulatory sign deficiencies were observed at the intersection of Vidler Avenue and
Kerr Avenue and area while completing this study. At the intersection of Nichols
Avenue at Ross Lane "One-Way" signs are required to properly inform motorists of the
northbound one-way traffic designation on Nichols Avenue. At the intersection of
Mariners Road at Nichols Avenue (northerly junction) "One-Way" signs are required to
properly inform motorists of the eastbound one-way traffic designation on Mariners
Road. In addition, the traffic control at this intersection is an all-way stop and therefore
supplementary "All-Way" signs must be installed below each stop sign.

By-law Amendments

Chatham-Kent Traffic and Parking By-law 245-2004 was reviewed in preparation of this
report and several errors were identified for the Community of Erieau. The by-law
schedules incorrectly list yield signs at the intersection of Mariners Road and Nichols
Avenue (northerly junction) and Nichols Avenue and Ross Lane. The yield signs were
replaced by an All-Way Stop at Mariners Road and Nichols Avenue (northerly junction)
and a northbound Stop Sign at Nichols Avenue and Ross Lane when both intersections
were reconstructed approximately ten years ago. Also, the northbound One-Way
highway designation for Nichols Avenue between Mariners Road (northerly junction)
and Ross Lane is omitted from the by-law schedule.
Vidler Avenue at Kerr Avenue Traffic Control Study, Community of Erieau                  6

Additional by-law errors were found for other Erieau intersections located near the study
area. A northbound Stop Sign installed the intersection of Mariners Road (southerly
junction) and Nichols Avenue is omitted from the Stop Sign schedule. Also, a
northbound yield sign is listed in the schedule as being at Point Post Lane and Stevens
Lane and at Post Point Lane and Powell Lane, which is the same intersection. This
duplication will be removed from the Yield Sign schedule. Each by-law correction has
been included in the amendment by-law (see Appendix C) as part of a housekeeping
exercise.

Conclusion

The current traffic volume and collision history at the intersection of Vidler Avenue and
Kerr Avenue do not warrant the installation of an All-Way Stop control. However, a Stop
sign on Kerr Avenue is recommended and the removal of the Stop sign on Vidler
Avenue is not recommended due to the sight obstructions near the intersection, the
geometric alignment of the intersection, and angle parking located within the
intersection. The result is a recommendation for an All-way Stop control at the
intersection.

The flashing red beacon currently installed on the westbound stop sign on Vidler
Avenue is not required due to a lack of horizontal or vertical alignment issues while
approaching the stop sign or collision history to justify the beacon. The implementation
of a higher level of traffic control at the intersection provides an opportunity to remove
the flashing red beacon as a cost saving exercise.

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS

The cost to implement the recommendations in this report is estimated to be $1,500 in
total. This includes:

        Installation of a Stop sign on Kerr Avenue and Vidler Avenue and other signs for
        new All-Way Stop control at the intersection.
        Installation of One Way signs at Nichols Avenue and Ross Lane, and Mariners
        Road and Nichols Avenue
        Removal of flashing red beacon from westbound stop sign on Vidler Avenue

The cost of these items will be funded through the Public Works Division base budget
for Signs and Markings and the Engineering and Transportation Division base budget
for Traffic Signal Maintenance. The cost associated with the removal of the flashing red
beacon is expected to be recovered in time by eliminating the yearly preventive
maintenance, unplanned maintenance, and electrical power costs plus any costs for
future upgrades to the beacon (i.e. LED lamp conversion).

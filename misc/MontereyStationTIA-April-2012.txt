Project Description

Mountain Pacific, Inc. (MPI) has been retained by the Applied Planning, Inc., to perform a
traffic impact analysis (TIA) as an element of the environmental document being prepared for
the proposed Monterey Station Residential Project (hereinafter referred to as the
"Project") in the City of Pomona. The Project will be implemented on a rectangular-shaped,
approximately 6.75-acre site located between Garey Avenue and Gibbs Street and between
Monterey Avenue and the United Pacific Railroad lines, which serve Metrolink and Amtrak in
addition to freight trains, on the south. The Project site, which is partially occupied with
miscellaneous commercial land uses also includes Commercial Street, an east-west local
street which cul-de-sacs just east of Garey Avenue, and which will be vacated as part of this
Project.

The Project is within the Downtown Pomona Specific Plan, and is consistent with its
guidelines and requirements. The downtown has been designated as a Pedestrian Oriented
District (POD). The Project will allow for maximum utilization of all modes of travel due to
its location within the downtown and proximity to the Pomona TransCenter, the
Downtown Pomona transit station serving bus and rail transit.

The site is proposed to be developed with up to 311 apartments and 38 live work units.
Access to the Project will be from Locust Street and Gibbs Street. The Project will generate
142 net new trips (32 inbound, 110 outbound) during the morning peak hour of analysis, and
176 new trips (111 inbound, 65 outbound) during the evening peak hour of analysis and
1,838 trips over a typical weekday.

Traffic Analysis Methodology

Discussions were held with the City of Pomona to identify the scope of the Traffic Impact
Analysis. (The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the Traffic Impact Analysis
(TIA) is provided in Appendix A to this report.) Nine (9) study intersections were identified for
analysis by the City under the following conditions:

     ·     Existing traffic conditions;
     ·     Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background No-Project traffic conditions; and
     ·     Opening Year (2013) Cumulative With-Project traffic conditions

April 2012                                                  Traffic Impact Analysis ­ Monterey Residential Project
 Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background No-Project traffic conditions include an
 ambient traffic growth of 2 percent annually as well as traffic generated by cumulative or
 "related" projects that could affect the study intersections. Some of these cumulative
 projects may not be completed or fully occupied by Project Opening Year (2013); hence, the
 analysis presented herein should be considered "worst-case".

 Based on the MOU, Level-of-service (LOS) analysis was conducted using the Highway
 Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology. City of Pomona's criteria to determine traffic
 impacts and deficiencies are as follows:

            ·       When the LOS without development is LOS A, B, C and D, the minimum
                    acceptable projected LOS shall be LOS D.

            ·       When the LOS without development is LOS E or F, the minimum
                    acceptable projected LOS shall be equal to the LOS without development.

 At locations where the Project is determined to have a significant impact based on the
 aforementioned criteria, mitigation measures to improve operating conditions to the
 minimum acceptable projected LOS levels were to be identified.

 The potential for this Project to have impacts on the Los Angeles County Congestion
 Management Program (CMP) was also evaluated in accordance with thresholds of
 significance established by the CMP.

 Analysis Results

 Existing Conditions

 All intersections currently operate acceptably (LOS D or better) during the morning and
 evening peak- hour periods.
 Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background No-Project Conditions

 All intersections currently operate acceptably (LOS D or better) during the morning and
 evening peak- hour periods under the Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background No-
 Project Conditions.

 Opening Year (2013) Cumulative With-Project Conditions

 All intersections currently operate acceptably (LOS D or better) during the morning and
 evening peak- hour periods under the Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background With-
 Project Conditions. Therefore, the Project was found to have no significant adverse impacts
 and no mitigation measures were identified at study intersections.

 Congestion Management Program

 Based on the CMP thresholds for analysis, the Project would not create significant increases in
 peak-hour traffic on the CMP roadway network and hence there would be no adverse
 traffic impacts created by this Project on the CMP network.

 On-Site Circulation and Access

 The proposed Project site plan was reviewed to ensure adequate circulation to, from and
 through the Project. The Project will be accessed from Monterey Avenue via Locust Street
 and from Gibbs Street. On-street parking will be provided on Locust Street (proposed to be
 vacated), on Gibbs Street and in a surface parking lot south of the apartment complex.

        Operational Analyses at Project access points (Locust Street and Gibbs Street) on
          Monterey Avenue:

             o Both intersections are unsignalized and will operate at LOS C or better under
                 STOP-sign control on the minor street (Gibbs Street and Locust Street)
                 approaches;
             o Traffic signal warrant studies showed that the satisfaction of the peak-hour
                 warrant was not achieved at either location;
             o The two-way center left-turn lane along Monterey should be designated a left-
                 turn turn lane at the approaches to Gibbs Street and Locust Street;
             o Locust Street will have direct Project access and should have one lane
                 inbound (southbound) and one lane outbound (northbound);
             o Gibbs Street should have one lane southbound and one lane northbound;
             o Separate right-turn lanes are not warranted at either intersection;
             o The implementation of the Project will not create back-ups on the public road
              network.

        · On-Site Circulation:

                o Aisle widths of 25 feet are appropriate for internal circulation and access
                   to/from and through the parking lot;
                o Curb radii are designed per the City of Pomona standards, with minimum 25- foot
                   curb radii at Monterey and Gibbs Streets.

 Other Operational Issues

            ·    The need for a traffic signal was reviewed at the intersection of Monterey Avenue
                ­ Palomares Street. A traffic signal is not warranted and the intersection will
                continue to operate acceptably (LOS B) under All-Way STOP-sign traffic control
                with Project implementation.

        ·     An analysis of traffic signal phasing at signalized study intersections which currently
             have permissive left-turn phasing indicates that those intersections will continue to
             operate efficiently and hence no changes to traffic signal operations are
             recommended with implementation of this Project.

        ·     The surrounding pedestrian street network will accommodate the Project which will
             provide sidewalks along Monterey Street as part of improving this street to
             Collector-street standards per requirements of the City of Pomona.

        ·     While not on City of Pomona's Bicycle Network, Monterey Avenue is wide enough
             to accommodate bicycle travel within the pavement width, and the Project provides
             bicycle storage facilities.

        ·      The addition of Project and cumulative traffic volumes will not change the lane
             requirements on Monterey Avenue or Gibbs Street, and on-street parking should
             continue to be provided consistent with the goals of the Downtown Specific Plan.



Findings

Based on the City of Pomona standards and thresholds of significance, as well as the CMP
thresholds of significance, this Project will not create adverse traffic impacts on the public
roadway system and no off-site mitigation needs to be implemented.

The Project should improve Monterey Avenue and Gibbs Street to the City of Pomona
design standards. The intersections of Monterey Avenue ­ Locust Street and Monterey
Avenue ­ Gibbs Street should be fully-directional and STOP-sign controlled on the Locust
Street and Gibbs Street approaches. On-street and off-street parking should satisfy the

STUDY SCOPE AND PROCEDURES
To make a thorough evaluation of the proposed development with respect to circulation-
related elements, the following analysis steps were undertaken:

1. Project Initiation ­Discussions were held with the City of Pomona to understand the
   scope of analysis for this Project; determine locations of study intersections; specify
   level-of-service analysis methodology; and identify ambient traffic growth as well as
   approved and/or planned projects (cumulative or "related" projects), which would be
   considered as part of the cumulative development setting in the Opening Year (2013).
   The Memorandum of Understanding for the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) is provided
   in Appendix A to this report.

2. Collection of Data ­ The Project-related date including the site plan was provided by the
   Project Applicant (REALM). Relevant transportation-related documents were obtained
   from the City of Pomona. Intersection turning movement and pedestrian counts were
   collected in February 2012 by Counts Unlimited, Inc., a subconsultant to MPI.

3. Analysis of Existing Conditions ­ Level of service calculations were performed at nine
   (9) study intersections for the morning and evening peak hours utilizing the Highway
   Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology, as requested by the city.

4. Project Traffic Generation ­ Estimates of Project-related traffic volumes were made.
   These estimates were based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip
   Generation, 8th Edition. Consideration was given to this Project's location within the
   downtown and its proximity to the transit station.

5. Project Traffic Distribution and Assignment ­ Based upon directional distribution
   developed for the Project site, Project-generated traffic was assigned to the study
   intersections and roadways.

6. Analysis of Opening Year Cumulative Background (No-Project) Traffic Conditions ­
   Cumulative Background traffic conditions were determined by first adding an ambient
   traffic growth of 2 percent per year through year 2013 and then adding traffic generated
   by other development projects either approved or anticipated in the area, as identified by
   the City of Pomona (known as cumulative or "related" projects), which could add traffic
   to the roadway system in Opening Year (2013). Level of service calculations were
   performed at the nine (9) study intersections for the morning and evening peak hours to
   determine the Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background No-Project traffic
   conditions.




                                          Page 4
7. Analysis of Opening Year Cumulative With-Project Traffic Conditions ­ To determine
   Opening Year (2013) Cumulative With-Project traffic volumes, traffic volumes
   generated by existing land uses within the Project site that access via Locust Street were
   first subtracted from the Cumulative Background No-Project traffic volumes and Project
   traffic volumes were then added. Level of service calculations were performed at the
   nine (9) study intersections for the morning and evening peak hours to determine the
   Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background With-Project traffic conditions.

8. Traffic Impact Analyses ­ Traffic conditions with and without the Project were
   compared to determine whether, based on City of Pomona definitions of significance,
   adverse traffic impacts would be created by the Project.

9. Congestion Management Program (CMP) ­ The potential impacts on the Los Angeles
   County Congestion Management Program (CMP) system were analyzed in accordance
   to Los Angeles County CMP guidelines.

10. On-Site Circulation and Access ­ The Project site plan was reviewed to determine the
    adequacy of on-site circulation and access.

11. Summary and Recommendations ­ Recommendations to mitigate any significant
    Project-related impacts were formulated based upon the results of the above-described
    analyses.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
ROADWAY SYSTEM
The major factors affecting the Project site are its location and the efficiency of the serving
roadway system. Efficiency of access is a function of travel time, convenience, directness
and available capacity of the routes utilized in accessing the development.

Regional access to the Project site is provided by Interstate 10 (San Bernardino Freeway)
which is approximately two miles north of the Project site. This ten-lane freeway facility
(which includes two High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes) generally exists in an east-west
orientation and interchanges with State Route 57 (SR-57to the west and with Interstate 15
(I-15) to the east. This is a major freeway facility which links Los Angeles County with San
Bernardino County.

Following is a description of the roadways serving the Project site:

Garey Avenue ­ Garey Avenue is a north-south street which borders the Project site to the
west. It is designated as a Minor Arterial on the City of Pomona General Plan. In the
Project vicinity, except between Monterey Avenue and 2nd Street, Garey Avenue has four
travel lanes and a painted median which serves as a left-turn lane at key intersections.
Between Monterey Avenue and 2nd Street, there is a raised median. The posted speed limits
on Garey Avenue are: 30 miles per hour (mph) between Holt Avenue and Mission
Boulevard and 35 mph north of Holt Avenue. On-street parking is permitted between
Mission Boulevard and Holt Avenue.




                                           Page 6
Monterey Avenue ­ Monterey Avenue borders the site to the north and will provide access
to the Project site via Locust and Gibbs Streets. Monterey Avenue runs in an east-west
direction and has two travel lanes and a center left-turn lane. It is designated as a Collector
street on the City of Pomona Genera Plan. Parking is allowed on both sides of the street and
the speed limit is 35 mph.

Gibbs Street ­ Gibbs Street is a local street which borders the site to the east. It will provide
direct access to the Project. Gibbs Street runs in a north-south direction and has two travel
lanes. Parking is allowed on both sides of the street and the speed limit is 25 mph.

Palomares Street ­ Palomares runs in a north-south alignment to the east of the Project site.
Palomares Street is designated as a Collector street on the City of Pomona General Plan and
has two travel lanes. Parking is allowed on both sides of the street and the speed limit is 25
mph.

Holt Avenue ­ Holt Avenue is an east-west roadway to the north of the Project. It is
designated as a Major Highway on the City of Pomona General Plan. In the Project vicinity,
Holt Avenue has four travel lanes and a painted median which serves as a left-turn lane at
key intersections. The posted speed limit on Holt Avenue is 35 miles per hour (mph). On-
street parking is permitted on Holt Avenue.

Towne Avenue ­ Towne Avenue is a north-south roadway east of the Project. It is
designated as a Major Highway on the City of Pomona General Plan. In the Project vicinity,
Towne Avenue has four travel lanes and a painted median which serves as a left-turn lane at
key intersections, except between Monterey Avenue and 2nd Street, where there is a raised
median. In areas to the north of Holt Avenue and to the south of Monterey Avenue, a raised
median exists along Towne Avenue. The posted speed limit on Towne Avenue is 40 mph
and on-street parking is permitted in the Project vicinity.

Commercial Street ­ Commercial Street is a local two-lane east-west street which bisects
the Project site from Gibbs Street to its cul-de-sac terminus just east of Garey Avenue. It
provides access to existing land uses on the Project site which will be replaced by the
Project with its implementation. Commercial Street will be vacated as part of the Project.

Locust Street ­ Locust Street is a local two-lane north-south street which runs between
Monterey Avenue and Commercial Street. Locust Street will provide access to the Project
from Monterey Avenue. Locust Street will be vacated as part of the Project.

EXISTING LEVELS OF SERVICE

LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS

"Level of service" is a term which denotes any of an infinite number of combinations of
traffic operating conditions that may occur on a given travel lane or at a given intersection
when it is subjected to various traffic volumes. The current technical guide to the evaluation
of traffic operations is the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The HCM defines "Level of
Service" as a quantitative measure which describes operational conditions within a traffic
stream, generally in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver,
traffic interruptions, comfort and convenience, and safety. Level of service (LOS) is a
measure of "quality-of-flow." There are six levels of service, A through F, which relate to
traffic congestion from best to worst, respectively.

In general, Level A represents free-flow conditions with no congestion. Conversely, Level
F represents severe congestion with stop-and-go conditions. Level F typically is considered
to be unsatisfactory. The criteria used to evaluate LOS conditions vary based on the type of
roadway and whether the traffic flow is considered interrupted or uninterrupted. Table 1
shows the definition of LOS for uninterrupted flow (flow unrestrained by the existence of
traffic control devices). Uninterrupted flow is generally found only on limited-access
facilities (freeways) in urban areas.

                 A        Represents free flow. Individual vehicles are virtually       0.00 to 0.60
                          unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream.

                 B        Is in the range of stable flow, but the presence of other     0.61 to 0.70
                          vehicles in the traffic stream begins to be noticeable.
                          Freedom to select desired speeds is relatively unaffected,
                          but there is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver.

                 C        Is in the range of stable flow, but marks the beginning of    0.71 to 0.80
                          the range of flow in which the operation of individual
                          vehicles becomes significantly affected by interactions
                          with other vehicles in the traffic stream.

                 D        Is a crowded segment of roadway with a large number of        0.81 to 0.90
                          vehicles restricting mobility and a stable flow. Speed
                          and freedom to maneuver are severely restricted, and the
                          driver experiences a generally poor level of comfort and
                          convenience.

                 E        Represents operating conditions at or near the level          0.91 to 1.00
                          capacity. All speeds are reduced to a low, but relatively
                          uniform value. Small increases in flow will cause
                          breakdown in traffic movement.

                 F        Is used to define forced or breakdown flow (stop-and-go          Not
                          gridlock). This condition exists when the amount of           Meaningful
                          traffic approaches a point that exceeds the amount that
                          can travel to a destination. Operations within the queues
                          are characterized by stop and go waves, and they are
                          extremely unstable.

The definitions of LOS for interrupted traffic flow (flow restrained by the existence of
traffic signals and other traffic control devices) differ slightly depending on the type of
control. The LOS is dependent on the quality of flow at the intersections along a roadway.
The HCM methodologies express the LOS at an intersection in terms of delay time for the
various intersection approaches and for the intersection as a whole. The HCM uses different
procedures depending on the type of intersection control. The LOS's determined in this
study are calculated using the HCM methodology.

The TRAFFIX software was employed as the analysis tool in this study, using the HCM
intersection analysis procedures.     Per the scoping discussions and as documented in
Appendix A (Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) for the Monterey Station Residential Project,
Pomona, California, Memorandum of Understanding), the parameters for the LOS analyses
(including the base saturation flow rate of 1800 passenger cars per hour per lane (pc/hr/ln)
for through lanes and 1700 pc/hr/ln for exclusive lefts, lane widths of 12 feet, 2 second lost
time per phase, and 2% heavy vehicle (bus/truck) composition) were used for determination
of LOS's at study intersections. The optimized solution is provided for all scenarios to
determine relative differences in delays and levels of service. The peak-hour factor (PHF)
for each study intersection was determined based on field counts and was applied to the
peak-hour volumes for the Existing and Opening Year (2013) scenarios.

Average stopped delay per vehicle was used to determine the LOS at study intersections.
The operations module in the HCS was used for the signalized locations. The study area
intersections which are currently STOP-sign controlled on the minor street only or have
STOP-signs in all directions have been analyzed using the unsignalized intersection and the
all-way-STOP-controlled (AWSC) methodologies, respectively of the HCM.

The LOS for intersections is defined in terms of average vehicle delay for the intersection,
as shown on Table 2.

TRAFFIC IMPACT SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

The impact of a development project in the City of Pomona is determined by comparing, at
each study intersection, the levels of service (LOS) during the Project completion year (in
this case, Opening Year (2013)) assuming that the Project was implemented versus the
levels of service in the same year assuming that the Project was not implemented.
Following this comparison, the need for site-specific or cumulative local-area traffic
improvements can be determined.

City of Pomona's criteria to determine traffic impacts and deficiencies are as follows:

   ·   When the LOS without development is LOS A, B, C and D, the minimum acceptable
       projected LOS shall be LOS D.
   ·   When the LOS without development is LOS E or F, the minimum acceptable
       projected LOS shall be equal to the LOS without development.

At locations where the Project is determined to have a significant impact based on the
aforementioned criteria, mitigation measures to improve operating conditions to the
minimum acceptable projected LOS levels will be identified.

       EXISTING LEVELS OF SERVICE

       Intersection Levels of Service

       The analysis of existing intersection levels of service (LOS) was based on peak-hour traffic
       volumes illustrated on Figure 5 (factored to reflect 2% heavy vehicles and PHF) and the
       existing intersection geometrics shown on Figure 4. Table 3 summarizes the levels of
       service at study intersections during the weekday morning and evening peak hours.
       Appendix C provides the existing level-of-service worksheets.

       As can be seen from Table 3, all intersections operate acceptably (LOS D or better) during
       the morning and evening peak- hour periods.

OPENING YEAR (2013) PROJECT TRAFFIC

PROJECT DESCRIPTION, LOCATION AND ACCESS

As discussed previously, the Project will be implemented on a rectangular-shaped,
approximately 6.75-acre site located between Garey Avenue on the west, Gibbs Street on
the east, Monterey Avenue on the north and the United Pacific Railroad lines on the south.
The Project site, which is partially occupied with miscellaneous commercial land uses also
includes Commercial Street, an east-west local street which cul-de-sacs east of Garey
Avenue, and which will be vacated as part of this Project. The Project location is shown on
Figure 1. The Project is located within 500 feet of the Pomona TransCenter, which located
on the west side of Garey Avenue, and within the Downtown Pomona Specific Plan, which
is designated as a Pedestrian Oriented District (POD) in the City of Pomona General Plan.

The site is proposed to be developed with up to 311 apartments and 38 live-work units and
approximately 455 parking spaces. Access to the Project will be from Locust Street and
from Gibbs Street. The conceptual site plan for the Project is provided on Figure 2 2.

The traffic related to the Project has been calculated in accordance with the following
accepted procedural steps:

       ·   Project Generation
       ·   Project Distribution
       ·   Project Assignment

PROJECT TRIP GENERATION

    Trip generation is expressed in vehicle trip ends, defined as one-way vehicular movements,
    either entering or exiting the generating land use. Trip generation rates and equations for
    different land uses are typically found in publications by the Institute of Transportation
    Engineers (ITE) and by local agencies such as San Diego Association of Governments
    (SANDAG). The estimated number of trips which will be generated by the Project has
    been determined using rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
    Trip Generation, 8th Edition. Table 4 shows the rates that have been used in this analysis.

Due to the proximity of this Project to the Pomona TransCenter, a 10 percent reduction in
the gross number of trips has been applied to account for transit trips. This is consistent
with the trip reduction "credit" factors determined by the LACCMP. In addition, due to the
location of this Project in downtown Pomona, it is assumed that 10 percent of the Project
trips will be to/from land uses within the downtown itself and would thus not generate
additional new trips on the roadway system. The trip generation rates and the reductions
due to the downtown location and proximity to transit are consistent with the methodology
in the City of Pomona Downtown Specific Plan Amendment.

           In addition, based on discussions with City of Pomona Planning staff and the Applicant, the
           site plan shows a total of 25,708 square feet of live work floor area of which half, or a
           maximum of 12,854 square feet, would be available for non-residential uses.
           Approximately one-third (or up to 4,284 square feet) of the non-residential floor area could
           be used for specialty retail-type type uses, while the balance (8,570 square feet) would be
           dedicated to professional/artisan type uses. The trip generation for the live/work units has
           been developed taking into consideration the interaction between the residential, office and
           retail components which reduces the number of off-site trips generated by these land uses
           individually. While limited data is available on the unique trip generation of live/work
           units, approved projects with live/work units in the Los Angeles area cite a 50% "credit" for
           internal trip making between the residential and commercial components within a work/live
           unit 3. In this analysis, 50% of the trips that would otherwise leave the Project to/from the
           residential component for a work or specialty retail purpose were assumed to be generated
           on-site. However, in an effort to be conservative, only 25 % of the trips that would
           otherwise leave the Project site to/from the specialty retail component were assumed to be
           generated on-site. This is realistic since the specialty retail component of the live/work unit
           is more undefined in terms of actual operation, and the typically generates trips at a much
           higher rate than either the residential or the office component.

           Table 5 shows the Project Trip Generation. It is important to note that the trip generation
           information shown on Table 5 shows both the gross and the net trips associated with the
           various land uses proposed in this Project. The gross trips reflect typical trip-making
           characteristics for individual land uses. The net trips reflect the anticipated trip-generation
           characteristics of this Project given that it is within Pomona's downtown as well as within a
           short-walking distance from the Pomona transit station (Pomona TransCenter), and based on
           the interaction of trips in the live/work units.

         In urban downtown areas, such as Pomona, the net trip generation tends to be lower than in
         suburban areas due to:

          1)       Trips that are made to multiple land uses within an area due to the availability of
                   residential, employment, shopping, recreational and educational opportunities
                   within walking distance of one another. This phenomenon is called "internal" trip
                   making. Internal trip-making is a result of relationships among land use activities
                   that result in people being attracted to two or more land uses on a single auto trip
                   to a given area of development, such as the downtown. The Downtown Pomona
                   Specific Plan TIA indicates that approximately 10 percent of the trips generated by
                   residential developments within the downtown would be internal to the downtown
                   area; and

          2)       Trips that are made by transit or other alternative modes. The Los Angeles County
                   CMP includes a series of "credit" factors for cities to apply for purposes of CMP
                   mitigation. For "primarily" residential projects within one-quarter mile of a transit
                   station, a 10% reduction in trips is allowed by the LACCMP. For "primarily"
                   commercial projects within one-quarter mile of a transit station, a 15% reduction
                   in trips is allowed. To be conservative, a 10% reduction was applied to specialty
                   retail and office uses since this is "primarily" a residential project and these uses
                   are part of the live/work component of the Project.

          As can be seen from Table 5, the Project will generate 142 net new trips (32 inbound, 110
          outbound) during the morning peak hour of analysis, and 176 new trips (111 inbound, 65
          outbound) during the evening peak hour of analysis and 1,838 trips over a typical
          weekday.




                                                             Page 22
 PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION

This Project trip distribution was developed based upon a review of the local and regional
land uses, the surrounding street system, proximity of freeway access, and available traffic
counts where available. This Project's trip distribution is consistent with that identified for
the Downtown Pomona Specific Plan Amendment TIA. The Project trip distribution is
shown on Figure 6.

PROJECT TRIP ASSIGNMENT

Based upon the trip distribution patterns described above, Figure 7 illustrates the
assignment of Project morning and evening peak-hour trips at study intersections.


OPENING YEAR (2013) CUMULATIVE NO-PROJECT TRAFFIC
VOLUMES
Cumulative Background No-Project ("baseline") conditions include existing traffic volumes
plus traffic from other cumulative ("related") projects in the Project vicinity that are likely
to be built and occupied in the same time frame as the proposed Project, as well as the
ambient growth rate, which accounts for regional and unspecified growth.

Ambient Traffic Growth

Ambient traffic growth is a result of traffic growth from unspecified development
(employment as well as housing growth) in the City of Pomona as well as growth in the
surrounding region (regional growth). Based on the review of growth projections found in
the Los Angeles County CMP, the ambient traffic growth rate is estimated to be less than 1
percent per year. However, the City of Pomona directed the use of a more conservative
annual ambient traffic growth of 2 percent per year. Hence, all future traffic conditions can
be considered "worst case". Therefore, as a first step in determining Opening Year (2013)
traffic volumes, a traffic growth rate of 2 percent was applied to existing (2012) traffic
volumes.

Cumulative ("Related") Projects

As a second step in developing year 2013 No-Project traffic volumes, traffic generated by
other planned and/or approved projects that could add traffic to the study intersections was
assigned to the study roadway system. Table 6 provides a summary list of projects that the
City of Pomona provided to be considered as "related" projects in the local area cumulative
development setting.

In addition, "related" projects in adjoining jurisdictions (City of Montclair, City of Chino,
City of Chino Hills and City of Industry) were reviewed for the potential of adding trips to
study intersections. Only one "related" project in the City of Montclair was identified as
having the potential to add trips to study intersections; the others would not use the network
analyzed in this report. Figure 8 shows the location of the cumulative ("related") projects
included in this analysis.

It should be noted that while these projects are anticipated for development by their
respective jurisdictions, it is unlikely that they all will be completed and generating traffic in
Project Opening Year (2013). Hence, the traffic conditions predicted in this analysis should
be considered as "worst-case" and actual traffic conditions may be better than indicated in
this report. Trip generation for the cumulative ("related") projects was obtained from
specific traffic studies prepared for each project, or based on rates published in ITE's Trip
Generation, 8th Edition. Table 7 summarizes the daily, morning and evening peak-hour trip
generation associated with the "related" projects as discussed above. As can be seen from
Table 7, the "related" projects in Pomona and Montclair are expected to generate 38,010 on
a typical weekday of which 2,406 trips occur during the morning peak hour and 3,078 trips
occur during the evening peak hour.

Cumulative ("related") projects' traffic volumes were assigned to the study intersections.
Figure 9 shows the cumulative ("related") projects' morning and evening peak-hour traffic
volumes at study intersections.

Opening Year (2013) Cumulative No-Project Traffic Volumes

The Opening Year (2013) Cumulative No-Project traffic volumes were determined by first
applying a traffic growth rate of 2 percent per year to existing (2012) traffic volumes and
then adding the cumulative ("related") projects' traffic to these volumes. Figure 10 shows
the Opening Year (2013) Cumulative No-Project morning and evening peak-hour traffic
volumes at study intersections.

OPENING YEAR (2013) CUMULATIVE WITH-PROJECT TRAFFIC
VOLUMES

The Opening Year (2013) Cumulative With-Project traffic volumes reflect traffic conditions
that would occur following implementation of the Project. Since the Project site currently
generates traffic from existing commercial land uses, the Opening Year (2013) Cumulative
With-Project traffic volumes were determined in two steps:

   1) First, trips generated by existing land uses occupying the Project site were removed
      from the roadway network. Traffic counts were collected at the intersection of
      Monterey Avenue ­ Locust Street to determine the number of trips entering and
      exiting the Project site at that location. The existing land uses generate 7 inbound
      trips and 3 outbound trips at Locust Street during the morning peak hour and 7
      inbound trips and 12 outbound trips during the evening peak hour. Based on the
      distribution of trips at this intersection and the overall downtown trip distribution,
      assignment of trips currently generated by the Project site at study intersections were
      determined and these trips were subtracted from the Opening Year (2013)
      Cumulative No-Project traffic volumes shown on Figure 10.

   2) Next, trips generated by the Project (shown on Figure 7) were added to determine
      Opening Year (2013) Cumulative With-Project traffic.

Figure 11 shows the Opening Year (2013) Cumulative With-Project morning and evening
peak-hour traffic volumes at study intersections.

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

This chapter describes the Level of Service (LOS) analysis and appropriate improvements
required to off-set Project-related traffic impacts. Traffic conditions (levels of service
(LOS)) are evaluated in the Project Opening Year (2013) for the following conditions:

   ·   Opening Year (2013) Levels of Service under Cumulative Background No-Project
       traffic conditions; and
   ·   Opening Year (2013) Levels of Service under Cumulative Background With-Project
       traffic conditions.

The traffic conditions with and without the Project were compared to determine Project-
related traffic impacts based on City of Pomona's LOS standards and thresholds of
significance, and to establish the need for mitigation.

This chapter also discusses the Project on-site circulation and access and the potential
impacts on the Los Angeles County Congestions Management Program (Los Angeles
County CMP) roadway network.

       OPENING YEAR (2013) INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE AND
       TRAFFIC IMPACTS

       Opening Year (2013) Levels of Service were determined for both the No-Project and With-
       Project scenarios. As discussed in Chapter 2, the Intersection Capacity Utilization and the
       Highway Capacity Methodology were employed to determine levels of service for
       signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively. The same specific analysis
       parameters as were employed for Existing traffic conditions were employed for the Opening
       Year (2013) Cumulative No-Project and With-Project traffic conditions. The lane
       configurations and traffic control in Opening Year (2013) were assumed to be the same as
       under Existing conditions and are shown on Figure 4.

       Opening Year (2013) Cumulative Background No-Project Intersection
       Levels of Service
       The analysis of Cumulative Background No-Project intersection LOS was based upon the
       peak-hour traffic volumes illustrated on Figure 10 (factored to reflect 2% heavy vehicles and
       PHF) and the intersection geometrics and traffic control exhibited on Figure 4. Table 8
       summarizes the Opening Year (2013) Cumulative No-Project LOS at the study intersections
       during the weekday morning and evening peak hours. Appendix C provides the TRAFFIX
       worksheets for the LOS analysis.

       As shown in Table 8, all intersections are projected to operate acceptably (LOS D or better)
       in Opening Year (2013).

       Project-Related Traffic Impacts

       As described earlier, the potential impact of a development project is determined by the City
       of Pomona as follows:

            ·   When the LOS without development is LOS A, B, C and D, the minimum acceptable
                projected LOS shall be LOS D.
            ·   When the LOS without development is LOS E or F, the minimum acceptable
                projected LOS shall be equal to the LOS without development.

At locations where the Project is determined to have a significant impact based on the
aforementioned criteria, mitigation measures to improve operating conditions to the
minimum acceptable projected LOS levels should be identified.

Tables 8 and 9 show that all the study intersections are projected to operate at levels of
service better than LOS D assuming the completion of the Project. Therefore, the Project
will not create any deficiencies on the City of Pomona roadway network, and no mitigation
measures are required to off-set Project-related traffic impacts.

ON-SITE CIRCULATION AND ACCESS

The Project, as shown on the Site Plan (Figure 2) will be accessed from Monterey Avenue
via Locust Street and from Gibbs Street. On-street parking will be provided on Locust
Street (proposed to be vacated), on Gibbs Street and in a surface parking lot south of the
apartment complex.

Operational Analyses at Project access points on Monterey Avenue
Both the intersections of Monterey Avenue ­ Gibbs Street (Intersection 2) and Monterey
Avenue ­ Locust Street (Intersection 7) are currently unsignalized. A two-way center-left
turn lane currently runs along Monterey Avenue, becoming a left-turn lane on the
westbound approach to Garey Avenue and on the eastbound approach to Palomares Street.

Both intersections are projected to operate at acceptable Levels of Service (LOS C or better)
during the morning and evening peak hours with the implementation of the Project, and no
additional lanes are required to accommodate Project traffic. The two-way center left-turn
lane should be restriped to designate a left-turn turn lane at the following locations:

   ·   on the westbound approach to Locust Street;
   ·   on the eastbound approach to Gibbs Street; and
   ·   on the westbound approach to Gibbs Street.

This signing would be typical of the westbound approach on Monterey Avenue to
Palomares Street, and would not conflict with access to any other properties since less than
50 feet of storage is required at any of these approaches.

The left-turn queuing between Garey Avenue and Gibbs Street was reviewed to ensure that
there would be no backing up between intersections. Table 10 shows the 95th percentile
queues along Monterey Avenue at its intersections with Garey Avenue, Locust Street and
Gibbs Street. As can be seen, from Table 10, all left-turn queues can be accommodated
without any conflicts with adjacent intersections.

          (5) For "worst-case" conditions, the driveway on the northside of Monterey Avenue was included in the intersection LOS and queueing analysis.
          (6) Westbound and eastbound through movements are free-flow, so there is no queue.
          (7) The westbound approach operates with a "de-facto" separate right-turn lane so queues are less than shown in this "wrost-case"analysis.
One lane northbound on Locust and Gibbs Streets at Monterey Avenue will accommodate
Project volumes at good levels of service. The maximum (95th percentile) queue on the
northbound (outbound) approaches from the Project onto Monterey Avenue is projected to
be one vehicle. The storage on the outbound approaches is adequate to accommodate
projected queues. There are no gated entries into the Project, and therefore no backing of
Project traffic onto public streets is expected.

Right-turn movements into Gibbs Street and Monterey Avenue from Monterey Avenue are
less than 50 vehicles per hour, and therefore separate right-turn lanes are not required for
access into the Project.

Traffic signal warrant analyses were conducted at the Project access intersections (Monterey
Avenue ­ Locust Street and Monterey Avenue ­ Gibbs Street) and at the All-Way STOP-
controlled intersection of Monterey Avenue ­ Palomares Street to determine whether the
need for any traffic signals would be triggered as a result of Project implementation.

The justification for installation of a traffic signal at an intersection is based on traffic signal
warrants established by California Manual on Traffic Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(California MUTCD) 2012 Edition, the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA)
MUTCD 2009 Edition, as amended for use in California. Traffic signal warrant #3 (peak-
hour warrant) is typically used in urban settings. Warrant #3 indicates whether peak-hour
conditions or peak-hour volumes are, or would be, sufficient to justify installation of a
traffic signal. Other traffic signal warrants are available; however, they cannot be verified
for future conditions as they rely on data for which forecasts are not available (such as
accidents, four- or eight-hour traffic volumes, and pedestrian volumes). Warrant #3 is based
on specified conditions outlined in two parts, Part A and Part B, either of which need to be
satisfied to warrant a traffic signal. Part A has three sub-parts which must all be satisfied to
warrant a traffic signal: 1) the traffic on the minor street STOP-controlled approach(es)
should experience at least four vehicle-hours of delay for a one lane-approach or delay of
five vehicle-hours for a two-lane approach; and 2) the volume on the minor street approach
should be at least 100 vehicles per hour (vph) for one moving lane of traffic or 150 vph for
two moving lanes; and 3) total entering volume serviced during the hour must be at least
800 vph for intersections with four or more approaches or 650 vph for intersection with
three approaches. Part B evaluates traffic volumes on both the minor and major streets in
relation to the lane geometry of both streets.

Table 11 shows the results of the traffic signal warrant analysis for Monterey Avenue ­
Locust Street, Monterey Avenue ­ Gibbs Street and Monterey Avenue ­ Palomares Street.
Warrant #3 is not satisfied at any of the three intersections during either the morning or
evening peak hours of travels, and all three intersections will continue to operate at LOS C
or better under unsignalized traffic control.

Aisle widths of 25 feet are appropriate for internal circulation and access to and through the
parking lot. Curb radii are designed per the City of Pomona standards, with minimum 25-
foot curb radii at Monterey and Gibbs Streets.

OTHER CIRCULATION ISSUES

Pedestrian Circulation

Because the study intersections are within the downtown area, which is designated as a
Pedestrian Oriented District (POD) in the City of Pomona General Plan, and a portion of the
Project's trips will be made by walking to the Pomona TransCenter and employment, retail
and entertainment opportunities in close proximity to the Project, the City requested that
pedestrian operations be evaluated.

Pedestrian counts were collected at all the study intersections. Count data sheets are
provided in Appendix B. The study intersections most heavily utilized by pedestrians are
the intersections of:

   ·   Monterey Avenue ­ Garey Avenue, where a peak of 70 pedestrians cross all four
       legs of the intersection during the morning peak hour, and 72 pedestrians cross all
       four legs of the intersection during the evening peak hour;
   ·   Holt Avenue ­ Garey Avenue, where a peak of 135 pedestrians cross all four legs of
       the intersection during the morning peak hour, and 161 pedestrians cross all four legs
       of the intersection during the evening peak hour;
   ·   Holt Avenue ­ Palomares Street, where a peak of 55 pedestrians cross all four legs
       of the intersection during the morning peak hour, and 113 pedestrians cross all four
       legs of the intersection during the evening peak hour; and
   ·   Holt Avenue ­ Towne Avenue, where a peak of 41 pedestrians cross all four legs of
       the intersection during the morning peak hour, and 106 pedestrians cross all four legs
       of the intersection during the evening peak hour

The four intersections listed above are signalized and provide adequate green time for
pedestrians to cross without creating undue congestion. The other study intersections
experience low pedestrian volumes (50 pedestrians or less during the peak hours of activity).

Monterey Avenue adjacent to the site will be improved to Collector roadway standards with
sidewalks consistent with the requirements of the City of Pomona to accommodate
pedestrian traffic. The Project will generate a peak of approximately 35 walking trips
to/from the Pomona TransCenter and the rest of downtown during the peak hour of analysis.
This pedestrian traffic is mostly concentrated at the intersection of Monterey Avenue ­
Garey Avenue. The intersection will continue to operate acceptably with the additional
pedestrian traffic under existing traffic signal operations.

Bicycle Circulation
While Monterey Avenue is currently not on the City of Pomona's Bicycle Network, it is
wide enough to accommodate bicycle travel within the pavement 56-foot width. The City's
General Plan Update is currently under way, and if it is determined through the update
process that Monterey Avenue has connectivity with other proposed bicycle routes, it could
be classified as bicycle route with appropriate signing. The Project provides bicycle storage
facilities.


On-Street Parking
Monterey Avenue is a Collector Street and currently has one travel lane in each direction
with a center left-turn lane and on-street parking. Gibbs Street is a Local Street with two
travel lanes and on-street parking. The addition of Project and cumulative traffic volumes
will not change the lane requirements on Monterey Avenue or Gibbs Street, and on-street
parking should continue to be provided consistent with the goals of the Downtown Specific
Plan.

Left-turn Protected Phasing

Several study intersections currently operate with permissive left-turn phases in one or both
directions. These are:

   ·   Monterey Avenue ­ Garey Avenue ­ This intersection operates with permissive left-
       turn phasing on the east-west approaches;
   ·   Holt Avenue ­ Palomares Street ­ This intersection operates with protected left-turn
       phasing on the east-west approaches, and permissive left-turn phasing on the north-
       south approaches.
   ·   Monterey Avenue ­ Towne Avenue ­ the intersection operates with protected left-
       turn phasing on the north-south approaches and with permissive phasing on the east-
       west approaches.

The HCM operations methodology was used to verify delays under existing traffic signal
control at these three intersections for the Opening Year (2013) With-Project conditions.
All analyses included the effect of pedestrian movements at these intersections. All three
intersections were determined to operate at acceptable levels of service. Since unacceptable
delays would not be experienced by left-turning vehicles and additional protected left-turn
phasing would reduce the green time for other movements and hence increase overall
intersection delay, no changes in traffic signal phasing is recommended as part of this
Project.

CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
The Project's potential to adversely affect the Los Angeles County Congestion Management
Program (Los Angeles County CMP) roadway network was evaluated. The CMP thresholds
require analysis of impacts of developments which will add 50 or more peak-hour trips to
any CMP intersection or arterial, or 150 or more peak-hour trips on mainline freeway
monitoring locations.

The three CMP monitoring intersections in the City of Pomona are as follows:

   ·   Arrow Highway ­ Garey Avenue;
   ·   Foothill Boulevard ­ Garey Avenue;
   ·   Corona Expressway (State Route 71) ­ Mission Boulevard

The Project would generate a maximum of 6 two-way trips (5 percent or less of the net new
trip generation) on Garey Avenue north of I-10 and on Mission Boulevard west of Garey
Avenue. Therefore, the three CMP intersections would not be adversely affected by the
Project based on the CMP thresholds for analysis.

The Project will generate a maximum of 43 two-way trips (24 percent or less of the net new
trip generation) on I-10 west of Garey Avenue and a maximum of 34 two-way trips (19% of
the net new trip generation) on I-10 east of Garey Avenue. Hence, no CMP freeway-
monitoring locations would be adversely affected by the Project.


PROJECT MITIGATION

Based on the City of Pomona standards and thresholds of significance, as well as the CMP
thresholds of significance, this Project will not create adverse traffic impacts on the public
roadway system and no off-site mitigation needs to be implemented.

The Project should improve Monterey Avenue and Gibbs Street to the City of Pomona
design standards. The intersections of Monterey Avenue ­ Locust Street and Monterey
Avenue ­ Gibbs Street should be fully-directional and STOP-sign controlled on the Locust
Street and Gibbs Street approaches. On-street and off-street parking should satisfy the
requirements of City of Pomona.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the Monterey
Station Residential Project.

Level-of-service analyses were conducted for the Existing, Cumulative No-Project and
With-Project conditions in Opening Year (2013). The results of these analyses indicate that,
based on City of Pomona's LOS standards and thresholds of significance, all study
intersection operate acceptably and there are no adverse traffic impacts as a result of the
Project. Further, there will be no impacts on the CMP roadway system as a result of this
Project.

An analysis of traffic signal phasing at the signalized study intersections which currently
have permissive left-turn phasing indicates that those intersections will continue to operate
efficiently and hence no changes are recommended as part of this Project. Likewise, the
surrounding pedestrian street network will accommodate the Project which will provide
sidewalks along Monterey Avenue as part of improving this street to Collector-street
standards per requirements of the City of Pomona.

Access to/from the Project site will be efficient with STOP-sign control on the Locust Street
approach to Monterey Avenue, allowing for fully directional movements. On-street and
off-street parking should satisfy the requirements of City of Pomona.

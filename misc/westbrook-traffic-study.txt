INTRODUCTION

The following traffic impact study has been conducted as part of the Adequate Public Facilities efforts for
Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) to propose a modernization project for Westbrook Elementary
School. The school is located along Allan Terrace in Bethesda, Maryland, in close proximity to
Massachusetts Avenue (MD 396) to the west. The project proposes to expand the school to add 12-15 new
classrooms, a new full sized gymnasium and additional support rooms. The modernization project is planned
to be completed by the year 2013 and no students will be relocated during the construction efforts.

A. Morton Thomas and Associates (AMT) has been retained to undertake the required traffic impact study
under the Mandatory Referral provisions of the Local Area Transportation Review/Policy Area Mobility Review
Guidelines (LATR/PAMR). In accordance with the procedures of the Maryland-National Park & Planning
Commission (M-NCPPC), the project was discussed with M-NCPPC staff and resulted in a detailed scoping
letter, dated December 10, 2010, and included in Appendix A.

The purpose of this traffic study was to evaluate the adequacy of the transportation facilities that are
available to serve the site in accordance with the procedures outlined in the LATR/PAMR Guidelines (as
adopted by the Planning Board and published in December 2009). The following existing intersections were
included in the study and analyses:

    x   Massachusetts Avenue (MD 396) and Baltimore Avenue/Falmouth Road
    x   Baltimore Avenue and Allan Road/Allan Terrace
    x   Baltimore Avenue and Glen Cove Parkway
    x   Allan Terrace and School Driveway #1 (School bus entrance)
    x   Allan Terrace and School Driveway #2 (School bus exit)
    x   Allan Terrace and School Driveway #3 (Staff entrance/exit)

This report summarizes the existing, background, and future conditions, pipeline developments, site trip
generation, and mitigation recommendations (if necessary) for the proposed study site. The location of the
study is shown on Figure 1.




                                                                                              Page 1 of 21

EXISTING CONDITIONS

Existing Roadway Characteristics

Regional access to the site is provided by Massachusetts Avenue (MD 396) to the west and local access is
provided via Baltimore Avenue and Allan Terrace.

Massachusetts Avenue (MD 396) is a north/south median (grass) divided four-lane roadway located west of
the site. Massachusetts Avenue intersects with Baltimore Avenue west of the site and this intersection is
signal-controlled.

Baltimore Avenue is an east/west undivided two-lane roadway extending from Massachusetts Avenue (MD
396) to Glen Cove Parkway, serving primarily residences. There are no sidewalks provided along Baltimore
Avenue. Baltimore Avenue intersects with Allan Terrace which provides access to the school north of this
road. The intersection of Baltimore Avenue and Allan Terrace is a 4-way stop controlled intersection. The
north leg of this intersection at Allan Terrace has a sign which prohibits entry to northbound Allan Terrace
to access the school between 8:30AM and 9:00AM and between 2:45PM and 3:30PM. Hence, all vehicles
must access the school by continuing east along Baltimore Avenue, turn left (north) at Glen Cove Parkway
and travel west along Allan Terrace to access the school.

Glen Cove Parkway is a north/south undivided two-lane roadway extending from Newport Avenue to the
south and Allan Terrace to the north serving primarily residences. Sidewalks are provided along Glen Cove
Parkway on the east side. The intersection of Glen Cove Parkway and Baltimore Avenue is a 3-way stop
controlled intersection.

Allan Terrace is an east/west undivided two-lane roadway extending from Glen Cove Parkway to Baltimore
Avenue, serving primarily residences and Westbrook Elementary School. There are sidewalks provided on
both sides of the road from Glen Cove Parkway up to school and continue only on the north side after that.

The traffic control and lane use at the studied intersections in the vicinity of the site are shown on Figure 2.

Existing Traffic Volumes

Peak hour manual turning movement and pedestrian counts were conducted by AMT on Wednesday, May
25th 2011 from 6:30AM to 9:30AM and from 2:00PM to 7:00PM, at the following intersections:

    x   Massachusetts Avenue (MD 396) and Baltimore Avenue/Falmouth Road
    x   Baltimore Avenue and Allan Road/Allan Terrace
    x   Baltimore Avenue and Glen Cove Parkway
    x   Allan Terrace and School Driveway #1 (School bus entrance)
    x   Allan Terrace and School Driveway #2 (School bus exit)
                                                                                                  Page 3 of 21

   x   Allan Terrace and School Driveway #3 (Staff entrance/exit)

The school AM and PM peak hour turning movement counts are shown on Figure 3 and are summarized in
Appendix B. There is a difference in traffic volumes between the Massachusetts Avenue/Baltimore Avenue
intersection and Baltimore Avenue/Allan Terrace intersection due to the presence of local driveways.

The school AM peak was generally found to occur between 8:00 AM and 8:15 AM and the school PM peak
between 2:45 PM and 3:00 PM. Pedestrian counts were also conducted at all key intersections as shown on
Figure 4.




                                                                                          Page 4 of 21

Existing Transit Facilities

One Ride-On transit route offers service in the vicinity of the
site: Route 29 (Bethesda Station-Wilson La-Mass Ave-Friendship
Heights Station). Route 29 offers transit service seven days a
week. A bus stop is located at the intersection of Massachusetts
Avenue and Baltimore Avenue. No students or teachers were
observed to utilize this bus route as their mode of
transportation.



Existing Conditions Analyses

Existing conditions level of service (LOS) were determined based on the existing traffic control and lane use
(Figure 2), the existing school peak hour volumes (Figure 3), and the critical lane volume (CLV) analysis
methodology, as described in the M-NCPPC LATR/PAMR Guidelines. The results are summarized in Table 1
and included in Appendix C.

Access Management, Internal School Traffic Circulation, Queuing and Pedestrian/Bicycle
Activity

Access to Westbrook Elementary School is provided via Allan Terrace, with a one-way bus loop located to
the and a staff/visitor parking driveway located to the west. The bus loop is accessible only to school buses.
The school buses utilize the bus loop to drop-off/pick-up students at the school. Field observations
indicated that approximately 2-3 school buses queued in the bus loop at one time.

There is a parking issue for the school staff. There are 63 staff members but there are only 27 parking
spaces on site; all other staff park on the street. There is no drop-off/pick-up loop for parents. Parents were
observed to park along Allan Terrace while dropping off and picking up their children from school. Since
parents parked their vehicles in both directions along Allan Terrace just east of the school, there is only
room for one vehicle to drive along Allan Terrace at a time, which causes a lot of stopping and backing up.
Many parents were observed to park along Allan Terrace further away from the school and walk their
children to school to avoid the congestion in front of the school. Also, a large percentage of parents were
observed to drop their children in the staff parking lot and then u-turn around to exit the staff parking lot.

There are three bicycle racks located in front of the school and they are all in good condition. A few
students and staff were observed to ride their bicycles to school and used these racks.

Existing School Operations

Access to Westbrook Elementary School is provided via Allan Terrace, with an entrance/exit bus loop and a
staff parking lot driveway located in front of the main school building. The entrance/exit bus loop is
accessible only to school buses and is located to the east along Allan Terrace and the driveway providing
access to the staff parking lot is located to the west along Allan Terrace. The school buses access the bus
loop to drop-off/pick-up students at the school. The school offers classes for kindergarten through 5th
grade, which are held from 8:50 AM to 3:05 PM, with occasional half-days and early/late dismissals. The
school currently enrolls 409 students. An after-school program is offered at the end of the day for students.
Field observations noted that approximately 19 students utilize the after-school program.

Students attending Westbrook Elementary School were noted to be dropped off by a school bus or a parent
in a vehicle, walked to school or biked to school. Table 2 summarizes the AM and PM peak hour field
observations during a typical school day.

Existing Parking Facilities

There is one staff parking lot situated at the west side of the school. The parking lot has twenty-seven (27)
parking spaces including two (2) handicapped parking spaces. Other than the reserved parking spaces for the
Principal, Administrative Secretary and other administrative staff members, there are around thirteen (13)
parking spaces available for staff members and visitors. Since there are approximately 63 staff members in
the school, currently there are inadequate parking spaces available for staff and visitors. Field observations
show that all the parking spaces were filled well before school started and most of the teachers parked on
the street along Allan Terrace. As shown in Table 3, AMT noted the parking occupancy at various intervals
during the AM peak hour.

Existing Pedestrian Facilities

Existing pedestrian activity in the vicinity of the school indicates that a large number of students and parents
walk along the sidewalks on Allan Terrace to access the school (as shown in Figure 4). There are no
crosswalks and "school children" warning signs provided in front of the school. Sidewalks are provided along
the north side along Allan Terrace and other residential roadways in the vicinity of the site. All sidewalks
were found to be in good condition.

BACKGROUND CONDITIONS

As per the scoping letter prepared by M-NCPPC, there are no background developments in the vicinity of
the site. Hence, there are no background trips associated with this site.

SITE TRIP ANALYSIS

Proposed Site Plan

The proposed site plan is shown on Figure 5 and indicates that the school will be accessible via the existing
bus entrance/exit loop and the existing staff parking driveway all located along Allan Terrace. The existing
parking lot will be expanded to provide more staff parking. In order to mediate this queue problem along
Allan Terrace, a 180 foot parking bay in front of the school is planned for the north side of Allan Terrace.

Site Trip Generation

The site trip generation for the proposed expansion of the site was determined based on the existing site
trip generation rates, as shown in Table 4. The peak hour trip rates were based on the number of students
during the school AM and the PM peak hours (and not the school enrollment of 409 students). Using the
field recorded number of students for the school AM and PM peak hours instead of the school enrollment
provides a more conservative trip-per-student rate. Therefore, the analysis provides a conservative future
trip generation estimate.

Note: Additional trips added to the trip generation summary to account for a lot of parents parking away from the
school and then walking the students to school.


The proposed school expansion is anticipated to generate an additional 124 school AM peak hour trips (66
in and 58 out) and an additional 129 school PM peak hour trips (63 in and 66 out).

Site Trip Assignments/Distributions

The proposed site trips were assigned to the road network based on the existing travel patterns of the
school. Current travel patterns indicate that approximately 75% of the trips approach the school from the
west along Massachusetts Avenue (MD 396) and approximately 25% approach the school from the
surrounding residential driveways. The detailed approach percentages and site trip assignments are shown
on Figure 6.

Future Parking Supply

The proposed site plan proposes to provide sixty (60) parking spaces for staff and visitors in the parking lot
located on the west side of the school. The total number of parking spaces in the future site will have an
additional thirty-three (33) spaces. These additional parking spaces are anticipated to sufficiently meet the
parking demands of the proposed school expansion. In front of the school on the east side, Allan Terrace
road will be expanded to provide a separate parent drop-off/pickup bay. This is expected to reduce the
traffic congestion and backups along Allan Terrace as parents drop-off and pick-up their children before and
after school.

FUTURE CONDITIONS

Future Conditions Forecasts

The future conditions forecasts were determined based on the existing school AM and PM peak hour
volumes (Figure 3) and the site generated trips (Figure 6), and are shown on Figure 7.

Future Conditions Analyses

Future conditions LOS were determined based on the existing traffic control and lane use (Figure 2), the
future conditions forecasts (Figure 7), and the critical lane volume (CLV) analysis methodology, as described
in the M-NCPPC LATR/PAMR guidelines. The results are summarized in Table 5 and included in Appendix
E.

Note: Based on the Critical Lane Volume Methodology and a Congestion Standard of 1,600 per
     the 2009 Local Area Transportation Review and Policy Area Mobility Review Guidelines

The results indicate that all studied intersections are expected to operate at acceptable LOS during the
school AM and PM peak hours for future conditions.

Future Queue Analysis

One major queuing problem exists today during both the school AM and PM peak hours. During the school
AM and PM peak hours, field observations show that parents are stopping to drop-off/pick-up their children
along the north side of Allan Terrace. Local residents and school staff park along the south side of Allan
Terrace. This creates a queue of vehicles along Allan Terrace since the road is only wide enough for two
vehicles at once.

In order to mediate this queue problem, a 180 foot parking bay in front of the school is planned for the
north side of Allan Terrace. The parking bay will allow parents to temporarily park for drop-off/pick-up and
not disrupt the westbound flow of traffic along Allan Terrace. The parking bay should reduce the queue to
less than 2 vehicles in length.

Pedestrian Impact Statement

The following presents the findings of the Pedestrian Impact Statement based on the LATR/PAMR
Guidelines:

    x   Pedestrian/Bicycle Traffic Counts: Pedestrian counts were recorded in the immediate vicinity of the
        school and indicated that the majority of the students walk southbound along Allan Terrace. Two
        (2) students were observed to bike to school and use the bike racks.

    x   Pedestrian Facilities: In general, sidewalks and crosswalks are provided in the immediate vicinity of
        the school and within the school grounds themselves. Sidewalk is provided on the north side of
        Allan Terrace and a large number of students and parents were observed to walk on the sidewalk
        along Allan Terrace during drop-off/pickup. There is no mid-block crossing along Allan Terrace
        since the school and sidewalk are both located along the north side of the street. The majority of
        the sidewalks and crosswalks in the vicinity of the school are in good condition.

    x   Transit Facilities: An existing bus route currently runs along Massachusetts Avenue, with a stop
        located at Baltimore Avenue. Field observations noted that no students or staff member utilized the
        bus route as their mode of transportation to/from school.

    x   Pedestrian Controls: None of the intersections located within close proximity to the school are
        signal-controlled, so no pedestrian signals are provided to students and their parents. Field
        observations indicated that most students walked on the sidewalk along Allan Terrace to attend
        school. No crossing guard is present at the school or in close proximity of the school.

    x   Bicycle Facilities: There are three (3) bicycle racks present at the school site and they are all in good
        condition.

                                                                                                  Page 19 of 21

Policy Area Mobility Review

Public elementary schools are designated to attract a majority of their trips from within a relatively small
geographic area. Typically, for elementary schools, the school system provides bus service for students living
beyond 1.0 mile from the school. To satisfy requirements of the Policy Area Mobility Review, the Bethesda-
Chevy Chase Policy Area is required to mitigate 30% of the new trips generated by a land use. Data
collected at Westbrook Elementary School indicates that approximately 17% of the students enrolled at the
school currently use the bus service provided during the school AM peak hour and 39% either walk/bike to
school. During the PM peak hour, approximately 18% of the students were observed to use the bus service
provided. Another 35% of the students were observed to either walk or bike to the school during the
school PM peak hour. Also, the data collected at the school indicates that the school's per student trip
generation rate is approximately 0.48 (196/409) which is about 44 percent lower than the 0.92 per student
trip generation rate included in the M-NCPPC LATR/PAMR Guidelines for private schools with grades K
through 8. This demonstrates that MCPS is achieving over 30 percent trip mitigation at Westbrook
Elementary School; and therefore, satisfying the PAMR requirement of the APF test.

CONCLUSIONS

This traffic impact study and analyses were conducted in accordance with the LATR/PAMR guidelines
published by M-NCPPC. The proposed increase in enrollment at Westbrook Elementary School falls within
the guidelines.

After collecting current traffic count data at three nearby intersections and all the school driveways along
Allan Terrace, it was determined that all studied intersections analyzed met the Congestion Standard for the
Bethesda-Chevy Chase Policy Area of 1,600 critical lane movements for the school AM and PM peak hours
during existing conditions.

There were no background developments in the vicinity of the site; and hence, no background conditions
were analyzed. The proposed site generated trips for the school expansion were distributed along the road
network based on the existing travel patterns. These site trips were added to the existing conditions
forecasts to determine the future conditions forecasts. It was determined that all studied intersections
analyzed are anticipated to continue to meet the Congestion Standard for the Bethesda/Chevy Chase Policy
Area of 1,600 critical lane movements for the school AM and PM peak hours during future conditions.
Therefore, a potential increase in the enrollment at Westbrook Elementary School will not have any
adverse effects on the roadway system serving the site

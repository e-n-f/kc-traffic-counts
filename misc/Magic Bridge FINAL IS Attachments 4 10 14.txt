Introduction and Overview
The City of Palo Alto is planning to develop a new facility in an area of Mitchell Park.
Current use near the project site consists of a pedestrian/bike path and tennis courts. The
project site itself is lawn and associated landscaping with few improvements or features.
Royston, Hanamoto, Alley & Abey requested that HortScience, Inc. prepare a Tree
Report for the site. This report provides the following information:
     1. An assessment of trees currently growing on the site.
     2. An assessment of the impacts to trees from constructing the proposed project.
     3. Recommendations for tree removal and replacement.
     4. Guidelines for tree preservation during the design, construction, and
          maintenance phases of development.

Assessment Methods
The tree assessment included trees greater than 4" in diameter measured 54" above
grade and consisted of the following steps:
     1. Identifying the tree as to species.
     2. Measuring the trunk diameter (54" above grade).
     3. Evaluating the health using a 0 to 5 scale where 0 = dead, 1 = poor and 5 =
        excellent condition.
     4. Noting any significant structural characteristics including decay, poor crown
        conformation, dieback and a history of failure.
     5. Assessing the tree's suitability for preservation.
     6. Recording the tree's location on a map.

As part of the assessment procedure, the tree was visually inspected from the ground. I
looked for structural conditions that were likely to lead to tree failure. Examination began
with an assessment of overall vigor and health, and then focused on a visual examination
of root collar, trunk, scaffold limbs and branches that were visible from the ground.

All trees have the potential to fail. Even a structurally sound tree can fail if exposed to
unusually strong winds. Under normal climatic conditions, however, most tree failures
appear to involve specific defects of structure such as the presence of decay or weak
branch attachments. These defects become significant in situations with saturated soil,
strong winds, snow/ice loads and other extremes of climate. The most likely failure
situation involves a combination of structural defects and unusual or severe weather. By
regularly examining trees for specific defects, evaluating their potential to fail, and
applying appropriate treatments, safety can be enhanced.

Description of Trees
Thirty-five (35) trees were evaluated, representing seven species (Table 1, following
page). None of the species are native to the Palo Alto area. Descriptions of each tree are
provided in the Tree Assessment Form and locations are shown on the Tree
Assessment Map (see Attachments).

The most frequently occurring species was blue gum with 19 trees. Trees were located in
a row along the south boundary of the park and in a row to the east of the tennis courts.
All were mature in size and development with trunk diameters that ranged from 25 - 70".
Ten (10) trees were in good condition and nine (9) in fair. Tree structure, generally good
for 16 of the 19 blue gums, was affected by a lack of regular maintenance. Heavy lateral
limbs and/or dead wood within the crowns could be mitigated

        and heavy and/or bowed stems. None of the 19 blue gums had been topped.

        Italian stone pine, with six (6) trees, was the second most commonly encountered
        species with trunk diameters ranging from 29 - 48". A group of three (3) trees (#297 -
        299) was located on the west side of the area adjacent to Adobe Creek concrete channel.
        Tree #297 was the only Italian stone pine in good condition with relatively upright form.
        Large roots had displaced asphalt in the adjacent path. Trees #298 and 299 were in fair
        condition and leaned west over Adobe Creek (photo 2). A heavy lateral limb was
        separating from the crown of #298. Trunk indentation at soil level on tension side of tree
        #299 may be an indication of girdling roots below soil. Trees #320 - 322, grouped toward
        the south end of the site, all leaned north/northwest and had heavy lateral limbs
        separating from their crowns (photo 1). Stone pine #320 had a heavy lateral limb leaning

Cork oak #301 was in good
condition; #300 was excellent (photo

and development with very good
structure. Cork oak #301 had a
slightly thin crown with some
dieback, likely due to competition
from stone pine #320. The canopy of
tree #300 was full and dense.

Located at the northwest corner of
the tennis courts were evergreen ash
#357, in good condition, and
Raywood ash #358, in fair condition.

Holly oak #356 had codominant trunks at its base. It was in poor condition and was
largely dead.

The Palo Alto Municipal Code (8.10.020) defines protected trees as "any tree of the
species Quercus agrifolia (coast live oak) or Quercus lobata (Valley Oak) which is eleven
and one-half inches in diameter (thirty-six inches in circumference) or more when
measured four and one-half feet (fifty-four inches) above natural grade; and any redwood
tree (species Sequoia sempervirens) that is eighteen inches in diameter (fifty-seven
inches in circumference) or more when measured four and one-half feet (fifty-four inches)
above natural grade." There are no Protected Trees at the site.

Results for individual trees are located in the Tree Assessment Form (see
Attachments). Tree locations are noted by tree tag number in the Tree Assessment
Map.

Suitability for Preservation
Trees that are preserved on development sites must be carefully selected to make sure
that they may survive development impacts, adapt to a new environment and perform
well in the landscape. Our goal is to identify trees that have the potential for long-term
health, structural stability and longevity. Evaluation of suitability for preservation
considers several factors:

        Tree health
        Healthy, vigorous trees are better able to tolerate impacts such as root injury,
        demolition of existing structures, changes in soil grade and moisture, and soil
        compaction than are non-vigorous trees.

        Structural integrity
        Trees with significant amounts of wood decay and other structural defects that
        cannot be corrected are likely to fail. Such trees should not be preserved in areas
        where damage to people or property is likely. Italian stone pines #320-322 have
        heavy stems that extend over future play sites. This species has a high tendency
        for stem failure and trees with this defect should be removed.

        Species response
        There is a wide variation in the response of individual species to construction
        impacts and changes in the environment. For example, evergreen ash is
        relatively tolerant of construction impacts while blue gum is more sensitive.

        Tree age and longevity
        Old trees, while having significant emotional and aesthetic appeal, have limited
        physiological capacity to adjust to an altered environment. Young trees are better
        able to generate new tissue and respond to change.

        Species invasiveness
        Species which spread across a site and displace desired vegetation are not
        always appropriate for retention. This is particularly true when indigenous
        species are displaced. None of the species at the site is considered invasive.

Each tree was rated for suitability for preservation based upon its age, health, structural
condition and ability to safely coexist within a development environment (Table 2).

                      Table 2: Tree suitability for preservation
                   Magical Bridge area. Mitchell Park. Palo Alto CA.

       Good          Trees with good health and structural stability that have the potential
                     for longevity at the site. Nine (9) trees were rated as having good
                     suitability for preservation.

                     those in the "good" category. Eighteen (18) trees were rated as
                     having moderate suitability for preservation.

Poor     Trees in poor health or possessing significant defects in structure
         that cannot be abated with treatment. These trees can be expected
         to decline regardless of management. The species or individual tree
         may possess either characteristics that are undesirable in landscape
         settings or be unsuited for use areas. Eight (8) trees were rated as
         having poor suitability for preservation.

We consider trees with good suitability for preservation to be the best candidates for
preservation. We do not recommend retention of trees with low suitability for preservation
in areas where people or property will be present. Retention of trees with moderate
suitability for preservation depends upon the intensity of proposed site changes.

Preliminary Evaluation of Impacts and Recommendations for Action
Appropriate tree retention develops a practical match between the location and intensity
of construction activities and the quality and health of trees. The tree assessment was the
reference point for tree condition and quality. Impacts from the proposed project were
assessed using the conceptual site plan (3/17/12) provided by Royston, Hanamoto, Alley
& Abey.

Impacts to trees could occur in a variety of ways. Grading and other construction
activities may damage trees, through both direct mechanical injury and indirectly by
altering drainage. Trenching for utilities and excavation for pedestrian and bike paths and
concrete pads for playground structures can damage roots and/or compact soils.
Installation of site improvements may require shallow excavation near trees and trees
may need to be pruned for clearance.

Because plans are conceptual, recommendations for action are preliminary based on tree
condition and suitability for preservation. I recommend removal of 12 trees and
preservation of 23 (table 3, following page). Trees recommended for removal are Italian
stone pines #298, 299, 320, 321, 322; blue gums #331, 332, 334, 337, 342; Raywood
ash #358; and holly oak #356. These trees have poor suitability for preservation. Italian
stone pines have structural defects that increase their likelihood for failure.

Blue gum #332 is recommended for removal due to its close proximity to the tot-lot play
zone. Construction of the playground will significantly impact the root zone of the tree,
and its canopy would overhang the playground, creating a potentially hazardous
condition. Blue gum #342 is also recommended for removal to decrease the blind curve
condition along the bike/pedestrian path into the park. The request to remove the tree
was initiated by the community and the Palo Alto Bicycle Advisory Committee as being a
safety concern along the path.

I also recommend removal of Raywood ash #358, due to its competition with evergreen
ash #357 to its east. Growing roughly ten feet apart, both trees are semi-mature in size
and without significant defects; however, the evergreen ash, the dominant of the two, is
causing the Raywood ash to lean. As the evergreen ash matures it will continue to
suppress its neighbor. Though the Raywood ash is not in poor condition, good
management practices would dictate removal of the smaller tree.

Recommendations for preservation are predicated on adherence to the Tree
Preservation Guidelines (following section).

Tree Preservation Guidelines
A Tree Protection and Preservation Plan is required for review by the City of Palo Alto
Planning Division when trees to be saved may be injured by disturbance. The Plan must
include written recommendations for the health and long-term welfare of trees to be
preserved, identify a tree protection zone for each tree, describe tree protection
measures during construction, and define a plan for continued maintenance after
construction. The Tree Protection Zones will be established and a Tree Protection and
Preservation Plan developed after construction drawings are available.

Design recommendations
       1. The Project Arborist shall review all project plans with regard to tree impact
          and necessary protection measures.

        2. Trunk locations of trees to be preserved shall be included on all plans.

        3. A TREE PROTECTION ZONE shall be established around each tree to be
           preserved. No grading, excavation, construction or storage of materials shall
           occur within that zone without arborist approval and supervision. Refer to the
           Tree Assessment Plan for layout of the tree protection zones.

        4. Underground services including utilities, sub-drains, water or sewer shall be
           routed around the TREE PROTECTION ZONE. Where encroachment cannot be
           avoided, special construction techniques such as hand digging or tunneling
           under roots shall be employed where necessary to minimize root injury.

        5. Irrigation systems must be designed so that no trenching will occur within the
           TREE PROTECTION ZONE.

Pre-construction and demolition treatments and recommendations
       1. The demolition contractor shall meet with the Project Arborist or the City's
           Landscape Architect and/or Urban Forester before beginning work to discuss
           work procedures and tree protection.

        2. Tree(s) to be removed that have branches extending into the canopy of
           tree(s) to remain must be removed by a qualified arborist and not by
           demolition or construction contractors. The qualified arborist shall remove the
           tree in a manner that causes no damage to the tree(s) and understory to
           remain. Stumps shall be ground below grade.
        3. Trees to be removed shall be felled so as to fall away from TREE PROTECTION
           ZONE and avoid pulling and breaking of roots of trees to remain. If roots are
           entwined, the Project Arborist or the City's Landscape Architect and/or Urban
           Forester may require first severing the major woody root mass before
           extracting the trees, or grinding the stump below ground.
        4. All down brush and trees shall be removed from the TREE PROTECTION ZONE
           either by hand, or with equipment sitting outside the TREE PROTECTION ZONE.
           Extraction shall occur by lifting the material out, not by skidding across the
           ground.
        5. Structures and underground features to be removed within the TREE
           PROTECTION ZONE shall use equipment that will minimize damage to trees
           above and below ground, and operate from outside the TREE PROTECTION
           ZONE. Tie back branches and wrap trunks with protective materials to protect
            from injury as directed by the Project Arborist or the City's Landscape
            Architect and/or Urban Forester. The Project Arborist or the City's Landscape
            Architect and/or Urban Forester shall be on-site during all operations within
            the TREE PROTECTION ZONE to monitor demolition activity.
         6. Fence all trees to be retained to completely enclose the TREE PROTECTION
            ZONE prior to demolition, grubbing or grading. Fences shall be 6 ft. chain link.
            Fences are to remain until all grading and construction is completed.

        7. Prune trees to be preserved to clean the crown and to provide clearance. All
           pruning shall be completed by a Certified Arborist or Tree Worker and adhere
           to the Tree Pruning Guidelines of the International Society of Arboriculture.

        8. Apply and maintain 4-6" wood chip mulch within the TREE PROTECTION ZONE.

Tree protection during construction
       1. Prior to beginning work, the contractors working in the vicinity of trees to be
           preserved are required to meet with the Project Arborist at the site to review
           all work procedures, access routes, storage areas and tree protection
           measures.

        2. Prior to grading, pad preparation, excavation for foundations/footings/walls,
           trenching, trees may require root pruning outside the TREE PROTECTION ZONE
           by cutting all roots cleanly to the depth of the excavation. The Project
           Arborist or the City's Landscape Architect and Urban Forester will identify
           where root pruning is required.

        3. Any grading, construction, demolition or other work that is expected to
           encounter tree roots should be monitored by the Project Arborist or the City's
           Landscape Architect and/or Urban Forester.

        4. Roots that cannot be preserved shall be cut by manually digging a trench
           and cutting exposed roots with a sharp saw. The Project Arborist or the City's
           Landscape Architect and/or Urban Forester will identify where root pruning is
           required.

        5. If injury should occur to any tree during construction, it should be evaluated
           as soon as possible by the Project Arborist or the City's Landscape Architect
           and Urban Forester so that appropriate treatments can be applied.

        6. Fences have been erected to protect trees to be preserved. Fences define a
           specific TREE PROTECTION ZONE for each tree or group of trees. Fences are
           to remain until all site work has been completed. Fences may not be
           relocated or removed without permission of the Project Arborist or the City's
           Landscape Architect and Urban Forester.

        7. Construction trailers, traffic and storage areas must remain outside fenced
           areas at all times.

        8. All underground utilities, drain lines or irrigation lines shall be routed outside
           the TREE PROTECTION ZONE. If lines must traverse through the protection
           area, they shall be tunneled or bored under the tree as directed by the
           Project Arborist or the City's Landscape Architect and Urban Forester.
        9. No materials, equipment, soil, waste or wash-out water may be deposited,
           stored, or parked within the TREE PROTECTION ZONE (fenced area).

        10. Any additional tree pruning needed for clearance during construction must be
            performed by a qualified arborist and not by construction personnel.

        11. Soil from trench, footing, utility or other excavation shall not be placed within
            the TREE PROTECTION ZONE, neither temporarily nor permanently.

Maintenance of impacted trees
Preserved trees will experience a physical environment different from that pre-
development. As a result, tree health and structural stability should be monitored.
Occasional pruning, fertilization, mulch, pest management, replanting and irrigation may
be required. In addition, provisions for monitoring both tree health and structural stability
following construction must be made a priority. As trees age, the likelihood of failure of
branches or entire trees increases. Therefore, annual inspection for hazard potential is
recommended.

                           Background

                           The two samples received 2/12 were identified as representing on site topsoil from 1 to 8
                           inches from areas that will be amended for planting turf, groundcover, trees and shrubs.
                           Sample #2 was additionally labeled as the North Tennis area.

                           Analytical Results

                           Soil texture is similar in both areas and these fall in the sandy clay loam classification by
                           USDA standards. Moderate levels of organic matter are present and based on these
                           characteristics the infiltration rate is estimated at 0.29 inch per hour.

                           Reaction values are the primary variation between these two areas. Sample 1 is slightly
                           alkaline and there is a low level of lime present. This would still be fine for most plants.
                           Sample 2 is slightly acidic and with no lime this is in the ideal range for most plants.
                           Salinity, boron and sodium are safely low and the SAR values show soluble sodium well
                           balanced by calcium and magnesium.

                           Nutritional data show both low in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. Sulfate is
                           low only in 1 with the other required nutrients in sufficient ranges. The levels of the
                           micronutrients are lower in as a reflection of its alkaline pH.

                           While it will not affect the recommendations below, the lab has been asked to rerun the
                           extractable calcium test on #1 because I suspect the value may be low. A follow up note
                           will follow.

                           Recommendations

                           To improve drainage of the root zone any undisturbed or compacted planting areas
                           should first be loosened to at least a 10-inch depth. Where plant spacing is close enough
                           to warrant general surface amending the following materials should be evenly spread
                           and thoroughly incorporated to a depth of 6 inches:

                               Amount / 1000 Square Feet
For both areas*
                       4-1/2 cubic yards      Nitrogen Stabilized Organic Amendment
                              13 pounds       6-24-24 Commercial Fertilizer

*If any areas represented by sample 1 are dominated by plants sensitive to alkalinity, sulfur could
be included at a rate of 10 pounds per 1000 square feet.

The amendment rate suggested is based on a minimum organic matter content of 270 pounds per
cubic yard of amendment and this may be adjusted depending on the organic content of the
amendment selected. If nutrient-rich compost is used, then it may be suitable to omit or reduce the
rate of 6-24-24. This should be based on confirming nutrient value of the selected compost.

To Prepare Backfill:

·     Excavate planting pits at least twice as wide as the diameter of the rootball.
·     Soil immediately below the root ball should be left undisturbed to provide support but the
      bottom around the sides should be cultivated to improve porosity.
·     The top of the rootball should be at or slightly above final grade.
·     The top 12-inches of backfill around the sides of the rootball of trees and shrubs may consist of the
      above amended soil or may be prepared as follows:

                                   3 parts      Pulverized Site Soil
                                    1 part      Organic Amendment
    Uniformly blended with:
                               Amount / Cubic Yard of Backfill

                              *3/4 pound      6-24-24 Commercial Fertilizer

                 Also 1/2 pound sulfur at 1 only if plants are sensitive to alkalinity.
                    *Possible omit the 6-24-24 if using Greenwaste Compost.

-Backfill below 12 inches required for 24-inch box or larger material should not contain the organic
amendment or sulfur but should be blended with 3/4 pound 6-24-24 per cubic yard.

·     Ideally a weed and turf free zone should be maintained just beyond the diameter of the planting
      hole. A 2-inch deep layer of coarse mulch can be placed around the tree or shrub but should be
      kept a minimum 4 inches from the trunk.
·     Irrigation of new plantings should take into consideration the differing texture of the rootball and
      surrounding soil to maintain adequate moisture in both during this critical period of
      establishment.

Maintenance

Initial maintenance fertilization may rely on a program that applies ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) at a
rate of 5 pounds per 1000 square feet. The first application should be three weeks after planting with
retreatment scheduled at 45 to 60-day intervals. Alternatively, slow release Sulfur Coated Urea (43-0-0)
may be applied at a 5-pound rate with refertilization scheduled at 3-month intervals. Once the
landscape has become well established the frequency of fertilization should be decreased depending on
color and rate of growth desired. In the fall and spring substitute a complete fertilizer such as 16-6-8 to
help insure continuing adequate phosphorus and potassium.

If an organic program will be utilized, then the amendment should be Greenwaste Compost and
instead of the 6-24-24 an organic nitrogen fertilizer should be incorporated along with the above or
applied as a topdress at the time of planting. Blood Meal (12-0-0) provides available nitrogen fairly
rapidly while materials such as Feather Meal (12-0-0) are slower to provide available nitrogen, but
they extend the length of time they make this contribution.

In order to provide a good supply of nitrogen for a 3-4 month time frame a good combination would
be 8 pounds Blood Meal and 16 pounds Feather Meal per 1000 square feet.

The long term maintenance program should consider fall and spring and fall applications of an
organic fertilizer blend such as Ringer 10-2-6 Lawn Restore or E. B. Stone 10-1-4 Lawn that would
also supplement phosphorus and potassium nutrition to a greater extent.

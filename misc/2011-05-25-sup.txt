1.0          INTRODUCTION

1.1          BACKGROUND
This Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) supplements the Vineyards at Marsh Creek and
Annexation Sites EIR (Vineyards EIR) certified by the City of Brentwood (City) in 2004 for the
Vineyards at Marsh Creek development (Vineyards Project). This SEIR has been prepared to analyze the
potential environmental effects that may result from the New Brentwood Center community college use
proposed on a portion of the Pioneer Square site within the Vineyards Project. The community college
use would replace the Mixed-Use Business Park uses for which the Pioneer Square site is currently
designated. The proposed New Brentwood Center (project) would be located in the City of Brentwood,
Contra Costa County, California, and this SEIR is being prepared, circulated and acted upon pursuant to
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code [PRC] Section 21000 et seq.),
and the CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations [CCR] Title 14, Section 15000 et seq.).

CEQA requires California public agencies to consider the environmental consequences of projects for
which they have discretionary authority. The public agency with the principal responsibility for carrying
out or approving a project is the "lead agency." CEQA requires the lead agency to prepare an EIR if there
is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record, that a project may have a significant effect on the
environment. A significant effect is defined by CEQA as a substantial and adverse physical change in the
environment. The Contra Costa Community College District (District) is the lead agency for the
proposed project.

According to CEQA Guidelines Section 15163, when an EIR has been certified for a project and changes
are later proposed, a lead agency may choose to prepare a Supplement to an EIR rather than a Subsequent
EIR if:

      "(1) Any of the conditions described in Section 15162 would require the preparation of a subsequent
           EIR; and
      (2) Only minor additions or changes would be necessary to make the previous EIR adequately
           apply to the project in the changed situation."

The Supplement to an EIR need contain only the information necessary to make the previous EIR
adequate for the project as revised. In addition, the Supplement to an EIR is given the same public notice
and review period as is given to a Draft EIR but may be circulated by itself without recirculating the
previous Draft or Final EIR.

Section 15162 requires preparation of a Subsequent EIR when:

      "(1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the
           previous EIR or Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental
           effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects;
      (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is
           undertaken which will require major revisions to the previous EIR or Negative Declaration due
           to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the
           severity of previously identified significant effects; or
      (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been
           known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified as
           complete or the Negative Declaration was adopted, shows any of the following:


Draft · February 2011                               1-1                                         Introduction
New Brentwood Center
Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




           (A)   The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR or
                 Negative Declaration;
           (B)   Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in
                 the previous EIR;
           (C)   Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be
                 feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but
                 the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or
           (D)   Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed
                 in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the
                 environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or
                 alternative."

1.2            PURPOSE OF SEIR
As stated above, this SEIR supplements the Vineyards EIR certified by the City in 2004 for the Vineyards
Project. As part of the Vineyards Project, the Vineyards EIR analyzed approximately 27 acres of mixed-
use development on what was then referred to as the "Village Center" and what was later renamed
"Pioneer Square." Approved Mixed-Use Business Park uses at Pioneer Square include commercial,
office, senior apartments, hotel and conference center, and assisted care facilities. Additionally, the
Vineyards EIR analyzed approximately 29 acres of nearby land proposed for annexation to the City and
development of a future community college by the District for a maximum of 5,000 students. This land,
referred to as the "Cowell Property," was one of two annexation sites studied in the Vineyards EIR and
was later annexed into the City.

The project (refer to Chapter 3, Project Description, for greater detail) that this SEIR analyzes is that
earlier community college proposal by the District in a new location: 17 acres of the 27-acre Pioneer
Square site. Although the project represents the District's desire to move its proposed community college
campus from the Cowell Property to a portion of the Pioneer Square site, no change in the City's
Community College land use designation on the Cowell Property is proposed at this time. The proposed
project would use 17 acres of the 27-acre Pioneer Square site for community college use instead of the
Mixed-Use Business Park uses for which the 17 acres are designated.

This SEIR contains the information, analysis, additions or other revisions that, when used in combination
with the information and analysis in the Vineyards EIR, provides adequate and useful information to the
District's decision-makers and public regarding the project and its alternatives. This SEIR does not result
in substantial changes, nor require major revisions to the Vineyards EIR. Instead, the information,
analysis, additions or other revisions in this SEIR are largely limited to portions of the Vineyards EIR
addressing Pioneer Square. As such, this SEIR is circulated by itself; copies of this SEIR and the
Vineyards EIR can be found at the Contra Costa Community College District, 500 Court Street, Martinez,
CA 94553.

1.3            SCOPE OF SEIR
The District prepared and distributed a Notice of Preparation (NOP), dated November 18, 2010, for the
proposed project. An NOP is a document that is sent by a lead agency to notify responsible and trustee
agencies and interested parties that the lead agency plans to prepare an EIR for a proposed project. The
purpose of an NOP is to solicit comments and identify specific environmental issues that should be
considered in the EIR.

The NOP was sent via certified mail to responsible and trustee agencies, neighboring property owners and
the State Clearinghouse for a 30-day public review period, extending from November 19 to December 20,
2010. The NOP and written comments received from responsible and trustee agencies, and interested
parties are contained in Appendix A (Notice of Preparation and Public Comments). A summary of the
comments received and responses to those comments is provided in Table 1-1 (Summary of NOP
Comments and Responses).

                                      encroachment permit would be needed to
                                      access CCWD's easement during construction.

The scope of this SEIR is limited to specific topics necessary to make the Vineyards EIR adequately
apply to the proposed project in the changed circumstances. Based on this, the District determined that
the following issues should be addressed in the SEIR:

    ·    Air Quality
    ·    Greenhouse Gas Emissions
    ·    Transportation/Traffic



Draft · February 2011                                          1-3                                                   Introduction
New Brentwood Center
Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




Resource areas that do not require revisions or updates in this SEIR include: aesthetic/visual resources;
agricultural resources; biological resources; cultural resources; geology, soils, seismicity and mineral
resources; hazards and hazardous materials; hydrology, drainage and water quality; land use and
planning; noise; population and housing; public services; and utilities and service systems. A summary of
the findings concerning these issues is included below, under Section 1.4 (Resource Areas that Do Not
Require Revisions or Updates in the SEIR).

In addition to the resource areas mentioned above that do not require revisions or updates in this SEIR,
the following topics presented in the Vineyards EIR are not restated or re-evaluated: cumulative impacts
for the resource areas not evaluated in the SEIR, growth inducing impacts and significant irreversible
changes.

1.4            RESOURCE AREAS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE REVISIONS OR
               UPDATES IN SEIR
The following provides the substantial evidence supporting the determination that certain resource areas
covered in the Vineyards EIR do not require revision or update in this SEIR in order to adequately
provide impact, mitigation and alternative analysis for the proposed project.

1.4.1          AESTHETICS/VISUAL RESOURCES

The Vineyards EIR found that with implementation of mitigation measures, impacts on aesthetics and
visual resources would be less than significant. As discussed in the Vineyards EIR, there was significant
public involvement and input regarding the design of the Vineyards Project. A key concern related to the
Pioneer Square site was the potential for new development to alter views when looking north from the
John Marsh House. Development of the proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in
significantly different aesthetic concerns when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park
uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR because both uses would result in a permanent change in the visual
character of the site that would be similar in scale and intensity of development. In addition, due to the
location of Pioneer Square at a relatively low elevation and its nearly flat topography, development with
either use would not disturb or obstruct views of ridgelines. Furthermore, both uses would introduce new
sources of light and glare that would be similar (i.e., parking lot and building lighting).

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of aesthetic/visual resources in the SEIR. Mitigation measures presented in the
Vineyards EIR to reduce aesthetic/visual resources impacts on the Pioneer Square site that would be
applicable to the proposed project are included in Appendix B (Applicable Mitigation Measures).

1.4.2          AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES

The Vineyards EIR found that impacts to agricultural resources would be less than significant.
Development of the proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in significantly different
agricultural concerns when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in
the Vineyards EIR because both uses would occur in the same area, and that particular area was identified
as Farmland of Local Importance, which has not changed since certification of the Vineyards EIR.
Furthermore, the Pioneer Square site was not zoned for agricultural uses, nor was it under a Williamson
Act contract at the time the Vineyards EIR was certified and that circumstance has not changed. Finally,
both uses would be limited to construction on the Pioneer Square site and would not extend infrastructure
into nearby agricultural land or cause other physical changes that would result in the conversion of
farmland to non-agricultural uses.


Introduction                                       1-4                                Draft · February 2011
                                                                                        New Brentwood Center
                                                                     Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of agricultural resources in the SEIR.

1.4.3        BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The Vineyards EIR found that with implementation of mitigation measures, impacts on biological
resources would be less than significant. Since certification of the Vineyards EIR, the project site has
been graded for future development associated with the Vineyards Project. As a result, wildlife habitat
has been disturbed and existing seasonal wetlands have been filled. To allow this, authorization/permits
were obtained from the following federal and state regulatory agencies:

    ·    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) ­ Formal consultation in accordance with Section 7 of
         the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA). In a letter dated October 29, 2004, USFWS stated
         that it expects that incidental take of California red-legged frog, California tiger salamander, San
         Joaquin kit fox, and vernal pool fairy shrimp may occur with implementation the Vineyards
         Project but would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of these species.
    ·    U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) ­ Authorization to fill seasonal wetlands pursuant to
         Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to allow filling of seasonal wetlands (April 6, 2005).
    ·    California Water Quality Control Board ­ Water quality certification for fill of seasonal wetlands
         under Section 401 of the CWA (June 15, 2004).
    ·    California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) ­ Section 1602 Streambed Alternation
         Agreement for impacts to wetlands, sensitive natural communities, including alkali meadow,
         freshwater marsh/seep, seasonal wetlands, and Great Valley mixed riparian forest, and special-
         status wildlife species, including California red-legged frog, California tiger salamander, vernal
         pool fairy shrimp and western borrowing owl.

The Vineyards EIR found that with implementation of enumerated mitigation measures, impacts on
special-status species and riparian habitat would be less than significant. Many of these measures already
have been implemented. Development of the proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in
significantly different biological resource concerns when compared to development of the Mixed-Use
Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR because the project site has been graded resulting in
disturbance to existing wildlife habitat and filling of wetlands. Furthermore, both uses would occur
within the same area at a similar scale and intensity of development.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of biological resources in the SEIR. In certain instances, the proposed project
does not have to perform the mitigation because the mitigation has already been completed, such as the
acquisition of habitat. However, in other instances the proposed project would be required to implement
applicable measures identified in the Vineyards EIR (e.g., pre-construction surveys). Mitigation measures
presented in the Vineyards EIR to reduce biological resources impacts at the Pioneer Square site that
would be applicable to the proposed project are included in Appendix B.

1.4.4        CULTURAL RESOURCES

The Vineyards EIR found that with implementation of mitigation measures, impacts on historical,
archaeological and paleontological resources, and human remains would be less than significant. The
proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions or updates to
the analysis of cultural resources in the SEIR because both the New Brentwood Center and the Mixed-
Use Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR would disturb the same area, and that particular



Draft · February 2011                                1-5                                         Introduction

Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




area contains a portion of a recorded pre-historic archaeological site (CCO-548) and could potentially
contain previously unrecorded cultural resources.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of cultural resources in the SEIR. Mitigation measures presented in the
Vineyards EIR to reduce impacts to cultural resources at the Pioneer Square site that would be applicable
to the proposed project are included in Appendix B.

1.4.5          GEOLOGY, SOILS, SEISMICITY AND MINERAL RESOURCES

The Vineyards EIR found that with implementation of mitigation measures, impacts associated with
geology, soils, seismicity and mineral resources would be less than significant. Development of the
proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in significantly different concerns when compared to
development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR because both uses
would occur in the same area and would be similar in scale and intensity of development. The project
site could be subject to strong ground shaking during an earthquake on one of the many active faults in
the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, buildings, roads and other structures associated with either use
have the potential to be damaged, if not properly treated, as a result of soil within the area that is
moderately to highly expansive. Furthermore, Pioneer Square does not have any mapped earthquake fault
segments running through it, nor did it have any at the time the Vineyards EIR was certified. The
Vineyards EIR determined that soils on the Pioneer Square site were not highly erodible or prone to
liquefaction and those conditions have not changed since the certification of the EIR. Moreover, the
Vineyards EIR did not find any evidence of previous slope failure at Pioneer Square and there has been
no evidence of slope failure since certification of the EIR. The Vineyards EIR also found that the site is
relatively flat resulting in a low potential for landslides and this condition has not changed either. Finally,
according to the Vineyard EIR, Pioneer Square does not have any mineral resources and none have been
identified since the certification of the EIR.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of geology, soils, seismicity and mineral resources in the SEIR. Mitigation
measures presented in the Vineyards EIR to reduce impacts at the Pioneer Square site that would be
applicable to the proposed project are included in Appendix B.

1.4.6          HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

The Vineyards EIR found that with implementation of mitigation measures, impacts associated with
hazards and hazardous materials would be less than significant. Development of the proposed New
Brentwood Center would not result in significantly different hazards and hazardous materials concerns
when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR
because both uses would occur within the same area and would be similar in scale and intensity of
development. The project site contains two underground natural gas pipelines and construction of either
use could potentially damage those pipelines. Moreover, hazardous materials associated with construction
activities could be accidentally discharged during the construction of either use, but this would not
represent a significant hazard since the amount of chemicals would be limited and they would be handled
in compliance with existing governmental regulations and procedures. In addition, both uses would result
in the storage and usage of limited amounts of household hazardous materials (i.e., fertilizers, pesticides,
cleaning solutions, aerosols, solvents) that would not pose a significant risk to human health or the
environment.




Introduction                                          1-6                                 Draft · February 2011
                                                                                        New Brentwood Center
                                                                     Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




According to the Vineyards EIR, the Pioneer Square site is not listed as a hazardous materials site
pursuant to California Government Code §65962.5. The California Environmental Protection Agency's
Cortese List website was consulted in September 2010 and no new active sites were listed. Furthermore,
Pioneer Square was not located near a public or private airport at the time the Vineyards EIR was certified
and no airports have been constructed near the site since then. As indicated in the Vineyards EIR,
development within the Vineyards Project would not impair or interfere with the City's Emergency
Operations Plan. Construction of the New Brentwood Center on the Pioneer Square site would not
involve any components that would prevent City departments, emergency agencies, and government
officials from implementing the Emergency Operations Plan during a major emergency. Construction of
the proposed project would not physically block or interfere with a component of the plan, such as an
emergency evacuation route. Finally, at the time the Vineyards EIR was certified, Pioneer Square was
adjacent to a vast amount of open space subject to wildland fire. The Vineyards EIR determined that the
combination of fire prevention and suppression components would reduce wildland fire risks. This
circumstance has not changed.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of hazards and hazardous materials in the SEIR. Mitigation measures presented
in the Vineyards EIR to reduce impacts at the Pioneer Square site that would be applicable to the
proposed project are included in Appendix B.

1.4.7        HYDROLOGY, DRAINAGE AND WATER QUALITY

The Vineyards EIR found that with implementation of mitigation measures, impacts associated with
hydrology, drainage and water quality would be less than significant. Development of the proposed New
Brentwood Center would not result in significantly different concerns with hydrology, drainage and water
quality when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards
EIR because both uses would occur within the same area, would be similar in scale and intensity of
development, and would be required to prepare and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP), which would reduce potential impacts to water quality. In addition, the New Brentwood Center
would result in a similar amount of impervious surface area as the Mixed-Use Business Park uses
contemplated for the Pioneer Square site by the Vineyards EIR and for this reason the Vineyards
stormwater management system could accommodate stormwater from the New Brentwood Center
project. Moreover, the development intensity of the New Brentwood Center would be similar to the
development intensity that was assumed for Pioneer Square by the Vineyards EIR and, thus, the New
Brentwood Center would not exceed the City's water supplies or increase groundwater pumping. Finally,
as documented in the Vineyard EIR, Pioneer Square is not located within a FEMA 100-year flood hazard
zone or near a source of seiche or tsunami waves and this has not changed since certification of the EIR.
As a result, neither use would result in impacts associated with these concerns.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of hydrology, drainage and water quality in the SEIR.

1.4.8        LAND USE AND PLANNING

The Vineyards EIR found that land use and planning impacts would be less than significant. While the
District is not subject to local land use regulations or ordinances when using property in furtherance of its
educational purposes, the District nonetheless chose this site because of the compatibility of its proposed
community college use with the surrounding mixed-use business and residential uses (refer to Chapter 3,
Project Description, for greater detail on the goals and objectives of the proposed project).



Draft · February 2011                                1-7                                         Introduction
New Brentwood Center
Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




1.4.9          NOISE

With implementation of mitigation measures, short-term construction and long-term operational noise
associated with the Vineyards Project were found to be less than significant in the Vineyards EIR.
Development of the proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in significantly different noise
concerns when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards
EIR because both uses would occur in the same area, would be similar in scale and intensity of
development, and would produce similar noise levels. These noise levels would not exceed the
established criteria/threshold levels. Additionally, although the District, as a state educational institution,
is exempt from local land use regulations and ordinances, the construction of the New Brentwood Center
would nevertheless comply with the exterior noise level as specified in the City's Municipal Code.
Furthermore, given the distance of Pioneer Square from existing buildings, vibration associated with
construction of both uses would not damage existing structures. Finally, as identified in the Vineyards
EIR, Pioneer Square is not located near a public or private airport and would not be affected by noise
from an airport. This condition has not changed since certification of the EIR.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of noise in the SEIR. Mitigation measures presented in the Vineyards EIR to
reduce noise impacts at the Pioneer Square site that would be applicable to the proposed project are
included in Appendix B.

1.4.10         POPULATION AND HOUSING

The Vineyards EIR found that impacts associated with population and housing would be less than
significant. Development of the proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in significantly
different concerns when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in the
Vineyards EIR because neither use would result in a substantial increase in population beyond previously
planned and projected conditions. Furthermore, Pioneer Square was undeveloped at the time the
Vineyards EIR was certified and is currently undeveloped; therefore, as with the Mixed-Use Business
Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR, the New Brentwood Center would not displace housing units or
people.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of population and housing in the SEIR.

1.4.11         PUBLIC SERVICES

The Vineyards EIR found that impacts associated with public services would be less than significant.
Development of the proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in significantly different concerns
when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR
because both uses would occur within the same area, would be similar in scale and intensity of
development, and could be adequately served by existing public service providers. As identified in the
Vineyards EIR, the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District (ECCFPD) has adequate facilities to serve
the Vineyards Project within an acceptable response time and no new facilities would be required.
Moreover, existing District police personnel would provide services to the New Brentwood Center and no
expansion of police facilities would be required. In addition, the jobs created by the New Brentwood
Center would not induce substantial population growth, resulting in an increase of school-aged children
that could affect school capacity. Furthermore, the students attending the New Brentwood Center would
not increase demand for park facilities any more than residents, employees or visitors to the Mixed-Use
Business Park uses analyzed in the Vineyards EIR. Finally, the New Brentwood Center would not result


Introduction                                          1-8                                 Draft · February 2011
                                                                                       New Brentwood Center
                                                                    Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




in the need for any other additional public facilities in the project vicinity such as libraries, community
centers, new roadways or government buildings.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of public services in the SEIR.

1.4.12       UTILITIES AND SERVICE SYSTEMS

The Vineyards EIR found that impacts associated with utilities and service systems would be less than
significant. Development of the proposed New Brentwood Center would not result in significantly
different concerns when compared to development of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses analyzed in the
Vineyards EIR because both uses would occur within the same area, would be similar in scale and
intensity of development, and could be adequately served by existing utilities. As described in the
Vineyards EIR, the City has sufficient water supplies to serve the Vineyards Project without impacting
service to existing customers. In addition, the Vineyards EIR found that the City's wastewater treatment
plant has sufficient capacity to meet the wastewater treatment of the Vineyards Project, while also
accommodating existing uses. Finally, the Vineyards EIR determined that the Vineyards Project would
not exceed the permitted daily capacity of the Keller Canyon Landfill.

Therefore, the proposed project does not present a significant change in circumstances requiring revisions
or updates to the analysis of utilities and service systems in the SEIR.

1.5          ADDITIONAL ALTERNATIVE
CEQA requires that a reasonable range of alternatives be discussed in an EIR. The Vineyards EIR
provides and analyzes such a reasonable range. This SEIR further expands the reasonable range of
alternatives in the Vineyards EIR by providing an alternative land use for the Cowell Property, now that
the District wishes to move its community college use from the Cowell Property to the Pioneer Square
site. The District believes that a second community college campus would never be developed on the
Cowell Property if one is developed on the Pioneer Square site. The City's determinations regarding the
feasibility, acceptance and/or rejection of such alternative will be address and resolved at a later date.

1.6          ORGANIZATION OF SEIR
The SEIR is organized into the following chapters:

Chapter 1, Introduction: Provides an introduction and overview that describes the purpose of the SEIR,
summarizes the SEIR process, identifies the substantial evidence supporting the determination that certain
impact areas covered in the Vineyards EIR do not require revision or update in this SEIR in order to

1.7            TERMINOLOGY USED IN SEIR
This SEIR uses the following terminology to denote the significance of environmental impacts of the
proposed project:

      ·   A "beneficial impact" is an environmental impact that would be a positive contribution or
          improvement to the physical conditions that exist in the area affected by the project.
      ·   An "environmental impact" is a direct or indirect effect that would be caused by the project that
          constitutes a physical change to the existing natural or man-made conditions within the area
          affected by the project.
      ·   "No impact" is the lack of any environmental impact, and no mitigation is required.
      ·   A "less than significant" impact or an impact that is "not significant" is an environmental impact
          that would cause no substantial adverse change in the environment and, as such, requires no
          mitigation.
      ·   A "potentially significant" or "significant" impact is an environmental impact that could or would
          cause a substantial adverse change in the environment. In such a case, an impact has been
          identified that, although potentially significant, can be avoided or reduced to less than significant
          levels through mitigation. Such mitigation may include project design features that have been
          incorporated into the project or existing requirements, such as municipal code or ordinance,
          engineering and design requirements (e.g., Uniform Building Code), and standard regulations set
          by regional, state and federal agencies. A further description of mitigation measures is provided
          below.
      ·   A "significant and unavoidable" impact is an environmental impact that could or would cause a
          substantial adverse change in the environment and cannot be avoided if the project is
          implemented; mitigation may be recommended, but would not reduce the impact to a less than
          significant level.
      ·   "Mitigation measures" are defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15370 as:
          ­ Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action
          ­ Minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its
              implementation
          ­ Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment

          ­   Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
              during the life of the action
          ­   Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments

1.8.3          CERTIFICATION OF FINAL SEIR AND PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS

For a period of at least ten days prior to any public hearing during which the lead agency will take action
to certify the SEIR, the Final SEIR will be made available to, at a minimum, the responsible and trustee
agencies that provided written comments on the Draft SEIR. The Final SEIR must be certified before the
lead agency can take action on the project.

After the SEIR is certified, the District will begin evaluating the merits of the project and conduct public
hearings to decide whether to approve the proposed project or not. Before approving (or conditionally
approving) the project, the District must prepare a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
(MMRP). The District must also prepare CEQA findings that briefly explain the rationale behind the
finding for each significant impact identified for the project, and, if an impact cannot be mitigated to a
less than significant level but the District as lead agency still decides to approve the project, a Statement
of Overriding Considerations.

Certification of the Final SEIR and approval of the CEQA findings, MMRP and Statement of Overriding
Considerations may be considered during the final public hearing. The certification of the Final SEIR
must be first in the sequence of approvals.

2.0          DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT CHANGES, CHANGED
             CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEW INFORMATION

2.1          INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes the project changes, changes in circumstances and new information that are
relevant to the discussion of potentially significant impacts associated with the proposed New Brentwood
Center project. The three topics discussed in this chapter are:

      ·   A change in the location of the proposed community college campus
      ·   New Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) CEQA Air Quality Guidelines
      ·   Revised estimates of cumulative traffic conditions

The updated environmental analysis required because of such project changes, changes in circumstances
and new information is presented in Chapter 4 (Environmental Analysis) of this SEIR.

2.2          CHANGE IN LOCATION OF COLLEGE CAMPUS
As described in Chapter 3 (Project Description), this SEIR supplements the Vineyards at Marsh Creek
and Annexation Sites EIR (Vineyards EIR) certified by the City of Brentwood (City) in 2004 for the
Vineyards at Marsh Creek project (Vineyards Project).

As part of the Vineyards Project, the Vineyards EIR analyzed approximately 27 acres of mixed-use
development on what was then referred to as the "Village Center" and what was later renamed "Pioneer
Square." Approved Mixed-Use Business Park uses at Pioneer Square include commercial, office, senior
apartments, hotel and conference center, and assisted care facilities. Additionally, the Vineyards EIR
analyzed approximately 29 acres of nearby land proposed for annexation to the City and development of a
future community college by the Contra Costa Community College District (District) for a maximum of
5,000 students. This land, referred to as the "Cowell Property," was one of two annexation sites studied
in the Vineyards EIR and was later annexed into the City.

The project change that this SEIR analyzes is that earlier community college proposal by the District in a
new location: 17 acres of the 27-acre Pioneer Square site. Although the project represents the relocation
of the community college land use from the Cowell Property to the Pioneer Square site, no change in land
use on the Cowell Property is proposed at this time. The proposed project would use 17 acres of the 27-
acre Pioneer Square site for community college use instead of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses for
which the 17 acres is designated. The potential environmental impacts of this project change are
presented and analyzed in detail in Chapter 4 of this SEIR.

2.3          NEW BAAQMD CEQA AIR QUALITY GUIDELINES
Since certification of the Vineyards EIR, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
adopted new CEQA Air Quality Guidelines in June 2010 to assist lead agencies in evaluating air quality
impacts of projects and plans proposed in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. The CEQA Air Quality
Guidelines provide BAAQMD-recommended procedures for evaluating potential air quality and
greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts during the environmental review process consistent with CEQA
requirements. In addition to providing new thresholds for GHG emissions, the 2010 CEQA Air Quality
Guidelines provide updated significance thresholds for criteria pollutants and supersede the BAAQMD's

previous CEQA guidance titled BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines: Assessing the Air Quality Impacts of
Projects and Plans (1999).

Senate Bill (SB) 97, signed in August 2007 (Chapter 185, Statutes of 2007; PRC Sections 21083.05 and
21097), acknowledges that climate change is a prominent environmental issue that requires analysis under
CEQA. This bill directed the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to prepare, develop and
transmit to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) guidelines for the feasible mitigation of GHG
emissions (or the effects of GHG emissions), as required by CEQA, by July 1, 2009. The Resources
Agency was required to certify and adopt those guidelines by January 1, 2010. On February 16, 2010, the
Office of Administration Law approved OPR's CEQA Guidelines Amendments, and filed them with the
Secretary of State for inclusion in the California Code of Regulations. The CEQA Guidelines
Amendments became effective on March 18, 2010.

The proposed project could produce criteria pollutants and generate both direct and indirect GHG
emissions that may exceed established thresholds and have a potentially significant impact on the
environment. The potential environmental impacts of this are presented and analyzed in detail in Chapter
4 of this SEIR.

2.4         NEW CUMULATIVE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
As noted above, the proposed project would relocate the community college land use contemplated on the
Cowell Property by the Vineyards Project and analyzed in the Vineyards EIR to a portion of the Pioneer
Square site. Although the community college land use would be affectively relocated to another site
within the Vineyard Project, the project does not propose land use change on the Cowell Property at this
time. This action would require separate approval by the City. Thus, the traffic impact analysis for the
proposed project assumes a community college land use on the Cowell Property as well as 17 acres of the
Pioneer Square site instead of Mixed-Use Business Park uses. While this scenario (two community
colleges in close proximity to one another) is unlikely, it is the only assumption that can be used in the
traffic analysis because a land use change on the Cowell Property has not yet been approved. The
proposed project's land use assumptions would result in a significant project impact at the State Route
4/Marsh Creek Road intersection under cumulative conditions. Because the East Contra Costa Regional
Fee and Financing Authority (ECCRFFA) Plan, which includes improvements are this intersection, is not
fully funded, this impact would be significant and unavoidable and must be analyzed in this SEIR.

The potential environmental impacts of such cumulative traffic conditions are presented and analyzed in
detail in Chapter 4 of this SEIR.

3.0          PROJECT DESCRIPTION

3.1          PROJECT BACKGROUND
As stated in Chapter 1 (Introduction), as part of the Vineyards Project, the Vineyards EIR analyzed
approximately 27 acres of mixed-use development on what was then referred to as the "Village Center"
and what was later renamed "Pioneer Square." Approved Mixed-Use Business Park uses at Pioneer
Square include commercial, office, senior apartments, hotel and conference center, and assisted care
facilities. Additionally, the Vineyards EIR analyzed approximately 29 acres of nearby land proposed for
annexation to the City and development of a future community college by the Contra Costa Community
College District (District) for a maximum of 5,000 students. This land, referred to as the "Cowell
Property," was one of two annexation sites studied in the Vineyards EIR and was later annexed into the
City.

The project (described in greater detail below) that this SEIR analyzes is that earlier community college
proposal by the District in a new location: 17 acres of the 27-acre Pioneer Square site. Although the
project represents the relocation of the Community College land use from the Cowell Property to the
Pioneer Square site, no change in land use on the Cowell Property is proposed at this time. The proposed
New Brentwood Center (project) would use 17 acres of the 27-acre Pioneer Square site for community
college use instead of the Mixed-Use Business Park uses for which the 17 acres is designated.

3.2          PROJECT LOCATION
The project site is located in the southern portion of Brentwood in eastern Contra Costa County (County),
and is generally west of the intersection of the State Route 4 (SR 4) Bypass and Marsh Creek Road. The
City is approximately 45 miles northeast of San Francisco and 65 miles southwest of Sacramento. Figure
3-1 (Regional Location Map) illustrates the regional location of the project site. As noted above, the site
is within the larger Vineyards Project area, and is a portion of Pioneer Square. As shown in Figure 3-2
(Local Vicinity), Pioneer Square is located northeast of Vineyards Parkway.

3.3          SURROUNDING LAND USES
The project site is surrounded by undeveloped land with some residential development and a private
athletic and resort club located to the northwest, and the historic John Marsh house located to the
southwest. Immediately north and west of the project site is relatively flat, undeveloped grassland that has
been graded. Further north and west, the topography transitions to grass covered rolling hills. Single-
family homes and Club Los Meganos, which includes tennis courts, swimming pools, exercise equipment,
a full-service spa and banquet/meeting facilities, are located in this area. Vineyards Parkway (which is
still under construction near the project site) and a vehicular bridge crossing over Marsh Creek abut the
site to the south and further south of Vineyards Parkway is vacant land that is part of the Vineyards
Project area (future winery site), as well as state park land and the historic John Marsh house. The land
immediately south of the project site is relatively flat and transitions to rolling hills further south. A
stormwater detention basin is generally located adjacent to the eastern side of the project site. Marsh
Creek is located further east of the stormwater detention basin and also borders the project site to the
north and south of the stormwater detention basin. Figure 3-2 depicts the land uses surrounding the
project site.

New Brentwood Center
Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




3.4          PROJECT SETTING

3.4.1        SITE CHARACTERISTICS

The project site is vacant land and has been graded for future development. Although the site is relatively
flat, there is a gentle slope that drops down into the site from Vineyards Parkway and from the site into
the stormwater detention basin and the Marsh Creek corridor. The site is covered with non-native annual
grasses and scattered valley oak (Quercus lobata) trees. A portion of a remnant concrete-lined irrigation
canal is located in the northern portion of the site.

3.4.2        LAND USE REGULATIONS

The project site has a City of Brentwood General Plan (General Plan) land use designation of Mixed-Use
Business Park and a zoning designation of Planned Development 64 (PD 64) District. The project site is
comprised of the following ten Assessor's Parcel Nos.: 007-570-001, -003, -004, -005, -006, -007, and
007-580-001, 003, -004 and -005. Under controlling law, the District, as a public educational institution,
is exempt from local planning regulations when using property in furtherance of its educational purposes.
Therefore, no amendments to the General Plan, Zoning, or other City regulations are needed for the
proposed project. Nonetheless, the District chose this site because of the compatibility of its proposed
community college use with the surrounding mixed-use business and residential uses (refer to Section 3.6,
Project Objectives, below, for greater detail on the goals and objectives of the proposed project). The
project will need approvals from other agencies, as further described under Section 3.7 (Intended Uses of
SEIR) below.

3.5          PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS
The project proposes the construction of a new education center, a satellite site of Los Medanos College,
that would serve a maximum of 5,000 full- and part-time students. The center would have a total of 80
full-time employees and 200 part-time employees, including faculty and staff. Refer to Figure 3-3
(Conceptual Site Plan).

As an education center, the proposed project would offer general education curriculum, but would not
function as a full-service community college campus. Consequently, it would be limited to classrooms,
laboratories and administrative and faculty offices, but would not have other uses typically associated
with a community college campus, such as a library, gymnasium, athletic fields, auditorium/theatre,
cafeteria, bookstore, student union or other student services and facilities.

3.5.1        CLASSROOM/OFFICE BUILDINGS

Two, approximately 42,000-square-foot buildings would be located in the center of the site for a total of
approximately 84,000 square feet of classroom/office space. Each building would be two-stories and
approximately 35 feet in height.

3.5.2        ACCESS, PARKING AND LANDSCAPING

As shown in Figure 3-3, a new circular roadway would provide access to the site from future Miwok
Avenue, which would intersect Vineyards Parkway. A total of approximately 1,366 parking spaces
would be provided in two surface lots.

                                                                      Supplemental Environmental Impact Report




A variety of drought-tolerant landscape materials would be planted throughout the site, including adjacent
to the proposed buildings, within the parking lots and along the perimeter of the site. In addition, several
existing mature oaks would be retained.

3.5.3         GRADING AND DRAINAGE

As noted previously, the project site has been graded for future development. However, additional
grading would be necessary to provide positive drainage for the project. In general, the site would be
graded so that it would drain to the adjacent stormwater detention basin.

3.5.4         INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES

The City would provide water, sanitary sewer, and solid waste and recycling collection service to the
proposed project. A potable water service main would be extended to the site from the City's existing
water system. A sewer line would be installed to convey wastewater from the site into the City's sewage
collection system, which flows to the City's sewage treatment plant. The City's Solid Waste Division
would provide solid waste disposal service to the project site. A storm drain system would be constructed
to convey surface water runoff to on-site catch basins or curb inlets and then to the adjacent stormwater
detention basin. Other service providers would include SBC for telephone service and Pacific Gas &
Electric for gas and electric service.

3.5.5         PHASING

The proposed project would be developed in two phases with construction of the first classroom/office
building and associated parking occurring within the next two to five years and construction of the second
classroom/office building occurring within the next ten to 15 years.

3.6           PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The District has identified the following project objectives:

      ·   Develop a 5,000-student education center in the City of Brentwood to better serve the existing
          and future needs of the District's present and future student population, at a location closer in
          proximity to parks/open space and future complimentary commercial uses at Pioneer Square
          (food, education supplies, recreation, etc.) so that students have the opportunity to attend classes
          and stay on or near campus during their school day reducing traffic, travel and related impacts
      ·   Facilitate easier access to the education center via multiple modes of transportation, including
          pedestrian, bicycle, automobile and public transit
      ·   Locate the education center in close proximity to future commercial uses at Pioneer Square
          providing businesses the opportunity to cater to and capture business from students and District
          faculty/staff, thereby ensuring the success of those businesses and their ability to provide goods
          and services to the students
      ·   Provide easy access to the education center for active adults and other current or future residents
          living near the education center

4.0           ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

4.1           INTRODUCTION
This chapter discusses the potential environmental impacts and presents the findings of the environmental
analysis conducted for the proposed project. The following environmental issues are evaluated in Sections
4.2 through 4.4: Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Traffic.

4.1.1         ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTER

Each of the sections in this chapter are organized as follows:

      ·   Existing Conditions are on-site and surrounding environmental conditions in existence at the
          time of publication of the Notice of Preparation (NOP), as well as relevant regulatory standards
          and requirements.
      ·   Environmental Analysis first specifies the applicable significance thresholds (i.e., criteria by
          which the level of significance of each potential impact is evaluated), and then describes changes
          that would result in the existing physical environment should the proposed project be
          implemented. The analysis focuses on the changes that might be significant impacts if the project
          is implemented.

Project impacts are identified within each section. A summary of the potential impact is presented first, its
level of significance is specified second, environmental analysis is provided third, and any required
mitigation is identified last. If mitigation is required, the section concludes with the residual level of
significance after mitigation.

4.1.2         MITIGATION MEASURES

Feasible mitigation measures are required when significant impacts are identified. Mitigation measures
must be fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally-binding instruments.
Each mitigation measure is numbered sequentially so that it directly correlates to the impact it addresses.

4.2          AIR QUALITY
This section evaluates air quality conditions associated with short- and long-term impacts resulting from
construction and operations of the proposed project. The analysis in this section is based primarily on the
Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (June 2010), the
Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan (September 2010), Air Quality Data (California Air Resources Board 2007
through 2009), and a traffic impact analysis (Brentwood Center Environmental Analysis Update) prepared
for the project by Fehr & Peers (dated September 20, 2010). Refer to Appendix C (Air Quality and
Greenhouse Gas Data) for the assumptions used in this analysis.

4.2.1        ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) divides the state into 15 air basins that share similar
meteorological and topographical features. The project site is located within the San Francisco Bay Area
Air Basin (Basin). This Basin comprises all of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the southern portion of Sonoma County, and the southwestern portion of
Solano County. Air quality in this area is determined by such natural factors as topography, meteorology
and climate, in addition to the presence of existing air pollution sources and ambient conditions. These
factors along with applicable regulations are discussed below.

The City of Brentwood is located within the Carquinez Strait climatological subregion of the Basin. The
Carquinez Strait runs from the City of Rodeo to the City of Martinez. It is the only sea-level gap between
the Bay and the Central Valley. The subregion includes the lowlands bordering the strait to the north and
south, and includes the area adjoining Suisun Bay and the western part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta as far east as Bethel Island. The subregion extends from Rodeo in the southwest and Vallejo in the
northwest to Fairfield in the northeast and Brentwood in the southeast. The Basin is characterized by
complex terrain, consisting of coastal mountain ranges, and inland valleys and bays, which distort normal
wind flow patterns. The gap in the western coast range is known as the Golden Gate, and the gap in the
eastern coast range is the Carquinez Strait. These gaps allow air to pass into and out of the Basin and the
Central Valley.

The climate is dominated by the strength and location of a semi-permanent, subtropical high-pressure cell.
During the summer, the Pacific high pressure cell is centered over the northeastern Pacific Ocean
resulting in stable meteorological conditions and a steady northwesterly wind flow. Upwelling of cold
ocean water from below to the surface because of the northwesterly flow produces a band of cold water
off the California coast. The cool and moisture-laden air approaching the coast from the Pacific Ocean is
further cooled by the presence of the cold water band resulting in condensation and the presence of fog
and stratus clouds along the northern California coast. In the winter, the Pacific high-pressure cell
weakens and shifts southward resulting in wind flow offshore, the absence of upwelling, and the
occurrence of storms. Weak inversions coupled with moderate winds result in a low air pollution
potential.

WIND PATTERNS

During the summer, winds flowing from the northwest are drawn inland through the Golden Gate and
over the lower portions of the San Francisco Peninsula. Immediately south of Mount Tamalpais, the
northwesterly winds accelerate considerably and come more directly from the west as they stream through
the Golden Gate. This channeling of wind through the Golden Gate produces a jet that sweeps eastward
and splits off to the northwest toward Richmond and to the southwest toward San Jose when it meets the
East Bay hills.

Supplemental Environmental Impact Report               




Wind speeds may be strong locally in areas where air is channeled through a narrow opening, such as the
Carquinez Strait, the Golden Gate or the San Bruno gap. For example, the average wind speed at San
Francisco International Airport in July is about 17 knots (from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.), compared with only
seven knots at San Jose and less than six knots at the Farallon Islands. The air flowing in from the coast
to the Central Valley, called the sea breeze, begins developing at or near ground level along the coast in
late morning or early afternoon. As the day progresses, the sea breeze layer deepens and increases in
velocity while spreading inland. The depth of the sea breeze depends in large part upon the height and
strength of the inversion. If the inversion is low and strong, and hence stable, the flow of the sea breeze
will be inhibited and stagnant conditions are likely to result.

In the winter, the Basin frequently experiences stormy conditions with moderate to strong winds, as well
as periods of stagnation with very light winds. Winter stagnation episodes are characterized by nighttime
drainage flows in coastal valleys. Drainage is a reversal of the usual daytime air-flow patterns; air moves
from the Central Valley toward the coast and back down toward the Bay from the smaller valleys within
the Basin.

TEMPERATURE

Summertime temperatures in the Basin are determined in large part by the effect of differential heating
between land and water surfaces. Because land tends to heat up and cool off more quickly than water, a
large-scale gradient (differential) in temperature is often created between the coast and the Central Valley,
and small-scale local gradients are often produced along the shorelines of the ocean and bays. The
temperature gradient near the ocean is also exaggerated, especially in summer, because of the upwelling
of cold ocean bottom water along the coast. On summer afternoons the temperatures at the coast can be
35 degrees Fahrenheit (ºF) cooler than temperatures 15 to 20 miles inland. At night this contrast usually
decreases to less than 10ºF. In the winter, the relationship of minimum and maximum temperatures is
reversed. During the daytime the temperature contrast between the coast and inland areas is small,
whereas at night the variation in temperature is large.

PRECIPITATION

The Basin is characterized by moderately wet winters and dry summers. Winter rains account for about
75 percent of the average annual rainfall. The amount of annual precipitation can vary greatly from one
part of the Basin to another even within short distances. In general, total annual rainfall can reach 40
inches in the mountains, but it is often less than 16 inches in sheltered valleys. During rainy periods,
ventilation (rapid horizontal movement of air and injection of cleaner air) and vertical mixing are usually
high and, thus, pollution levels tend to be low. However, frequent dry periods do occur during the winter
where mixing and ventilation are low and pollutant levels build up.

AIR POLLUTION POTENTIAL

The potential for high pollutant concentrations developing at a given location depends upon the quantity
of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere in the surrounding area or upwind, and the ability of the
atmosphere to disperse the contaminated air. The topographic and climatological factors discussed above
influence the atmospheric pollution potential of an area. Atmospheric pollution potential, as the term is
used here, is independent of the location of emission sources and is instead a function of factors described
below.

Wind Circulation

Low wind speed contributes to the buildup of air pollution because it allows more pollutants to be emitted
into the air mass per unit of time. Light winds occur most frequently during periods of low sun (fall and
winter, and early morning) and at night. These are also periods when air pollutant emissions from some
sources are at their peak, namely, commute traffic (early morning) and wood burning appliances
(nighttime). The problem can be compounded in valleys, when weak flows carry the pollutants upvalley
during the day, and cold air drainage flows move the air mass downvalley at night. Such restricted
movement of trapped air provides little opportunity for ventilation and leads to buildup of pollutants to
potentially unhealthful levels.

Inversions

An inversion is a layer of warmer air over a layer of cooler air. Inversions affect air quality conditions
significantly because they influence the mixing depth, which is the vertical depth in the atmosphere
available for diluting air contaminants near the ground. The highest air pollutant concentrations in the
Basin generally occur during inversions.

There are two types of inversions that occur regularly in the Basin. One is more common in the summer
and fall, while the other is most common during the winter. The frequent occurrence of elevated
temperature inversions in summer and fall months acts to cap the mixing depth, limiting the depth of air
available for dilution. Elevated inversions are caused by subsiding air from the subtropical high pressure
zone, and from the cool marine air layer that is drawn into the Basin by the heated low pressure region in
the Central Valley.

The inversions typical of winter, called radiation inversions, are formed as heat quickly radiates from the
earth's surface after sunset, causing the air in contact with it to rapidly cool. Radiation inversions are
strongest on clear, low-wind, cold winter nights, allowing the build-up of such pollutants as carbon
monoxide and particulate matter. When wind speeds are low, there is little mechanical turbulence to mix
the air, resulting in a layer of warm air over a layer of cooler air next to the ground. Mixing depths under
these conditions can be as shallow as 50 to 100 meters, particularly in rural areas. Urban areas usually
have deeper minimum mixing layers because of heat island effects and increased surface roughness.
During radiation inversions downwind transport is slow, the mixing depths are shallow, and turbulence is
minimal, all factors which contribute to ozone formation.

Although each type of inversion is most common during a specific season, either inversion mechanism
can occur at any time of the year. Sometimes both occur simultaneously. Moreover, the characteristics of
an inversion often change throughout the course of a day. The terrain of the Basin also induces
significant variations among subregions.

Solar Radiation

The frequency of hot, sunny days during the summer months in the Basin is another important factor that
affects air pollution potential. It is at the higher temperatures that ozone is formed. In the presence of
ultraviolet sunlight and warm temperatures, reactive organic gases and oxides of nitrogen react to form
secondary photochemical pollutants, including ozone. Because temperatures in many of the inland
valleys are so much higher than near the coast, the inland areas are especially prone to photochemical air
pollution. In late fall and winter, solar angles are low, resulting in insufficient ultraviolet light and
warming of the atmosphere to drive the photochemical reactions. Ozone concentrations do not reach
significant levels in the Basin during these seasons.

Supplemental Environmental Impact Report                 



Sheltered Terrain

The hills and mountains in the Basin contribute to the high pollution potential of some areas. During the
day, or at night during windy conditions, areas in the lee sides of mountains are sheltered from the
prevailing winds, thereby reducing turbulence and downwind transport. At night, when wind speeds are
low, the upper atmospheric layers are often decoupled from the surface layers during radiation conditions.
If elevated terrain is present, it will tend to block pollutant transport in that direction. Elevated terrain also
can create a recirculation pattern by inducing upvalley air flows during the day and reverse downvalley
flows during the night, allowing little inflow of fresh air.

The areas having the highest air pollution potential tend to be those that experience the highest
temperatures in the summer and the lowest temperatures in the winter. The coastal areas are exposed to
the prevailing marine air, creating cooler temperatures in the summer, warmer temperatures in winter, and
stratus clouds all year. The inland valleys are sheltered from the marine air and experience hotter
summers and colder winters. Thus, the topography of the inland valleys creates conditions conducive to
high air pollution potential.

LOCAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY

CARB monitors ambient air quality at approximately 250 air monitoring stations across the state. Air
quality monitoring stations usually measure pollutant concentrations ten feet aboveground level;
therefore, air quality is often referred to in terms of ground-level concentrations. The closest air
monitoring station to the project site is on Bethel Island at 5551 Bethel Island Road, which was used to
gather pollutant information from 2007 to 2009. The Bethel Island Monitoring Station is located
approximately seven miles away from the project site and collects data for all criteria pollutants except
PM2.5. Therefore, PM2.5 data was collected from the Concord Monitoring Station located at 2975 Treat
Boulevard (approximately 17 miles from the project site). Local air quality data from 2007 to 2009 is
provided in Table 4.2-1 (Local Air Quality Levels). This table lists the monitored maximum
concentrations and number of exceedances of federal/state air quality standards each year as available.

Carbon Monoxide. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas that is emitted by mobile
and stationary sources as a result of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons or other carbon-based fuels.
In cities, automobile exhaust can cause as much as 95 percent of all CO emissions.

CO replaces oxygen in the body's red blood cells. Individuals with a deficient blood supply to the heart,
patients with diseases involving heart and blood vessels, fetuses, and patients with chronic hypoxemia
(oxygen deficiency, as seen in high altitudes) are most susceptible to the adverse effects of CO exposure.
People with heart disease are also more susceptible to developing chest pains when exposed to low levels
of CO. Exposure to high levels of CO can slow reflexes and cause drowsiness, as well as result in death
in confined spaces at very high concentrations.

Nitrogen Dioxide. Nitrogen oxides (NOX) are a family of highly reactive gases that are a primary
precursor to the formation of ground-level ozone (O3), and react in the atmosphere to form acid rain. NO2
(often used interchangeably with NOX) is a reddish-brown gas that can cause breathing difficulties at high
levels. Peak readings of NO2 occur in areas that have a high concentration of combustion sources (i.e.,
motor vehicle engines, power plants, refineries, and other industrial operations).

The health effects of short-term exposure are still unclear. However, continued or frequent exposure to

Ozone. O3 occurs in two layers of the atmosphere. The layer surrounding the earth's surface is the
troposphere. The troposphere extends approximately ten miles above ground level, where it meets the
second layer, the stratosphere. The stratospheric (the "good" O3 layer) extends upward from about ten to
30 miles and protects life on earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.

The "bad" O3 is a photochemical pollutant, and needs reactive organic gases (ROGs), NOX and sunlight to
form; therefore, ROGs and NOX are O3 precursors. To reduce O3 concentrations, it is necessary to control
the emissions of these O3 precursors. Significant O3 formation generally requires an adequate amount of
precursors in the atmosphere and a period of several hours in a stable atmosphere with strong sunlight.

High O3 concentrations can form over large regions when emissions from motor vehicles and stationary
sources are carried hundreds of miles from their origins.

While O3 in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation,
high concentrations of ground-level O3 (in the troposphere) can adversely affect the human respiratory
system and other tissues. O3 is a strong irritant that can constrict the airways, forcing the respiratory
system to work hard to deliver oxygen. Individuals exercising outdoors, children and people with pre-
existing lung disease such as asthma and chronic pulmonary lung disease are considered to be the most
susceptible to the health effects of O3. Short-term exposure (lasting for a few hours) to O3 can result in
aggravated respiratory diseases such as emphysema, bronchitis and asthma, shortness of breath, increased
susceptibility to infections, inflammation of the lung tissue, increased fatigue, as well as chest pain, dry
throat, headache and nausea.

Coarse Particulate Matter (PM10). PM10 refers to suspended particulate matter, which is smaller than ten
microns or ten one-millionths of a meter. PM10 arises from sources such as road dust, diesel soot,
combustion products, construction operations, and dust storms. PM10 scatters light and significantly
reduces visibility. In addition, these particulates penetrate into lungs and can potentially damage the
respiratory tract. On June 19, 2003, CARB adopted amendments to the statewide 24-hour particulate
matter standards based upon requirements set forth in the Children's Environmental Health Protection Act
(Senate Bill 25).

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5). Due to recent increased concerns over health impacts related to fine
particulate matter (particulate matter 2.5 microns in diameter or less), both state and federal PM2.5
standards have been created. Particulate matter impacts primarily affect infants, children, the elderly, and
those with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease. In 1997, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) announced new PM2.5 standards. Industry groups challenged the new standard in court and the
implementation of the standard was blocked. However, upon appeal by the EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court
reversed this decision and upheld the EPA's new standards.

On June 20, 2002, CARB adopted amendments for statewide annual ambient particulate matter air quality
standards. These standards were revised/established due to increasing concerns by CARB that previous
standards were inadequate, as almost everyone in California is exposed to levels at or above the current
state standards during some parts of the year, and the statewide potential for significant health impacts
associated with particulate matter exposure was determined to be large and wide-ranging.

Sulfur Dioxide. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless, irritating gas with a rotten egg smell; it is formed
primarily by the combustion of sulfur-containing fossil fuels.             Sulfur dioxide is often used
interchangeably with sulfur oxides (SOX) and lead (Pb). Exposure of a few minutes to low levels of SO2
can result in airway constriction and reduction in breathing capacity in some asthmatics.

Reactive Organic Gases and Volatile Organic Compounds. Hydrocarbons are organic gases that are
formed solely of hydrogen and carbon. There are several subsets of organic gases including reactive
organic gases (ROGs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Both ROGs and VOCs are emitted from
the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons or other carbon-based fuels. The major sources of
hydrocarbons are combustion engine exhaust, oil refineries, and oil-fueled power plants; other common
sources are petroleum fuels, solvents, dry cleaning solutions, and paint (via evaporation).

Toxic Air Contaminants. Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs) (also referred to as Hazardous Air Pollutants
[HAPs]), are pollutants that result in an increase in mortality, a serious illness, or pose a present or

potential hazard to human health. Health effects of TACs may include cancer, birth defects, and immune
system and neurological damage.

TACs can be separated into carcinogens and noncarcinogens based on the nature of the physiological
degradation associated with exposure to the pollutant. For regulatory purposes, carcinogens are assumed
to have no safe threshold below which heath impacts would not occur. Noncarcinogenic TACs differ in
that there is a safe level in which it is generally assumed that no negative health impacts would occur.
These levels are determined on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis.

TACs are not considered criteria air pollutants and, thus, are not specifically addressed through the setting
of ambient air quality standards. Instead, the EPA and CARB regulate HAPs and TACs, respectively,
through statutes and regulations that generally require the use of the maximum or best available control
technology (MACT and BACT) to limit emissions. These in conjunction with additional rules set forth
by the BAAQMD establish the regulatory framework for TACs.

SENSITIVE RECEPTORS

Sensitive populations are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution than is the general population.
The following types of people are most likely to be adversely affected by air pollution, as identified by
CARB: children under 14, elderly over 65, athletes, and people with cardiovascular and chronic
respiratory diseases. Locations that may contain a high concentration of these sensitive population groups
are called sensitive receptors and include residential areas, hospitals, day-care facilities, elder-care
facilities, elementary schools and parks. Existing sensitive receptors located in the project vicinity
include single and multi-family residential homes, schools, parks, places of worship, and a hospital.
Sensitive receptors are depicted in Table 4.2-2 (Sensitive Receptors).

4.2.2           REGULATORY SETTING

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

The EPA is responsible for implementing the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), which was first enacted in
1955 and amended numerous times after. The FCAA established federal air quality standards known as
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). These standards identify levels of air quality for
"criteria" pollutants that are considered the maximum levels of ambient (background) air pollutants

considered safe, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health and welfare. The criteria
pollutants are O3, CO, NO2 (which is a form of NOX), SO2 (which is a form of SOx), particulate matter
less than ten and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM10 and PM2.5, respectively), and Pb. Refer to Table 4.2-3

(CAAQS) were established in 1969 pursuant to the Mulford-Carrell Act. These standards, included with
the NAAQS in Table 4.2-3, are generally more stringent and apply to more pollutants than the NAAQS.
In addition to the criteria pollutants, CAAQS have been established for visibility reducing particulates,
hydrogen sulfide and sulfates. The CCAA, which was approved in 1988, requires that each local air
district prepare and maintain an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) to achieve compliance with
CAAQS. These AQMPs also serve as the basis for preparation of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for
the State of California.

Like the EPA, CARB also designates areas within California as either attainment or nonattainment for
each criteria pollutant based on whether the CAAQS have been achieved. Under the CCAA, areas are
designated as nonattainment for a pollutant if air quality data show that a state standard for the pollutant
was violated at least once during the previous three calendar years. Exceedances that are affected by
highly irregular or infrequent events are not considered violations of a state standard, and are not used as
a basis for designating areas as nonattainment.

BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

BAAQMD is the regional agency with jurisdiction over the nine-county region located in the Basin. The
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC),
county transportation agencies, cities and counties, and various nongovernmental organizations also join
in the efforts to improve air quality through a variety of programs. These programs include the adoption
of regulations and policies, as well as implementation of extensive education and public outreach
programs.

BAAQMD is responsible for attaining and/or maintaining air quality in the Basin within federal and state
air quality standards. Specifically, BAAQMD has the responsibility to monitor ambient air pollutant
levels throughout the Basin and to develop and implement strategies to attain the applicable federal and
state standards.

In June 2010, BAAQMD adopted its updated CEQA Air Quality Guidelines as a guidance document to
provide lead agencies, consultants and project proponents with uniform procedures for assessing air
quality impacts and preparing the air quality sections of environmental documents for projects subject to
CEQA. The CEQA Air Quality Guidelines include methodologies and thresholds for addressing project
and program level air quality and greenhouse gas emissions.

1. California standards for ozone, carbon monoxide (except Lake Tahoe), sulfur dioxide (1- and 24-hour), nitrogen dioxide, suspended particulate matter-PM10 and
   visibility-reducing particles are values that are not to be exceeded. All others are not to be equaled or exceeded. California ambient air quality standards are listed
   in the Table of Standards in Section 70200 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. In 1990, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) identified vinyl
   chloride as a toxic air contaminant, but determined that there was not sufficient available scientific evidence to support the identification of a threshold exposure
   level. This action allows the implementation of health-protective control measures at levels below the 0.010 parts per million ambient concentration specified in the
   1978 standard.
2. National standards (other than ozone, particulate matter and those based on annual averages or annual arithmetic mean) are not to be exceeded more than once a
   year. EPA also may designate an area as attainment/unclassifiable, if: (1) it has monitored air quality data that show that the area has not violated the ozone
   standard over a three-year period; or (2) there is not enough information to determine the air quality in the area. For PM10, the 24-hour standard is attained when
   the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 g/m3 is equal to or less than one. For PM2.5, the 24-hour
   standard is attained when 98 percent of the daily concentrations, averaged over three years, are equal to or less than the standard.
3. Concentration is expressed first in units in which it was promulgated. Equivalent units given in parentheses are based upon a reference temperature of 25°C and a
   reference pressure of 760 mm of mercury. Most measurements of air quality are to be corrected to a reference temperature of 25°C and a reference pressure of
   760 mm of mercury (1,013.2 millibar); ppm in this table refers to ppm by volume, or micromoles of pollutant per mole of gas.
4. National Primary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health.
5. The Federal 1-hour ozone standard was revoked on June 15, 2005 in all areas except the 14 8-hour ozone nonattainment Early Action Compact (EAC) areas.
6. The Environmental Protection Agency revoked the annual PM10 standard in 2006 (effective December 16, 2006).
7. To attain this standard, the 3-year average of the 98th percentile of the daily maximum 1-hour average at each monitor within an area must not exceed 0.100 ppm
   (effective January 22, 2010). Note that EPA standards are in units of ppb and California standards are in units of ppm.

Supplemental Environmental Impact Report              



In March 2010, BAAQMD, in cooperation with the MTC and ABAG, published the draft 2010 Bay Area
Clean Air Plan, which, supersedes the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy. The 2010 Bay Area Clean Air
Plan updates the 2005 Ozone Strategy in accordance with the requirements of the CCAA to achieve the
following:

    ·    Implement all feasible measures to reduce ozone; provide a control strategy to reduce ozone,
         particulate matter, toxic air contaminants and greenhouse gases in a single, integrated plan
    ·    Review progress in improving air quality in recent years
    ·    Establish emission control measures to be adopted or implemented in the 2010 to 2012 time
         frame

The control strategy includes stationary-source control measures to be implemented through BAAQMD
regulations; mobile-source control measures to me implemented through incentive program and other
activities; and transportation control measures to be implemented through transportation programs in
cooperation with MTC, local governments, transit agencies and others. The 2010 Bay Area Clean Air
plan also represents the Bay Area's most recent triennial assessment of the region's strategy to attain the
one-hour ozone standard.

4.2.3         IMPACT ANALYSIS

THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE

BAAQMD Thresholds

Under CEQA, BAAQMD is an expert commenting agency on air quality within its jurisdiction or
impacting its jurisdiction. BAAQMD reviews projects to ensure that they would: (1) support the primary
goals of the latest Air Quality Plan; (2) include applicable control measures from the Air Quality Plan;
and (3) not disrupt or hinder implementation of any Air Quality Plan control measures.

As described above, the BAAQMD adopted their CEQA Air Quality Guidelines to assist lead agencies in
evaluating air quality impacts of projects and plans proposed in the Basin. The CEQA Air Quality
Guidelines provide BAAQMD-recommended procedures for evaluating potential air quality and GHG
impacts during the environmental review process consistent with CEQA requirements. In addition to
providing new thresholds for GHG emissions, the 2010 CEQA Air Quality Guidelines provide updated
significance thresholds for criteria pollutants and supersede the BAAQMD's previous CEQA guidance
titled BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines: Assessing the Air Quality Impacts of Projects and Plans (1999).

If the project proposes development in excess of the established thresholds, as illustrated in Table 4.2-4
(BAAQMD Emissions Thresholds), a significant air quality impact may occur and additional analysis is
warranted to fully assess the significance of impacts.

Additionally, the BAAQMD screening criteria provides that the proposed project would result in a less-
than-significant impact to localized CO concentrations if the following are met:

     ·    Project is consistent with an applicable congestion management program established by the
          county congestion management agency for designated roads or highways, regional transportation
          plan, and local congestion management agency plans
     ·    Project traffic would not increase traffic volumes at affected intersections to more than 44,000
          vehicles per hour
     ·    Project traffic would not increase traffic volumes at affected intersections to more than 24,000
          vehicles per hour where vertical and/or horizontal mixing is substantially limited (e.g., tunnel,
          parking garage, bridge underpass, natural or urban street canyon, below-grade roadway)

If none of the above criteria are met, then the project would require a quantitative analysis that would
compare emissions to the CAAQS.

Health Risk Screening Thresholds

BAAQMD has developed methods whereby local community risk and hazard impacts from projects for
both new sources and new receptors can be determined based on comparison with applicable thresholds
of significance and screening criteria. The screening methods are provided in the BAAQMD guidance
document entitled Recommended Methods for Screening and Modeling Local Risks and Hazards (May
2010). The BAAQMD guidance provides screening tables to determine whether emissions would create
a significant health hazard impact based on project size and receptor distance. Additionally, BAAQMD
recommends that all toxic sources are identified within a 1,000 foot radius of a project site to determine
any risk and health hazards.

CEQA Thresholds

According to Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines, the project would have a significant air quality impact
if it would:

     ·    Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan
     ·    Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality
          violation
     ·    Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project
          region is in nonattainment under an applicable Federal or State ambient air quality standard

POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Short-Term (Construction) Air Emissions Impacts

4.2-1    SHORT-TERM CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED
         PROJECT WOULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT AIR POLLUTANT
         EMISSION IMPACTS.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Potentially Significant Impact.

Impact Analysis:

Short-term air quality impacts are predicted to occur during grading and construction operations
associated with implementation of the proposed project. Temporary air emissions would result from the
following activities:

    ·    Particulate (fugitive dust) emissions from grading and building construction
    ·    Exhaust emissions from the construction equipment and the motor vehicles of the construction
         crew

Potential odors could arise from the diesel construction equipment used on-site, as well as from
architectural coatings and asphalt off-gassing. Odors generated during construction activities would be
temporary and would not be considered a significant impact. Emissions produced during grading and
construction activities are short-term, as they would exist only during construction.

The project site is currently vacant and has been previously cleared. Construction activities would
include grading, construction of buildings, paving, and application of architectural coatings. Project
construction is anticipated to begin in 2013 and would last approximately 18 months. During the mass
grading phase of construction, approximately five acres of site would be graded per day with
approximately 1,500 cubic yards earth movement per day. Grading for the site would be balanced and no
soil import or export would be required. The analysis of daily construction emissions has been prepared
utilizing the URBEMIS 2007 computer model (refer to Appendix C). Table 4.2-5 (Construction
Emissions) presents the anticipated daily short-term construction emissions.

Fugitive Dust Emissions

Construction activities are a source of fugitive dust (also known as PM10 and PM2.5) emissions that may
have a substantial, temporary impact on local air quality. Fugitive dust is often a nuisance to those living
and working within the vicinity of the project site. Fugitive dust emissions are associated with land
clearing, ground evacuation, cut and fill operations, and truck travel on unpaved roadways. Fugitive dust
emissions also vary substantially from day to day, depending on the level of activity, the specific
operations, and weather conditions.

PM10 and PM2.5 are both emitted during construction activities and as a result of wind erosion over
exposed soil surfaces. Clearing and grading activities comprise the major sources of construction dust
emissions, but traffic and general disturbance of the soil also generates significant dust emissions. PM10
and PM2.5 emissions can vary greatly depending on the level of activity, the specific operations taking

place, the equipment being operated, local soils, weather conditions, and other factors making
quantification difficult. The highest potential for construction dust impacts would occur during the late
spring, summer, and early fall months when soils are dry. Despite this variability in emissions,
experience has shown that there are a number of feasible control measures that can be reasonably
implemented to significantly reduce PM10 and PM2.5 emissions from construction activities. BAAQMD
recommends the implementation of all Basic Construction Mitigation Measures, whether or not
construction-related emissions exceed applicable significance thresholds. As shown in Table 4.2-5,
unmitigated fugitive dust emissions would exceed BAAQMD thresholds for PM10 and PM2.5. However,
implementation of the BAAQMD's Basic Construction Mitigation Measures would be required for the
proposed project (included in Mitigation Measure 4.2-1) and would reduce fugitive dust impacts to a less
than significant level.

ROG Emissions

In addition to gaseous and particulate emissions, the application of asphalt and surface coatings creates
ROG emissions, which are O3 precursors. In accordance with the methodology prescribed by the
BAAQMD, the ROG emissions associated with paving have been quantified with the URBEMIS 2007
model. In addition, based upon the size of the buildings, architectural coatings were also quantified
within the URBEMIS 2007 model. The highest concentration of ROG emissions would be generated
during the application of architectural coatings towards the end of construction. As indicated in Table
4.2-5, the project construction would not exceed BAAQMD thresholds for ROG. Therefore, impacts
would be less than significant.

Construction Equipment and Worker Vehicle Exhaust

Exhaust emission factors for typical diesel-powered heavy equipment are based on the URBEMIS 2007
program defaults. Variables factored into estimating the total construction emissions include: level of
activity, length of construction period, number of pieces/types of equipment in use, site characteristics,
weather conditions, number of construction personnel, and the amount of materials to be transported on-
site or off-site. A listing of mobile and stationary construction equipment is included in Appendix C.

Exhaust emissions from construction activities include emissions associated with the transport of
machinery and supplies to and from the project site, emissions produced on-site as the equipment is used,
and emissions from trucks transporting materials to and from the site. Emitted pollutants would include
ROG, NOX, PM10 and PM2.5. As indicated in Table 4.2-5, construction equipment exhaust would not
cause an exceedance of the BAAQMD's NOX thresholds during the construction period. Impacts would
be less than significant in this regard.

Naturally Occurring Asbestos

Pursuant to guidance issued by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research, State Clearinghouse,
lead agencies are encouraged to analyze potential impacts related to naturally occurring asbestos.
Naturally occurring asbestos can be released from serpentinite and ultramafic rocks when the rock is
broken or crushed. At the point of release, the asbestos fibers may become airborne, causing air quality
and human health hazards. These rocks have been commonly used for unpaved gravel roads,
landscaping, fill projects, and other improvement projects in some localities. Asbestos may be released to
the atmosphere due to vehicular traffic on unpaved roads, during grading for development projects, and at
quarry operations.

Serpentinite and/or ultramafic rock are known to be present in 44 of California's 58 counties. These rocks
are particularly abundant in the counties associated with the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Klamath
Mountains and Coast Ranges. According to the Department of Conservation Division of Mines and
Geology, A General Location Guide for Ultramafic Rocks in California ­ Areas More Likely to Contain
Naturally Occurring Asbestos Report (August 2000), the project site is not located in an area where
naturally occurring asbestos is likely to be present. Therefore, impacts are less than significant in this
regard.

Total Daily Construction Emissions

In accordance with BAAQMD Guidelines, URBEMIS 2007 was utilized to model construction emissions
for ROG, NOX, PM10 and PM2.5. Construction would occur over an 18-month period with the greatest
fugitive dust emissions being generated during the initial stages of construction. Additionally, the

greatest amount of ROG emissions would typically occur during the final stages of development due to
the application of architectural coatings.

The URBEMIS 2007 model allows the user to input mitigation measures such as watering the
construction area to limit fugitive dust in the project area. Mitigation measures inputted within the
URBEMIS 2007 model allow for certain reduction credits and result in a decrease of pollutant emissions.
Reduction credits are based upon various land use and transportation studies and were programmed
within the URBEMIS 2007 model.1 As indicated in Table 4.2-5, construction-related impacts would be
less than significant with the implementation of the BAAQMD's Basic Mitigation Measures (Mitigation
Measure 4.2-1).

Construction Toxic Air Contaminants

Construction-related activities could result in the generation of TACs, specifically diesel particulate
matter (DPM), from on-road haul trucks and off-road equipment exhaust emissions. Due to the variable
nature of the proposed construction activity, the generation of TAC emissions would be temporary,
especially considering the short amount of time such equipment is typically within an influential distance
that would result in the exposure of sensitive receptors to substantial concentrations.

The construction period would occur for approximately 18 months and would require various types of
heavy equipment throughout each construction phase. Specifically, grading activities would require two
tractors, one grader, one rubber tired dozer and one water truck. Trenching activities would require two
excavators. Paving activities would include four cement and mortar mixers, one paver, one roller and two
other pieces of paving equipment. The building phase would require one crane, two forklifts, one tractor,
three welders and one generator set. As indicated in the URBEMIS2007 model outputs for the proposed
project (refer to Table 4.2-5), construction activities would generate 1.30 pounds of diesel PM2.5 exhaust
per day in 2013 and 0.90 pounds of diesel PM2.5 exhaust per day in 2014. Additionally, the project would
include implementation of the BAAQMD's Basic Construction Mitigation Measures (Mitigation Measure
4.2-1), which is recommended for all proposed projects, and would also reduce DPM exhaust emissions.

As depicted in Table 4.2-2, the closest sensitive receptors to the project site would be the residential uses
approximately 1,000 feet (305 meters) to the east. Additional sensitive receptors include residential uses
1,062 feet (324 meters) to the south, 1,700 feet (518 meters) to the west, and 2,400 feet (732 meters) to
the north.

BAAQMD has developed guidance for estimating risk and hazards impacts entitled Recommended
Methods for Screening and Modeling Local Risks and Hazards (May 2010), which also includes
recommendations for mitigation of significant risk and hazards impacts. BAAQMD guidance provides a
screening approach to conduct initial evaluations of potential health risks from exposure to TACs
(including DPM and PM2.5) from construction activities. Table 2 of the BAAQMD Recommended
Methods for Screening and Modeling Local Risks and Hazards provides the minimum distance required
between the fence line of a construction site and a nearby sensitive receptor to ensure that cancer and non-
cancer risks associated with the project are less than significant per BAAQMD significance thresholds.

Based on the approach recommended by BAAQMD guidance, the minimum offset distance (screening
distance) required for the proposed project would be 492 feet (150 meters). This is the minimum distance
necessary between sensitive receptors and the project site to avoid significant impacts. As noted above,

the closest sensitive receptors are the residential uses located approximately 1,000 feet (305 meters) to the
east. As the closest receptors are not located within 150 meters of the project site, impacts from
construction TACs would be less than significant.

              ·   All roadways, driveways, and sidewalks to be paved shall be completed as soon as
                  possible.
              ·   Idling times shall be minimized either by shutting equipment off when not in use or

Long-Term (Operational) Air Emissions Impacts

4.2-2    LONG-TERM OPERATION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD RESULT IN
         POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS IMPACTS.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Potentially Significant Impact.

Impact Analysis:

Operational emissions generated by both stationary and mobile sources would result from normal daily
activities on the project site after occupation (i.e., increased loads of O3, PM10 and CO). Stationary area
source emissions would be generated by the consumption of natural gas for space and water heating
devices, the operation of landscape maintenance equipment, and the use of consumer products. Mobile
emissions would be generated by the motor vehicles traveling to and from the project site. Emissions
associated with each of these sources were calculated and are discussed below.

Mobile Source Emissions

Mobile sources are emissions from motor vehicles, including tailpipe and evaporative emissions.
Depending upon the pollutant being discussed, the potential air quality impact may be of either regional
or local concern. For example, ROG, NOX, SOX, PM10 and PM2.5 are all pollutants of regional concern
(NOX and ROG react with sunlight to form O3 [photochemical smog], and wind currents readily transport
SOX, PM10 and PM2.5). However, CO tends to be a localized pollutant, dispersing rapidly at the source.

As previously discussed, the Basin is a nonattainment area for federal and state air quality standards for
O3 and PM2.5 and state standards for PM10. NOX and ROG are regulated O3 precursors. A precursor is
defined as a directly emitted air contaminant that, when released into the atmosphere, forms or causes to
be formed, or contributes to the formation of, a secondary air contaminant for which an ambient air
quality standard has been adopted. Project-generated vehicle emissions have been estimated using the
URBEMIS 2007 model. This model predicts ROG, NOX, PM10 and PM2.5 emissions from motor vehicle
traffic associated with new or modified land uses (refer to Appendix C).

According to the Traffic Impact Analysis set forth in Section 4.4 (Transportation/Traffic), the proposed
project would generate 11,150 daily trips. However, the proposed project would displace approximately
63 percent of the mixed-uses that are currently allowed on the Pioneer Square site. As a result,
implementation of the proposed project would displace 3,100 daily trips associated with the mixed-uses
and the net project trip generation would be 8,050 daily trips. Table 4.2-6 (Long-Term Operational Air
Emissions) presents the anticipated mobile source emissions. As shown in Table 4.2-6, emissions
generated by vehicle traffic associated with the proposed project would exceed established BAAQMD
thresholds for ROG and PM10. As there is no available mitigation, impacts from vehicle emissions would

Area Source Emissions

Area source emissions would be generated due to an increased demand for electrical energy and natural
gas with the development of the proposed improvement. This assumption is based on the supposition that
those power plants supplying electricity to the site are utilizing fossil fuels. Electric power generating
plants are distributed throughout the Basin and western U.S., and their emissions contribute to the total
regional pollutant burden. The primary use of natural gas by the proposed land uses would be for
combustion to produce space heating, water heating, other miscellaneous heating, or air conditioning,
consumer products, and landscaping. As indicated in Table 4.2-6, area source emissions from the
proposed project would not exceed BAAQMD thresholds. Thus, impacts associated with area source
emissions would be less than significant.

Operational Emissions Mitigation

As depicted in Table 4.2-6, mobile source emissions would exceed the BAAQMD's threshold for ROG
and PM10. According to the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (June 2010), where operational-
related emissions exceed applicable thresholds of significance, all feasible mitigation measures to reduce
the project's air quality impacts should be implemented. BAAQMD provides mitigated emission
estimates from both URBEMIS mitigation measures and non-URBEMIS mitigation measures that are
included in the proposed project. These mitigation measures have been quantified and the mitigated
emissions are provided in Table 4.2-6, above.

The proposed project would include various design features that would reduce emissions of criteria
pollutants related to both mobile and area source emissions. The project proposes development of two
42,000 square foot classroom/office buildings that would serve 5,000 students and include 80 full-time
and 200 part-time faculty and staff members. The project would include project design features that have
been identified by the BAAQMD as both URBEMIS mitigation measures and non-URBEMIS mitigation
measures that would reduce operational related emissions of criteria pollutants.

URBEMIS Reduction Measures. The proposed project would include transportation demand management
features that include a daily parking charge and free transit passes to students. According to the
BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines, these transportation demand features would reduce mobile
source criteria pollutant emissions by up to 4.17 percent.2 Additionally, the proposed project would
include other transportation demand measures such as secure bike parking, car-sharing services, and
preferential carpool/vanpool parking. Implementation of these three other transportation demand
measures would increase transit and pedestrian/bike friendliness, and result in an eight percent reduction
in mobile source emissions. The project would also reduce area source emissions and exceed California
Code of Regulations Title 24 (California's Energy Efficiency Standards) by ten percent. It should be
noted that this is based on the 2010 California Green Building Standards, which are effective January 1,
2011. Despite the implementation of the URBEMIS reduction measures, ROG and PM10 emissions
would remain above BAAQMD thresholds.

Non-URBEMIS Reduction Measures. The proposed project would also incorporate several non-
URBEMIS (mitigation measures not quantifiable in URBEMIS2007) energy efficiency measures
including planting shade trees, installing cool roof materials, installing smart meters and programmable
thermostats, meeting California Green Building Code standards, and heating ventilation and air
conditioning (HVAC) duct sealing. Implementation of these design features would reduce electricity

related emissions by 99 percent, and natural gas related emissions by ten percent.3 Also, refer to Section
4.3 (Greenhouse Gas Emissions) for additional discussion of the project's emissions reducing design
features. It should be noted that these measures primarily apply to energy efficiency and would not
reduce ROG and PM10 emissions due to vehicle trips. As depicted in Table 4.2-6, ROG and PM10
emissions would remain above BAAQMD thresholds, despite the implementation of Non-URBEMIS
reduction measures.

Table 4.2-6 depicts both the unmitigated and mitigated operational emissions associated with the
proposed project. As indicated in Table 4.2-6, despite the implementation of operational mitigation
measures, ROG and PM10 emissions would remain above BAAQMD thresholds. According to the
BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (June 2010), if mitigated levels of any criteria air pollutant or
precursor would still exceed the applicable threshold of significance, the impact to air quality would
remain significant and unavoidable.

Localized Carbon Monoxide Hotspots

The Basin is designated as attainment for carbon monoxide (CO). As indicated in the BAAQMD CEQA
Air Quality Guidelines, emissions and ambient concentrations of CO have decreased dramatically in the
Basin with the introduction of the catalytic converter in 1975. No exceedances of the CAAQS or
NAAQS for CO have been recorded at nearby monitoring stations since 1991.4 As a result, the screening
criteria in the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines note that CO impacts may be determined to be
less than significant if a project is consistent with the applicable congestion management plan and would
not increase traffic volumes at local intersections to more than 24,000 vehicles per hour. The project
would be consistent with applicable congestion management planning, as it would not significantly
increase the delay or level of service at the study intersections, and the greatest volume at any of the study
intersections is less than 5,000 vehicles per hour (this includes project buildout and cumulative volumes).
Therefore, impacts related to CO concentrations would be less than significant.

Risk and Health Hazards

BAAQMD recommends that all TAC and particulate PM2.5 sources be identified within a 1,000 foot
radius of the proposed project site to determine any risk and health hazards. As described above, the
project site is surrounded primarily by open space and residential uses. There are no TAC and PM2.5
sources located within 1,000 feet of the project site.5 State Route 4 Bypass is located to the northeast;
however, peak hour vehicle volumes are less than 2,000 and would not be considered a health hazard
source. 6 Therefore, any impacts associated with risk and health hazards would be less than significant.

Mitigation Measures: No feasible mitigation is available.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable Impact.

Consistency with Regional Plans

4.2-3    DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD NOT BE
         CONSISTENT WITH REGIONAL PLANS.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Potentially Significant Impact.

Impact Analysis:

The Vineyards EIR analyzed the project's consistency with the 2000 Clean Air Plan (CAP) (the latest
CAP at the time). The analysis found that based on the project's consistency with the City of
Brentwood's General Plan Update EIR, the project would also be consistent with the CAP. Therefore, the
Vineyards EIR found that the project would not cause population growth that would exceed the values
used for air quality purposes. Additionally, the City's General Plan was consistent with the transportation
control measures in the CAP and would reduce vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled. The most
recently adopted air quality plan in the Basin is the 2010 Bay Area Clean Air Plan (CAP). This CAP
outlines how the San Francisco Bay Area will attain air quality standards, reduce population exposure,
protect public health, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The project analyzed in this SEIR proposes the construction of a new education center on a portion of the
Pioneer Square site within the Vineyards Project site. Although the project represents the relocation of
the community college land use from the Cowell Property to the Pioneer Square site, no change in land
use on the Cowell Property is proposed at this time. As a result, the original property would retain the
land use designation allowing the community college campus, as analyzed in the Vineyards EIR. As
described above, the proposed project would be adding more vehicle trips than assumed in the Vineyards
EIR.

No significant land use and planning impacts were identified in the Vineyards EIR. The current General
Plan land use designation for the 17-acre project site is Mixed-Use Business Park (PD 64), which does
not expressly list community college as a permitted use. However, while the District is not subject to local
land use regulations or ordinances when using property in furtherance of its educational purposes, the
District nonetheless chose this site because of the generally compatibility of its proposed community
college use with those surrounding Mixed-Use Business Park uses and nearby residential uses (refer to
Chapter 3, Project Description, for greater detail on the goals and objectives of the proposed project).As
indicated in the analysis above, the proposed project would result in significant long-term operational air
quality impacts regarding ROG and PM10 emissions. Additionally, it should be noted that operational
emissions for the Vineyards Project were also found to be significant and unavoidable. Therefore, the
project's exceedance of operational ROG (an ozone precursor) and PM10 emissions would hinder the
region's ability achieve compliance with the state ozone standards as expeditiously as practicable.
Despite the implementation of transportation demand management features (included as project design
features), impacts would be significant and unavoidable.

Mitigation Measures:      No feasible mitigation is available.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable Impact.

Cumulative Impacts

4.2-4    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT AND RELATED CUMULATIVE
         PROJECTS WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CUMULATIVE AIR QUALITY
         IMPACTS.

Level of Significance Before Mitigation: Potentially Significant Impact.

Impact Analysis:

Cumulative Construction Impacts

As discussed above, the project's construction-related emissions would not exceed any of the proposed
new BAAQMD thresholds of significance. The BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines do not include
significance thresholds for cumulative construction emissions. However, due to the temporary nature of
construction emissions, if the project's emissions would be less than significant based on the project-level
thresholds of significance, it can be expected that the cumulative impact would also be less than
significant. In addition, the project would be required to implement the proposed BAAQMD Basic
Construction Mitigation Measures (Mitigation Measure 4.2-1), which are recommended for all projects
whether or not construction-related emissions exceed the thresholds of significance. Therefore,
construction emissions associated with the proposed project would not result in a cumulatively
considerable impact to air quality.

Cumulative Operational Impacts

The BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines do not include separate significance thresholds for
cumulative operational emissions. However, the project's maximum daily operational emissions would
exceed BAAQMD thresholds of significance for ROG and PM10. It should be noted that the proposed
BAAQMD thresholds are average daily or maximum annual thresholds. The BAAQMD CEQA Air
Quality Guidelines note that the nature of air emissions is largely a cumulative impact. As a result, no
single project is sufficient in size to, by itself, result in nonattainment of ambient air quality standards.
Instead, a project's individual emissions contribute to existing cumulatively significant adverse air quality
impacts. BAAQMD developed the operational thresholds of significance based on the level above which
a project's individual emissions would result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to the Basin's
existing air quality conditions. Therefore, a project that exceeds the BAAQMD operational thresholds
would also result in a cumulatively considerable impact. As depicted in Table 4.2-6, the proposed
project's operational emissions would exceed BAAQMD thresholds for ROG and PM10. Therefore, the
proposed project, in conjunction with related cumulative projects would be cumulatively considerable.
Despite the implementation of transportation demand management features (included as project design
features), cumulative impacts would be significant and unavoidable.

Mitigation Measures: No feasible mitigation is available.

Level of Significance After Mitigation: Significant and Unavoidable Impact.

4.3                   GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
This section evaluates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the proposed project and
analyzes project compliance with applicable regulations. Consideration of the project's consistency with
applicable plans, policies, and regulations, as well as the introduction of new sources of GHG, is included
in this section.

4.3.1                 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

As stated in Section 4.2 (Air Quality), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) divides the state into
15 air basins that share similar meteorological and topographical features. The project site is located
within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin (Basin). This Basin comprises all of Alameda, Contra
Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the southern portion of Sonoma
County, and the southwestern portion of Solano County. Air quality in this area is determined by such
natural factors as topography, meteorology and climate, in addition to the presence of existing air
pollution sources and ambient conditions. These factors along with applicable regulations are discussed in
Section 4.2 (Air Quality).

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE GASES

The natural process through which heat is retained in the troposphere is called the "greenhouse effect."1
The greenhouse effect traps heat in the troposphere through a three fold process as follows: Short wave
radiation emitted by the Sun is absorbed by the Earth; the Earth emits a portion of this energy in the form
of long wave radiation; and GHGs in the upper atmosphere absorb this long wave radiation and emit it
into space back toward the Earth. This "trapping" of the long wave (thermal) radiation emitted back
toward the Earth is the underlying process of the greenhouse effect.

The most abundant GHGs are water vapor and carbon dioxide (CO2). Many other trace gases have
greater ability to absorb and re-radiate long wave radiation; however, these gases are not as plentiful. For
this reason, and to gauge the potency of GHGs, scientists have established a Global Warming Potential
(GWP) for each GHG based on its ability to absorb and re-radiate long wave radiation. The GWP of a
gas is determined using CO2 as the reference gas with a GWP of 1.

GHGs normally associated with the proposed project include the following:2

       ·      Water Vapor (H2O). Although water vapor has not received the scrutiny of other GHGs, it is the
              primary contributor to the greenhouse effect. Natural processes, such as evaporation from oceans
              and rivers, and transpiration from plants, contribute 90 percent and ten percent of the water vapor
              in the atmosphere, respectively.

              The primary human related source of water vapor comes from fuel combustion in motor vehicles;
              however, this is not believed to contribute a significant amount (less than one percent) to
              atmospheric concentrations of water vapor. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
              (IPCC) has not determined a GWP for water vapor.

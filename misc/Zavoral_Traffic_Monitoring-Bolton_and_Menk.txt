    Subject: Trunk Highway 97 & Trunk Highway 95 (Zavoral Mine) Traffic Monitoring Memo
                  Scandia, MN



At the request of the City of Scandia, the intersection of Trunk Highway (TH) 97 at Trunk Highway (TH)
95 was evaluated to determine existing traffic operations. Based on the analyses, the addition of trucks
entering/exiting the mine doesn't appear to appreciably lower the level of service at the intersection
during the time of this study.

There have been few crashes at intersections along the TH 97 and CR 91 (Lofton Ave) corridors from
2008 to 2013. One intersection that had an above average crash rate was the TH 97 & CR 91 (Lofton
Ave) intersection. Based on the crash rate, intersection skew and lack of turn lanes, improvements may
be needed and are planned at this intersection to accommodate the truck traffic. The improvements
include constructing turn lanes in the summer of 2014.

Existing Conditions
TH 97 runs east/west and is classified as a rural minor arterial. TH 95 runs north/south and is also
classified as a rural minor arterial. The Zavoral Mine entrance is located on the east leg of the
intersection. The intersection has two-way stop control with vehicles on TH 97 and the mine entrance
required to stop. The north and south legs of the intersection are three lane approaches (left, thru, and
right). The west leg of the intersection is a two lane approach (left-thru and right) and the east leg is a
single lane approach. The speed limit on both roadways is 55 MPH.

Turning Movement Counts
A 14 hour turning movement count was taken on December 3rd, 2013 from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM to
capture traffic conditions while trucks were hauling material from the Zavoral Mine. Normal mining
hours are from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM. Due to road conditions, hauling was called off at approximately
2:00 p.m. on December 3rd. Therefore, the data obtained from the turning movement counts was adjusted
accordingly. The next section will explain how the trucks during the PM peak hour were accounted for in
the analysis. The turning movement count data is included in the attachments.
The following is taken from the December 3rd turning movement count:
              Trucks enter/exit the mine at a steady rate from 7:00 AM to 2:00 PM
              95% of the trucks leaving the mine headed west on Highway 97
              97% of the trucks entering the mine entered from the west on Highway 97

                   The hour with the heaviest amount of truck volume entering/existing the mine was 12:30
                    PM to 1:30 PM (74 trucks)
                   AM Peak Hour (7:00 AM to 8:00 AM): 521 cars/trucks used the intersection (29 trucks
                    entered/exited the mine)
                   Mid-Day Peak Hour (12:30 PM to 1:30 PM): 375 cars/trucks used the intersection (74
                    trucks entered/exited the mine)
                   PM Peak Hour (3:30 PM to 4:30 PM): 602 cars/trucks used the intersection (0 trucks
                    entered/exited the mine)
                   The total number of trucks entering/exiting the mine was 297 (7:00 AM to 2:00 PM)

Traffic Operations Analysis
Traffic operations analysis was then completed for the existing two-way stop control for the A.M., Mid-
Day, and P.M. peak hours. Because there was no truck count for the P.M. peak hour due to a stoppage in
hauling, the truck movements from the Mid-day peak hour were used in the P.M. analysis. Based on
information provided by the Tiller Corporation and on the traffic count, the number of trucks assigned to
the haul does not change throughout the day and the trucks are loaded in a consistent manner throughout
the day. Therefore, the Mid-day peak hour truck movements were used because they were the highest
observed during the traffic count. This approach is the most conservative and allows comfort in the
assumption that the number of trucks during the P.M. peak hour will most likely be the same or lower
than the Mid-day peak hour. The analysis was performed using the methodology of the 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual through Synchro, a traffic analysis software program by Trafficware. The Synchro
output files are included in the attachments.

Results of the analysis are displayed as measures of effectiveness. Measures of effectiveness display
quantitative information about the performance of an intersection or network of intersections. The
primary measures that are used in this study are level of service and delay.

The operational analysis results are described as a Level of Service (LOS) ranging from A to F. These
letters serve to describe a range of operating conditions for different types of facilities. Levels of Service
are calculated based on the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, which defines the level of service, based on
control delay. Control delay is the delay experienced by vehicles slowing down as they are approaching
the intersection, the wait time at the intersection, and the time for the vehicle to speed up through the
intersection and enter into the traffic stream. The average intersection control delay is a volume weighted
average of delay experienced by all motorists entering the intersection on all intersection approaches for
signalized intersections. Level of Service C is considered acceptable for opening year operations and LOS
D is commonly taken as an acceptable long term future year LOS. The level of service and its associated
intersection delay for a signalized and unsignalized intersection is presented below. The delay threshold
for unsignalized intersections is lower for each LOS compared to signalized intersections, which accounts
for the fact that people expect a higher level of service when at a stop-controlled intersections.

Volume to capacity ratio is the proportion of the actual traffic utilizing the facility to the facility's
physical ability to carry a specific maximum volume. This is calculated by dividing the total traffic using
the facility by the capacity of the facility. This can then determine if a facility is sufficient to handle the
traffic that is expected to be traveling on it. A ratio greater than 1.00 predicts that the facility will be
unable to discharge all of the demand arriving on it. Such a situation would result in long queues and
extensive delays, or diversion to alternate routes. While a volume-to-capacity ratio below 1.00 is
acceptable, it is preferable to have volume-to-capacity ratios below 0.85 to account for traffic
fluctuations.

Analysis of the existing conditions (two-way stop control) indicates that the intersection is operating
within acceptable service levels during the peak hours. The analysis also indicates that there is reserve
capacity available at the intersection to handle additional traffic. The peak hour operational analysis of the
existing traffic volumes is summarized below in Table 2.

Crashes
Crashes were reviewed along TH 97, between CSAH 15 (Manning Trl) and TH 95, and along CR 91
(Lofton Ave), between TH 97 and 228th St, from 2008 to 2013. The crashes from 2008 to 2012 were used
in determining the 5-year crash rate. The reason for this 5-year crash rate is to set a base number that
depicts crash occurrences in the study area. Our team will be reviewing crashes in the study area every
six months (for the next 3  years) and calculate the new crash rate to compare to the base crash rate to
see if crashes are increasing due to the mine opening. 2013 crashes were not included in the 5-year crash
rate because the database that was used, Minnesota Crash Mapping Analysis Tool, only has crashes up
until November 4, 2013. The crashes in 2013 thru November 4th include 3 at the TH 97 and CSAH 15
(Manning Trl) intersection, 1 on TH 97 between CSAH 15 (Manning Trl) and CR 91 (Lofton Ave), 1 at
the CR 91 (Lofton Ave) and TH 97 intersection, and 1 on TH 97 between Meadowbrook Ave and

Newberry Ave. Crashes after November 4th will be included with our next update. The crash rates and
number of crashes for each segment are included in the attachments. There were two intersections that
had higher than average crash rates. The TH 97 & CR 91 (Lofton Ave) intersection had a crash rate of
0.78 and the TH 97 & CSAH 3 had a crash rate of 0.56. There were 8 crashes in 2008 and a total of 14
from 2008 to 2012 at the TH 97 & CR 91 (Lofton Ave) intersection. Future improvements are planned at
this intersection to accommodate the truck traffic. The improvements include constructing turn lanes in
the summer of 2014.

Conclusions
    The TH 97 & TH 95 intersection is operating within acceptable service levels during the peak
       hours.
           o The maximum delay to minor-street traffic during the peak hours is 18 seconds (PM peak
                hour)
                        The limiting movement was the eastbound direction.
           o The highest capacity utilization for the peak hours is 44% (PM peak hour)
                        This intersection has reserve capacity to accommodate more vehicles, meaning
                        that there is very little congestion at this intersection.
           o The addition of trucks entering/exiting the mine doesn't appear to have an unacceptable
                effect on the level of service at the intersection during the time of this study.
    Future improvements may be needed and are planned at the TH 97 & CSAH 91 (Lofton Ave)
       intersection to accommodate for truck turns.
    Crashes will be reviewed in the study area every six months to determine if safety has been
       compromised because of the mine opening.

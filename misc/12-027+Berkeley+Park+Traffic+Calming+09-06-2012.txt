INTRODUCTION
The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) defines Traffic Calming as "the combination of
mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle use, alter driver
behavior and improve conditions for non-motorized street users." The immediate purpose of
traffic calming is to reduce the speed and volume of traffic to acceptable levels.

The purpose of this study is to measure and evaluate the need for traffic calming devices within
the Berkeley Park Neighborhood located in Atlanta, GA. The City of Atlanta's Traffic Calming
Device Implementation Guidebook, "need" is defined as the magnitude of the impact felt by the
residents of existing traffic conditions within a given neighborhood.




                                   Figure 1 ­ Location Map

Using the City of Altanta's Traffic Calming Device Implementation Guidebook (1999) and the
ITE Traffic Calming State of the Practice (1999), this study has analyzed field data to help
provide traffic calming options for the neighborhood. This field data includes daily traffic
counts, turning movement counts, origin ­ destination survey, spot speed survey and accident
data evaluation. The location of the neighborhood and surrounding road network is shown in
Figure 1.

                                                                       A&R Engineering Inc.

EXISTING FACILITIES
Roadways classified as arterials, collectors, and above are excluded from receiving certain traffic
calming measures under Atlanta's guidelines. Other streets may not be eligible depending on
location and individual characteristics such as designated bicycle and emergency routes. An
inventory was performed of the roads in the neighborhood. The following is a brief description
of each of these facilities. Roadway classifications were taken from the 2007 City of Atlanta
Functional Classification Map.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CALMING DEVICES
Traffic calming has already been implemented to some degree in the neighborhood in an attempt
to limit cut-through traffic. The following is a brief description of each of the traffic calming
devices and their location. The locations of the existing traffic calming devices are also shown in
Figure 9.

Bellemeade Ave
Bellemeade Ave has a "NO TRUCK OVER 18 TONS OR 30 FT IN LENGTH" sign located at
both the east and west ends. This restriction pertains to all semi-trucks some single unit trucks
(aka "box trucks").




   Figure 4 ­NO TRUCK Signs on Bellemeade Ave at Northside Dr (left) Howell Mill (right)
Holmes Street
Holmes Street has two speed bumps located in between Howell Mill Road and Buchanan Street.
Additionally, there is a "NO TRUCK" sign located at the east and west end of Holmes Street.
Left turns from Howell Mill Road onto Holmes Street are prohibited.

                                            6
The NO LEFT TURN sign on the southbound Howell Mill approach (shown in Figure 5b) is
located adjacent to the outside lane, approximately 110 feet from the center of the intersection. A
more visible location for the sign would be affixed to the mast arm. Furthermore, the flexible
delineators on Northside Drive (shown in Figure 5d) should either be repaired or replaced with
curbing.

Verner Street
Verner Street has two speed bumps in between Howell Mill Road and Buchanan Street.
Additionally, there is a "No Truck" sign located at the west end of Verner Street.




                 Figure 6 ­ NO TRUCK and SPEED HUMP signs on Verner St

Antone Street
Antone Street has a "No Truck" and a "ROAD CLOSED TO THROUGH TRAFFIC" sign
located at the west end, at the intersection of Howell Mill Road. The "ROAD CLOSED TO
THROUGH TRAFFIC" sign is easily visible at its current location. It is recommended that the
sign be relocated to a more viewable location.

Berkeley Ave
Berkeley Ave has "No Truck" sign located at the intersection with Howell Mill Road. The
current placement of this sign is only visible to traffic traveling north on Howell Mill Road. It is
recommended that an additional sign be placed that will be visible to southbound vehicles.

DATA COLLECTION

The following traffic studies have been performed to help determine the different traffic issues
within the neighborhood:

Average Daily Traffic Counts
24 hour bi-directional tube counts were conducted on Friday, April 20th. The tube counts were
collected on potential problem streets and on streets that serve as gateways to the neighborhood.
The data collected also includes vehicle classification information.

Origin ­ Destination Study
A license plate survey was conducted for a continuous two hour period in the morning (7:00am
to 9:00am) and afternoon (4:00pm to 6:00pm) peak travel hours on Friday, April 13th. This study
was conducted to determine if traffic is cutting through the neighborhood on particular
residential streets. This included observers recording the inbound and outbound activity of
vehicles using the surrounding access points for the neighborhood.

Turning Movement Counts
Turning movement counts were collected on Friday, April 20th to determine the AM and PM
peak hours and volumes at key intersections. These counts were collected at the following
intersections:
    x Holmes Street / Buchanan Street
    x Holmes Street / Tallulah Street
    x Antone Street / Forrest Street
    x Berkeley Ave / Forrest Street

Spot Speed Survey
This data was recorded from the bi-directional tube counts that were conducted on Friday, April
20th. This survey measured the 85th percentile speed of traffic traveling through the
neighborhood to determine the percentage of total motorists that exceed the speed limit.

Accident Evaluation
This information was obtained at intersections within the neighborhood to help identify locations
with a high rate of reoccurring accidents related to cut-through traffic.

The location of the neighborhood counts is shown in Figure 10. The tube counts are also
numbered in this figure.




                                                                       A&R Engineering Inc.
                                               10
TRAFFIC VOLUME ANALYSIS
The purpose of a traffic volume analysis in relation to traffic calming studies is to determine
whether the amount of traffic on a residential road is at tolerable levels. Many times it is difficult
to develop a consensus on what is considered as tolerable. In order to quantify the levels of
traffic in the Berkeley Park neighborhood, several types of data were collected. Bi-directional
tube counts were collected at 15 locations throughout the Berkeley Park Neighborhood on
Friday, April 20th. Additionally, origin-destination information was collected through license
plate counts on Friday, April 13th.

Daily Volume Counts
As expected, of the roadway segments studied, the highest volumes were observed on
Bellemeade Avenue. Because of its proximity to commercial land uses, signalized access points
at both ends, and lack of alternative routes nearby, Bellemeade Avenue is considered (by the
motoring public in the area) to be the preferred route traveling between Howell Mill Road and
Northside Drive. Along Bellemeade Ave, the daily traffic volumes range from 7,380 veh/day to
9,322 veh/day. The daily traffic volumes for the other (residential) streets are listed below:

Traffic volumes are not the single criterion for evaluating neighborhood traffic problems. There
are two different types of motorists who travel on residential streets. The typical majority are
local residential motorists, who live in the area and travel on a particular residential street to get
to or from their home. Traveling on these residential streets is a necessity for these motorists.
Traffic calming measures will not affect the amount of locally bound traffic unless they are so
severe or restrictive as to "degenerate" motor vehicle trips. The other type of motorists traveling
on residential streets is sometimes referred to as "cut-through" motorists. These motorists are
using the residential streets as a short-cut to by-pass nearby collector or arterial streets which
may be congested or out-of-direction to their destination.




                                                                           A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                 12
Bellemeade Avenue
Bellemeade Avenue is the highest volume roadway on which counts were collected. It is
classified by the City of Atlanta as a local roadway; however, at over 9,000 vehicles per day it is
functionally more like a collector and is used by the local motorists as the preferred route
between Howell Mill Road and Northside Drive in the area. A majority of traffic on this road is
anticipated to be unrelated to the Berkeley Park residential area.

There are several reasons as to why Bellemeade Avenue is the most utilized route in this area. In
comparison to other neighborhood roads, Bellemeade is the most equipped to handle the Howell-
Northside traffic as it is the only route to have signals at either end. Furthermore, apart from the
residential Berkeley Park traffic, this route serves adjacent commercial zoned properties which
have property frontage on Bellemeade Avenue. Alternate east-west collectors include Collier
Road (0.7 miles north) and 17th Street (0.62 miles south). It is believed that if traffic were to be
diverted from Bellemeade Ave, the next most likely place for vehicles to go would be less
desirable routes like Verner St, Holmes St, and Antone St. Therefore, traffic calming measures
have not been recommended for this route. Once closer alternate east-west routes are established
(such as the extension of Trabert Ave), it is more feasible that traffic could be diverted away
from Bellemeade Avenue without spilling into the other neighborhood streets.

It is important to consider traffic diversion in the overall design. If traffic calming measures are
installed on only one route, a negative consequence could include shifting the problems to other
undesired locations. A positive result involves diversion of traffic to higher order roads that are
better able to handle it. The City of Atlanta guidelines state that increases of traffic on adjacent
local streets are acceptable based on a curve ranging from a maximum 150 veh/day ­ 400
veh/day (depending on current traffic volumes). No increases are allowed on local streets
exceeding 3,000 vehicles per day. In this case, implementation of traffic calming in Berkeley
Park will shift traffic to Bellemeade Avenue, which currently has daily volumes of greater than
9,000 vehicles. The Atlanta guidelines also state that "an increase in traffic volumes that exceeds
the Impact Threshold Curve does not constitute a fatal flaw to the project unless Traffic and
Transportation makes that determination prior to project implementation." It should be noted that
the increases in through traffic on Bellemeade Avenue would be small in relation to the amounts
already present and limited based on current volumes within the Berkeley Park study area.




                                                                          A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                13
Truck Percentages
As part of this analysis, the percent of heavy trucks was also determined from the tube counts.
For the purposes of this study, trucks are considered as vehicles that are FHWA Vehicle
Classification 5 and higher. The range of percent of heavy trucks that were present at each tube
count location, on average, ranged from 3% to 7%. One tube count on Verner Street was found
to have a much higher truck percent, with a considerable makeup of 23.65% of heavy trucks
traveling in the eastbound direction. The heavy truck percent of the total average daily traffic
volumes is shown in Figure 12.

Origin-Destination Counts
An origin ­ destination study was completed to determine the extent of cut-through traffic
through the Berkeley Park Neighborhood study area during the AM and PM peak hours. Cut-
through motorists do not have a trip end in the vicinity of the residential street in which they are
traveling. This data was determined from a license plate survey that was completed on Friday,
April 20th from 7:00am ­ 9:00am and 4:00pm ­ 6:00pm. From the four hours of data, an AM
and PM peak hour was chosen. It was found that the AM peak hour is from 8:00am ­ 9:00am
and the PM peak hour is from 5:00pm ­ 6:00pm.

The results of the analysis indicate that the highest volume of entering cut-through traffic (in the
AM or PM peak hour) occurs at Verner Street / Howell Mill Road. The majority of the motorists
using this intersection are turning left from Howell Mill Road. The highest amount of exiting
cut-through traffic was found to be at Holmes Street / Northside Dr. All of the motorists using
this intersection are exiting right, onto Northside Drive. In the PM peak hour, equally high
exiting cut-through volumes were seen at Buchanan Street / Bellemeade Ave. Cut-through
motorists that are exiting onto Bellemeade Ave are exiting right and left with the majority

As part of the origin ­ destination study, cut-through paths were determined using the license
plate survey data. Using this data, a record was kept of the travel patterns that a cut-through
vehicle would make through the neighborhood. After all cut-through traffic was identified, the
paths of the cut-through traffic were then determined. The cut-through volumes for both the AM
and PM peak hour are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.

This data indicates that most cut-through traffic is bypassing Bellemeade Ave by traveling south
on Howell Mill Road (likely after turning from Chattahoochee Ave) and turning left onto either
Antone Street or Verner Street then exiting towards right onto Northside Dr.

As shown in Figure 11, the queues on Chattahoochee Avenue are worse for the left turn lane
than the queues for the right turn lane. It is conceived that many vehicles are using the right turn
lane in combination with the neighborhood streets to travel either north on Howell Mill or
towards Northside Drive to avoid these queues.

Volumes Analysis Conclusions

The City of Atlanta's Traffic Calming Device Implementation Guidebook states that tolerable
limits for traffic volumes / cut-through traffic components are not easily defined, nor is there a
easily reached consensus as to what constitutes "too much" traffic. Therefore, the reference
suggests that volumes of through-traffic of fewer than 2.0 vehicles per minute are deemed as
"tolerable". Through traffic volumes between 2.0 ­ 2.5 vehicles are deemed as a "moderate
problem", and through traffic volumes greater than 2.5 vehicles per minute are considered a
"serious problem".

Traffic managers in several communities have need to strike a balance between an approach that
relies on fixed thresholds (or warrants as used for traffic signals in MUTCD) and "best technical
judgment." The strongest argument for these thresholds is standardization, while the counter-
argument is that every traffic calming application is unique. According to the ITE Traffic
Calming State of the Practice, "Volume impacts are much more complex and case-specific than
are speed impacts. They depend on the entire network of which a street is a part, not just on the
characteristics of the street itself. In particular, volume impacts depend fundamentally on the
split between local and through traffic." In this area, the highest through volumes for one road
reaches 45-53% of the traffic.

Volume control measures fall into three classes: those that preclude through traffic; those that
discourage but still allow through traffic; and those that are neutral with respect to through traffic
other than to slow it down. For example, street closures and/or restricting certain movements
would preclude through traffic, adding speed bumps would discourage through traffic, and a
traffic circle would cause minimal diversion. The effect of speed control measures on traffic
volumes vary with the degree of speed reduction. Route choice depends on travel times, and a
route that is traffic calmed becomes less attractive relative to alternate routes. Impacts are also
dependent on the availability and quality of alternative routes.

Specific recommendations for improvements that will reduce traffic volumes are presented in the
Recommendations section of this report. The average daily traffic volumes are shown in Figure
13. The percentage of heavy trucks at various locations is shown in Figure 14. Peak hour
volumes are shown in Figure 15. The percentages of cut through volumes at various locations are
shown in Figure 16, and total peak hour cut-through volumes are shown in Figure 17.

SPEEDING ANALYSIS
In traffic engineering, speed distributions are typically represented by 85th percentile speeds. It
is not the highest speed any motorist travels, but is high enough to represent the probable safe
end of the speed distribution. The posted speed limit throughout the neighborhood is 25 mph,
except for the 30 mph speed limit on Howell Mill Road.

The City of Atlanta's Traffic Calming Device Implementation Guidebook has determined that a
speeding problem exists when the 85th percentile speed exceeds the posted speed limit. The
problem is classified as moderate or serious depending on where the problem falls in between
two threshold lines. A moderate condition for a 25 mph roadway is identified as an 85th
percentile speed that is above 25 mph but below 35 mph. A serious problem for a 25 mph
roadway is identified as an 85th percentile speed that is greater than 35 mph.

A spot speed survey was completed to determine the percentage of total motorists who exceed
the speed limit. This data was collected from tube counts on Friday, April 13th. The 85th
percentile speed is the speed at which 85% of the observed vehicles are traveling at or below.
This speed was determined at each tube count location. The result of the analysis is shown in
Figure 17A.




                              Figure 17A ­ 85th Percentile Speeds




                                                                         A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                23
The analysis indicates that of the 15 tube count locations throughout the neighborhood, two
indicated that drivers are traveling below a posted speed limit of 25 mph. When comparing the
85th percentile speeds to the City of Atlanta thresholds, the results indicate that the overall
speeding problem for Berkeley Park study area would be classified as a moderate condition
under City of Atlanta guidelines.

Speed control measures are of three types: vertical measures, horizontal measures, and
narrowings. A vertical measure would include speed humps while horizontal measures include
traffic circles and lateral shifts. Narrowings include measures such as neckdowns, which use
curb extensions or center islands. Vertical and horizontal devices tend to be more effective in
reducing speeds because a physical impediment is in place. Narrowings can help to improve
pedestrian safety, but are not as effective in reducing speeds. Another approach sometimes used
for speed reduction includes psycho-perceptive controls like centerline and edgeline striping,
unique message signs, transverse markings, and small setbacks. These alternative approaches are
not reported to have success in local street applications.

Speed impacts of traffic calming measures depend primarily on geometrics and spacing.
Geometrics determine the speeds at which motorists travel through slow points. Spacing
determines the extent to which motorists speed up between slow points. In regards to speed
humps/tables, the traffic speed is usually lowered to one third of the original speed at the point of
installation (location of speed hump) and 3-6 mph higher than one third of the original speed
within 100' upstream and downstream.

Specific recommendations for improvements that will reduce vehicular speeds are presented in
the Recommendations section of this report. The 85th percentile speeds located in the
neighborhood are shown in Figure 18. For comparison, the 95th percentile speeds are shown in
Figure 17B.

ACCIDENT RECORD INVESTIGATION
"Perhaps the most compelling effect of traffic calming is in the area of safety. By slowing traffic,
eliminating conflicting movements, and sharpening drivers' attention, traffic calming may result
in fewer collisions. And, because of lower speeds, when collisions do occur, they may be less
serious." ITE - Traffic Calming State of the Practice (1999)

Accident data was obtained for internal intersections as well as intersections on the fringe of the
neighborhood. These accidents have occurred within the last 24 months. The intersections that
experienced accidents are show below in Table 6.

neighborhood is Howell Mill Road / Verner Street. This intersection experiences a high volume
of cut-through traffic as discussed later in the report. Accident volumes for intersections in the
study area can be seen in Figure 19.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Summary of Findings
The two main traffic issues that are present in the neighborhood include a "moderate" to
"serious" speeding problem as well as targeted routes with a large percentage of cut-through
and/or truck traffic. Most cut-through traffic in the neighborhood is originating from the
southbound movement on Howell Mill Road (as an alternate to Bellemeade Avenue) and the
eastbound movement from Chattahoochee Avenue (to avoid queues in the left turn lane).
Speeding is most prevalent on wide-lane, straight, and/or downhill segments within the
neighborhood. Traffic calming devices have been recommended where appropriate to reduce
speed through the neighborhood and reduce and/or eliminate cut-through volumes.

Traffic Diversion as an Area Wide Approach
The routes closer to Bellemeade Avenue and Chattahoochee Avenue (mainly Holmes Street and
Verner St near Howell Mill Road) have been shown to be the most convenient segments for cut-
through traffic; therefore, these routes have been given harsher volume reduction measures than
areas in which speeding is the major concern. By installing traffic calming measures that prohibit
(rather than merely discourage) cut-through traffic on Holmes St and Verner St, these trips will
be forced to use alternate routes.

It is important to consider traffic diversion in the overall design. If traffic calming measures are
installed on only one route, a negative consequence could include shifting the problems to other
undesired locations. A positive result involves diversion of traffic to higher order roads that are
better able to handle it. As discussed earlier in this report, Bellemeade Avenue is the more
appropriate route for this traffic, rather than the southern portion of the Berkeley Park
neighborhood. As the Antone St also has a cut-through problem, and the segment is relatively
close to the prohibited routes, an additional restrictive measure has been recommended there to
prevent cut-through traffic from taking advantage of Antone Street's straight, downhill nature
and few stops. There are very few cut-through routes originating at Berkeley Avenue and Forrest
Street from Howell Mill Road. The distance of Berkeley Avenue and Forrest Street from the
alternate Bellemeade Avenue route, the larger amount of stop controlled intersections, and the
amount of turns required for through traffic are likely to discourage traffic from using these
streets as an alternate to Bellemeade Avenue. As an additional precautionary measure, and to
help abate speeding, some milder calming measures have been recommended for these areas.

As an overall neighborhood recommendation, the installation of "Road Closed to Through
Traffic" signs at each entrance along Howell Mill Road and Northside Drive. This traffic
calming device could be implemented quickly and is relatively less expensive than other traffic
calming devices. Recommended signage and location is shown in Figure 20.


                                                                          A&R Engineering Inc.

Verner Street

Verner Street has the highest amount of entering cut-through traffic in both the AM and PM peak
hours. Cut-through traffic is making a southbound left turn from Howell Mill Road onto Verner
Street, then exiting left and right onto Bellameade Ave. This cut-through movement is motivated
by two possible scenarios. The intersection of Howell Mill Road / Bellemeade Avenue is a
signalized intersection with a 100' dedicated left turn lane and no protected left turn phase.
Southbound vehicles may choose not to turn left onto Bellemeade either due to limited gaps in
northbound traffic or long queues within or past the left turn lane. The other possible scenario
involves vehicles traveling east on Chattahoochee Avenue turning right onto Howell Mill Road
rather than waiting in the long queues for the left turn lane.




                                                                       A&R Engineering Inc.
                                              30
It is recommended that the striped median on Howell Mill Road be replaced with a raised curb
section to prevent left turns into and out of Verner Street.




Median barriers are raised islands located along the centerline of a street and continuing through
an intersection so as to block through movement at a cross street. They are also referred to as
median diverters or occasionally as island diverters. Median barriers are classified as volume
control measures. Their primary purpose is to discourage or eliminate through traffic.




                                                                        A&R Engineering Inc.
                                               31
Holmes Street

Holmes Street experiences a large portion of the neighborhood cut-through traffic. Cut-through
motorists are using Holmes as an east-west route from Howell Mill Road to Northside Drive.
Additionally, cut-through motorist are crossing Holmes Street at Buchanan Street and Tallulah
Street. Some of the cut-through traffic is choosing to not travel on Bellameade Ave to Northside
Drive, but rather through the neighborhood. Furthermore, 85th percentile speeds on Holmes
Street indicates a moderate speeding problem between Buchannan Street and Tallulah Street,
with speeds averaging around 35 mph.




Speeds can be decreased by utilizing extra lane width to install parallel parking spaces at
strategic sections on the roadway to slow vehicular traffic through lateral displacement. This
"chicane" type of horizontal curvature will require drivers to slow down in order to navigate the
curve safely. A level one recommendation includes using flexible delineators to create the
desired parallel parking space boundary and horizontal curvature along the roadway. These
measures should offer reductions in speed and some abatement in cut-through and truck
volumes. A concept design for Holmes Street is located in the Appendix.


                                                                       A&R Engineering Inc.

                                 33
Antone Street

Antone Street has the second highest entrance point for cut-through traffic in the AM peak hour.
Cut-through traffic is making a southbound left turn from Howell Mill Road onto Antone Street
rather than utilizing Bellemeade Avenue. This movement is motivated by two possible scenarios.
The intersection of Howell Mill Road / Bellemeade Avenue is a signalized intersection with a
100' dedicated left turn lane and no protected left turn phase. Southbound vehicles may choose
not to turn left onto Bellemeade either due to limited gaps in northbound traffic or long queues
within or past the left turn lane. The other possible scenario involves vehicles traveling east on
Chattahoochee Avenue turning right onto Howell Mill Road rather than waiting in the long
queues for the left turn lane.




85th percentile speeds on Antone Street indicate a moderate speeding problem, with speeds
averaging around 30 mph. Both the wide lanes and straight downhill slopes (eastbound) on
Antone Street may contribute to increased vehicular speeds. Even though heavy vehicles are
prohibited, truck traffic was counted as many as 52 daily trips on Antone Street (east of
Tallulah).



                                                                        A&R Engineering Inc.
                                               34
A recommendation for Antone Street includes a partial roadway closure or half closure east of
Howell Mill Road to block eastbound traffic from entering the neighborhood. Half closures are
used to help eliminate cut-through traffic by only allowing a one-way travel movement. A level
one recommendation for this road includes using flexible delineators and striping to only allow
westbound traffic to exit Antone Street. This temporary traffic calming device can then be
analyzed to determine if cut-through traffic has decreased. If the half road closure has decreased
cut-through traffic issues, a more permanent obstruction can be installed. This permanent
obstruction consists of landscaping, parking bays or other physical obstruction along the road. A
concept design is located in the Appendix.




                                   Partial/Half Road Closures

Based on input from neighbors, alternative options for Antone Street include:
   x A narrowing of Antone Street to 8'-9' lanes using a combination of striping and curb
       extensions on alternating sides of the roadway
   x Speed bumps to reduce vehicle speeds and discourage cut-through traffic




                                                                        A&R Engineering Inc.
                                               35
Forrest Street, Tallulah Street, and Berkeley Ave

If the recommended traffic calming devices are placed throughout the neighborhood, cut-through
motorists are likely to use alternate routes to avoid these traffic calming devices. A traditional
and typically effective approach to the problem includes the addition of speed humps. A speed
hump has a travel length of approximately 12 feet and a maximum height of 3 to 4 inches. A
speed bump typically has a travel length of 1 to 3 feet with a maximum height of 3 to 6 inches.




The operational difference between a hump and a bump is the impact on vehicles. Speed bumps
cause significant driver discomfort usually resulting in the vehicle slowing to a speed near 5
mph. At high speeds, bumps tend to have less of an impact due to the quick absorption of impact
from the vehicles suspension. Speed humps at relatively low speeds will cause some driver
discomfort resulting in drivers reducing their speed to near 15 mph at the hump and 20 to 25
mph in between humps. If a motorist chooses not to reduce their speed, a hump acts as a bump
causing significant driver discomfort. Therefore, speed humps are recommended in these areas.




                                                                        A&R Engineering Inc.

When determining the ideal spacing of speed humps, the deciding factor becomes the desired
85th percentile speed. Research has shown that on a flat road, 275 foot intervals are ideal in
maintaining a speed of 25 mph. This spacing varies from one road to another, and should be
determined on specific road characteristics such as grade, length of road, number of intersections
and noise. Approximate speed hump locations, for the roads listed above, are shown in the
Appendix.




Based on input from neighbors, additional measures to reduce cut-through traffic for Berkeley
Avenue and Forrest Street include narrowing of the streets to 8'-9' lanes using a combination of
striping and curb extensions on alternating sides of the roadway.

Summary of Recommendations

Recommendations have been made for the neighborhood streets using a tiered approach. A level
one recommendation can be implemented quickly and will require a smaller amount of physical
change to the existing street and are used as a stepping stone towards a level two
recommendation. A level two recommendation will be a more involved physical change to the
roadway, requiring the street to undergo construction if necessary. A condensed list of
recommendations for the neighborhood streets is listed below.




Verner Street
Traffic Calming Device: Median barrier
Install a median in the existing striped area on Howell Mill Road to prevent left turns into and
out of Verner Street.
    x Level One: Use flexible delineators to create a barrier.
    x Level Two: Replace flexible delineators with mountable curb or other physical
        obstruction



                                                                       A&R Engineering Inc.
                                              38
Holmes Street
Traffic Calming Device: Horizontal Displacement
Install parking bays at strategic locations along the section of road between Buchanan St and
Tallulah St.
    x Level One: Use striping and flexible delineators to create the diagonal closure within the
        intersection. Stripe additional parking bays and adjust double yellow centerline.
    x Level Two: Replace striping and flexible delineators with curb and gutter or other
        physical obstructions. Add curbed bulb-outs the beginning and end of each parking area
        to further protect the bays.

Antone Street
Traffic Calming Device: Partial/Half Roadway Closure
Install a traffic island, east of Howell Mill Road, to restrict traffic from traveling eastbound on
Antone Street.
    x Level One: Use striping and flexible delineators to create traffic island.
    x Level Two: Replace striping and flexible delineators with curb and gutter or other
        physical obstructions.

Forrest Street, Tallulah Street, and Berkeley Ave
Traffic Calming Device: Speed Humps
Install speed humps at strategic locations.

Detailed recommendations for each of the streets listed above are included in the previous
section of this report. Concept designs are provided in the Appendix.

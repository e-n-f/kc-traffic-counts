    INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND NEED
The purpose of this safety study is to evaluate the existing safety performance and identify potential
countermeasures to reduce traffic crashes and congestion for the Cedar Road and Brainard Road
intersection including the adjacent intersections that comprise the Interstate 271 (IR-271) interchange.
The project area lies within the jurisdiction of the following cities in Cuyahoga County, Ohio:
Lyndhurst, Beachwood, and Pepper Pike. The focus of the safety study and potential countermeasures
is shown on Figure 1.

A review of crash data provided by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) yielded a total of
445 crashes within the project area during a 3-year period between 2009 and 2011. Of the total reported
crashes, 159 crashes (35.7 percent) were recorded on IR-271 and 286 crashes (64.3 percent) along
Cedar Road and Brainard Road arterials and study intersections. Of the total crashes on the mainline,
31.4 percent resulted in injury, which is significantly higher than the statewide average of 23.9 percent
for injury crashes on a state route, freeway location.

On the surface streets, 25.9 percent of crashes resulted in injury, which is similar to the statewide
average of 23.8 percent for injury crashes on a non-state system. No fatalities occurred during the study
period. The following crash types and conditions are over represented on the project surface streets
compared to the statewide averages (shown in parentheses).

Rear End: 172 crashes or 60.1 percent                    (20.6 percent)
Sideswipe-Passing: 51 crashes or 17.8 percent             (6.9 percent)
The findings from this safety study are to focus on short and medium term countermeasures that
improve the safety performance of the study area. While long term countermeasures may be
identified for further study, it is the intent of the ODOT safety program to identify feasible
countermeasures that can be implemented in a short period of time. Therefore, the basic
configuration of the existing ramps and bridge type/sizes are assumed to be unchanged. The
recommended countermeasures will improve safety performance of the Cedar/Brainard
interchange. Longer term countermeasures should be considered once short and medium term
countermeasures are implemented and evaluated for effectiveness. This approach is also
consistent with FHWA's 8-point policy for Interchange Access Modification studies.

STUDY AREA
The study area is comprised of four signalized intersections surrounding the IR-271 and Cedar/
Brainard Road interchange:

    >   Cedar Road at Brainard Road
    >   Cedar Road at southbound entrance ramp to IR-271
    >   Brainard Road at northbound IR-271 ramps
    >   Brainard Road at southbound exit ramp from IR-271

The study area also includes a segment of northbound IR-271 that extends from the Cedar/Brainard
Road interchange to a point 1.5 miles in advance of the interchange. Queues extend from the
northbound exit ramp terminal onto the mainline lanes of IR-271 interstate on a daily basis. The safety
performance associated with this congestion during the AM and PM peak periods is documented in
order to develop targeted countermeasures. A study area map is shown in Figure 2.

BACKGROUND
The signalized intersections within the study area of the Cedar/Brainard interchange have been the
subject of numerous studies over the past decade to identify feasible countermeasures to reduce
congestion. A brief summary of the previous studies are summarized below:

1. I-271 ­ Cedar/Brainard Access Point Modification Study (2002) (PID 21029 ­ Cedar Road Deck
   Replacement)
    The interchange modification study identified several potential alternatives that were not evaluated.
    In particular, Alternative #10 suggested two modifications to the existing ramp configuration to
    increase capacity of the existing interchange:

    >   New directional ramp from northbound IR-271 to east Cedar Road
        The purpose of this new directional ramp is to reduce the right turn volume at the NB IR-271
        ramps and Brainard Road intersection which are destined to east Cedar Road. The peak
        demand for this movement occurs during the AM peak period. Existing right turning volumes
        that are destined to east Cedar Road are estimated to be 539 vehicles in the AM peak period.
        Figure 3 shows a schematic plan of the ramp configuration.

                          New Directional Ramp




        Source: IR-271 Cedar/Brainard Access Point Modification Study (2002)

    >   New directional ramp from southbound Brainard Road to southbound IR-271
        The purpose of this new directional ramp is to reduce the left turn volume at the SB IR-271
        ramp and Cedar Road intersection. Figure 3 shows a ramp connection defined as a `marginal
        road' that connects Brainard Road to the SB IR-271/Cedar Road intersection. [This marginal
        road connection is not recommended for further study ­ the addition of a third signal
        phase at the southbound IR-271/Cedar Road intersection would further increase delays at
        the existing signalized intersection. ]

2. Brainard/Cedar Technical Memorandum (2009)
   The study was commissioned by the Cuyahoga County Engineers Office. The purpose of the traffic
   study was to document existing AM traffic operations and to recommend short, medium, and long
   term solutions which would alleviate congestion during the peak period. It was noted that traffic
   demand exceeded capacity of many movements at the signalized intersections ­ the southbound left
   turn movement at the Cedar/Brainard intersection was 900 vehicles resulting in a level of service
   (LOS) F. Short term recommendations consisted of revised signal timing and phasing to optimize
   operations. No medium term recommendations such as the extension of left turn lane lengths or
   additional turn lanes were considered due to the minimal signal spacing constraints of the Brainard
   Road corridor. The preferred long term alternative was a directional ramp from northbound IR-271
   to eastbound Cedar Road similar to the concept shown in Figure 3.

3. Preliminary Engineering Study of NB IR-271 directional ramp (2010)
   A preliminary engineering study (CUY-271-10.43) was performed on the proposed improvement
   that constructs a directional ramp from northbound IR-271 to eastbound Cedar Road (Figure 3).
   The topography and proximity of the power substation required substandard design criteria for the
   ramp typical section, horizontal, and vertical design elements.

    Additional capacity analysis should evaluate the need for a two lane exit ramp that diverges from
    mainline IR-271, lane utilization of the two lane exit ramp with a directional ramp to eastbound
    Cedar Road (1,500 vehicles in a single lane AM peak), and weaving on Cedar Road between the
    proposed ramp and Brainard Road (400 feet). Refinements to the ramp configuration may include a
    single lane ramp at the Cedar Road intersection; a free flow ramp design to channelize the right
    turning movement and to reduce right-of-way impacts adjacent to the substation; and associated
    right-of-way impacts of a longer ramp (vertical criteria) and weaving with residential access points
    along Cedar Road.

    The elevation difference between IR-271 and the substation is approximately 20 feet.

4. Road Safety Audit (2012)
   A road safety audit (RSA) was conducted at the Cedar/Brainard interchange by a team led by
   NOACA. The study area and associated crash data (279 crashes) was limited to the four signalized
   intersections included in this safety study. Numerous countermeasures were identified and some
   incorporated as part of this safety study. Countermeasures or activities being implemented include
   the following:
        >      A signal timing analysis for signals along the Brainard Road corridor
        >      Delineators near the junction of the NB IR-271 loop ramp and WB Cedar Road.
        >      Evaluate removal of vandal fencing on bridge to improve intersection sight distance of
               northbound IR-271 ramp traffic turning right on red at Brainard Road.
        >      Evaluate capacity upgrades to Brainard Road and a new directional ramp from NB IR-271
               to EB Cedar Road.
    The Executive Summary from the RSA is shown in Appendix A.

5. Signal Timing Analysis (2013)
   Revised signal timing and progression analysis was conducted for several alternatives (AM and PM
   peak periods) on the Brainard Road corridor. One signal phasing recommendation is to serve the
   southbound Brainard Road left turn movement twice in a single cycle with a lead and a lagging
   protected left turn phase ­ existing (2012) demand volumes are nearly 900 vehicles in the AM peak
   period. Implementation of the revised signal timing is planned for September 2013.

    EXISTING CONDITIONS
ROADWAY CONDITIONS
The Interstate Route 271 (IR-271) is an auxiliary interstate highway that connects Interstate 71 at the
south end with Interstate 90 at the north end. The highway is officially designated the Outerbelt East
Freeway and is divided within express (2-lanes) and local (3-lanes) lanes within the study area.

The Cedar Road/Brainard Road/IR-271 interchange (exit 32) located within Cuyahoga County
provides access to the cities of Lyndhurst as well as Pepper Pike (south), Beachwood (west), and
Mayfield Heights (east). The Cedar Road/Brainard Road/IR-271 interchange is a hybrid interchange
having ramps that intersect with local roadways at signalized intersections and has a loop ramp that
provides a free flow movement from northbound IR-271 to westbound Cedar Road. Adjacent
interchanges along the IR-271 corridor include US 322/Mayfield Road (2 miles north) and US
422/Chagrin Blvd (3 miles south). Both experience peak hour congestion as well.

Cedar Road is a variable width roadway having a lane configuration that varies between 4 and 7 lanes
within the study area. Brainard Road is a variable width roadway having a lane configuration that
varies between 2 and 6 lanes. Cedar Road and Brainard Road intersect at an at-grade intersection
south and east of the IR-271 interchange. Roadway conditions are summarized in Table 1.

INTERSECTION CONDITIONS
The study area is comprised of four signalized intersections. The coordinated traffic signal system on
Cedar Road (operated by the City of Beachwood) is independent of the coordinated traffic signal
system on Brainard Road (operated by the City of Lyndhurst). For purposes of this safety study, the
recently revised (2013) signal timing developed for the Brainard Road corridor is assumed to
represent the existing condition on Brainard Road although field observations occurred prior to
implementation.
The existing conditions and traffic operations at these nodes are summarized below.

1. Northbound IR-271 Ramps at Brainard Road Intersection
   The intersection provides access from (exit ramp) and to (entrance ramp) the northbound local
   lanes of IR-271. The intersection is controlled by a traffic signal operating a 3-phase sequence.
   southbound left turn phase (protected/permissive), northbound/southbound Brainard Road, and
   the northbound IR-271 exit ramp (eastbound approach).

    The lane configuration at the signalized intersection is comprised of two northbound lanes (TR-
    R), three southbound lanes (L-T-T), two eastbound lanes (L-R), and two eastbound receiving
    lanes on the IR-271 entrance ramp.

    Traffic operations observed in the field are documented below:

         >   Queues on the northbound IR-271 exit ramp regularly extend more than a mile in
             advance of the signalized intersection primarily during the AM and PM peak periods.
             Three factors contribute to the length of queues that extend from the northbound IR-271
             exit ramp.
                  o   Queue blockage. Queue lengths more than 500 feet long from the Brainard Road
                      intersection can block the free flow loop ramp to westbound Cedar Road which
                      increases the length of the queue that forms on the northbound IR-271 exit ramp.
                      Queues in the AM peak period are attributed to the right turn traffic demand (590
                      vehicles) at the Brainard Road intersection. Queues in the PM peak period are
                      attributed to the left turn traffic demand (503 vehicles) at the Brainard Road
                      intersection. Note that traffic volumes exceeding 300 vehicles per lane in the
                      peak hour typically exceed the capacity of a single lane at a 3-leg intersection.
                  o   Ramp capacity. The combined traffic volume demand of the northbound IR-271
                      exit ramp is nearly 2,200 vehicles in the AM peak period and 1,800 vehicles in
                      the PM peak period. The combined traffic volumes include traffic destined to
                      Brainard Road and to westbound Cedar Road. Peak hour volumes for the AM
                      and PM peak hour exceed the threshold for a single lane diverging ramp (1,500
                      vehicles).
                  o   Network congestion. Right turning vehicles destined to eastbound Cedar Road
                      were observed to extend through the NB IR-271/Brainard intersection from the
                      dual left turn lanes at the Cedar/Brainard intersection in the AM peak period. Left
                      turning vehicles destine to Lyndhurst were observed to extend through the
                      northbound IR-271/Brainard intersection from the single through lane at the
                      southbound IR-271 exit ramp.
             A rolling queue (35 MPH estimated) that extended beyond decel lane for northbound IR-
             271 exit ramp was observed between 4:45PM and 6:00PM. A rolling queue (less than 15
             MPH) that extended beyond decel lane for the northbound IR-271 exit ramp was
             observed at 5:00PM.
         >   Drivers use the inside shoulder of the northbound I-271 exit ramp to bypass queues
             during both AM and PM peak periods. The ramp is effectively two lanes between the
             Cedar Road bridge and the beginning of the loop ramp. Local enforcement officers
             (LEO) will occasionally cite motorists for using the shoulder as a travel lane though use
             of the shoulder is beneficial to reduce queues on IR-271 mainline.
         >   Through traffic on the northbound Brainard Road approach restricts the effective capacity
             of the right turn movement. Northbound through traffic would regularly block the
             entrance ramp causing traffic to change lanes abruptly (from the shared lane to the curb
             lane) if destined to the northbound IR-271 entrance ramp.

         >   A northbound right turn overlap on Brainard Road operates during the exit ramp phase to
             maximize capacity of the signalized intersection. A potential conflict exists if an
             eastbound vehicle on the northbound IR-271 exit ramp drives across Brainard Road. The
             regulatory lane use signs for the northbound IR-271 exit ramp show an exclusive left and
             exclusive right turn lane.
         >   The southbound through lanes are imbalanced during the peak periods. The inside
             through lane during the AM peak hour defaults to be a left turn lane extension for the
             southbound dual left turn lanes at the Cedar/Brainard intersection. The curb lane on the
             southbound approach during the PM peak hour defaults to be a right turn lane extension
             for the southbound right turn at the Cedar/Brainard intersection.
         >   A pedestrian phase crosses the north leg of the intersection. Sidewalk does not exist
             between Cedar and the northbound IR-271 ramps (west side).

2. Cedar Road at Brainard Road Intersection
   The intersection is located 440 feet south of the northbound IR-271 ramp intersection. The
   intersection is controlled by a traffic signal operating a four-phase sequence: northbound left turn
   phase (protected only), northbound/southbound Brainard Road, eastbound left turn phase
   (protected only), eastbound/westbound Cedar Road. The southbound right turn lane operates as
   an overlap during the eastbound left turn phase.
    The lane configuration at the signalized intersection is comprised of three northbound lanes (L-T-
    R), four southbound lanes (L-L-T-R), four eastbound lanes (L-L-T-TR), and four westbound
    lanes (L-T-T-R).

    Traffic operations observed in the field are documented below:

         >   The dual eastbound left turn lanes on Cedar Road are imbalanced due to the proximity of
             the northbound IR-271 entrance ramp and queues that form in the shared through-right
             lane at the entrance ramp.
         >   The southbound left turn phase was modified to call the phase twice during the same
             cycle (dual service). The proximity of the adjacent intersection resulted required the need
             for shorter queue lengths. The dual service concept was recommended to better
             accommodate the arrival type of platoons turning left.
         >   The southbound dual left turn lanes on Brainard Road are imbalanced due to the
             proximity of a merge condition about 1,000 feet east of the intersection. Left turning
             traffic favors the inside through lane since the curb lane is required to merge near the
             Windy Lane intersection.
         >   The eastbound through lanes are imbalanced on Cedar Road due to the proximity of a
             lane merge condition about 1,000 feet east of the intersection. ODOT design guidance
             suggests a lane transition provide 1,000 to 1,500 feet before merging traffic.
         >   The northbound left turn lane has a negative offset leading to limited intersection sight
             distance of turning vehicles and opposing through traffic. Signal phasing is recently
             changed to be a protected only movement in order to accommodate the dual servicing
             (two phases during same cycle) of the southbound left turn movement effectively
             mitigating this condition.
         >   Pedestrian crossings of Cedar Road exist on the east and west legs of the intersection.
             The pedestrian crossing is prohibited on the south leg of the intersection. The pedestrian

             phases to cross Cedar Road are recalled. Pedestrian signal timing greater is than through
             vehicle demand especially for the west leg pedestrian crossing.
         >   Guardrail exists in the northwest quadrant of the intersection. No sidewalk exists in the
             northwest quadrant of the intersection. A person in a wheelchair was observed using the
             crosswalks at the intersection to continue north on Brainard Road from Beachwood.
         >   Multiple cycle backup was observed during the PM peak period on the northbound
             approach. The existing northbound right turn volume of 8 vehicles is low for an
             exclusive right turn lane. The lane configuration on the northbound approach is L-T-R.
         >   Dual left turn lanes do not have curve widening on the receiving lanes to accommodate
             turning traffic.

3. Southbound IR-271 Exit Ramp at Brainard Road Intersection
   The intersection is located 600 feet north of the northbound IR-271 ramp intersection. The
   intersection is controlled by a traffic signal operating a 2-phase sequence: northbound/
   southbound Brainard Road and the southbound IR-271 exit ramp (westbound approach).

    The lane configuration at the signalized intersection is comprised of one northbound through lane,
    two southbound through lanes, and two westbound lanes (L-LR). Traffic operations observed in
    the field are documented below:

         >   The dual left turn lanes accommodate the major movement. Queues often extend to the
             ramp gore during AM and PM peak periods. Queues favor the left lane in the AM peak
             period since they are destined to the southbound left turn movement at the Cedar Road
             intersection. Queues favor the right lane in the PM peak period since they are destined to
             the southbound right turn movement at the Cedar Road intersection.
         >   Left turning vehicles destine to Cedar Road were observed to extend through the
             southbound IR-271/Brainard intersection from the through lanes at the NB IR-
             271/Brainard intersection.

4. Southbound IR-271 Entrance Ramp at Cedar Road Intersection
   The intersection is located 325 feet east of the Acacia Park Drive intersection in the City of
   Beachwood. The intersection is controlled by a traffic signal operating a two-phase sequence:
   eastbound/ westbound Cedar Road and the westbound left turn phase.

    The lane configuration at the signalized intersection is comprised of two westbound through lane,
    three eastbound lanes (T-TR-R), and two southbound receiving lanes This lane configuration was
    the result of interchange improvements constructed in 2005. Traffic operations observed in the
    field are documented below:

         >   The City of Beachwood operates long cycle lengths to maximize throughput on Cedar
             Road. Cycle lengths during the peak periods vary between 175 seconds and 220 seconds
             during shopping seasons.
         >   The shared through-right turn lane on the eastbound approach is imbalanced due to the
             upstream lane configuration. Traffic in the eastbound curb lane at the Acacia Park Drive
             intersection are primarily destined to the exclusive right and shared through-right lane at
             the southbound IR-271 entrance ramp intersection.

         >   A limited number of vehicles traveling in the inside through lane on the eastbound
             approach of Acacia Park Drive are able to change lanes and access the southbound IR-
             271 ramp. The length of the right turn lane (225 feet) provides a limited opportunity for
             multiple lanes to access the southbound ramp.
         >   Ground mounted signal heads on the eastbound approach show right arrows to facilitate
             the right turn movement. The right turn arrows show red indications when a pedestrian
             places a call to cross the south leg of the intersection.
         >   The curb in the southeast quadrant of the intersection is damaged due to westbound left
             turning vehicles.

DATA COLLECTION
Turning movement counts were performed at the signalized intersections within the study area
August 7 and 9, 2012 as part of the recent signal timing analysis (2013) along Brainard Road. Data
for turning movement counts was collected during the following time periods: 6:30-9:30AM,
11:00AM-1:00PM, and 3:30-6:30PM. Mechanical tube counts were also placed on Brainard Road
and on the northbound IR-271 loop ramp during the weekday and weekend periods. Appendix D
contains the traffic data from a February 2013 memo prepared for the signal timing task.

The manual turning movement data collected as part of the signal timing analysis was used as a basis
for design year analyses of potential countermeasures. Manual count data was submitted to the
NOACA for certification of design year growth rates. Certified growth rates for the design year are
provided in Appendix D.

Lane imbalances were noted as part of the field observations. The lane imbalances are attributed to
the proximity of adjacent signalized intersections, of major turning movements, and/or changes of
lane continuity (lane drop or through lane transitions). Time lapse video from June 4-5, 2012 was
provided by ODOT District 12 for the AM and PM peak periods. The time lapse video was used to
document the lane utilization of major movements that are serviced with two travel lanes. Table 2
summarizes the lane utilization of the following movements and contributing factor(s).

The lane utilization factor (FLU) is calculated using the following equation:


                                  fLU = Total Approach Volume
                                        (No. of Lanes) x
                                        (High Lane Vol)

The default lane utilization factor applied by the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) is 0.97. The lane
utilization of dual turn lanes within the study area are lower than the default values thus adversely
affecting intersection capacity.
Research sponsored by the North Carolina DOT (February 2005) documented how lane drops and
merges downstream of a signalized intersection affect lane utilization (LU). The key findings and
conclusions are summarized below.

    >    Congestion affects lane utilization. There is a greater tendency for drivers to use both travel
         lanes when traffic volumes increase. Lane utilization calculations for the safety study are
         based on the peak 15 minute period of the peak hour (highest lane utilization). Lane
         utilization is expected to decrease during off-peak periods.
    >    Lane utilization at most types of intersections is affected by the length of the shortest lane. A
         long distance to the lane drop leads to higher lane utilization.
    >    The existence of a two way left turn lane (TWLTL) or a mid-block left turn bay tends to
         increase the LU factor.
    >    Lane drops into an exclusive turn lane have more equal lane volume distribution than a mid-
         block lane merge. Safety performance however is not affected by the type of lane transition
         downstream.
    >    Taper length significantly affects lane utilization and safety performance at freeway ramp
         junction areas.

    CRASH ANALYSIS
CRASH DATA -- GENERAL
Crash data was furnished by the Ohio Department of Transportation for the Cedar/ Brainard
interchange study area, encompassing a three-year study period between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2011. The OH-1 report for each documented crash was reviewed to confirm accuracy
and to locate crashes properly within the study limits. The crash diagrams for the study area are
included in Appendix E.
Non-freeway statistics were used for comparison purposes for crashes recorded on the surface streets
and freeway statistics were used for IR-271 mainline crashes influenced by the ramps. Statewide
averages for crashes on the state system, freeway and non-state system, non-freeway locations as
applicable are shown in parentheses based on data for years 2007 through 2011.

Mainline (Total crashes ­ 159)
    > Injury: 50 crashes or 31.4 percent                                             (23.9 percent)
    >   Rear end: 121 crashes or 76.1 percent                                        (29.9 percent)
Surface Streets (Total crashes ­ 286)
    > Injury: 74 or 25.9 percent                                                     (23.8 percent)
    >   Rear end: 172 crashes or 60.1 percent                                        (20.6 percent)
    >   Sideswipe Passing: 51 crashes or 17.8 percent                                 (6.9 percent)
    >   Wet: 96 crashes or 33.6 percent                                              (19.8 percent)

The crash frequency suggests that congestion is a contributing factor to the safety performance of the
study area. Graphs 1 through 3 show the crash frequency by day of week, time of day, and month
of year.
    >   Day of Week (Graph 1). Friday represents the day of week with the highest crash frequency
        (95 crashes or 21.3 percent) ­ Graph 1 ranks crashes by day of week from high to low. The
        24-hour tube count data shows that the highest volumes recorded on the northbound IR-271
        loop ramp (free flow conditions) occurred on a Friday (> 1,400 vehicles per hour).
        Another count station on Brainard Road north of the IR-271 interchange (see Appendix D)
        showed that traffic volumes were consistent over several days. The traffic data at this location
        suggests that the capacity of the existing roadway network was measured instead of the
        demand volumes.
    >   Time of Day (Graph 2). The highest crash frequency (86 crashes or 19.3 percent) occurred
        during the 5PM peak hour. Traffic volumes vary between the AM and PM peak hour by as
        much as 36 percent (Brainard Road north of the IR-271 interchange). The next highest hour
        for crashes occurred during the 6PM peak hour (46 crashes or 10.3 percent).
    >   Month of Year (Graph 3). The highest crash frequency (104 crashes or 23.4%) occurred during
        the month of December. The City of Beachwood increases the cycle length on Cedar Road
        from 175 seconds up to 220 seconds to deliver the traffic demand associated with seasonal
        shopping at Beachwood Place and other commercial developments in the region.

The action of the driver not at-fault was documented in the majority of crashes (283 crashes or 63.5
percent) as slowing or stopped in traffic. Long queue lengths extending through adjacent signalized

CRASH ANALYSIS BY LOCATION
The crash data set used for the safety study includes crashes that occurred on the local lanes of
northbound IR-271. These crashes were combined with crashes on the local street network and
subdivided by location. The statewide averages for crashes using the combined crash database were
compared to the crash data by location as shown in Table 3.

The relative severity index (RSI) was also calculated for each location. The RSI represents the
relative cost to society of a specific type of crash (head on, rear end, angle accident, etc.). The RSI is
the sum of the relative costs per crash divided by the total number of crashes. These values represent
crashes in the most recent and consecutive three year period. The RSI is updated periodically
according to cost adjustments (i.e. inflation) associated with each crash type. The current index and
scoring scale can be found on the ODOT Office of Local Programs website.

countermeasures. Supplemental information in addition to the crash summary (Table 3) and crash
diagrams (Appendix E) is noted below.

1. Brainard Road at Northbound IR-271 Ramps
   The percentage of angle crashes (44.8%) here is more than twice the statewide average. The
   corresponding injury crashes (34.4%) here are the highest location within the study area.

    All right angle crashes (17 of the 43 angle crashes) involved southbound through vehicles and
    eastbound left turning vehicles. The majority of at-fault drivers (82 percent) are southbound
    through vehicles running the red signal. The balance of crashes did not assign fault due to both
    drivers claiming they had the right of way. The frequency of red light running crashes at the
    intersection is attributed to the limited intersection sight distance between southbound traffic on
    Brainard Road and of eastbound traffic on the northbound IR-271 exit ramp. Research conducted
    by Dr. Timothy Gates of Wayne State University documented that a driver's tendency to run a
    red light increases when a driver perceives that a conflicting movement is not present. Traffic on
    the ramp approach is obstructed by the bridge parapet and vandal fence giving motorists on
    Brainard Road the faulty perception that the risk of a conflicting movement is low.

    Most turning angle crashes (22 of the 43 angle crashes) involved northbound vehicles turning
    right onto the northbound IR-271 entrance ramp. Vehicles in the shared through-right turn lane
    turn into vehicles in the exclusive right turn lane. Field observations noted that vehicles in the
    shared through-right turn lane would change lanes abruptly to avoid northbound through vehicles
    stopping for the traffic signal.

2. Northbound IR-271 Mainline
   The location with the highest number of crashes was those that occurred on the northbound
   IR-271 exit ramp or on the northbound local lanes of IR-271 within one mile upstream of the
   gore. Reoccurring congestion on IR-271 is well documented and observed in the field.

    This location also experienced the highest number of injury crashes (50 of a total of 124 crashes).
    The number of injury crashes that resulted in incapacitating injuries was also the highest of all
    locations (four of a total of six incapacitating injury crashes). The speed differential between
    queues that extend from the Cedar Road/Brainard Road/IR-271 interchange and free flow traffic
    on the local lanes of IR-271 contribute to the frequency of injury and rear end crashes.

    The crash data also shows that a majority of crashes (62 percent) at this location occur during the
    PM peak period (5-8PM). Potential countermeasures should focus on mitigating congestion
    during the PM peak period.

3. Cedar Road at Southbound IR-271 Entrance Ramp
   The percentage of rear end crashes (71.4%) is nearly four times the statewide average. Crashes
   are distributed over several hours of an average day (12 to 5PM) as indicated by the low
   percentage of crashes occurring in the AM and PM peak periods. This crash type is attributed to
   congestion considering the average daily traffic on Cedar Road is 34,000 vehicles ­ demand
   volumes are expected to be higher than the historical ADT volume. Eastbound right turning
   vehicles destined to southbound IR-271 exceed the lane capacity of a single lane (800 vehicles
   per hour) ­ right turning vehicles in the AM peak hour are nearly 1,500 vehicles whereas right
   turning vehicles in the PM peak hour are more than 1,100 vehicles.

    The percentage of sideswipe passing crashes (23.5%) is more than three times the statewide
    average. The following factors contribute to the sideswipe passing crashes: geometry of the
    entrance ramp requires slow speed turns for dual turning movements (eastbound right and
    westbound left turns); westbound left turns must navigate an S-curve alignment to access the
    entrance ramp; the lane use assignments on the westbound approach to the signalized intersection
    also contribute to sideswipe crashes ­ motorists are required to change lanes to avoid dedicated
    turn lanes.

    The traffic control plan of the study area does not maintain lane continuity for through traffic
    especially on Cedar Road. This lane configuration in general terms is considered necessary for
    several reasons:

        >    Through lanes dropping to an exclusive turn lane best accommodates major turning
             movements between closely spaced intersections by providing better lane balance at
             upstream intersections.
        >    Traffic destine to opposite ends of the study area does not represent the majority of the
             trip ends.
        >    Traffic wanting to traverse opposite ends of the study area is typically local trips by
             drivers most familiar with the lane configuration of the surrounding road network.

        >    Adequate overhead lane use signs are required to communicate the appropriate lane
             assignment for traffic approaching this intersection in particular.

4. Cedar Road at Brainard Road Intersection
   The percentage of sideswipe passing crashes (25.9%) is nearly four times the statewide average
   and is distributed on all legs of the signalized intersection. Motorists were observed changing
   lanes abruptly to avoid long queues that form on the approaches. The long queues also contribute
   to the elevated rear end crash frequency at this location.

5. Brainard Road at Southbound IR-271 Exit Ramp
   Although this location experienced the lowest number of crashes (34 crashes) during the 3-year
   period, this location experienced the highest percentage of rear-end crashes (76.5 percent). Rear
   end crashes are concentrated on the westbound approach of the southbound IR-271 exit ramp (14
   crashes) and the northbound approach of Brainard Road (9 crashes).

    Crashes are distributed throughout the day with the highest number occurring in the 12PM and
    2PM time periods.

Other crashes were documented at the existing loop ramp. A total of three fixed object/out of control
crashes and an additional two crashes lost control and sideswiped eastbound vehicles. A few other
crashes also were the result of vehicles exiting from the loop ramp and trying to make a U-turn to
travel east on Cedar Road. Two vehicles were observed in the field making a U-turn from the loop
ramp to travel east on Cedar Road during the PM peak period.

    COUNTERMEASURES
The following section addresses contributing factors associated with the prevalent crash types by
identifying potential countermeasures to improve lane utilization of the existing roadway, reduce
queues, increase capacity along the Brainard Road corridor, and reduce queue lengths on the
northbound IR-271 ramp. Additional countermeasures are recommended to minimize potential safety
issues that may not be directly attributable to historical crash trends. A conceptual plan (Figure 4)
shows the countermeasures proposed below.

Improvements to the Cedar/Brainard interchange will require an updated IMS to justify medium and
long term improvements that affect capacity of IR-271. Improvements identified as a preferred
alternative resulting from an interchange modification study typically are implemented no more than 8
years after approval of the document by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

SYSTEM WIDE COUNTERMEASURE
A short term countermeasure that is proposed for all signalized intersections is to revise the clearance
intervals for protected only left turn phases. Revised yellow clearance and all red clearance times per
ODOT Traffic Engineering Manual and ITE guidelines are summarized in Appendix F.
Recommended clearance intervals are based on posted speeds (35 MPH) and actual crossing
distances. NCHRP Report 731 dated July 2012 confirms that the ITE clearance interval guidelines
are used by the highest percentage of state and local agencies resulting in a total crash reduction of 8
to 14 percent ­ an injury reduction of 12 percent also can be expected.

The NCHRP Report 731 also recommends using a design speed of 20 MPH for left turning vehicles.
This finding is consistent with research conducted by the North Carolina Department of
Transportation published by the ITE Journal determined that the average operating speed for left
turning traffic is 17 miles per hour. Clearance intervals referenced in Appendix F are based on a
design speed of 25 miles per hour unless a lagging left turn phase. This methodology helps provide
adequate all-red clearance times based on operating speeds and avoids excessively long clearance
intervals (yellow + AR).

Other short and medium term countermeasures are proposed by location below.

BRAINARD ROAD AND NORTHBOUND IR-271 RAMPS & BRAINARD ROAD AND SOUTHBOUND IR-271
EXIT RAMP
These countermeasures focus on the Brainard Road and northbound IR-271 ramp intersection. The
proposed countermeasures also improve the safety performance of the southbound IR-271 ramp
intersection.

1. Increase Capacity of Northbound Approach
   The capacity and safety of the northbound approach is to be increased with the following
   improvements:
        >   Add a third lane between Cedar Road and the northbound IR-271 ramp intersection
            Revise the lane configuration from TR-R to a future lane configuration of
            T-TR-R. The additional lane will reduce the frequency of through traffic blocking the
            shared through-right lane. Additional right-of-way is expected to accommodate the
            relocation of overhead power lines and sign supports.

                                                              CUY-271-9.9/10.5 SAFETY STUDY  ODOT DISTRICT 12



       >   Add overhead lane use signs (200 feet) and a guide sign (350 feet) in advance of the
           intersection.
                  o   The lane use sign for the right turn lane should have an advisory distance plaque
                      (200 feet) to warn motorists of the lane configuration at the traffic signal. The
                      guide sign would have a yellow panel to demark the dedicated right turn lane to
                      northbound IR-271. Add route marker adjacent to right turning lanes indicating
                      IR-271 as a destination ­ the curb lane would have an ONLY plaque. Overhead
                      signs should also encourage through traffic to keep left when traveling
                      northbound on Brainard Road.
                  o   A changeable lane use may be considered to encourage the desired lane
                      assignment to time of day (i.e., dual right turn lanes for the PM peak period).
       >   Construct a raised median to channelize right turning traffic destined to northbound IR-
           271 from through traffic on Brainard Road
           The frequency of through traffic blocking the ramp should be reduced with the additional
           through lane on the northbound approach-- stacking for about 2 vehicles is possible
           before blocking the ramp resulting in increased utilization of the shared lane by right
           turning traffic. The raised median will enable the right turn overlap to operate without
           conflicting with eastbound through traffic.
       >   Right turn movement would yield to left turning traffic
       >   Merge warning signs on the ramp should be converted to have the left lane end instead of
           the right lane
       >   Remove transverse lines on the bridge and convert to two northbound through lanes

2. Increase Capacity of the Eastbound Approach (Northbound IR-271 Exit Ramp)
   The capacity and safety of the eastbound approach is to be increased with the following
   improvements:

       >   Construct an additional shared left-through-right turn lane (L-LTR-R) on the eastbound
           approach
           The improvement will extend 400 feet from the stop line on the ramp approach. The
           shared lane will be used in the AM peak as a dual right turn lane by traffic that is destine
           to eastbound Cedar Road. The shared lane will be used in the PM peak as a dual left turn
           lane by traffic destine to northbound Brainard Road. A changeable lane use may be
           considered to encourage the desired lane assignment by time of day.
       >   Revise pavement markings on existing single lane ramp to accommodate 2-lane ramp
           between 400 and 750 feet from the stop line. Design exception for 6 foot shoulder.
       >   Partially remove vandal fencing to improve sight distance of eastbound right turning
           traffic and of southbound through traffic
       >   Remove the existing guardrail south of the signalized intersection and replace with
           sidewalk and handrail between the Cedar Road intersection and the northbound IR-271
           ramp intersection
       >   Add a NB through lane from the southbound IR-271 ramp to Edenhall Drive (1,500 feet)

3. Increase Capacity of the Southbound Approach
   The capacity and safety of the southbound approach is to be increased with the following
   improvements:

       >   Channelize the southbound curb lane to align with the southbound right turn lane at the
           Cedar Road intersection
                  o   Dotted lines between the through lanes on the southbound approach are proposed
                      since the transition starts on the north side of the signalized intersection. Lane
                      utilization of the southbound IR-271 exit ramp is expected to improve especially
                      during the PM peak period.
                  o   This countermeasure improves the utilization of the shared through-right turn
                      movement proposed on the southbound approach of the Cedar/Brainard
                      intersection.
       >   Set back the stop line for the southbound left turn movement to accommodate the
           eastbound left turn movement

4. Upgrade Traffic Signal Operation at the Northbound IR-271 Ramp Intersection
   Reconstruction of the traffic signal is proposed to accommodate capacity and safety
   countermeasure outlined above. This recommendation includes the following components:

       >   Reapply dotted lines for turning movements of dual turn lanes (eastbound) through the
           intersection.
       >   Signal head to stop line distances exceed 120 feet for the southbound approach thus
           would benefit from supplemental signal heads to improve signal visibility. Install
           supplemental 3-section signal head on the near right side of the intersection.
       >   Install reflective back plates on all signal heads.
       >   Remove the pedestrian crosswalk on the north leg of the intersection and relocate to the
           west leg. The pedestrian crosswalk on the west leg of the intersection will require
           moving the stop line back. The increased start-up time of eastbound vehicles entering the
           intersection will reduce the potential for right angle crashes with southbound traffic.
       >   Add No Pedestrian Crossing signs to prohibit pedestrians from crossing the north and
           south legs of the intersection.
       >   Operate the pedestrian crossing of the northbound right turn lanes concurrent with the
           southbound left turn phase.
       >   Install detection loops 150 and 225 feet in advance of the stop line of the ramp approach.
           The loops would serve as extension loops. Loops at the stop line would be disabled
           during the active phase. Same treatment for southbound IR-271 ramp intersection.

The proposed countermeasures are expected to mitigate the 96 crashes at the northbound IR-
271 ramp intersection as well as 34 crashes at the southbound IR-271 exit ramp intersection.
The proposed countermeasures will reduce delays by 62 percent at the northbound IR-271 ramp
intersection during the PM peak period (design year 2035) as compared to the existing conditions.
Delays are reduced in the PM peak hour from 72.6 seconds/veh (LOS E) to 27.5 seconds/veh
(LOS C). See Appendix G for supporting capacity analyses.

Previous studies have recommended further evaluation of an auxiliary ramp that connects Brainard to
Lander Road and/or Landerbrook Drive (Appendix A, Figure A1). This improvement would
reallocate more than 500 right turning vehicles to an eastbound through movement at the northbound
IR-271 ramp intersection during the AM peak period.

The addition of this ramp connection to the local roadway network further east is not recommended
as a safety-based countermeasure for two reasons:

    >   This location does not exhibit a severe crash problem in the AM peak period. Only 9 percent
        of the crashes have occurred on mainline IR-271 occur during the AM peak period (7-10
        AM) whereas 62 percent have occurred during the PM peak period (5-8PM).
    >   The northbound right turn phase is active at all times except when the opposing southbound
        left turn phase is ON. The northbound right turn phase accommodates 1,000 vehicles in the
        PM peak hour. This alternative would reduce the green time for the northbound right turn
        phase increasing risk that queues extend into the Cedar/Brainard intersection.

Any future alternative that increases the number of signal phases at the northbound IR-271
ramp intersection is not recommended (i.e. a two-way marginal road). Queues that extend into
the critical intersection of Cedar/Brainard Road from the northbound IR-271 ramp
intersection would further degrade the safety of the study area.


MAINLINE IR-271
The construction of a two-lane ramp for the northbound IR-271 exit is recommended to accommodate
the existing traffic demand. The capacity of a single lane exit ramp is typically 1,500 vehicles in the
peak hour. Existing traffic volumes are about 2,200 vehicles in the AM peak hour and about 1,900
vehicles in the PM peak hour. An upgrade to the exit ramp is considered necessary regardless of the
capacity improvements to the local roadway network. The ramp itself is a capacity constraint that
contributes to queues extending onto the local lanes of IR-271.

The proposed ramp design should provide adequate storage between the ramp gore and the local
street network to accommodate future growth and congestion associated with seasonal traffic
volumes. The proposed alignment uses the end span of the existing bridge for Cedar Road and
constructs a retaining wall to contain the spill through slopes. Retaining walls are also expected along
the substation property where the elevation difference is about 20 feet.

This countermeasure is expected to mitigate the 159 crashes that occur on the local lanes of
IR-271 within a mile of the ramp gore.

BRAINARD ROAD AND CEDAR ROAD INTERSECTION
The countermeasures focus on the Brainard Road and northbound IR-271 ramp intersection.

1. Upgrade Traffic Signal Operation at the Cedar/Brainard Road Intersection
   Reconstruction of the traffic signal is proposed to improve capacity and safety. This
   recommendation includes the following components:

       >   Reapply dotted lines for turning movements of dual left turn lanes (eastbound and
           southbound) through the intersection.
       >   Install detection loops 150 feet and 225 feet in advance of the stop line of the dual left
           turn lanes. The loops would serve as extension loops and reduce wasted time after the
           last vehicle clears the intersection. Stop line detection leaves a portion of the green time
           unutilized as the last car crosses the detector.
       >   Signal head to stop line distances exceed 120 feet thus may benefit from supplemental
           signal heads to improve signal visibility. Install supplemental 3-section signal heads on
           the near right side of the intersection for the northbound and eastbound approaches. Near
           side supplemental signal heads on the southbound and westbound approaches should be
           5-section, vertical pole mounted to provide signal
           indication for the overlap right turning
           movements.
       >   Add far side mast-arm mounted 5-section signal
           head for the westbound approach to provide a right
           turn overlap with the southbound left turn phase.
           FHWA publication HRT-04-091 dated August
           2004 shows an alternate location to improve
           visibility of the signal head ­ the figure to the right
           shows the driver field of vision to see a right turn
           overlap phase.
       >   Install reflective back plates on all signal heads.
       >   No pedestrian crashes were reported at the subject intersection. Pedestrian crosswalks on
           the north, south, and west legs of the intersection can be accommodated within existing
           splits for the respective movements when a pedestrian phase is called thus increasing
           vehicle capacity.
           Relocate the pedestrian crosswalk from the east leg to the south leg of the intersection.
           The vehicle demand on the northbound approach in the AM peak period is relatively low
           ­ 139 vehicles in the through and right turn lanes. The existing pedestrian signal timing
           of 29 seconds (8 sec WALK, 21 sec FDW) is longer than required to service the vehicle
           demand of the approach. Additional green time can be reassigned to the southbound left
           turn movement without increasing delays on other approaches.
           Improvements to include pedestrian crosswalks, relocation of stop lines on the south leg,
           relocation of the crosswalk on the east leg to shorten the crosswalk distance, and removal
           of No Ped Crossing sign for the south leg of the intersection. Add No Ped Crossing on the
           northeast quadrant of the intersection to prohibit pedestrians from crossing the east leg.

2. Increase Capacity of the Southbound Right Turn Movement
   The capacity and safety of the southbound right turn movement is to be increased with the
   following improvements:

       >   Revise pavement markings on the north leg of the intersection for the southbound right
           turn movement. The capacity of the southbound right turn movement is increase by
           revising the lane configuration from L-L-T-R lane configuration to a L-L-TR-R lane
           configuration. Improvements are to include revised overhead lane use signs on the
           southbound approach.
       >   Modify the radius on the northwest quadrant using a taper/offset design. The
           reconstruction of the radius provides additional pavement to accommodate the turning
           radius of southbound right turning vehicles. The new radius will require relocation and
           lengthening of the signal support.

       Revised lane use assignments are required at the northbound IR-271 ramp intersection for this
       capacity improvement to be effective.

3. Increase Lane Utilization of the Southbound Left Turn Lane
   The capacity and safety of the southbound left turn movement is to be increased with the
   following improvements:

       >   Modify the radius on the southeast quadrant using a taper/offset design. The
           reconstruction of the radius provides additional pavement to accommodate the turning
           radius of southbound left turning vehicles. The new radius is to avoid the existing
           foundation of the signal support.
       >   Revise pavement markings as shown on the concept plan to encourage more balanced
           lane utilization when dual right turn lanes are constructed on the IR-271 exit ramp.
       >   Revise the pavement markings on Cedar Road at the Windy Lane intersection (east of
           Brainard Road) to drop the inside, eastbound through lane as an exclusive left turn lane at
           the Landerbrook Drive intersection. This lane configuration assumes the westbound left
           turn lane to Windy Lane is removed and the turn prohibited. Research by the NCDOT
           supports the conclusion that this countermeasure can improve lane utilization for three
           reasons: increasing the distance from the turn to a lane drop; dropping a lane into a turn
           lane results in better lane utilization than a mid-block merge condition (existing); and the
           short lane (transition lane) as the inside left turn lane at the Cedar/Brainard Road
           intersection results in better performance.
           An alternative configuration would be to maintain two eastbound lanes through the
           Landerbrook Drive intersection. The inside lane configuration would be a shared
           through-left turn lane to Landerbrook Drive.
       >   Remove the left lane merge signs and replace with overhead lane use signs in advance of
           the Landerbrook Drive intersection indicating that the inside lane becomes a dedicated
           left turn lane. Add advisory distance plaque (500 feet) to advise motorists they must turn
           left if they remain in the inside through lane.

4. Increase Capacity of the Northbound Approach
   The capacity and safety of the northbound left turn movement is to be increased with the
   following improvements:

       >   Convert the exclusive right turn lane to a shared through-right turn lane. Storage lane
           length calculations in Appendix H suggest the curb lane be extended to a minimum of
           250 feet in length.
       >   Shift the northbound left turn lane to improve intersection sight distance of opposing
           through vehicles. This countermeasure is recommended regardless of the signal phasing
           (protected or permissive).

5. Overhead Lane Use Signs
      > Add an overhead sign support on the eastbound approach 530 feet in advance of the
          signalized intersection.
       >   Add an advisory distance plaque (500 feet) under both Left Turn Only signs to warn
           motorists they must turn left at the signalized intersection if they remain in the center
           lane.
       >   Add route marker adjacent to both left turn lane use signs that indicate IR-271 as a
           destination ­ the outside lane has an ONLY plaque.
       >   Add an advisory distance plaque (150 feet) to the existing overhead lane use signs on the
           eastbound approach to reinforce the lane configuration.

These countermeasures and recent signal timing upgrades are expected to mitigate the 58
crashes that occur at the Cedar and Brainard Road intersection. The proposed capacity related
improvements reduces delays by 25 percent ­ delays were reduced in the PM peak hour from 95.3
seconds/veh (LOS F) to 71.1 seconds/veh (LOS E). See Appendix G for supporting capacity
analyses.

Previous studies have recommended further evaluation of a new directional ramp from northbound
IR-271 to eastbound Cedar Road (Figure 3). A directional ramp is not recommended as a safety-
based countermeasure for the following reasons:

       >   The queues that form on the northbound IR-271 exit ramp in the AM peak do not
           significantly contribute to the safety performance of the study area. Only 9 percent of the
           crashes have occurred on mainline IR-271 occur during the AM peak period (7-10 AM)
           whereas 62 percent have occurred during the PM peak period (5-8PM). A new
           directional ramp is considered to be a countermeasure to mitigate capacity issues in the
           AM peak period.
       >   The construction of a new directional ramp on Cedar Road (northbound IR-271 to
           eastbound Cedar Rd) may introduce new traffic operational issues related to weaving on
           an arterial roadway.
           A maximum distance of 400 to 500 feet would be available in advance of the traffic
           signal at Brainard Road. Three maneuvers are expected to occur within this short
           distance: weaving of eastbound right turning vehicles with ramp traffic, weaving of ramp
           traffic to access the eastbound left turn lanes, merging of traffic destined to points east of
           Brainard Road.

        >   The construction of a new directional ramp on Cedar Road may introduce new traffic
            operational issues related to lane utilization on the future two-lane exit ramp. The
            estimated volumes that would use the new directional ramp destine to eastbound Cedar
            Road is 539 vehicles in the AM peak period ­ this number does not include traffic destine
            to Brainard Road south of Cedar Road.
        >   The existing volumes using the loop ramp destine to westbound Cedar Road is 1,400
            vehicles in the AM peak period.
            The combined volumes of both movements (1,936 vehicles) would be expected to utilize
            the same lane of a two-lane northbound IR-271 exit ramp. This capacity constraint
            would prevent the demand volumes from reaching the respective ramps (westbound
            Cedar loop ramp and the new eastbound Cedar directional ramp). Note the lane capacity
            of 2,000 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) only can be achieved when operating speeds
            are 70 miles per hour.
        >   Preliminary design constraints were identified that affected the typical section, horizontal
            alignment, and the vertical profile of a directional ramp. The construction of a two lane
            exit ramp will increase the design constraints and construction costs of a new directional
            ramp.
The capacity constraints of a single lane exit ramp contribute to the poor safety performance of the
northbound IR-271 exit ramp during various time of day and during seasonal periods. Mitigating this
capacity constraint with a two lane exit ramp should be a priority improvement regardless of the
proposed countermeasures that may improve traffic operations of the local roadway network in the
AM peak period.

A new directional ramp as shown in Figure 3 is not considered an effective alternative to
improve the safety performance or improve traffic operations within the study area.

CEDAR ROAD AND SOUTHBOUND IR-271 ENTRANCE RAMP
The countermeasures focus on Cedar Road and Southbound IR-271 entrance ramp.

1. Realign Entrance Ramp
   Realign the existing entrance ramp to increase capacity and safety:

        >   To increase turning speed of the westbound left turn movement. Increasing the
            intersecting angle of the ramp will increase throughput when compared to the existing
            geometry (low speed S-curve).
        >   To increase the distance from Acacia Park Drive to the southbound IR-271 entrance ramp
            intersection. The existing intersection spacing of 320 feet (stop line to stop line) can be
            increased to 400 feet.

2. Increase Capacity of the Eastbound Approach
   The capacity and safety of the southbound approach is to be increased with the following
   improvements:

        >   Channelize the eastbound curb lane starting at the Acacia Park Drive intersection to
            become a dedicated right turn lane at the southbound IR-271 entrance ramp.
            The inside through lane would be a shared through-right turn lane. Lane utilization on
            the eastbound approach will improve with this lane configuration thus improve capacity.

       >   Construct a raised median to channelize right turning traffic destine to southbound IR-
           271 from through traffic on Cedar Road. The right turn movement would yield to left
           turning traffic.
       >   Add a second through lane on the eastbound approach to the southbound IR-271 entrance
           ramp. The add lane will help reinforce it as a supplemental lane that becomes an
           exclusive left turn lane at the Brainard Road intersection.
       >   Add a sign 1,000 feet in advance of the Acacia Park Drive intersection that directs
           through traffic to use the left lane.

3. Overhead Lane Use Signs
      > Add an overhead sign support on the westbound approach 300 feet in advance of the
          signalized intersection (future location).
       >   Add an advisory distance plaque (300 feet) under both Left Turn Only signs to warn
           motorists they must turn left at the signalized intersection.
       >   Add route marker adjacent to both left turn lane use signs that indicate IR-271 as a
           destination.
       >   Add an advisory distance plaque (700 feet) to the existing overhead lane use signs on the
           westbound approach to reinforce the lane configuration at the signalized intersection.

4. Reconstruct traffic signal
   Reconstruction of the traffic signal is proposed to improve capacity and safety. This
   recommendation includes the following components:

       >   Reapply dotted lines for turning movements of dual
           left turn lanes (westbound) through the intersection.
       >   Install 3-section signal heads on the far side of the
           dual right turn lanes on the eastbound approach.
                  o   The signal heads would be oriented 30
                      degrees left of center which is the field of
                      view of right turning vehicles.
                  o   A near side supplemental signal head for
                      the eastbound curb lane should be a vertical
                      pole mounted to provide a supplemental signal indication for the pedestrian
                      phase.
       >   Install detection loops 150 feet and 225 feet in advance of the stop line of the dual left
           turn lanes.
                  o   The loops would serve as extension loops.
                  o   Loops at the stop line would be disabled during the protected only left turn phase.
           Video detection would be the preferred method of detection subce the detection zones
           would be located on the existing bridge.

LONG TERM COUNTERMEASURES
Two long term countermeasures are proposed to improve safety performance of the study area:
1. Construct additional southbound lane on Brainard Road between the southbound IR-271 exit ramp
   and the northbound IR-271 exit ramp
   A calculated queue length of 725 feet is suggested to accommodate right turning traffic demand
   in the PM peak period at the Cedar/Brainard Road intersection ­ the distance between the Cedar
   Road intersection and the northbound IR-271 ramp intersection is only 440 feet. The additional
   lane would serve as an extension of the southbound right turn lane at the Cedar/ Brainard
   intersection and avoid lane transitions across the northbound IR-271 ramp intersection.
   Similarly, a calculated queue length of 600 feet is suggested to accommodate left turning traffic
   in the AM peak period at the Cedar/Brainard Road intersection. The additional lane would
   provide a 3-lane approach with the inside through lane channelized to the southbound left turn
   lane at the Cedar/Brainard Road intersection.

   The existing bridge is in good condition. Reconstruction of the existing structure would be for
   capacity reason only (not maintenance related).

2. Widen Cedar Road to extend eastbound right turn lane at the IR-271 southbound entrance ramp.
   A calculated queue length of 1,400 feet is suggested to accommodate right turning traffic demand
   in the AM peak period at the IR-271 southbound ramp/Cedar Road intersection ­ the distance
   between the southbound IR-271 ramp intersection and Acacia Park Drive is only 350 feet. The
   additional lane would extend through the Acacia Park Drive intersection.

3. Evaluate the Feasibility of a New Directional Ramp from Southbound Brainard Road to Southbound
   IR-271
   This countermeasure is effective only if traffic is removed from the westbound left turn
   movement at the southbound IR-271 ramp/Cedar Road intersection. A significant limitation of
   this countermeasure is the available capacity on IR-271 to accommodate peak hour traffic from
   the local street network. Ramp metering of all ramps at the Cedar/Brainard interchange as well as
   adjacent interchanges would be anticipated as part of a preferred alternative.
   Other limitations of this potential countermeasure include the following:
       >   The connection of a new directional ramp to the southbound IR-271 ramp/Cedar Road
           intersection is not recommended. The addition of a phase at the southbound IR-
           271/Cedar Road intersection would further increase delays at the existing signalized
           intersection.
       >   An additional turning movement (i.e. northbound left turn) at the southbound IR-271
           ramp/Brainard Road intersection is not recommended ­ the proposed ramp would be a
           directional ramp serving southbound Brainard Road traffic destined to southbound IR-
           271. Additional turning movements that access IR-271 will increase traffic on the
           Brainard Road corridor. Increased traffic volumes should be discouraged on a corridor
           that already experiences congestion due to high volumes and closely spaced intersections.

    IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The Relative Safety Index (RSI) was calculated for the subsections of the study area to help prioritize
safety improvements by location. The RSI values shown in parenthesis from Table 3 suggest the
following safety ranking starting with the highest priority location:

    1. Northbound IR-271 exit ramp (21,623)
    2. Northbound IR271 ramp at Brainard Road intersection (20,538)
    3. Southbound IR-271 ramp at Brainard Road intersection (18,952)
    4. Cedar at Brainard Road intersection (18,292)
    5. Southbound IR-271 ramp at Cedar Road intersection (17,706)

The bottleneck at the IR-271 northbound exit ramp and Brainard Road intersection is the leading
cause for queue spillback onto IR-271 mainline. Countermeasures on Brainard Road mitigate crashes
at locations #2 and #3 listed above. The combined RSI values for these two locations result in the
highest RSI score (39,490) thus countermeasures to mitigate crashes on the Brainard Road corridor
are the highest priority.

The conversion of the single lane exit ramp to a 2-lane exit ramp is proposed as the location having
the next highest priority ranking. Improvements to the northbound IR-271 exit ramp will further
mitigate congestion on the local lanes of IR-271 and provide additional storage during peak traffic
periods.

The revised ranking of countermeasures by location is proposed to provide the greatest opportunity to
improve the safety performance of the study area:

    1. Northbound IR271 ramp at Brainard Road intersection (20,538)
        Southbound IR-271 ramp at Brainard Road intersection (18,952)
    2. Northbound IR-271 exit ramp (21,623)
    3. Cedar at Brainard Road intersection (18,292)
    4. Southbound IR-271 ramp at Cedar Road intersection (17,706)

See the Countermeasures section of the safety study for an explanation of the proposed
countermeasures.

    RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS
Rate of return (ROR) is an economic analysis tool to determine the financial benefits of a project
based on net present value (NPV) of an improvement. ROR values greater than zero indicate a
positive return on the original investment. Preferred countermeasures are those having the highest net
present value (NPV). Project costs were estimated based on the concept plan shown in Figure 4.
Construction cost estimates assume the following:

    >    35 percent design risk and 27.6 percent inflation rate for an estimated 2018 construction year.
    >    Right of way acquisition not anticipated for Cedar Road/Brainard intersection improvements
         or for additional NB through lane on Brainard Road from NB ramps to Edenhall Drive.
    >    Right of way impacts anticipated for Brainard Rd/IR-271 NB ramps intersection
         improvements and long term countermeasure of IR-77 NB mainline/NB ramp diverge
         improvements.
    >    Estimate does not include utility relocation.

Tables 4, 5 and 6 list the crash reduction factors, total estimated project cost and resulting rate of
return for the short term countermeasures. Table 7 lists the crash reduction factors, total estimated
project cost and resulting rate of return for the medium term countermeasures. Detailed cost estimates
and rate of return calculations are included in Appendix I.

CRASH REDUCTION FACTORS (CRF)
Crash reduction factors (CRF) included in the rate of return for countermeasures include the
following:

Install Right Turn Lane on Single Major Road Approach ­ Signalized
This CRF was obtained from a study titled "Safety Effectiveness of Intersection Left- and Right-Turn
Lanes" and listed in the CMF Clearinghouse. The CRF for this countermeasure provides a suggested
safety improvement ranging between 4 and 9 percent. [CMF ID: 286, 288]

Change Number of Lanes on Freeway Exit Ramp from X to Y
This CRF was obtained from a study titled "Identifying Crash Distributions and Prone Locations by
Lane Groups at Freeway Diverge Areas" and listed in the CMF Clearinghouse. The CRF has a 3 star
rating and the countermeasure for a one lane to two lane off-ramp condition suggests a safety
improvement of 42 percent for injury and fatal crashes. [CMF ID: 3047]

Improve Visibility of Signal Heads
This CRF was obtained from a study titled "Evaluating the Safety Impacts of Improving Signal
Visibility at Urban Signalized Intersections" and listed in the CMF Clearinghouse. The CRF has a 4
star rating. Other CRFs for similar countermeasures suggested safety improvements ranging between
21 to 29 percent ­ this study had a lower rating and hence not considered for ROR. [CMF ID: 1430, 1432]

Horizontal Alignment Changes
The CRF for the intersection realignment was obtained from research by the Florida Department of
Transportation "Update of Florida Crash Reduction Factors and Countermeasures to Improve the
Development of District Safety Improvement Projects" (2005). Table 3.7 in the Florida
documentation shows an average crash reduction factor of 45 for all crash types with changes to the
horizontal alignment of an intersection.

This CRF is utilized for improvements to eastbound approach of Cedar Road/IR-271 SB Entrance

ramps. A factored CRF of 22.5 will be utilized as the improvements only apply to one of the two
intersection approaches.

All improvements including signal timing revisions, pavement marking upgrades, pavement
resurfacing, the addition of a northbound through lane on Brainard Road from NB ramps to Edenhall
Drive are estimated as part of the total construction cost. The CRFs associated with these secondary
improvements were not used to calculate the potential rate of return.

Rate of return calculations were not performed for the long term countermeasures.


RAMP CLEAR PROGRAM

ODOT's Ramp Clear program was created to reduce congestion on interchange ramps that experience
bottleneck and where traffic frequently backs up onto the freeway. The safety improvements to be
eligible under this program are expected to be low cost, with minimum or no right of way acquisition
and utilities, constructible in one construction season and capable of design build development.
Detailed description of the eligibility criteria and potential countermeasures to be considered for
Ramp Clear Program are included in Appendix J.

The IR-271/Cedar Road/Brainard Road interchange experiences daily congestion resulting in queue
spillback onto the mainline. Some of the countermeasures recommended in this safety study are
eligible for ODOT's Ramp Clear Program. The countermeasures used to calculate a rate of return in
Tables 4-7 were repackaged to be consistent with the Ramp Clear program. The following
combination of improvements is recommended for the Ramp Clear Program.

    >    Widen northbound IR-271 exit ramp between Cedar Rd bridge and Brainard Road
    >    Lane channelization improvements to southbound approach at Brainard Road and NB IR-271
         ramp intersection.
    >    Add an additional northbound through lane on Brainard from IR-271 north ramps to Edenhall
         Drive.
    >    Reconstruct Cedar/Brainard Road intersection and associated signal work to accommodate
         dual SB right and improve dual SB left turn movements.
The study area meets the eligibility criteria of recurring congestion and queue spillback onto the
freeway and above improvements can be constructed within the existing Right of way for less than
$2 million. Table 8 lists the total estimated project cost, crash reduction factors and resulting rate of
return for the countermeasures eligible for the Ramp Clear program.

Additional details on the Ramp Clear Program, detailed cost estimates and rate of return calculations
for the eligible improvements are included in Appendix J.

Executive Summary

The Road Safety Audit (RSA) for the intersection of Cedar Road and Brainard Road in the Cities of
Lyndhurst and Pepper Pike (see Figure 1) is one of several audits conducted by the Northeast Ohio
Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) as part of NOACA's safety studies program for State Fiscal Year
(FY) 2012. The intersection was identified as a high-crash location based on NOACA's 2009 Crash Report
titled "Accident Characteristics & Intersection Accident Analysis". This intersection has a particularly
unusual circumstance in that it is located within the expanse of a vast, spread-out interchange which ramps
straddle Cedar Road and Brainard Road (see Figure 2). In addition to serving local traffic, it is also used as
a pass-through by regional traffic entering and exiting the I-271 Freeway in the area. Furthermore, the
pattern of traffic movements is greatly influenced by many local traffic generators and a peculiar set of
origin-destination characteristics.

 The purpose of this RSA is to have an independent road safety audit team (RSA Team) examine the
particulars of this intersection and other nearby roadway intersections with the I-271 Interchange ramps to
enable the RSA team to make suggestions for short term, low cost safety improvements, as well as
possible long term, higher cost improvements. The various intersections, referenced as Location 1,
Location 2, Location 3, and Location 4, are shown in Figure 2.

The RSA team, therefore, recommends the following low-cost, short-term; low-cost, medium-term; medium-
cost, longer term, and higher cost, long term improvements to increase the level of safety at this
intersection. The main recommendations, described separately for each location, are:


Location 1: Cedar Road/Brainard Road:
    Examine the timing and phasing of the traffic control signals with regards to the following modifications:
         o To provide a shorter cycle length.
         o To introduce a phasing sequence that provides a phase for exclusive, protected left-turn
             movements from the Brainard Road northbound approach.
    Provide more pronounced dashed lane-extension lines through the intersection to help moving traffic
    avoid encroaching on adjacent turn lanes, and to help drivers make better judgment regarding their
    travel paths.
    Improve the pavement sub-grade and surface conditions on all approaches of the intersection as well
    as within it to improve friction and to provide a better surface conducive to receiving lane marking paint
    for a longer lasting, more durable lane demarcation.
    Improve pavement markings where needed.
    Set back the stop bar for the exclusive left-turn lane on the Cedar Road westbound approach.
    Delete the pedestrian crosswalk for Cedar Road at its present location on the west side of the
    intersection and emphasize it at the east side of the intersection, as the heavy right-turn traffic
    movements inhibit pedestrians from attempting to cross the road at this location even during the recall
    pedestrian crossing phase.

    Convert the through lane on the Brainard Road southbound approach from an exclusive through lane
    to a shared through and right-turn lane.
      Consider incorporating information from the I-271--Cedar/Brainard Access Point Modification Study
    into this RSA report to develop a more comprehensive approach towards addressing the issues
    identified in this RSA study report.

Location 2: Brainard Road/I-271 Northbound Exit Ramp:
 Remove all obstructions to the line of site, especially the chain link fence on the bridge parapet, and
   nearby shrubberies that block the line of vision of vehicle drivers stopped at the traffic control signal of
   I-271 northbound exit ramp and looking to their left to check for oncoming southbound traffic on
   Brainard Road.
 Set back the stop bar for the exclusive left-turn bay on Brainard Road southbound approach.
 Improve pavement conditions, especially any crumbling or rutted pavements, to provide for better
   traction, smoother ride, and a pavement condition conducive to proper and longer lasting marking.
 Consider providing two right-turn bays on the I-271 northbound exit ramp at Brainard Road to increase
   the storage capacity and minimize traffic backups that often reach the freeway mainline.
 Consider building a marginal road beginning commencing at Brainard Road, on the opposite side of the
   I-271 northbound exit ramp, aligned with the exit ramp through lane, and relatively alongside the I-271
   northbound entrance ramp to Lander Road to help take traffic more directly to Landerbrook Drive and
   Lander Haven Drive. This marginal Road will carry or service traffic bound for Landerbrook Drive and
   Lander Haven Drive and will alleviate the traffic demand on the Cedar Road/Brainard Road intersection
   caused by the zigzag traffic movement pattern created by traffic exiting I-271 at the northbound exit
   ramp to Brainard Road and that then turns right to proceed to Cedar Road to turn left to reach Lander
   Road and then Landerbrook Drive and Lander Haven Drive (see diagram 2-1 in the Finding of Issues
   Section).
 Improve the pavement condition on Brainard Road.
 Restripe the stop line for the southbound approach and make it perpendicular to the curb of the
   roadway instead of the present slanted stop line.
 Add overhead lane use signs on the Brainard Road Bridge over I-271. The present sign is erected on
   the bridge parapet and cannot be seen by traffic coming from the I-271 southbound exit ramp.
 Remove the pedestrian crosswalk across Brainard Road. It is very unlikely pedestrians will cross to or
   from the southern side of the Brainard Road Bridge. That side of the bridge is not connected with or
   serviced by any sidewalks. Keep the pedestrian crosswalk across the I-271 northbound entrance ramp
   as pedestrians will more likely use it for the sidewalk on the northern side of the bridge is connected to
   sidewalks along Brainard Road.
 Re-examine the presently closed -by-hatching outer through lane on Brainard Road. This through lane
   may be reinstated if a tapered northbound receiving lane is built on Brainard Road. The tapered
   through lane may also serve traffic exiting at the I-271 southbound exit ramp and turns right from an
   exclusive right-turn bay proposed for the exit ramp as recommended for Location 4.

Location 3: Cedar Road/I-271 Southbound Entrance Ramp:
 Improve the curb near the bridge by setting it a little backward and increasing its curvature to permit
   vehicles in the inner left-turn bay on the Cedar Road eastbound approach to transition to the ramps
   easier and without encroaching on the adjacent left-turn lane extension line to minimize the potential for
   sideswipe passing crashes.
 Emphasize or Highlight the island and extension lines markings.
 Revisit alternative 10 presented in the I-271 Access Point Modification Study, completed in 2002, that
   provides for a free-flow entrance ramp to I-271 southbound at the Cedar Road eastbound approach,
   and a fourth approach created by a marginal road west of the freeway between Brainard and Cedar
   Road (see diagram below).
 Consider incorporating information from the I-271--Cedar/Brainard Access Point Modification Study into
   this RSA report to address issues identified in this RSA report.

Location 4: Brainard Road/I-271 Southbound Exit Ramp:
 Place overhead lane assignment signs on the bridge as the sign erected on the bridge parapet is not
   visible to traffic exiting at the I-271 southbound exit ramp and turning left to go south on Brainard.
 Re-examine the need for the "no-turn-on-red sign posted opposite the exit ramp.
 Add an exclusive right-turn bay on the exit ramp and convert the through and left lane to an exclusive
   left-turn lane only which will become a second left-turn lane.
 Build a long taper, through-lane on Brainard Road in the northbound direction to receive traffic from the
   outer through lane on the bride after opening it to traffic as it is currently closed by hatching.
 Place destination signs on the exit ramp to help drivers occupy the respective lane for the respective
   destination.

Subject: D12 safety study growth rates

Mahmound

LJB is working with District 12 on several safety study locations. Attached is current traffic data for these
locations.

1. CUY-271-9.90/10.5 (Cedar Brainard interchange)
2. LAK-283-8.4/8.7 (Lake Shore at Reynolds Road)
3. LAK-615-4.45 (Center Street at Tyler Blvd)

Typically planning level growth rates are sufficient for use on a safety study. I know a couple of the study
locations are near interchanges that may have older certified traffic volumes.
I am interested in 20 year future volumes that is the easiest for NOACA to obtain whether as growth rates
applied to existing traffic data or applied to certified volumes of recent projects adjacent to the study
areas.

Does your schedule enable you to generate these numbers within the next 2 weeks?

Thank you for your help.

Scott

CLEARANCE INTERVAL

    CLEARANCE INTERVALS
The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 731: Guidelines for Timing
Yellow and All-Red Intervals at Signalized Intersections was published July 2012. A number of
conclusions were reached as a result of the comprehensive study important to the safety performance
of signalized intersections.

    >   The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Proposed Recommended Practice for the
        calculation of yellow change intervals and all-red clearance intervals is the methodology used
        by the highest percentage of state and local agencies.
    >   Drivers were documented to decelerate when turning at an intersection. The NCHRP Report
        731 recommended using a design speed of 20 mile per hour for the calculation of all red
        timing. Research conducted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation published
        by the ITE Journal determined that the average operating speed for left turning traffic is 17
        miles per hour.
    >   Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
        intervals has been shown to reduce total crashes between 8 and 14 percent while reducing
        injury crashes by approximately 12 percent.
    >   Using the current ITE guidelines to calculate the duration of yellow change and red clearance
        intervals has been shown to reduce red light running occurrences between 36 and 50 percent.
Vehicular clearance times were calculated for each study area intersection based on guidelines
published in the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the ITE Proposed
Recommended Practice. The following posted speeds were used to calculate clearance intervals for
through phases:

    >   Cedar Road/Brainard Road: 35 MPH
    >   A 25 MPH speed was used to calculate clearance intervals for all leading left turn phases.
Calculated clearance intervals were included in the Synchro models for the proposed condition, as
described in the following section. A summary of the calculated clearance intervals for the three
signalized intersections is listed below in Table A and the calculations are appended at the end of this
section.

      CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Intersections are graded using a level of service (LOS) designation expressed in terms of letter grades.
Level of service is a quality measure describing operational conditions with a traffic stream with LOS A
representing the highest quality traffic flow and minimal delay, and LOS F representing poor traffic
operations, significant delay, and substantial queuing. Level of service is defined in terms of vehicle
delay, as published in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010). Levels of
service thresholds for signalized intersections have been summarized in Table A.

  C                           > 20 and  35
  D                           > 35 and  55
  E                           > 55 and  80
  F                           > 80

Traffic signal operation was evaluated for the four signalized intersections along Brainard Road and
Cedar Road with the Interstate 271 interchange ramps including the intersection of Brainard Road and
Cedar Road. This analysis assists in evaluating the level of benefit provided by the recommended safety
countermeasures aimed at reducing congestion. The following conditions were evaluated using design
year 2035 traffic volume projections. The results for the critical peak hours (AM and PM) are
summarized in Table B. Detailed reports are included at the end of this section.

2035 EXISTING CONDITIONS
Existing conditions were analyzed using TEC/DLZ traffic study Synchro models. The signal timings
recommended by TEC were used for the Brainard Road intersections and the following changes were
made to the existing condition models:
       > Minimal volume adjustments were made to balance counted traffic volumes between
         intersections along Brainard Road. Removed any growth factors for individual movements.
       > Lane utilization factors were calculated for dual-lane movements along the Brainard Road
         corridor using documented traffic volumes. Those movements include: westbound left turn at the
         Brainard/Southbound IR-271 Exit ramp, southbound through at Brainard/Northbound IR-271
         Exit ramp, southbound left turn at Cedar/Brainard, and eastbound left turn at Cedar/Brainard.
       > The intersection of southbound entrance ramp to IR-271 at Cedar Road was added to the models.
         Current traffic signal timings provided by the City of Beachwood were used in the existing
         condition analysis.
       > Lane utilization factors for the eastbound movements at the southbound IR-271 entrance ramp at
         Cedar Road were adjusted from default values to more accurately represent existing lane
         utilization as witnessed in the field.

2035 PROPOSED COUNTERMEASURES
      > Proposed models analyzed the recommended capacity and lane assignment modifications as
        listed in the Countermeasures section of the report.
      > Proposed analysis retained TEC's recommended cycle lengths (AM Peak ­ 120 seconds, PM
        Peak -135 seconds) for the Brainard Road corridor and optimized splits and offsets.
      > The Cedar Road and IR-271 southbound entrance ramp intersection was analyzed with the
        existing cycle length (200 seconds) since it is part of a separate coordinated system; however,
        splits were optimized to minimize corridor congestion.
      > Proposed clearance intervals and pedestrian timings were used.
      > Dual-service left-turn (twice per cycle) was eliminated for the southbound left turn phase at the
        Cedar/Brainard intersection. All protected left-turn phases were analyzed as single-service
        leading phases.
      > Proposed storage lane lengths were used.
      > Lane utilization factors were updated to default values as the proposed countermeasures are
        designed to balance lane utilization.
The proposed condition shows improved levels-of service and decrease in vehicle delay for the majority
of movements for all study intersections. Intersections either maintained or improved Levels of service
by at least one letter grade for the peak time periods. However, several movements still show poor or
failing levels of service which can be attributed to high volume to capacity (v/c) ratios indicating
movements are near or over capacity.

2035 SPECIAL CONDITION
The special condition scenario analyzed the addition of a directional exit ramp from northbound
Interstate 271 to eastbound Cedar Road, creating an intersection west of Brainard Road. Traffic volumes
were collected for the peak hour time period using video data for those vehicles originating from the I-
271 northbound exit ramp destined to eastbound Cedar Road, this maneuver is completed under the
existing conditions by turning right (south) from the IR-271 NB exit at Brainard Rd and then left (east)
at the Cedar/Brainard intersection. These volumes were used to model the demand for the directional
eastbound exit ramp and also redistribute traffic volumes from southbound left turn to eastbound through
movement at the Cedar/Brainard intersection.
Detailed capacity reports are included at the end of this section.

MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS
Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) are quantitative indicators to help compare intersection and network
operation performance. MOE indicators may include delays, stops, fuel consumption, queuing penalty,
dilemma vehicles and emissions. MOE information of 2035 operating conditions under the existing
and proposed geometric scenarios is summarized in Table C.

MOEs indicate that the proposed recommendations provide operational improvements compared to the
existing for the majority of indicators along the Brainard corridor. Most notably, total delay (hours)
and un-served vehicles show improvement at all intersections.

STORAGE LANE LENGTH
   CALCULATIONS
        STORAGE LANE LENGTHS
Turn lane lengths were calculated for turn lanes for the study intersections along the Brainard Road
corridor and Cedar Rd/IR-271 SB ramps intersection. Lane lengths were first calculated using
guidelines specified in the Location and Design Manual Section 401 (Ohio Department of
Transportation). Lane lengths based on the ODOT's standard criteria assume posted speed limits and
include vehicle storage and a 50 foot diverging taper. The calculated lengths were compared to the
95th percentile queue lengths generated by SimTraffic modeling software. A recommended length is
provided based on this comparison and available space between adjacent intersections. A summary of
the lane sizing comparison is shown in Table A with lane sizing calculations attached to this section.

Turn lane lengths were calculated using the following parameters:
                    >      2035 PM peak traffic volumes
                    >      Lengths rounded up in 5-foot increments

RAMP CLEAR PROGRAM
  DOCUMENTATION
RampClearProgram
Overview:
ODOT's low-cost RampClear Program was created in the summer of 2012 to
reduce congestion on interchanges ramps where traffic frequently backs up onto
the freeway. These traffic queues are a serious safety concern as stopped vehicles
co-mingled with high-speed traffic can lead to catastrophic crashes that result in
serious injuries and deaths.

Eligibility:
To be considered for the program, ramp locations typically must:
    · Experience routine, documented queues onto the freeway
    · Be $2M or less to improve
    · Involve minimal or no right of way and utilities
    · Qualify for CE Level 1 environmental document
    · Be reconstructed in one construction season, and
    · Be capable of Design Build development
    · Special consideration will be given to commercial/retail areas

Potential countermeasures could include:
   · Restricting traffic movements (particularly at adjacent intersections)
   · Signal phasing, signal timing/coordination, queue flushing timing plans
   · Turn lane construction
   · Changes in lane use
   · Queue warning systems for the freeway mainline
   · Improving operations/capacity at adjacent intersections that affect ramp operations

Approval Process:
  · The District Safety Review Team will forward candidate locations to the Office Administrator of
      Roadway Engineering (RE).
  · Central Office RE and the Office of Traffic will review candidate locations to determine feasibility and
      cost.
  · RE will send qualified locations to ODOT's Highway Safety Program Manager for funding approval.
  · The Highway Safety PM will assign a consultant to work with the District and RE to develop a Design
      Build Scope. The consultant may be asked to perform other tasks as assigned.
  · The RE Administrator will have final approval over the design concept and design reviews.
  · The District Project Manager will retain responsibility and decision-making authority over the
      remaining elements of the Design Build project.

Note: Locations that are deemed ineligible for the RampClear Program may be eligible for safety funding
through the traditional review and approval process. District Offices can submit a safety analysis/study and
application to Central Office by the April 30 or September 30 deadlines. The Highway Safety PM may grant an
interim review if there is evidence a project can be constructed quickly outside the traditional review and
approval process.

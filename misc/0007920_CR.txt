Need and Purpose: Traffic congestion is the most stubborn barrier to continued economic growth in
Georgia and the metropolitan Atlanta region. From 1990 to 2000, the Atlanta region added more than 1.0
million residents to total 3.7 million ­ almost half of the population of Georgia.

Atlanta's development pattern has increasingly dispersed employment and has generated scattered
residential suburbs throughout the region. The dispersed pattern has created suburb-to-suburb transportation
needs and has decreased the percentage of the region's jobs located in one central location, downtown
Atlanta (from 25% of the jobs in downtown Atlanta to 6%).

The region's road network and trip-making patterns have created corridors with high levels of traffic
congestion on a daily basis. Despite significant investments in freeways and transit systems, radial and
suburban cross-town corridors alike are congested. By 2025, the number of daily person trips in the region
will rise to 14.6 million, a 37% increase. There are 44 congested corridors within the 13-county region, as
identified by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC).

In recent years, the Atlanta metropolitan region has taken major steps in meeting the transportation
challenges for its residents and visitors. Until recently, an overall transit plan had not been developed for
the region which would address the current and future transit needs. The plan, identified as the Regional
Transit Action Plan (RTAP), has been developed over a two year time frame and has provided an integrated
public transportation network for the Atlanta region. The RTAP and associated projects are included in the
2025 Amended RTP and the 2003-2005 TIP as Projects AR-367B, AR-367C, AR-392, and AR-393. The
RTAP will be an integral transit component of the 2030 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) being currently
developed by the ARC.

The RTAP concept plan is the regional blueprint which would define the future public transportation
network for the Atlanta region. The plan lays out a new direction in extending transit services into
congested corridors through the implementation of a regional transit network consisting of 1) the Regional
Express Bus Program and 2) the Regional Bus Rapid Transit System. The plan also calls for:

         Preservation and maintenance of existing transit services and infrastructure;
         Expanded local bus service throughout the 13-county region;
         A seamless, integrated fare policy for the region'
         An investment in Intelligent Transportation Systems technologies, and
         Support tools that will enable more people to perceive transit as a viable option for their travel
         needs;
         Land use plans and regulations should be modified to encourage transit-oriented developments;
         comprehensive plans should take a strong position on the role of transit in the community.

The RTAP has identified a regional express bus system, supporting circulator systems, arterial Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) corridors, and high speed BRT corridors. The identified system will provide competitive
choices to the region's residents, will enhance the customer experience, will invest wisely and optimize
value of such a system, and will develop an integrated system.

Project Concept Report ­ Blairs Bridge Road Park and Ride Lot
Project Number: CSMSL-0007-00(920) Cobb County
P.I. Number:0007920
As part of the development of such a system, locations throughout the region for supporting infrastructure
are being identified. Such supporting infrastructure would include, but not be limited to, park and ride lots,
new construction and existing sites, and maintenance facilities. One identified facility is the proposed Blairs
Bridge Road Park and Ride Lot near I-20 @ Thornton Road.

Description of the proposed project:
Location and Proposed Improvements
The proposed project consists of constructing a park and ride lot facility on an 18.94-acre site located in
Cobb County, Georgia. The parcel is bordered by Interstate 20 to the south, Blairs Bridge Road to the north,
and a residential subdivision along Bridgeport Court to the east. The proposed park and ride facility
infrastructure would consist of approximately 492 parking spaces, three bus pavilions, a Fare Systems
Shelter building for ticket vending, and access to the site from various locations.

Existing Conditions
The previous owner of the parcel was in the process of building a residential development of town homes.
However, the GDOT design for the new HOV interchange at I-20 @ Thornton Road crosses the site.
Therefore, the construction of the residential development was halted. The existing conditions on the site
include the infrastructure for that development, including curb and gutter and asphalt roads, complete storm
and sanitary sewer, underground water and power, graded building pads, several retaining walls and a
stormwater detention pond.

Disturbed Area
The 18.94-acre parcel is divided by the future HOV Interchange alignment, leaving two separate parcels.
The park and ride lot will be constructed on the northern side of the HOV Interchange in an area of
approximately 10.7 acres. There is a 50-foot non-disturbed buffer along the eastern property line, and there
is also a 50-feet stream buffer near the southeastern corner of the site. The proposed park and ride lot will
not encroach into these buffers, therefore the approximate disturbed area for the project is 7 acres.

Access
Commuter vehicles will enter and exit the lot via the full access driveway on Blairs Bridge Road. Initially,
buses will enter the lot via a separate driveway off of Blairs Bridge Road. This access driveway will remain
in place during the HOV Interchange construction, so that operation of the bus service will not be
interrupted. When the construction of the HOV Interchange is complete, buses will then enter the lot
directly off of the new access road. Buses will exit the lot onto Blairs Bridge Road during both current and
future conditions. Refer to the attached Traffic Report for further detail related to access to the site.

Stormwater Detention
The Concept Plan indicates the location of the existing stormwater detention facility, which will remain in
place. The design criteria used for the pond design will be studied to confirm that there is adequate storage
for the park and ride lot.

              walls along the perimeter of the site (six total) will either be maintained or modified to meet
              proposed grades, so that the buffers along the perimeter will not be encroached upon. The
              walls on the interior of the site will be removed. The Concept Plan does not include any
              proposed retaining walls, but there may be a need to add one during design when detailed
              grading of the site is determined.

Alternates considered:
One alternate location was considered for this lot. It was located at the intersection of North Blairs
Bridge Road and Blairs Bridge Road, and bordered by I-20 to the south. That location was considered
due to the proximity to the exit ramp for I-20 to Thornton Road. The alternate concept included a bus
                                                    7
Project Concept Report ­ Blairs Bridge Road Park and Ride Lot

ramp from the off ramp, which would allow buses to have direct access from I-20 westbound to the park
and ride lot. However, the location required the acquisition of several parcels, none of which are
currently for sale. Also, one parcel currently has an operating electrical supply store on it, which would
have been displaced by the project. The existing grades on the site required significant retaining walls.

A Concept Report for the alternate location was prepared and submitted on November 10, 2005 for
review. FHWA was not in favor of the bus ramp, which was the main reason for selecting that location.
 As a result, GRTA has chosen to construct this lot adjacent to the future HOV interchange, which will
provide direct access to and from I-20 to the lot when the interchange is complete.

Comments:
None at this time.

 Subject:     CONCEPT MEETING MINUTES ­ 0007920 (Blairs Bridge Road Park and Ride Lot)

Purpose: The purpose of this memo is to document the Project Concept Meeting held with Georgia DOT and
GRTA on Thursday, April 12, 2007 starting at 1:30 PM the GDOT Central Office. The meeting was held to
discuss the Concept Report for the proposed Park and Ride Lot on Blairs Bridge Road, near I-20 and Thornton
Road.

Discussion:
   1. URS provided an overview of the project. They provided history on why this property was chosen for this
       park and ride lot, and how buses and commuter vehicles will access the site.
   2. The impact of the future HOV interchange at this location was discussed. URS has coordinated with
       Earth Tech on the I-20 HOV Project, and the alignment of the interchange in shown on the concept plan.
        When the interchange is constructed, buses will access the park and ride lot directly from the
       interchange.
   3. Jan Hilliard (GDOT Project Manager for the I-20 HOV project) requested a full-size copy of the Concept
       Plans from URS for the Urban Design office.
   4. GDOT confirmed that the CE has also been approved, and it is for the entire parcel (18.94 acres). The
       CE required that noise protection be installed along the western boundary of the site, in order to protect
       the adjacent residential development. The options of installing noise walls and/or a landscape buffer
       were discussed. It was noted that there is an existing 50-foot non-disturbed buffer along the property
       line, which will remain in place.
   5. GDOT also confirmed that the entire parcel has been acquired as part of the advanced acquisition
       process for the I-20 HOV project.
   6. URS provided a brief summary of the traffic report for the project. The report concluded that the
       proposed park and ride lot will result in minor impacts to the surrounding intersections, but they will still
       operate at acceptable levels. No changes or upgrades to the surrounding roadway network are required.
        The traffic report does recommend that the speed limit on North Blairs Bridge Road be reduced from 45
       MPH to 35 MPH, because that is a more realistic speed limit for the existing road.
   7. GDOT questioned the existing condition of both North Blairs Bridge Road and Blairs Bridge Road.
       These roads will be used by heavy equipment during construction of the lot, which may result in
       necessary roadway improvements. These two roads are owned and maintained by Cobb County and
       Douglas County. GRTA agreed that improvements to these facilities may be necessary, and it will be
       discussed further with the County DOTs during design.
   8. No utility issues have arisen on the project.
   9. The five-leg intersection within the park and ride lot was an initial cause for concern. However, since the
       bus traffic will not significantly conflict with passenger vehicles, and the buses are driven by professional
       drivers, there should be little issue with the operation of the intersection.
   10. GDOT will determine what construction area office covers this project and provide URS and GRTA with
       appropriate contact information.

INTRODUCTION

The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) Xpress Bus park and ride lot to be
located in the Lithia Springs area is currently proposed to be constructed along the south side of
Blairs Bridge Road east of Thornton Road (State Route 6, SR 6) and North Blairs Bridge Road
plus its southern boundary abuts the I-20 right-of-way; see Figure 1. This facility would replace
the existing Ride Share park and ride lot that is accessed via the west leg of the North Blairs
Bridge Road and Blairs Bridge Road intersection.

Under its proposed layout, the park and ride lot would have a separate bus-only entrance at the
western boundary of the property. There would also be a full access driveway for other vehicles
at the approximate center of the frontage along Blairs Bridge Road. This driveway would also
be used by the buses to exit the park and ride lot. The facility is currently designed to provide a
total of 492 parking spaces, 10 of which will be designated for handicapped drivers. The stop
area with benches and shelters is located in the approximate center of the park and ride lot. The
site layout is shown in Figure 2.

This study was undertaken to quantify the impact to traffic operations once the park and ride lot
is functional and the additional traffic generated by the facility would be present. This report
will supersede the previous study performed by URS in April 2005 for a different nearby site.

SERVICE

Information used in the previous study to estimate the transit service to this park and ride lot was
based on the September 2003 "Regional Express Service Bus Plan". At that time Xpress service
had not yet been initiated. Today there are two routes in service that are in proximity to the new
park and ride site. The first is the Route #460 which has one terminus in Douglas County and
the other in downtown Atlanta. This route passes the site as it runs along I-20. The second is
Route #470 which has one terminus in Hiram with a stop at the Silver Comet Trailhead in
Powder Springs and the other in downtown Atlanta. This route runs along Thornton Road (SR
6) and I-20 as it passes this site.

In discussions with GRTA representatives regarding the planned service to the park and ride lot,
no final determination has been made to specific routings and time schedule. However, the
current plan would include three routes providing service to the park and ride lot. Two of the
routes would have 30 minute headways staggered by 15 minutes. The third route would have 60
minute headways. To present a conservative estimate of the number of buses traveling during
the peak hour of adjacent street traffic, the first minute and the 60th minute of the service hour
are included in the analysis resulting in seven additional buses being added to the traffic stream.
Table 1 represents the bus activity during the peak hour.

This service schedule would be essentially the same for both the morning and evening peak
hours with the only difference being the orientation of all of the trips are inbound in the morning
and outbound in the evening. Although this schedule does not include the potential for reverse
commute trips, if that type of service were implemented, it would only account for an additional
bus or two. This table is also an oversimplification of actual service which would have layover
time for the bus to sit at the stop and shelters waiting for patrons to board. However, these
aspects do not affect the evaluation of the impact to the operations of adjacent street traffic
where the number of buses is utilized.

ROUTING

As final decisions have not been made as to the actual transit service that would be scheduled at
the park and ride lot, the route that the buses would follow has not been defined. However, due
to the commuting nature of the Xpress service, the main line of travel would be along I-20.
Consequently, there are a limited number of streets that the buses can travel to get to and from
the park and ride lot to I-20. Even if ultimately the service originates at the park and ride lot, a
bus deadheading to the facility would still travel the same streets.




                                                                                 URS Corporation

Identified below are the routes that would be traveled by the buses providing service to the new
park and ride lot. These roadways and their intersections are then analyzed for the impact to
their operations given the introduction of the buses and the associated vehicles of the transit
service patrons accessing the park and ride lot.

Inbound Buses
For this report, inbound service starts in the western portion of the metropolitan region and ends
in the center of the City of Atlanta. For an inbound service that would originate from Douglas
County, the bus would exit from I-20 eastbound using the right of two left-turn lanes on the off-
ramp at Thornton Road (SR 6) turning into the far right/outside through lane and proceed north
towards North Blairs Bridge Road. After traversing the I-20 westbound exit ramp intersection,
the bus would be required to weave across two lanes of free flowing traffic, exiting at a high rate
of speed from the I-20 westbound ramp, in under 400 feet before turning right onto North Blairs
Bridge Road. At the all-way stop with Blairs Bridge Road, the bus would then turn left and
proceed to the bus-only entrance and turn right into the facility.

For service originating from the Hiram/Powder Springs area, buses are expected to access the
park and ride lot from southbound Thornton Road (SR 6) to North Blairs Bridge Road where
they would turn left. The bus would then follow the same route as the Douglas buses to the
exclusive bus entrance driveway on Blairs Bridge Road.

If the Xpress service originates at the park and ride lot, the bus would be deadheading from the
bus barn. The route to be followed would be predicated on the location of that facility. The
route could be one of those followed by an originating service as described above or from
westbound I-20. Under this scenario, the bus would exit at the westbound Thornton Road (SR 6)
ramp and proceed a short distance to North Blairs Bridge Road where it would turn right and
follow the route of the other inbound buses.

After the patrons have boarded the bus, it could continue its inbound trip by turning left onto
Blairs Bridge Road; turn right onto North Blairs Bridge Road after stopping at the all-way stop;
turn left at the signalized intersection with Thornton Road (SR 6); travel through the signal at
Thornton Road (SR 6) and the I-20 westbound exit; and then turn right at the free flow entrance
ramp to I-20 before proceeding eastbound to downtown.

In discussions with GRTA representatives, an alternate route for buses to access I-20 eastbound
is being considered. The basis for considering this routing is that Thornton Road (SR 6) at the
I-20 interchange can become congested and the buses could experience additional delay to the
service. Along those lines, I-20 eastbound in the morning can be congested and if this interstate
is entered further east, some of the delay experienced would be decreased. Given this
background, the other inbound route being considered for the buses leaving the park and ride lot
is to turn right onto Blairs Bridge Road and proceed to the all-way stop with Six Flags Drive;
turn right and proceed east on Six Flags Drive to the Riverside Parkway interchange with I-20
and enter the interstate at this point to then proceed downtown. This alternate inbound route to
access I-20 is the one used in the analysis for the impact on traffic operations caused by the park
and ride lot generated buses.


                                                                                 URS Corporation
                                                5
Outbound Buses
For this report, outbound service starts in the center of the City of Atlanta and ends in the
western portion of the metropolitan region. Outbound buses on I-20 westbound would exit at the
ramp to Thornton Road (SR 6) and turn right onto North Blairs Bridge Road to proceed to Blairs
Bridge Road, turn left, and then turn right into the park and ride lot. If the facility is the end
point of the service, the bus would either return to Atlanta via the inbound routing to do another
outbound run or it would return to the bus barn. If this park and ride lot is only an intermediate
stop, the bus would exit and continue to its other destinations.

For the continued outbound trip independent of its continued destination, after unboarding
passengers the bus would turn left out of the park and ride lot onto Blairs Bridge Road, right
onto North Blairs Bridge Road, and proceed to the signalized intersection with Thornton Road
(SR 6). Buses destined for Douglas County would turn left into the far right lane and enter the
westbound on-ramp to I-20. Buses destined for Hiram/Powder Springs would turn right and
continue north on Thornton Road (SR 6).

Commuter Vehicles
Patrons driving their vehicles to and from the park and ride lot have different routes they could
travel to access the facility's driveway on Blairs Bridge Road. These routes are based on the
area from which the patron starts. Patrons originating from north, west, and south of the site are
expected to travel on Thornton Road (SR 6) to North Blairs Bridge Road where they will travel
to Blairs Bridge Road and then make a right-turn to enter the park and ride lot. These patrons
are expected to follow the reverse path upon exiting and continuing to their destination of origin.


Patrons accessing the site from points east are expected to traverse either Blairs Bridge Road or
Six Flags Drive before traveling along Blairs Bridge Road to make a left-turn to enter the park
and ride lot. Upon exiting they are expected to follow the reverse path from which they entered.

ROADWAY NETWORK

Thornton Road (SR 6)
Thornton Road (SR 6) is classified as an urban principal arterial according to the Georgia
Department of Transportation's (GDOT) Road Classification (RC) index. Information from the
RC index indicates that approximately 10% of the vehicles on the roadway are trucks. This
regionally significant multi-lane median divided roadway is oriented north-south in the vicinity
of the park and ride lot with a posted 45 mile per hour (mph) speed limit. From recently
collected traffic counts Thornton Road (SR 6) in the vicinity of North Blairs Bridge Road has an
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) of 75,000 vehicles. The traffic data sheets for this and the
subsequent roadways are in the Traffic Volume Data section of the Appendix.

At the intersection with North Blairs Bridge Road, Thornton Road (SR 6) is signalized with
protected only left-turn phasing for the northbound and southbound maneuvers. Thornton Road
(SR 6) and the I-20 westbound and eastbound ramps are also signalized.

North Blairs Bridge Road
North Blairs Bridge Road is classified as an urban local street according to the GDOT RC index,
posted with a speed limit of 45 mph, and connects Thornton Road (SR 6) with Blairs Bridge
Road. North Blairs Bridge Road, which is approximately 1,300' long, provides access to several
businesses along its length. The RC Index did not identify the percentage of trucks on North
Blairs Bridge Road; however, due to the nature of the businesses along this roadway it is
expected that trucks would comprise approximately 2% of the vehicles. Currently, one travel
lane in each direction exists along North Blairs Bridge Road with widening to add a left-turn
lane and shared through/right-turn lane for westbound traffic at the intersection with Thornton
Road (SR 6). The "T" intersection with Blairs Bridge Road is stop controlled in all directions.
From recently collected traffic counts, North Blairs Bridge Road between Thornton Road (SR 6)
and Blairs Bridge Road has an ADT of 4,100 vehicles.

The street/driveway opposite North Blairs Bridge Road provides access to commercial
businesses on the west side of Thornton Road (SR 6). A Home Depot Center was recently
constructed and as part of their approval, roadway improvements were required. These recent
improvements were to add a separate southbound right-turn lane on Thornton Road (SR 6) and to
widen the western approach to three lanes providing separate right-turn, through, and left-turn
lanes.

Blairs Bridge Road
Blairs Bridge Road is classified as an urban local street according to the GDOT RC index,
posted with a speed limit of 35 mph, and connects North Blairs Bridge Road with Six Flags
Drive. There is one travel lane in each direction, with both its intersection North Blairs Bridge
Road and Six Flags Drive being stop controlled in all directions. The RC Index did not identify
the percentage of trucks on Blairs Bridge Road; however, due to the residential nature of the
development along this roadway it is expected that trucks would comprise approximately 1% of
the vehicles. The driveways providing access to the park and ride lot are on the south side of



                                                                               URS Corporation
                                               7
Blairs Bridge Road. From recently collected traffic counts, Blairs Bridge Road between North
Blairs Bridge Road and Six Flags Drive has an ADT of 3,570 vehicles.

Six Flags Drive
Six Flags Drive is classified as an urban local street according to the GDOT RC index, posted
with a speed limit of 40 mph, and connects Blairs Bridge Road with Riverside Parkway. Six
Flags Drive has one travel lane in each direction separated by a continuous two-way left-turn
lane, which becomes a separate left-turn lane at its all-way stop controlled intersection with
Blairs Bridge Road. The street name of the leg of the intersection opposite Six Flags Drive is
called Oak Ridge Road. From a count performed by Cobb County in August 2004, the reported
ADT on Six Flags Drive is 7,900 vehicles.

At Six Flags Drive and Blairs Bridge Road, the all-way stop signage is supplemented with an
overhead flashing red beacon. Also there is a separate left-turn lane on each approach to the
intersection. Three of the four legs also have right-turn channelization. This channelization,
however, occurs within the intersection proper where two vehicles waiting at the stop block
access to the right-turn. Consequently, the capacity analyses for this intersection did not include
separate right-turn lanes.

Figure 3 illustrates the existing lane configuration for the intersections in the immediate vicinity
of the park and ride lot.

ANALYSIS

To quantify traffic operations in the area and evaluate the impact the park and ride lot and
Xpress service may cause, morning and evening peak period turning movement counts were
performed in January 2007 at three intersections in the immediate vicinity of the park and ride
lot; the count sheets are in the Traffic Volume Data section of the Appendix. Turning movement
counts were performed at the signalized intersection of Thornton Road (SR 6) and North Blairs
Bridge Road, at the unsignalized intersection of North Blairs Bridge Road and Blairs Bridge
Road, and at the unsignalized intersection of Blairs Bridge Road and Six Flags Drive. These
existing peak hour volumes are shown on Figure 4.

Under the current site configuration, the park and ride lot will be constructed with 492 spaces, 10
of which will be designated for handicapped drivers. To determine the anticipated amount of
traffic created by this facility, trip generation rates were developed using the Institute of
Transportation Engineer's (ITE) reference Trip Generation, 7th Edition. For Land Use Code #
090, Park-and-Ride Lot with Bus Service, it is expected that this lot when fully operational
would generate 1,495 trips on an average weekday. The adjacent street network would
experience 379 generated trips during the morning peak hour with 80% of the vehicles entering
the park and ride lot and 20% exiting. During the evening peak hours the facility would generate
303 trips with 77% exiting the lot and 23% entering.




                                                                                 URS Corporation
                                                 8
For comparison purposes, another technique was evaluated for estimating trip generation rates.
The technique used the number of buses operating at the park and ride lot during the peak hour
in conjunction with anticipated ridership. The typical Xpress bus seats 45 customers. With a
load factor of 80%, there would be 36 passengers per bus. Assuming each patron drivers their
own car and there are seven buses utilizing the park and ride lot in the peak hour, that would
result in 252 trips. This value is less than rates given using Trip Generation. One reason for this
is that park and ride lots are also used by van pools and carpools; using strictly mass transit
activities can under represent the actual usage of the facility. Consequently, the rates reported by
ITE are used in the impact analysis to estimate the number of generated rips by the park and ride
lot.

To estimate the distribution of the park and ride lot generated trips, an evaluation was performed
that incorporated traffic volumes, connectivity of the adjacent road network, and orientation of
trip attractors and generators. The site-generated traffic was distributed to the area per the
percentages shown in Figure 5 and assigned, per the existing turning percentages, to the
intersections as shown in Figure 6.

The currently anticipated opening date of the facility is in late 2008. In the event there is a
delay, the park and ride lot would be constructed and functional in early 2009. To estimate the
traffic volumes that would be present on the roadways prior to the opening of the park and ride
lot, existing volumes were projected for two years. To calculate a growth rate to estimate these
background volumes, AADT counts collected by GDOT on Thornton Road (SR 6) between Oak
Ridge Drive and I-20 westbound ramp from 1999 to 2005 were evaluated. These reported
volumes indicated growth rates fluctuated; however, over this time period volumes remained
relatively flat. Based upon more regionally oriented data, the existing traffic volumes were
grown at a rate of 3%. This growth rate was applied to the existing peak hour volumes. The
background volumes are shown in Figure 7. The park and ride lot generated volumes were then
added to the background volumes to determine the anticipated future volumes when the facility
is operational. These volumes are shown in Figure 8.

To analyze the impact to traffic operations by the generated trips from the park and ride lot,
existing roadway geometry, signal timing data, and the collected traffic data were used. This
data was input into the capacity analyses to determine the background and future Level of
Service (LOS). The results of theses analyses are presented in Table 2 and the worksheets are in
the Capacity Analysis section of the Appendix.

                                                   11
For the future conditions, the intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS. During
the evening peak hour, the Blairs Bridge Road and Six Flags Drive intersection would operate at
LOS D.

Under the future conditions with the park and ride lot generated traffic present, the LOS at the
all-way stop controlled intersection of Blairs Bridge Road and Six Flags Drive, would remain the
same although there would be a slight increase in the average delay per vehicle. At the all-way
stop controlled intersection of North Blairs Bridge Road and Blairs Bridge Road, the operations
decreased from LOS A to LOS B during both the morning and evening peak hour. These are
still very acceptable Levels of Service. At the signalized intersection of Thornton Road (SR 6)
at North Blairs Bridge Road, where additional northbound right turning traffic increased overall
control delay in the morning and evening by 9.8 and 14.1 seconds respectively, the Level of
Service would decrease from LOS B to LOS C during the morning peak hour and would
decrease from LOS C to LOS D during the evening peak hour. Consequently, the introduction
of the park and ride lot generated traffic to the adjacent street network will have an impact to
area traffic operations; however, the resultant Levels of Service will continue to be in the
acceptable range.

OPERATIONAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONSIDERATIONS

This analysis was focused primarily on the impacts to traffic operations in the vicinity of the new
park and ride lot once the facility is constructed and operational. Identified below are additional
operational and infrastructure considerations for the adjacent transportation network.

One operational consideration is the currently posted speed limit of 45 mph on North Blairs
Bridge Road. This roadway in its short length does have vertical and horizontal curvature.
When the park and ride lot is operational, this street would experience the largest increase in new
volumes. Consequently, to enhance the safety, consideration should be given by the local
jurisdiction to decrease the speed limit to at least 35 mph.

Another operational consideration is the intersection control for the internal driveways of the
park and ride lot. The exclusive bus entrance driveway intersects the full access driveway at the
intersection of driveways for separate parking areas. To minimize the delay for buses to access
the main facility driveway to exit, this intersections should be considered to be controlled with
an all-way stop.

There are roadway improvements that are planned in the area of the park and ride lot. One of
those projects entails geometric improvements and installation of a stop and go traffic signal at
the intersection of Blairs Bridge Road and Six Flags Drive. The work would be funded under
Cobb County's SPLOST program. It is expected though that this work would not be
programmed until 2010 at the earliest. Consequently, the improved intersection was not
included in this analysis.

As part of the plan for expanding the HOV system in the Atlanta metropolitan region, a future
I-20 HOV ramp is proposed to be located across the western portion of the parcel on which the


                                                                                 URS Corporation
                                                17
park and ride lot would be constructed. The ultimate plan calls for direct bus access to the park
and ride lot from this HOV ramp. As this major Interstate construction would not occur for a
number of years, this HOV ramp and its affect on bus and vehicular circulation and operations
was not included in this analysis.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Lithia Springs Xpress park and ride lot will introduce additional traffic through the
intersections of Thornton Road (SR 6) and North Blairs Bridge Road; North Blairs Bridge Road
and Blairs Bridge Road; and Blairs Bridge Road and Six Flags Drive. Although no final
determination has been made as to which routes would provide service at this park and ride lot,
the current plan anticipates this lot would be served by three different Xpress routes. To perform
as conservative an analysis as possible by maximizing the amount of transit trips utilizing the
facility, it was assumed that seven buses would operate at the park and ride lot during the peak
hours. With existing traffic volumes projected for two years and the park and ride lot site-
generated traffic added, the capacity analysis indicated that the additional volumes would have
an impact on the intersection operations by increasing delay; however, the intersections will
continue to function at acceptable Levels of Service.

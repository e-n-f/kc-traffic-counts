1.0 Introduction
This  Road  Safety  Audit  (RSA)  was  conducted  by  the  Old  Colony  Planning  Council  (OCPC) 
at the request of the East Bridgewater Department of Public Works.  The intersection of 
Belmont  Street  and  Summer  Street  was  the  subject  of  a  previous  local  assistance 
planning  study  completed  by  OCPC  in  2006  at  the  request  of  the  East  Bridgewater 
Department  of  Public  Works  in  response  to  concerns  raised  by  residents  regarding 
safety.  The location of the intersection is shown in Figure 1. 

2.0 The Road Safety Audit
A  Road  Safety  Audit  (RSA)  is  defined  by  the  Federal  Highway  Administration  (FHWA) 
Road  Safety  Audits  Guidelines  as;  "A  formal  safety  performance  examination  of  an 
existing or future road or intersection by an independent audit team."  The RSA is a way 
of  doing  business  to  identify  road  safety  issues  as  well  as  opportunities  for  safety 
improvements for all road users.  The RSA includes the following elements: 
 
      Performed by an independent team 
      Performed by a multidisciplined team 
      Considers all potential road users 
      Accounts for road user capabilities and limitations 
      Generates a formal report 
      Requires  a  formal  response  from  the  project  owner  (in  this  case  the  Selectmen 
         who have requested this study) 
          
In  summary,  the  RSA  is  a  proactive,  formal  examination  that  focuses  on  road  safety, 
which  is  conducted  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  independent  of  the  project  owner  (or 
the  requester  of  the  study).   The  audit  team  must  be  adequately  qualified  individually 
and  as  a  team.   The  RSA  is  qualitative  in  nature,  although  crash  data,  traffic  data,  and 
analyses  are  necessary,  and  the  safety  of  all  road  users  and  facilities  are  considered.  
This  report  includes  average  daily  traffic  volume  counts,  crash  data  compilation  and 
analyses,  and  intersection  warrant  analyses  for  traffic  signal  and  multiway  stop  control 
implementation. 
 
It  is  important  for  participants  to  understand  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of 
organizations  involved  in  the  RSA.   OCPC  is  the  manager  and  facilitator  of  the  process, 
responsible  for  data  collection  and  compilation,  analysis,  grant  support,  and  facilitator 
of  the  meetings  and  field  visit.   The  Town  of  East  Bridgewater  is  responsible  for  action 
and implementation of the proposed recommendations made by the support team.

2.1     Choosing the Road Safety Audit Team
The  main  objective  in  selecting  an  RSA  team,  according  to  the  Federal  Highway 
Administration's  (FHWA)  Road  Safety  Audits  Guidelines  is  to  choose  an  independent, 
qualified, and multidisciplinary team of experts.  The recommendations were to include 
individuals with the following backgrounds: 
 
     Road  Safety  Specialist    With  expertise  in  causal  factors  that  lead  to  crashes  and 
        effective treatments that address the occurrence of such crashes. 
     Traffic  Operations  Engineer  ­  Qualified  in  the  field  of  traffic  operations  and 
        understand  the  principles  of  traffic  flow,  the  causes  of  congestion,  and  the 
        proper  placement  and  uses  of  signs,  pavement  markings,  and  traffic  signal 
        operations. 
     Road  Design  Engineer  ­  With  extensive  road  design  experience  and  familiarity 
        with federal. state, and local standards.   
     Local  Contact  Person  ­  With  familiarity  with  the  area  under  review  and  the 
        traffic safety issues experienced there. 
     Other  Areas  of  Specialties  ­  These  include  specialists  in  human  factors, 
        maintenance,  law  enforcement,  first  response,  pedestrian  and  bicycle  use,  and 
        transit use. 

The  FHWA  guidelines  recommended  that  the  best  practice  regarding  the  size  of  the 
team is to limit its size.  The team should consult with other individuals if other skill sets 
are  necessary.    OCPC  compiled  a  list  of  potential  participants  to  fill  the  needs  of  the 
team.  Those participating in the RSA on December 4, 2012 included: 

Robb Kenn, Operations Manager, East Bridgewater DPW 
Silpa Munukutla, MassDOT Highway Safety Division 
Corey O'Connor, MassDOT Highway Safety Division 
Sergeant Mike McLaughlin, East Bridgewater Police Department 
Acting Fire Chief Timothy M. Harhen, East Bridgewater Fire Department 
Tim Kochan, MassDOT District 5 
Jed Cornock, Transportation Planner, OCPC 
Ray Guarino, Transportation Planner, OCPC  

A  copy  of  the  attendance  sheet  for  the  preaudit  meeting  and  the  field  audit  are 
included in the appendix to this report. 

2.2     The RSA Procedure
After  receiving  a  request  from  the  East  Bridgewater  DPW  regarding  safety  at  the 
Belmont  Street/Summer  Street  intersection,  OCPC,  acting  as  the  RSA  manager, 
identified and contacted (by telephone and email) RSA participants who could act as the 
independent  audit  team.    OCPC  scheduled  the  RSA  December  4,  2012  at  10:00  AM  at 
the  East  Bridgewater  Water  Department  conference  room,  49  Dean  Place  in  East
Bridgewater.    In  addition,  OCPC  compiled  background  traffic  and  crash  data  for  the

intersection,  as  well  as  previous  studies.   The  peak  hour  intersection  turning  movement 
counts  were  updated  in  September  of  2012,  and  crash  data  was  updated.    Crash  data 
was obtained from the East Bridgewater Police Department for the latest available three 
year  period  (from  December  2009  through  December  2012).    A  previous  study 
completed  by  OCPC  for  the  intersection  was  completed  September  2006.    Speed  data 
for Belmont Street as well as stopping sight distance measurements are available for the 
intersection in this study.

3.0 Background Data and Information for Belmont Street at Summer
   Street
3.1      Physical Attributes
Belmont  Street  is  classified  as  an  urban  minor  arterial  road  and  Summer  Street  is 
classified  as  a  collector  road,  according  to  the  Massachusetts  Department  of 
Transportation  (MassDOT)  road  inventory  file.    Although  the  roads  are  under  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Town  of  East  Bridgewater,  the  intersection  is  eligible  for  federal 
funding  under  the  Surface  Transportation  Program  (STP).   The  intersection  of  Belmont 
Street  and  Summer  Street  is  approximately  onehalf  of  a  mile  from  both  the  West 
Bridgewater Town Line and Brockton City Line.  
 
Belmont  Street  is  a  twolane  roadway  with  lanes  between  ten  and  twelve  feet  wide  on 
both  approaches  to  the  Summer  Street  intersection.   Site  visit  observations  showed  the 
absence  of  sidewalks  and  shoulders.    White  edge  lines  (Fog  lines)  and  centerlines  on 
both  approaches  have  been  added  to  the  intersection  since  the  2006  OCPC  study.  
Summer  Street  is  a  twolane  collector  road  that  runs  north  south  in  East  Bridgewater 
from Winter Street to Pleasant Street.   
 
The  intersection  of  Belmont  Street  and  Summer  Street  is  a  fourway  intersection  with 
stop signs posted on the Summer Street approaches.  Belmont Street is the major street, 
which  provides  access  to  Route  28  in  West  Bridgewater  and  Route  18  in  East 
Bridgewater.  Right turns on the Summer Street approaches are yield controlled and are 
channeled  via  a  raised  island  on  both  approaches.   A  town  monument  is  located  within 
the  right  turn  island  on  the  northbound  approach.  A  utility  pole  is  located  within  the 
right  turn  island  on  the  southbound  approach.    The  travel  lanes  approaching  the 
intersection  on  all  four  legs  average  10  to  12  feet  wide.   Site  visits  performed  by  OCPC 
staff  determined  that  both  Belmont  Street  and  Summer  Street  lack  adequate  shoulders 
and sidewalks.  
 
The  intersection  is  located  within  a  thickly  settled  area  in  the  northwestern  section  of 
East  Bridgewater.    According  to  Massachusetts  General  Law  Chapter  90,  Section  1,  a 
"thickly  settled  area"  is  defined  as  "the  territory  contiguous  to  any  way  where  the 
dwelling  houses  are  situated  at  such  distances  as  will  average  less  than  two  hundred 
feet between them for a distance of a quarter of a mile or over."  The prima fascia speed 
limit, according to Massachusetts statute, is 30 miles per hour, unless otherwise posted.

3.2      Average Daily Traffic
Traffic  counts  were  conducted  on  Belmont  Street  and  Summer  Street  in  2004  (for  the 
previous  OCPC  study)  and  in  2012  for  the  Road  Safety  Audit  to  determine  the  average 
daily  traffic  (total  traffic  within  a  24hour  period).    Traffic  counts  were  conducted 
utilizing  automatic  traffic  recorders  at  four  locations,  one  on  each  of  the  approaches  to 
the  intersection  at  the  following  locations:  Belmont  Street  east  of  Summer  Street; 
Belmont  Street  west  of  Summer  Street;  Summer  Street  north  of  Belmont  Street;  and 
Summer  Street  south  of  Belmont  Street.   The  traffic  recorders  were  placed  for  a  forty
eight  hour  period  and  recorded  vehicle  volumes,  vehicle  speeds,  and  vehicle 
classifications  (the  number  of  heavy  vehicles  in  the  traffic  stream).   A  summary  of  the 
data  is  included  in  the  appendix  to  this  report.   Table  1  summarizes  the  traffic  volume

of Belmont Street 

  As  shown  in  Table  1,  Belmont  Street  east  of  Summer  Street  had  3,653  vehicles  per  day 
  east of Summer Street in 2004 and 3,855 in 2012.  This represents an overall increase in 
  2012 over 2004 of 5.5 percent.  The Belmont Street west of Summer Street location, had 
  3,921  vehicles  per  day  in  2004,  and  4,294  vehicles  per  day  in  2012.   This  represents  an 
  overall  increase  of  9.5  percent.    The  highest  volumes  of  traffic  were  recorded  on 
  Belmont  Street  west  of  Summer  Street  at  4,294  vehicles  per  day  in  2012.   On  Summer 
  Street  north  of  Belmont Street,  the  traffic  volumes  were  2,020  vehicles per  day  in  2004, 
  and  1,927  vehicles  per  day  in  2012.    This  was  an  overall  decrease  in  traffic  of  4.6 
  percent.    The  Summer  Street  south  of  Belmont  Street  intersection  also  experienced  a 
  decrease  in  traffic  from  991  vehicles  per  day  in  2004  to  969  vehicles  per  day  in  2012.  
  This was an overall decrease in traffic of 2.2 percent. 

  3.3      Heavy Vehicles and Vehicle Speeds
  The  automatic  traffic  recorders  on  Belmont  Street  and  Summer  Street,  in  addition  to 
  recording  the  2012  traffic  volumes,  also  recorded  the  percentage  of  heavy  vehicles  and 
  the  prevailing  speeds  in  the  traffic  stream.    The  heavy  vehicle  data  is  classified  into 
  categories  based  on  the  Federal  Highway  Administration  (FHWA)  classification  system.  
  Any vehicle with a minimum of two axles and six tires is considered a heavy vehicle.  The 
  traffic recorders measured the 85th percentile speed, which is the speed that 85 percent 
  of traffic is travelling.  The results of the vehicle classification indicate that 9.3 percent of 
  the traffic on Belmont Street east of Summer Street consists of trucks and 7.4 percent of 
  the  traffic  on  Belmont  Street  west  of  Summer  Street  consists  of  trucks.    On  Summer 
  Street,  north  of  Belmont  Street  the  vehicle  classification  was  10.3  percent  truck  traffic 
  and  on  Summer  Street  south  of  Belmont  Street  the  vehicle  classification  was  nine 
  percent trucks.

Old Colony Planning Council


 
The  85th  percentile  speeds  were  recorded  as  follows:  40  miles  per  hour  at  Belmont 
Street  east  of  Summer  Street,  42  miles  per  hour  at  Belmont  Street  west  of  Summer 
Street,  40  miles  per  hour  on  Summer  Street  north  of  Belmont  Street,  and  42  miles  per 
hour  south  of  Belmont  Street.   The  speed  limit  on  Belmont  Street  is  30  miles  per  hour 
(based  on  the  prima  fascia  speed  limit  in  a  thickly  settled  area),  and  the  posted  speed 
limit  on  Summer  Street  is  35  miles  per  hour.    In  addition,  spot  speeds  were  sampled 
manually  using  a  stop  watch  on  Belmont  Street  west  of  Summer  Street  and  Summer 
Street north of Belmont Street in 2006.  The 85th percentile speeds at that time were 42 
miles  per  hour  eastbound  and  33  miles  per  hour  westbound  on  Belmont  Street  west  of 
Summer  Street,  and  36  miles  per  hour  northbound  and  35  miles  per  hour  southbound 
on Summer Street north of Belmont Street.  

3.4      Intersection Volumes and Levels-of-Service
Manual  turning  movement  counts  were  conducted  in  September  2012  at  the  Belmont 
Street  at  Summer  Street  intersection  during  the  morning,  7:00  AM  to  9:00  AM  and 
afternoon,  4:00  PM  to  6:00  PM  periods  to  determine  the  morning  and  afternoon  peak 
hours  (the  highest  onehour  volumes.)   The  morning  and  afternoon  peak  hour  volume 
summaries  are  shown  in  the  appendix.    These  2012  turning  movement  counts  are 
compared  to  the  2006  volumes  used  in  the  2006  OCPC  Belmont  Street/Summer  Street 
Intersection Study in Table 2.

Table  2  shows  that  the  PM  peak  hour  experiences  the  most  traffic  during  the  day  with 
628  vehicles  entering  the  intersection  in  2012  during  the  PM  peak  hour,  and  545  in 
2006.   In  2006,  the  PM  peak  hour  entering  volume,  545  vehicles,  was  116  more  or  27 
percent  over  the  AM  peak  hour  (429).    In  2012,  the  PM  peak  hour's  entering  volume, 
628  vehicles,  was  136  more  than  the  AM  peak  hour  (492),  or  27  percent.   The  AM  peak 
hour  and  the  PM  peak  hour  showed  increases  in  2012  over  2006,  with  the  AM  peak 
hour increasing 63 vehicles, or 15 percent, and the PM peak hour increasing 83 vehicles, 
or 17 percent.

The 2012 peak hour turning movement volumes were used to calculate the intersection 
levelsofservice,  for  this  Road  Safety  Audit,  which  discern  the  existing  traffic  operating 
conditions  at  the  intersection.  Levelofservice  analyses  are  a  qualitative  and 
quantitative  measure  based  on  the  techniques  published  in  the  Highway  Capacity 
Manual  by  the  Transportation  Research  Board.    Levelofservice  is  a  general  measure 
that  summarizes  the  overall  operation  of  an  intersection  or  transportation  facility.   It  is 
based upon the operational conditions of a facility including lane use, traffic control, and 
lane  width,  and  takes  into  account  such  factors  as  operating  speeds,  traffic 
interruptions, and freedom to maneuver.   
 
Levelofservice  represents  a  range  of  operating  conditions  and  is  summarized  with 
letter  grades  from  "A"  to  "F",  with  "A"  being  the  most  desirable.  Levelofservice  "E" 
represents  the  maximum  flow  rate or  the  capacity  on  a  facility.   The  following  describes 
the characteristics of each levelofservice: 
 
     LOS  "A"  represents  free  flow.    Individual  users  are  virtually  unaffected  by  the 
         presence of others in the traffic stream. 
     LOS  "B"  is  in  the  range  of  stable  flow,  but  the  presence  of  other  users  in  the 
         traffic  stream  begins  to  be  noticeable.   Freedom  to  select  desired  speeds  is  still 
         relatively unaffected. 
     LOS  "C"  is  in  the  range  of  stable  flow,  but  marks  the  beginning  of  the  range  of 
         flow  in  which  the  operation  of  individual  users  becomes  significantly  affected  by 
         interactions  with  others  in  the  traffic  stream.   Occasional  backups  occur  behind 
         turning vehicles. 
     LOS  "D"  represents  highdensity,  but  stable,  flow.  Speed  and  freedom  to 
         maneuver  are  restricted,  and  the  driver  experiences  a  below  average  level  of 
         comfort  and  convenience.      Small  increases  in  traffic  flow  will  generally  cause 
         operational problems at this level. 
     LOS  "E"  represents  operating  conditions  at  or  near  the  capacity  level.  All  speeds 
         are  reduced  to  a  low,  but  relatively  uniform  level.  Freedom  to  maneuver  within 
         the  traffic  stream  is  extremely  limited,  and  generally  requires  forcing  other 
         vehicles to give way. Congestion levels and delay are very high. 
     LOS  "F"  is  representative  of  forced  or  breakdown  flow.  This  condition  exists 
         wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount that can 
         traverse the point, resulting in lengthy queues and delay. 

The  LOS  definitions  describe  conditions  based  on  a  number  of  operational  parameters.   
There  are  certain  parameters  utilized  as  measures  of  effectiveness  for  specific  facilities.   
In  the  case  for  intersections,  twolane  highways,  and  arterials,  which  represent  the 
physical  conditions  that  typify  the  study  area  corridors,  time  delay,  average  stop  delay,  
and  average  travel  speed  are  used  as  measures  of  operational  effectiveness  to  which 
levels of service are assigned.

The  Belmont  Street  and  Summer  Street  intersection  is  classified  as  a  twoway  stop 
controlled  intersection  (TWSC)  rather  than  an  all  way  stop  control  intersection  (AWSC) 
because  traffic  on  Summer  Street must  stop  and  yield  to  the  Belmont  Street  traffic, and 
Belmont  traffic  has  the  right  of  way.    Levelofservice  analysis  was  conducted  for  the 
intersection  in  the  OCPC  2006  study.    The  results  of  the  2006  analysis  showed  that 
traffic  flow  at  the  Summer  Street  approaches  was  LOS  "B"  during  the  morning  and 
afternoon  peak  hours,  with  very  little  delay  experienced  by  motorists  entering  the 
intersection.   The  levelofservice  analysis  was  also  performed  utilizing  the  2012  turning 
movement  volumes.   The  update  analysis  showed  that  the  traffic  flow  on  the  Summer 
Street approaches is still at the LOS "B" level for the morning and afternoon peak hours. 

3.5      Available Stopping Sight Distance
The available sight distance on a roadway should be sufficiently long to  enable a vehicle 
traveling  at  or  near  the  design  speed  to  stop  before  reaching  a  stationary  object  in  its 
path.  Sight distance is affected by road conditions, such as grades, curves, and roadside 
vegetation  or  other  objects  (signs,  stone  walls,  fences, etc.).   According  to  the  American 
Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO)  ­  2011  Geometric 
Design of Highways and Streets, sight distance is the length of the roadway ahead that is 
visible to the driver.   

In  the  OCPC  2006  study  for  the  Belmont  Street  at  Summer  Street  intersection,  field 
measurements  were  conducted  by  OCPC  staff.   The  study  concluded  that  the  Stopping 
Sight  Distance  (SSD)  for  the  Belmont  Street  eastbound  approach  is  approximately  200 
feet,  which  is  adequate  for  vehicles  traveling  at  the  speed  limit  of  30  miles  per  hour  or 
less (see Table 6.)  However, the 85th percentile speed for the traffic heading eastbound 
on  this  approach  is  42  miles  per  hour,  based  on  based  on  the  automatic  traffic  recorder 
speed  study.    Traffic  approaching  the  intersection  from  this  direction  experiences  a 
sharp curve and a raise in elevation.  The 2006 OCPC study concluded that these factors 
contribute to the inadequate stopping sight distance for this eastbound approach.

             eight crashes in 2002.  The remaining years experienced four or fewer crashes with four 
             crashes  in  2003  and  2007.    There  were  three  years  that  experienced  one  crash,  2005, 
             2009, and 2010.  Table 3 summarizes the crashes based on type of crash, crash severity,

             type,  with  27,  and  there  were  3  ranoffroad/single  vehicle  crashes,  and  two  headon 
             crashes.    There  was  one  fatality  in  2003;  however,  according  to  the  East  Bridgewater 
             police,  that  fatality  was  due  to  driver  medical  condition  and  not  because  of  road 
             conditions or traffic control.  Most of the crashes resulted in property damage only (16), 
             and there were five crashes that resulted in personal injury.  The majority of the crashes 
             occurred during daylight hours and under dry conditions.

A  crash  rate  was  calculated  for  the  Belmont  Street  at  Summer  Street  intersection.   The 
crash  rate  indicates  the  frequency  of  crashes  at  intersections  and  measures  the  crash 
exposure.  It is based on the number of crashes per million entering vehicles (MEV).  The 
crash  rates  calculated  for  intersections  in  this  study  are  based  upon  the  ITE  equation  in 
the Manual of Traffic Engineering Studies.  The crash rate per million entering vehicles is 
the number of accidents in a year (averaged over three years) times one million, divided 
by  the  number  of  vehicles  entering  the  intersection  in  a  year.    The  crash  rate  for  the 
intersection  was  calculated  to  be  0.40  crashes  per  million  entering  vehicles.    The 
average  crash  rate  for  unsignalized  intersections  in  MassDOT  District  5  is  0.60  MEV.  
The  average  crash  rate  for  unsignalized  intersections  in  Massachusetts  is  0.61  MEV.  
The  crash  rate  for  this  intersection  is  below  both  the  MassDOT  District  average  and  the 
Massachusetts average.

4.0 Safety Challenges and Observed Deficiencies
        4.1.1Pre-Audit Meeting and Discussion
OCPC  held  a  preaudit  meeting  and  discussion  with  the  RSA  team  regarding  traffic  and 
safety issues on December 4, 2012 at the East Bridgewater DPW (Water Division office).  
OCPC  presented  the  background  traffic  and  crash  data  to  the  team  and  reviewed  the 
purpose, procedures, and timeline for the RSA. 
  
At  the  preaudit  meeting,  the  participants  discussed  the  existing  conditions  and  the 
history of crashes.  These included: 
 
 Limited  sight  distance  on  Belmont  Street  for  vehicles  approaching  the  intersection 
    eastbound  on  Belmont  Street  and  for  vehicles  approaching  Belmont  Street  from 
    Summer Street 
 A lack of visibility approaching the intersection prevents approaching motorists from 
    recognizing that there is an intersection ahead  
 An uptick in crashes at the intersection during wet and slippery weather 
 Belmont  Street  is  used  as  a  cut  through  for  traffic,  especially  by  parcel  delivery 
    trucks  
 Speeding on Belmont Street 
 Poor turning radii for truck turns 
 Lack of advanced warning signs 
 Channelized islands present obstruction and misalignment 
 Trees  near  the  intersection  visually  blend  the  Summer  Street  approaches  into  the 
    landscape

        4.1.2 Field Audit Findings
After  reviewing  the  background  crash  data,  traffic  volumes,  speed  data,  heavy  vehicle 
data,  and  discussing  the  issues,  the  team  reconvened  the  audit  in  the  field  at  the 
Belmont  Street  at  Summer  Street  intersection.    The  team  inspected  sight  lines,  the 
condition  and  placement  of  signs  along  the  road,  channelization  islands,  and  the  road 
alignment.   The  team  also  noted  the  sharp  curve  and  grade  on  the  eastbound  Belmont 
Street approach to Summer Street in front of the cemetery. 

4.2      Recommendations and Countermeasures for Consideration
The  recommendations  and  countermeasures  developed  by  the  RSA  participants  have 
been  categorized  as  shortterm, midterm,  or  longterm  based  on  the  definitions  shown 
in  Table  4.   Additionally,  a  cost  category  has  been  assigned  to  each  improvement  based 
on the parameters also in Table 4.

         4.2.1 Alternative Recommendation Analysis
Flashing Beacons 
Flashing  beacons,  which  are  installed  overhead  at  intersections,  reinforce  driver 
awareness  of  stop  signs,  and  contribute  toward  mitigating  right  angle  crashes.    The 
beacons  are  used  to  supplement  stop  signs  and  to  call  drivers'  attention  to  the  stop 
signs.  Flashing  beacons  are  not  as  effective  as  a  multiway  stop  in  reducing  the  number 
of fatalities or stop sign violations at intersections, although there is a general reduction 
in  speeds  on  the  major  road  approaches  (according  to  the  Manual  on  Uniform  Traffic 
Control  Devices,  MUTCD).    This  alternative  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  advanced 
warning  signs  on  the  intersection  approaches.   The  flashing  beacon  should  be  properly 
placed  where  they  are  clearly  visible  to  approaching  drivers.   The  MUTCD  states  that  a 
supplemental  signal  indication  can  be  used  on  one  or  more  approaches  to  provide 
additional  visibility  to  approaching  vehicles.    Supplemental  signal  indications  on  the 
Belmont  Street  approaches  to  the  intersection  will  help  slow  down  traffic  in  advance  of 
the intersection. 

All Way Stop Signs with Flashing Beacons 
This  alternative  requires  the  posting  of  a  stop  sign  on  all  four  approaches  to  the 
intersection.    The  flashing  red  beacon  will  also  face  all  four  intersection  approaches.  
The  advantage  to  this  alternative  is  that  it  offers  a  low  cost,  quick  fix  solution  to  the 
safety  problems  at  the  intersection.    Advanced  warning  signs  will  be  required  on  the 
approaches  especially  on  the  eastbound  approach,  due  to  high  speeds  and  the 
limitations  on  sight  distance  on  this  approach.   This  will  allow  vehicles  to  slow  down  in 
advance of the stop control at the intersection.   
 
The  multiway  stopcontrol  strategy  targets  unsignalized  intersections  with  patterns  of 
right  angle  crashes  with  moderate  volumes.   According  to  the  MUTCD,  specific  criteria 
should  determine  stop  sign  installation.   The  criteria  are  based  on  the  vehicle  volumes 
or the number of crashes within a twelvemonth period and the traffic volumes. 
 
The traffic volumes at the Summer Street and Belmont Street intersection did not satisfy 
the  minimum  volumes  for  the  multistop  control  warrant.1    However,  the  crash  data 
showed  that  a  multiway  stop  control  is  warranted  based  on  the  crash  experience 
between  August  2007  and  April  2008.   Six  crashes  occurred  within  a  12  month  period, 
and  five  of  these  crashes  were  angle  type,  which  can  be  mitigated  utilizing  allway  stop 
control.    The  crash  data  and  the  warrant  analysis  are  provided  in  the  appendix  of  this 
report.

   According  to  the  MUTCD    If  the  85thpercentile  approach  speed  of  the  majorstreet  traffic  exceeds  40  mph,  the 
minimum  vehicular  volume  warrants  are  70  percent  of  the  values  provided  in  Items  1  and  2;  however,  the  70  percent 
volumes also did not satisfy MUTCD warrants for all way stop control or traffic signals.

Traffic Signals 
The  MUTCD  provides  the  basis  for  the  consideration  of  the  installation  of  traffic  control 
signals.   The  MUTCD  guidance  states  that  the  selection  and  use  of  traffic  control  signals 
should  be  based  on  an  engineering  study  of  roadway  conditions.    These  warrants 
provide  an  analysis  of  traffic  operations  that  define  the  minimum  conditions  under 
which installing traffic control signals might be justified.  The MUTCD states that a traffic 
control signal should not be installed unless one or more of the warrants are satisfied. 

Traffic  signals  assign  the  rightofway  to  traffic  movements  at  an  intersection  and 
provide a number of advantages including: 
 
       They provide for the orderly movement of traffic. 
       They  increase  the  traffichandling  capacity  of  the  intersection  if  proper  physical 
          layouts  and  control  measures  are  used,  and  if  the  signal  timing  is  reviewed  and 
          updated  on  a  regular  basis  (every  two  years)  to  ensure  that  it  satisfies  current 
          traffic demands. 
       They  reduce  the  frequency  and  severity  of  certain  types  of  crashes,  especially 
          rightangle collisions. 
       They  are  coordinated  to  provide  for  continuous  or  nearly  continuous  movement 
          of traffic at a definite speed along a given route under favorable conditions. 
       They  are  used  to  interrupt  heavy  traffic  at  intervals  to  permit  other  traffic, 
          vehicular or pedestrian, to cross. 
 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  MUTCD  states  that  a  traffic  control  signal  should  not  be 
installed  if  it  will  seriously  disrupt  progressive  traffic  flow.   The  signal  warrant  analysis 
performed  for  the  intersection  based  on  the  MUTCD  is  included  in  the  appendix  to  this 
report.  
 
The  results  of  the  warrant  analysis  show  that  the  existing  traffic  volumes  at  the 
intersection  did  not  meet  any  of  the  warrant  criteria  in  the  MUTCD  to  justify  a  traffic 
signal  at  the  Summer  Street  and  Belmont  Street  intersection.    The  warrant  analysis  is 
included in the appendix to this report. 

5.0 Conclusions and Next Steps
5.1      Recommendation Summary
A  number  of  safety  improvement  opportunities  have  been  described  in  this  report, 
along  with  their  potential  impacts,  to  address  the  identified  deficiencies  at  the  Belmont 
Street  at  Summer  Street  intersection.   It  is  important  to  note  that  many  treatments  are 
both  low  cost  and  short  term  and  that  there  is  a  complementary  nature  of  some  of 
these  safety  strategies  in  that  one  improvement  will  aid  with  multiple  safety  issues.   In 
addition,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  approach  towards  improved  safety  is  dynamic  in 
nature and warrants revisiting over time.

The  intersection  does  not  satisfy  the  MUTCD  warrants  for  the  installation  of  a  traffic 
signal,  however,  low  cost  solutions  such  as  adding  "STOP"  pavement  markings  at  the 
stop  bar  and  at  the  yield  points  from  the  channelized  right  turns  on  the  Summer  Street 
approaches, stricter speed enforcement along Belmont Street, and flashing beacons can 
improve  overall  safety.  Other  potential  low  cost  improvements  the  intersection  include 
adding  warning  signs  on  the  eastbound  and  westbound  Belmont  Street  approaches 
(intersection ahead).   

5.2    Next Steps
The  Road  Safety  Audit  process  will  conclude  with  a  review  and  finalization  of  the 
findings  and  recommendations  by  the  RSA  participants,  and  a  formal  response  should 
be prepared by the Town of East Bridgewater that includes a plan for implementation of 
improvements.

Instructions for participants: 
     Before attending the Road Safety Audit on December 4th, participants are encouraged to drive or 
         walk through the intersection and complete elements of the RSA Prompt list with a focus on 
         safety. 
     Participants are reminded that this is a collaborative process and mutual respect of opinions is a 
         key element to overall success. 
     After the RSA, participants will receive a draft of the RSA report for review and comment to 
         ensure that it is reflective of the RSA conclusions and recommendations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report summarizes the transportation impacts associated with the proposed Snowbasin
Resort Master Plan. The report includes an analysis of build-out conditions for a typical
weekday and peak Saturday during ski season at the proposed resort. In addition to the buildout
analysis, an analysis of intermediate development steps was also conducted to identify when
the various identified roadway improvements would be needed, so that the road system would
continue to provide adequate operations as the development progresses toward completion.

The Snowbasin Resort Master Development Plan Update was completed in February 2010, and
defines the operational improvements anticipated for Snowbasin going into the future. The
Development Plan was developed alongside the Snowbasin Area Plans, which were completed
in May 2008 and updated in January 2010. Together, these documents represent a vision for
the transformation of Snowbasin Resort from a day-skier destination to a year-round resort.

Snowbasin is located in the Wasatch Mountains east of Ogden, Utah. The resort currently
focuses around Earl's Lodge, which is accessed via Snowbasin Road (SR-226). Snowbasin
Road intersects Trappers Loop Road (SR-167), which provides access north to Huntsville and
Ogden (via Ogden Canyon Road (SR-39)) and south to Salt Lake City (via Interstate 84). Much
of the property along Trappers Loop Road and Snowbasin Road is within the ownership
boundary of the Snowbasin Resort Company. The Snowbasin Resort Master Plan proposes
strategic development of these lands, with care taken to preserve the natural beauty, view
corridors, and sensitive lands within the region.

The proposed development would expand the Earl's Lodge base area and construct a second
resort base in the Strawberry Park area, with ski lift and gondola connections between the two
areas. These bases would be developed as mixed-use villages, complete with lodging, retail,
restaurants and skier support services. Residential neighborhoods with a mix of townhomes,
condominiums and single family homes would be built around both base areas, as well as on
the east side of Trappers Loop Road opposite the ski area. A residential and commercial
development would also be developed at the north end of Trappers Loop Road near the SR-39
intersection to serve resort guests and the Ogden Valley community. Finally, a smaller
residential development may be built on the northwest side of the Pineview Reservoir.

Together, these general development areas have been divided into seven development areas,
labeled A thru H for design and planning consideration. Table ES-1 lists the various land uses
planned for each development area.

Due to the large scale of the project, a broad view of the traffic impacts was taken for the Master
Plan. The traffic analysis assessed highway operations on Trappers Loop Road from the I-84
interchange to Ogden Canyon Road and Ogden Canyon Road between Trappers Loop Road
and SR-158, as well as major intersections along both roads.

Existing traffic counts were taken on the Thursday and Saturday of the Martin Luther King, Jr.
holiday to capture volumes on a typical winter weekday and a peak weekend ski day. Future
background traffic projections throughout the study area were derived from these counts,
historic Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) average daily traffic (ADT) counts, and
traffic projections from the Powder Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study (Fehr & Peers,
2005).

The Master Plan trip generation is based on trip rates published in Trip Generation, 8th Edition
(Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2008), the nationally recognized standard, and utilizes
trip-making assumptions that are based on observations from several other ski areas in the
western United States. Two additional key trip-making assumptions were used to develop traffic
projections: 1) the commercial development at the resort functions primarily as a service to day
skiers, resort guests and local residents, so the majority of commercial trips would remain
internal to the resort, and 2) as the resort grows, the number of day skiers coming from Ogden,
Salt Lake City and other off-mountain areas will generally remain the same as today; i.e., the
increase in skiers on the mountain would be a result of the increased number of guests and
residents staying at the resort rather than from more day visits from the Salt Lake Basin.

Resort Trip Generation
(Refer to Tables 6 and 7)

The following highlights the results of the resort trip generation analysis for the winter season:

      Overall, the resort would generate approximately 30,200 vehicle trips on a peak
       weekend ski day. Of these, approximately 11,200 trips are generated by the
       development in and around the ski area (development areas A, B and C on the west
       side of Trappers Loop Road), 5,500 trips are generated by the residential development
       east of the ski area (development areas D, E, and F on the east side of Trappers Loop
       Road), 13,400 trips are generated by the predominantly retail development at the Ogden




                                                                                                     Page ii
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                             Transportation Element


       Canyon Road/Trappers Loop Road intersection (development area G), and 140 are
       generated by the reduced residential development at the Pineview Reservoir
       (development area H).

      On weekdays, the resort would generate approximately 17,700 vehicle trips. Of these,
       Area ABC generates 5,800 trips, Area DEF generates 2,900 trips, Area G generates
       8,900 trips and Area H generates 75 trips.

      An internal shuttle service between the ski area bases and the residential developments
       in Areas ABC and DEF would be available so resort guests won't need to rely on their
       personal vehicle to access the ski area. The shuttle is anticipated to reduce vehicle
       travel within and between those areas by approximately 4,100 trips per day on the
       weekend and 2,700 trips on the weekday.

      The retail in Area G would primarily provide additional commercial services for resort
       guests and residents (e.g., a grocery store, office space, etc.), but would also provide a
       shopping destination that would appeal to residents living elsewhere in the community.
       It is anticipated that on the weekends approximately 60 percent of the retail trips
       generated by Area G would come from the other resort areas (ABC, DEF and H) with the
       remaining demand fulfilled by residents of Huntsville and Mountain Green. On
       weekdays approximately 40 percent of the retail traffic would be from the resort and 60
       percent from Huntsville and Mountain Green.

Traffic Impacts

The following highlights the results of the intersection and highway level of service analyses,
and the recommended improvement measures identified from these analyses:

Existing Intersections (listed from south to north)

I-84 Off Ramp to Old Trappers Loop Highway

In the morning at this intersection the northbound movement would operate at LOS F and in the
afternoon the southbound movement would operate at LOS E. Both of these movements are
forecast to have extremely low volumes, however (five vehicles per hour southbound and less
than five vehicles per hour northbound), because there is virtually no development or
developable land south of the interstate, so no improvements to the existing lane geometry are
recommended at this location.

I-84 On Ramp from Old Trappers Loop Highway

At this intersection the northbound movement would operate at LOS C in the morning and LOS
B in the afternoon. These represent acceptable levels of service, so no improvements to the
existing lane geometry are recommended at this location.




                                                                                            Page iii
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                             Transportation Element


It should be noted that UDOT is considering replacing the current split diamond configuration of
the I-84 Mountain Green interchange with a full diamond interchange somewhere between the
two existing overpasses. Morgan County and Mountain Green both support the proposed
concept and Snowbasin Resort supports the idea as well, recognizing that it is not required for
development at Snowbasin. However, it should be noted that the current interchange
configuration adequately accommodates Snowbasin traffic and that development of the resort is
not dependent on interchange improvements.

Trappers Loop Road (SR-167) / Old Trappers Loop Highway

This intersection near Mountain Green would operate at LOS F in the long-range future, either
with or without the Snowbasin Resort development. A signal was identified for this location as
part of the Powder Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study, and therefore was assumed to be
implemented in the background analysis. With a signal and the addition of Snowbasin buildout
traffic, the intersection would operate at LOS B in the morning and LOS C in the afternoon. No
additions to the current lane geometry would be required, but the eastbound left turn lane would
need to be lengthened to accommodate the increased traffic volumes for that movement.

SR-167 / SR-226

This intersection currently serves as the primary access to Snowbasin Resort. In the future, the
intersection would provide the primary access to Areas A and B, including the Earl's Lodge base
area, which includes one of the main parking lots for day skiers. The intersection would require
signalization by build-out of the resort and would operate at LOS B or better with a signal during
both the morning and afternoon peak periods. No additions to the current lane geometry would
be required, but each of the existing turn lanes (northbound left, southbound right and
eastbound left) would need to be lengthened to accommodate the increased traffic volumes at
the resort.

SR-167 / SR-39

This intersection at Huntsville would operate at LOS F in the long-range future either with or
without the Snowbasin Resort development. A signal was identified for this location as part of
the background analysis. With a signal and the addition of Snowbasin traffic the intersection
would operate at LOS B during both the morning and afternoon peak periods. No additions to
the current lane geometry would be required, but each of the existing turn lanes (northbound
left, eastbound right and westbound left) would need to be lengthened to accommodate the
increased traffic volumes for those movements.

SR-39 / SR-226

This intersection provides access to residences along Old Snowbasin Road. Due to the closure
of this road during the winter as an access to Snowbasin Resort, no additional volumes are
anticipated at this intersection. The intersection would operate at LOS B or better for all
movements. No changes in the lane geometry would be required.




                                                                                           Page iv
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                              Transportation Element


SR-39 / SR-158

This intersection provides access to residences along the west side of the Pineview Reservoir,
and serves as a part of the access route to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The intersection
would operate at LOS F in the long range future either with or without the Snowbasin Resort
development. A signal was identified for this location as part of the Powder Mountain Ski Resort
Traffic Impact Study, since that resort has a much more significant impact on traffic operations
there (very little Snowbasin traffic would use this intersection, particularly the SR-158 approach).
With the signal and the addition of Snowbasin buildout traffic, the intersection would operate at
LOS E in the morning and LOS F in the afternoon on weekends, which is the same level of
service as that reported in the Powder Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study. The Powder
Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study further identifies a public awareness campaign and
alternate route identification using an ATMS system to reduce delays at the intersection. The
proposed system would provide automated signs that notify drivers prior to the SR-158 / SR-162
intersection that the SR-39 / SR-158 intersection is experiencing an overcapacity condition, and
suggest the alternate route. The system would be triggered by queue detectors at the SR-158 /
SR-39 intersection.

New Intersections (listed from south to north)

SR-167 / Intersection C/D1

This intersection would serve as the primary access to the new ski area base in development
Area C as well as the primary access to the residential development Areas D and E. It is the
second of two new intersections requiring signalization at build-out of Snowbasin Resort. With a
signal the intersection would operate at LOS B or better during both the morning and afternoon
peak periods. In addition to signalization, the intersection would require left and right turn
deceleration lanes in each direction of SR-167, and left turn lanes on both side street
approaches.

SR-167 / Intersection D2

This intersection would serve as a secondary access point to Areas E and F. It would be stop
sign controlled on the side street approach, with left turns out of the site operating at LOS D in
the morning and LOS E in the afternoon. Left and right turn deceleration lanes and acceleration
lanes would be required in each direction of SR-167, as would a left turn lane on the side street
approach.

SR-167 / Intersection E/F1

This intersection would serve as the primary access point to Area F and a secondary access to
Area E. It would be stop sign controlled on the side street approach, with left turns out of the
site operating at LOS D in the morning and LOS F in the afternoon. Left and right turn
deceleration lanes and acceleration lanes would be required in each direction of SR-167, as
would a left turn lane on the side street approach.




                                                                                              Page v
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                             Transportation Element


SR-167 / Intersection G4

This intersection would serve as the second of two access points to the residential portions of
Area G on the east side of SR-167. It would be stop sign controlled on the side street
approaches, with westbound left turns out of the site operating at LOS C in the morning and
LOS D in the afternoon; all other movements would operate at LOS B or better during both the
morning and afternoon peaks. A left turn deceleration lane would be required on SR-167.

SR-167 / Intersection G3

This intersection would serve as the primary access point to a residential portion of Area G on
the west side of SR-167. It would be stop sign controlled on the side street approach, with all
movements operating at LOS E or better during both the morning and afternoon peaks. A left
turn deceleration lane would be required on SR-167.

SR-167 / Intersection G2

This intersection would serve as the primary access point to a second residential portion of Area
G on the west side of SR-167. It would be stop sign controlled on the side street approach, with
all movements operating at LOS D or better during both the morning and afternoon peaks. A
left turn deceleration lane would be required on SR-167.

SR-167 / Intersection G1

This intersection would serve as the primary access to the retail and residential development in
Area G and is one of two new intersections requiring signalization in the proposed build-out of
Snowbasin Resort. Without a signal the side street left turns at the intersection would operate at
LOS F in both the morning and afternoon peak periods and would experience significant
queuing and delays in the afternoon. With a signal the intersection would operate at LOS A
during both the morning and afternoon peak periods. In addition to signalization, the intersection
would require left and right turn deceleration lanes in each direction of SR-167, and separate
right turn lanes on both side street approaches.

SR-167 Highway Level of Service

Two-lane highway level of service analyses were conducted for the peak travel directions on
SR-167 both north and south of the Snowbasin Resort.

The south section of SR-167 is projected to carry 18,800 vpd at build-out of the resort. At these
volumes the uphill direction would operate at LOS A during the morning peak (due in large part
to the continuous climbing lane) while the downhill direction would operate at LOS E during the
afternoon peak. The volume-to-capacity ratio for the downhill direction would be 0.67 in the
afternoon, (i.e., the projected volume would be approximately 67 percent of the capacity of the
roadway during the peak hour), so it would appear that the roadway would not require an
additional downhill lane.




                                                                                           Page vi
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                             Transportation Element


The north section of SR-167 is projected to carry 20,400 vpd at build-out of the resort. At these
volumes the uphill direction would operate at LOS A during the morning peak (again due to the
continuous climbing lane) while the downhill direction would operate at LOS E during the
afternoon peak. The volume-to-capacity ratio for the downhill direction would be 0.70 in the
afternoon, however, so it would appear that no additional lanes would be necessary on that
section, either.

Interim Development Phasing and Roadway Improvement Schedule

Traffic volumes at Snowbasin Resort would increase over time as the resort is developed, and
as a result, not all of the above roadway improvements would be needed immediately. Overall,
the resort would be developed in 16 distinct phases. To determine when the various roadway
improvements would be needed, interim transportation analyses were conducted for three
interim phases, each representing a significant development or transportation need milestone:
completion of Phases 1-3 (completion of approximately 1/3 of the base village in Area C and 2/3
of the Area G commercial), 4-6 (50 percent completion of the Area A base village, full
completion of Area F, Area G commercial and Area H), and 9-15 (buildout of the project). Table
ES-2 shows projected development levels for each interim year.

Table ES-3 shows the recommended phasing plan for the road system improvements based on
the above development schedule. As the table indicates, the existing road system could
accommodate project growth in the near term, with the first road system improvement
(signalization of the SR-167/SR-39 intersection) needed at completion of Phase 3. By the
completion of Phase 6, the remaining four additional intersections would need signalization: SR-
167/SR-226, SR-167/G2, SR-167/C/D1, SR-167/Old Trappers Loop Highway.

  I.     EXISTING CONDITIONS
  A.     Roadway System

  Major roadways that serve the Snowbasin Resort area are illustrated on Figure 1. During the
  winter the Old Snowbasin Road coming in from the north from Ogden Canyon Road is no longer
  plowed, so the only access to Snowbasin Resort is from Trappers Loop Road (SR-167).
  Trappers Loop Road is a two-lane rural highway with an additional climbing lane in the uphill
  direction for each approach to Snowbasin Road. To the north Trappers Loop Road provides
  access to Huntsville and Ogden via Ogden Canyon Road (SR-39), while to the south Trappers
  Loop Road provides access to Salt Lake City via Interstate 84. Due to a lack of lodging at the
  hill, all Snowbasin visitors are currently day skiers, the majority of which live in Ogden or Salt
  Lake City.

  B.     Traffic Volumes

  Daily traffic volumes along SR-167, SR-226, and SR-39 for the winter season were collected in
  January 2009, on a typical weekday and on the Saturday of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The
  later was chosen because skier visits on that day are typically around the 10th highest of the
  year, so it provides a good representation of traffic conditions on a peak ski day for the season.
  The existing weekday and Saturday traffic volumes are shown in Table 1 and on Figures 2 and
  3. As shown on the table and figures, daily traffic volumes along SR-167 range from 3,800
  vehicles per day (vpd) south of the SR-39 intersection to 6,600 vpd west of Mountain Green.
  SR-226 carries approximately 4,200 vpd west of SR-167 and SR-39 carries approximately
  4,500 vpd west of SR-167. All volumes represent moderate traffic levels that are within the
  capacity of two lane roads. Appendix A contains the raw traffic count data.

C.     Intersection Operations

Traffic operations within the study area were evaluated according to techniques documented in
the Highway Capacity Manual, (Transportation Research Board, 2000) (HCM-2000). Level of
service (LOS) is a qualitative measure of traffic operational conditions, based on roadway
capacity and vehicle delay. Levels of service are described by a letter designation ranging from
LOS A to LOS F, with LOS A representing the best possible conditions and LOS F representing
congested conditions. For signalized intersections, level of service is calculated for the entire
intersection; for unsignalized intersections, levels of service are calculated for movements which
must yield right-of-way to other traffic movements.

Existing levels of service are shown on Figures 4 and 5 for weekday and Saturday conditions,
respectively. All intersections are currently stop sign or yield controlled and all individual
movements currently operate at LOS D or better. Appendix B contains the existing level of
service worksheets.

D.     Safety Assessment

Crash records were obtained from the Utah Department of Transportation from 2005  2008 for
state highways in the Snowbasin project area. Records were collected for the following highway
segments:

a.     SR-39, Milepost 9 - 19
b.     SR-158, Milepost 0 - 4.33
c.     SR-167, Milepost 0 - 11.05
d.     SR-226, Milepost 0 - 3

The records were then analyzed to determine crash patterns along each corridor in order to
determine roadway sections requiring further review for improvements which could help to
reduce accident frequency and severity. The Utah Department of Transportation classifies each
accident type into one of five categories based on the severity of the crash.

1.     No Injury/Property Damage Only
2.     Possible Injury
3.     Non-Incapacitating Injury
4.     Incapacitating Injury
5.     Fatal

Special consideration was given to accidents which occurred in category four and five due to the
severity of these accident types. Each of these highway segments is summarized in the
following sections. Included is the calculation of the average crash rate. This value was
determined by calculating how many crashes occurred per one million vehicle miles traveled.

SR-39, Milepost 9 - 19

SR-39 at milepost 9 represents the mouth of Ogden Canyon continuing to milepost 19 which
represents the termination of the study area at Huntsville. This segment of SR-39 provides
access the Snowbasin Resort from Ogden. Between mileposts 9 and 19 there were 208 total
accidents, including 20 with a severity rating of four and 2 with a severity rating of five. The fatal
accidents occurred at milepost 10.06, resulting from a head-on accident, and at milepost 15, as
a result of a single car accident. In total, there were 11 head-on accidents including a
concentration of seven accidents between mileposts 9.50 and 11.50. In addition, 9 of 20
incapacitating accidents occurred between these same mileposts representing a significant
concentration of accidents along the segment. This two mile section should be reviewed for
safety concerns.

The average crash rate was calculated to be 3.03 accidents per one million miles traveled for
the segment.

SR-158, Milepost 0 - 4.33

SR-158 begins at the junction with SR-39 at the Pineview Reservoir and heads north to Eden.
This segment of SR-158 ends at the junction with SR-162 and represents the portion of SR-158
along which Area H development is proposed. Between mileposts 0 and 4.33 there were 47
total accidents, including four with a severity rating of four; there were no fatal accidents along
this segment during the study horizon. Two of the incapacitating injury accidents occurred at
intersections, one resulting in a head on accident and the other in an angled accident. The other
serious accidents were a rear end accident and an angled accident. An examination of all
crashes occurring in the segment revealed two primary areas of higher accident frequency. The
first area occurred at the intersection of SR-158 and SR-39 and represented a concentration of
rear end accidents, likely due to the junction. The second area occurred between mileposts 3.60
and 3.85 and represented a higher concentration of intersections throughout the segment
leading to more conflict points and more accidents.

The average crash rate was calculated to be 1.58 accidents per one million miles traveled for
the segment.

SR-167, Milepost 0 - 11.05

SR-167 begins at the junction with Interstate 84 and heads north ending at the junction with SR-
39. This segment represents the primary access for all destinations within the Snowbasin
Resort as well as provides a connection between Mountain Green, to the south and Huntsville,
to the north. Additionally, coming from the south and beginning at Mountain Green, the road
ascends steep grades to SR-226 and the county line between Weber and Morgan counties, and
descends back to SR-39. Along each uphill section there is an additional climbing lane.
Between mileposts 0 and 11.05 there were 73 total accidents, including 13 with a severity rating
of four; there were no fatal accidents along this segment during the study horizon. Of these 13
accidents, eleven were single car accidents, one was an angled accident occurring at the
intersection with Interstate 84, and one was a sideswipe same direction accident. The majority
of accidents along the segment were single vehicle accidents, 59 of 73, and did not occur in any
significant concentrations.




                                                                                                Page 8
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                           Transportation Element


The average crash rate was calculated to be 1.81 accidents per one million miles traveled for
the segment.

SR-226, Milepost 0 - 3

SR-226 begins at the junction with SR-167 and heads west ending at the existing entrance to
the Snowbasin Resort. SR-226 provides the primary access to Areas A and B, and secondary
access to Area C. Between mileposts 0 and 3 there were 17 total accidents, including two with a
severity rating of four; there were no fatal accidents along this segment during the study
horizon. Each of the incapacitating injury accidents occurring within this segment were single
car accidents. There was no concentration of accidents within the study segment.

The average crash rate was calculated to be 2.68 accidents per one million miles traveled for
the segment.

II.    RESORT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS
This section documents the processes used to develop traffic projections for the Snowbasin
Resort Master Plan.

A.     Background

The Snowbasin Resort Master Development Plan Update was completed in February, and
defines future operational improvements anticipated for Snowbasin Ski Area. The Development
Plan was developed alongside the Snowbasin Area Plans, which was originally completed in
May 2008. Together, these documents represent a vision for the transition of Snowbasin Resort
from a day-skier destination to a year-round resort.

The trip forecasts for the project is based on trip rates published in Trip Generation, 8th Edition
(Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2008), the nationally recognized standard, and utilizes
trip-making assumptions that are based on observations from several other ski areas in the
western United States. Two additional key trip-making assumptions were used when
forecasting resort trips: 1) the commercial development functions primarily as a service to day
skiers, resort guest and local residents so the majority of commercial trips will remain internal to
the resort, and 2) as the resort grows, the number of day skiers coming from Ogden, Salt Lake
city and other off-mountain areas will generally remain the same as today; i.e., the increase in
skiers on the mountain will be a result of the increased number of guests and residents staying
at the resort rather than increased day visits from the Salt Lake Basin.

B.     Resort Trip Generation

The Snowbasin Resort expansion has been divided into eight key development areas (labeled A
to H) and each has been uniquely defined by the Snowbasin Area Plans. Table 2 summarizes
the land uses proposed for each area.

1. Dwelling units
2. 1,000 square feet

Due to natural grouping of these areas and proximity to access points, the eight areas were
consolidated into four groups for the traffic evaluation: ABC, DEF, G, and H.




                                                                                                  Page 10
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                              Transportation Element


Trip generation forecasts for Snowbasin were based on three key elements: 1) overnight
population projections derived from the proposed lodging/residential densities; 2) the projected
employment base; and 3) the proposed commercial densities. In general, trips in or out of the
resort would include day-skier trips, employee trips, and overnight guests and residents' non-
skiing related trips. The follow provides further details on each of the key elements.

Overnight Guest/Resident Trips. Overnight guests and residents represent those visitors to
the resort that are staying within the properties of Snowbasin. These overnight visitors would
represent a significant number of skiers for the resort, so to determine these skier forecasts, the
residential land uses within the resort were first broken down by single family or multi-family and
owned versus rented, and then an average number of bedrooms was applied to each multi-
family unit. Next, weekday and weekend occupancy rates, based on information from other ski
resorts and discussions with the project team, were applied to each property type. Table 3
shows the projected occupancy rates for weekday and weekend conditions.

Table 3.        Snowbasin Residential Occupancy Rates Summary

                                 Occupancy Rate
           Land Use
                                Weekday Weekend
Single Family (Private) (du1)    25%       50%
Townhome (Rent) (du1)            50%       90%
Condominium (Rent) (du1)         50%       90%
Townhome (Private) (du1)         25%       50%
Condominium (Private) (du1)      25%       50%
Hotel (rooms)                    50%       90%
1. Dwelling Units

Finally, the above information was used in conjunction with information from other ski resorts on
the typical number of skiers per unit or bed to project the total number of skiers from the
overnight guest and resident population. Table 4 provides the weekend skier forecasts for each
development area and lodging type.

Since Area A and Area C represent slopeside lodging and Area B would have a lift that
connects it to the Earl's Lodge base, and all three areas would have an internal transit shuttle, it
was assumed that all of the skier trips from Area ABC would either be walking or transit, so
there would be no skier vehicle trips generated from those areas onto Trappers Loop Road or
any other external road. Similarly, transit service is planned between Area DEF and the ski
area bases, so skier vehicle traffic crossing Trappers Loop Road between DEF and the ski area
was reduced by 50 percent to account for transit use (based on observations of transit use for
near-slopeside accommodations at other ski resorts). No transit reductions were assumed for
skier trips from Area G, since it is not yet known whether transit services would be provided
between that Area and the ski area bases.

For those skiers that do choose to drive, a vehicle occupancy of 2.0 skiers per vehicle was used
to project traffic volumes. This occupancy is based on the existing vehicle occupancy at
Snowbasin.

Day Skiers. As mentioned previously, it is anticipated that the number of day skiers at
Snowbasin will remain roughly the same in the future as there are today. The trips associated
with these day skiers is already reflected in the existing traffic volumes so no additional
adjustments were taken for day skier visits.

It should be noted that anecdotal evidence from other ski areas operators suggest that some
current day skiers convert to overnight guests once accommodations are provided at the resort.
However, for Snowbasin it was assumed that little to no conversion would occur so that the
traffic analysis is based on a more conservative traffic condition.

Projected Employment Base. The projected employment base includes all new employees
working at Snowbasin Resort, either for the ski area or for one of the rental, hotel or commercial
properties at the resort. The existing ski area employees are not included in this analysis as
they have already been accounted for in the existing daily traffic volume counts. Table 5 shows
the projected employment summary at full buildout of the resort.

The employment forecasts in Table 5 represent the total employees needed if every residence
and commercial property were to be operating at full capacity. To account for typical occupancy
conditions, the rental lodging and hotel employment forecasts were multiplied by the occupancy
rates listed in Table 3.

A vehicle occupancy rate of 1.6 employees per vehicle was used to project traffic volumes for
employees. This occupancy is based on employee surveys collected at other ski resorts.

Commercial Densities. The commercial land uses planned for Areas ABC and DEF would
provide many of the services required by on-mountain guests (shopping, restaurants, etc.), so
almost all of the activity generated by these uses is anticipated to come from either day skiers or
overnight guests staying in Areas ABC and DEF. The only external traffic associated with those
properties would be that generated by employees and by deliveries and other service needs.

The commercial uses in Area G, on the other hand, would provide services such as a grocery
store that would appeal to a broader market beyond the resort. As such, while a significant
portion of the demand from that area would come from the residents and guests of the
Snowbasin Resort, its customer base will also include residents of Huntsville, Mountain Green
and the surrounding area. To determine the appropriate split between resort patrons and non-
resort patrons, the proportion of trips generated by the resort's residential population was
determined based on internal capture percentages and procedures outlined in the Trip
Generation Handbook, (Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), 2004), with the remaining
trips assigned to the non-resort area population.

Total Trip Generation

Using the above assumptions and procedures, vehicle trips were forecast for each of the four
development areas as well as for the resort as a whole. Table 6 summarizes the trip generation
for the resort on a weekday, and Table 7 summarizes trip generation on the weekend.

C.     Resort Vehicle-Trip Distribution and Assignment

Trips from the Snowbasin Resort were assigned to the external road system by considering the
internal attractions between the development areas as well as the external attractions of the
surrounding communities. Table 8 defines the trip distribution for each of the general land uses
according to the development areas.

        1. The remaining 40 percent of the trips from Area H were assigned to the north, out of the study area.

        Residential Trips. For the residential trip assignment, first, skier vehicle trips were separated
        from the total residential trips and assigned to Area ABC. Next, the remaining vehicle trips were
        designated a trip type; 64 percent were designated internal retail trips (i.e., trips to retail in
        another resort development area) 16 percent were designated as off mountain retail and 20
        were designated as other off mountain destinations. Finally, each trip type was assigned to final
        destinations; i.e., of the 20 percent off mountain residential trips, 75 percent were assigned to
        Salt Lake City and 25 percent were assigned to Ogden.

        As noted previously, because Area H is located in a distinct area away from the rest of the
        resort, trips from it were assigned separately; 40 percent were assigned to the north, 20 percent
        to Ogden, 10 percent to Huntsville, 15 percent to ABC, and 15 percent to G.

        Retail Trips. As noted previously, the patronage for the retail developments in ABC and DEF
        would come from either day skiers or overnight guests and residents staying in those areas, so
        the only off-site trips would be made by employees and service vehicles. Those trips were
        assigned 75 percent to Salt Lake City and 25 percent to Ogden. For Area G the demand from
        Areas ABC and DEF were accounted for in the "internal retail" residential trips and the demand
        from Area H was identified in it's trip assignment. The remaining retail trips from Area G were
        assigned 80 percent to Huntsville and 20 percent to Mountain Green.

Ski Area/Lodging Employee Trips. Ski area employee and lodging employee trips were
assigned 70 percent to Salt Lake City, 20 percent to Ogden and 10 percent to Huntsville.

Office Trips. All office trips were assigned to Huntsville.

Figures 6 and 7 show the resulting site-generated weekday and Saturday traffic volumes at
buildout of Snowbasin Resort.

D.     Density Transfer From Area H

As noted previously, Area H's location on the northwest side of the Pineview Reservoir places it
in quite a bit different location than the other seven Snowbasin development parcels. Under the
current land use zoning designation, up to 572 multifamily units could be developed on that site,
which would add a significant volume of to SR 158 on the west side of the reservoir. Limiting
traffic on that road is important because the Powder Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study
has already identified that the SR 39/SR 158 would experience LOS F conditions with the
buildout of that resort. As a result of this, Snowbasin has elected to minimize the development
of that property, and transfer that density to the other seven parcels that are closer to the ski
area. Table 9 shows how this density transfer will help minimize traffic growth on SR 158,
reducing trips from the parcel by approximately 760 trips per day on the weekday (91 percent)
and by approximately 1,480 trips per day on the weekend (also 91 percent) over what could
potentially be generated by that parcel.

III.     TRAFFIC IMPACTS
A.       Background Traffic Volume Projections

Background traffic volumes were derived from historical daily traffic volumes along SR-167 and
SR-39. The growth factor was based on historical growth trends from 2003 to 2009 (Table 10).
Based on the historical data, traffic on the roadways in the vicinity of the project is anticipated to
grow at a rate of 2.5 percent per year.

                                                  2003             2009            Annual

                                                                 SR-167 Growth      2.7%
SR-39           SR-226 (Snow Basin Rd)            3,040            3,545            2.6%
                SR-167 (Trappers Loop Rd)         3,040            3,495            2.4%
                                                                  SR-39 Growth      2.5%
                                                                 Overall Growth     2.5%

For the purpose of the traffic analysis, the year 2030 was selected as a buildout analysis
scenario, since it represent the typical 20-year future design horizon. The background traffic
volume projections were calculated for 2030 by first removing the existing ski area traffic from
Snowbasin Resort and Powder Mountain Resort, then applying the annual growth rate to the
remaining background traffic, then adding the existing Snowbasin Resort ski volumes and the
anticipated 2030 Powder Mountain ski volumes back into the newly calculated background
volumes to determine the 2030 background traffic volume projections.

Figures 8 and 9 show the 2030 background weekday and Saturday traffic volumes. Note that
for the purpose of the traffic analysis it was assumed that a second base parking lot would be
constructed in Area C as part of background conditions (for a better apples to apples traffic
comparison of with and without expansion operations), and that some of the existing ski area
traffic would shift to the new lot.

B.       Background Traffic Operations

Background operational conditions were analyzed at each of the study intersections based on
procedures documented in the Highway Capacity Manual, (Transportation Research Board,
Third Edition, 2000). Figures 10 and 11 show the projected levels of service, lane geometry and
signalization requirements for the study area intersections under 2030 weekday and weekend
background traffic conditions, respectively. As the figures indicate, three intersections would
require signalization; SR-39/SR-158 northwest of the project area, SH 39/Trappers Loop Road
near Huntsville, and SR-167/Old Trappers Loop Highway at Mountain Green.

The signal at the SR-39/SR-158 intersection was also identified in the Powder Mountain Ski
Resort Traffic Impact Study. It is projected to operate at LOS C or better during the week and at
LOS D on Saturday mornings, but would operate at LOS F during the Saturday afternoon peak
hour. The poor level of service during the weekend afternoon peak was also documented in the
Powder Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study and reflects build-out of Powder Mountain as
part of the background traffic assumptions for this analysis.

The signals at SH 39/Trappers Loop Road and SR-167/Old Trappers Loop Highway are both
projected operate at LOS A for all peak periods on both the weekday and weekend.

All remaining intersections are projected to remain stop sign or yield controlled, and all
individual movements would operate at LOS C or better during the week. On the weekends all
individual movements at the unsignalized intersections would operate at LOS D or better, with
the exception of the northbound movement at the I-84 Eastbound Ramp intersection, which
would operate at LOS E in the afternoon peak. It is not uncommon, however, for movements
from driveways and side streets along higher volume roadways to experience poor levels of
service. As noted in Chapter 17 (Unsignalized Intersections) of the Highway Capacity Manual
(2000):

       In evaluating the overall performance of two-way stop control intersections, it is
       important to consider measures of effectiveness in addition to delay, such as v/c
       ratios for individual movements, average queue lengths, and 95th percentile
       queue lengths. By focusing on a single measure of effectiveness for the worst
       movement only, such as delay for the minor street left turn, users may make less
       effective traffic control decisions.

At the I-84 Eastbound Ramp intersection the northbound traffic volumes would be less than five
vehicles per hour, the v/c ratio would be 0.02 and the projected 95th percentile queue length
would be one vehicle, so no improvements would appear to be necessary at that location. It is
worth noting, however, that UDOT is considering replacing the current split diamond
interchange with a full diamond configuration located somewhere between the two overpasses,
and that this new interchange would eliminate the movement with the poor level of service.
Morgan County and Mountain Green both support the idea of a new interchange.

Appendix C contains the background level of service worksheets.

C.     Total Traffic Volume Projections

Build-out site generated traffic volumes were added to the 2030 background traffic volumes to
estimate the 2030 build-out total traffic volumes. Figures 12 and 13 show the 2030 total
weekday and Saturday traffic volumes, while Figures 14 and 15 show the lane geometry and
levels of service for weekday and Saturday conditions.

D.     Total Traffic Operations

Substantial lane geometry and signalization changes would be required for the proposed
development of Snowbasin Resort at several existing and newly proposed access points. The
following highlights the traffic operations and improvement needs at each study intersection at
full buildout of the project.

Existing Intersections (Listed from south to north)

I-84 Off Ramp to Old Trappers Loop Highway

In the morning at this intersection the northbound movement would operate at LOS F and in the
afternoon the southbound movement would operate at LOS E. Both of these movements are
forecast to have extremely low volumes, however (five vehicles per hour southbound and less
than five vehicles per hour northbound), because there is virtually no development or
developable land south of the interstate, so no improvements to the existing lane geometry is
recommended at this location.

As noted in the Future Background Conditions section, UDOT is considering replacing the
current split diamond configuration with a full diamond interchange somewhere between the two
existing overpasses. Morgan County and Mountain Green both support the proposed concept
and Snowbasin Resort is not opposed to the idea, but would like input on the design should the
project move to that stage. However, it should be noted that the current interchange
configuration adequately accommodates Snowbasin traffic and that development of the resort is
not dependent on interchange improvements.

I-84 On Ramp from Old Trappers Loop Highway

At this intersection the northbound movement would operate at LOS C in the morning and LOS
B in the afternoon. These represent acceptable levels of service, so no improvements to the
existing lane geometry is recommended at this location.

Trappers Loop Road (SR-167) / Old Trappers Loop Highway

This intersection near Mountain Green would operate at LOS F in the long-range future, either
with or without the Snowbasin Resort development. A signal was identified for this location as
part of the Powder Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study, and therefore was assumed to be
implemented in the background analysis. With a signal and the addition of Snowbasin buildout
traffic, the intersection would operate at LOS B in the morning and LOS C in the afternoon. No
additions to the current lane geometry would be required, but the eastbound left turn lane would
need to be lengthened to accommodate the increased traffic volumes for that movement.

SR-167 / SR-226

This intersection currently serves as the primary access to Snowbasin Resort. In the future, the
intersection would provide the primary access to Areas A and B, including the Earl's Lodge base
area, which includes one of the main parking lots for day skiers. The intersection would require
signalization by build-out of the resort and would operate at LOS B or better with a signal during
both the morning and afternoon peak periods. No additions to the current lane geometry would
be required, but each of the existing turn lanes (northbound left, southbound right and
eastbound left) would need to be lengthened to accommodate the increased traffic volumes at
the resort.




                                                                                           Page 30

SR-167 / SR-39

This intersection at Huntsville would operate at LOS F in the long-range future either with or
without the Snowbasin Resort development. A signal was identified for this location as part of
the background analysis. With a signal and the addition of Snowbasin traffic the intersection
would operate at LOS B during both the morning and afternoon peak periods. No additions to
the current lane geometry would be required, but each of the existing turn lanes (northbound
left, eastbound right and westbound left) would need to be lengthened to accommodate the
increased traffic volumes for those movements.

SR-39 / SR-226

This intersection provides access to residences along Old Snowbasin Road. Due to the closure
of this road during the winter as an access to Snowbasin Resort, no additional volumes are
anticipated at this intersection. The intersection would operate at LOS B or better for all
movements. No changes in the lane geometry would be required.

SR-39 / SR-158

This intersection provides access to residences along the west side of the Pineview Reservoir,
and serves as a part of the access route to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The intersection
would operate at LOS F in the long range future either with or without the Snowbasin Resort
development. A signal was identified for this location as part of the Powder Mountain Ski Resort
Traffic Impact Study, since that resort has a much more significant impact on traffic operations
there (very little Snowbasin traffic would use this intersection, particularly the SR-158 approach).
With the signal and the addition of Snowbasin buildout traffic, the intersection would operate at
LOS E in the morning and LOS F in the afternoon on weekends, which is the same level of
service as that reported in the Powder Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study. The Powder
Mountain Ski Resort Traffic Impact Study further identifies a public awareness campaign and
alternate route identification using an ATMS system to reduce delays at the intersection. The
proposed system would provide automated signs that notify drivers prior to the SR-158 / SR-162
intersection that the SR-39 / SR-158 intersection is experiencing an overcapacity condition, and
suggest the alternate route. The system would be triggered by queue detectors at the SR-158 /
SR-39 intersection.

The majority of Snowbasin-related traffic at this intersection would be through volumes on SR-
39 travelling between the resort and Ogden (i.e., the major street movement). Only Area H
traffic would use the SR-158 (minor street) approach, and as noted in the Resort Traffic
Generation section, Snowbasin has elected to transfer much of the allowed density on that
parcel to other development areas in an effort to minimize the traffic impacts to that roadway
(only 50 of the 572 allow units in Area H would be developed).

New Intersections (listed from south to north)

SR-167 / Intersection C/D1

This intersection would serve as the primary access to the new ski area base in development
Area C as well as the primary access to the residential development Areas D and E. It is the
second of two new intersections requiring signalization at build-out of Snowbasin Resort. With a
signal the intersection would operate at LOS B or better during both the morning and afternoon
peak periods. In addition to signalization, the intersection would require left and right turn
deceleration lanes in each direction of SR-167, and left turn lanes on both side street
approaches.

SR-167 / Intersection D2

This intersection would serve as a secondary access point to areas E and F. It would be stop
sign controlled on the side street approach, with left turns out of the site operating at LOS D in
the morning and LOS E in the afternoon. Left and right turn deceleration lanes and acceleration
lanes would be required in each direction of SR-167, as would a left turn lane on the side street
approach.

SR-167 / Intersection E/F1

This intersection would serve as the primary access point to Area F and a secondary access to
Area E. It would be stop sign controlled on the side street approach, with left turns out of the
site operating at LOS D in the morning and LOS F in the afternoon. Left and right turn
deceleration lanes and acceleration lanes would be required in each direction of SR-167, as
would a left turn lane on the side street approach.

SR-167 / Intersection G4

This intersection would serve as the second of two access points to the residential portions of
Area G on the east side of SR-167. It would be stop sign controlled on the side street
approaches, with westbound left turns out of the site operating at LOS C in the morning and
LOS D in the afternoon; all other movements would operate at LOS B or better during both the
morning and afternoon peaks. A left turn deceleration lane would be required on SR-167.

SR-167 / Intersection G3

This intersection would serve as the primary access point to a parcel of approximately 45
residential units of Area G on the east side of SR-167. It would be stop sign controlled on the
side street approach, with all movements operating at LOS E or better during both the morning
and afternoon peaks. A left turn deceleration lane would be required on SR-167.

SR-167 / Intersection G2

This intersection would serve as the primary access point to a parcel of 15 residential units of
Area G on the west side of SR-167. It would be stop sign controlled on the side street
approach, with all movements operating at LOS D or better during both the morning and
afternoon peaks. A left turn deceleration lane would be required on SR-167.




                                                                                            Page 32

SR-167 / Intersection G1

This intersection would serve as the primary access to the retail and residential development in
Area G and is one of two new intersections requiring signalization in the proposed build-out of
Snowbasin Resort. Without a signal the side street left turns at the intersection would operate at
LOS F in both the morning and afternoon peak periods and would experience significant
queuing and delays in the afternoon. With a signal the intersection would operate at LOS A
during both the morning and afternoon peak periods. In addition to signalization, the intersection
would require left and right turn deceleration lanes in each direction of SR-167, and separate
right turn lanes on both side street approaches.

E.     Highway Operations

Highway capacity analyses were performed for key sections of SR-226 (Trappers Loop Road),
including:

1.     SR-226 to Huntsville, uphill
2.     SR-226 to Huntsville, downhill
3.     SR-226 to Mountain Green, uphill
4.     SR-226 to Mountain Green, downhill

Highway capacity analyses were performed using methodologies documented in the Highway
Capacity Manual. The uphill segments were evaluated during the morning peak and the
downhill segments were evaluated during the evening peak for the existing Saturday volumes,
2030 background Saturday volumes, and 2030 total Saturday volumes. The analysis was
designed to capture the worst highway level of service for each direction during a peak ski
Saturday. The results of the analyses are summarized in Table 11.

Table 11.      Highway Levels of Service

                                  Existing         2030 Background         2030 Total
         Segment              Uphill   Downhill    Uphill  Downhill      Uphill  Downhill
                               AM         PM        AM        PM          AM       PM
SR-226 to Huntsville          LOS A     LOS D      LOS A    LOS D        LOS A    LOS E
SR-226 to Mountain Green      LOS A     LOS D      LOS A    LOS E        LOS A    LOS E

The south section of SR-167 is projected to carry 18,800 vpd at build-out of the resort. At these
volumes the uphill direction would operate at LOS A during the morning peak (due in large part
to the continuous climbing lane) while the downhill direction would operate at LOS E during the
afternoon peak. The volume-to-capacity ratio for the downhill direction would be 0.67 in the
afternoon, (i.e., the projected volume would be approximately 67 percent of the capacity of the
roadway during the peak hour), so it would appear that the roadway would not require an
additional downhill lane.




                                                                                           Page 33
Snowbasin Resort Master Plan                                                   Transportation Element


The north section of SR-167 is projected to carry 20,400 vpd at build-out of the resort. At these
volumes the uphill direction would operate at LOS A during the morning peak (again due to the
continuous climbing lane) while the downhill direction would operate at LOS E during the
afternoon peak. The volume-to-capacity ratio for the downhill direction would be 0.70 in the
afternoon, however, so it would appear that no additional lanes would be necessary on that
section, either.

Appendix E contains the highway analysis worksheets.

F.      Auxiliary Lane Requirements

Table 12 provides auxiliary length requirements for each of existing intersections while Table 13
provides requirements for new intersections that would be build for the resort. The
recommendations consider roadway speed limits, grades, traffic volumes and projected 95th
percentile queues at each intersection at buildout of the project. Table 12 also includes the
existing lane lengths at each intersection and indicates that, with the exception of the eastbound
left turn lane out of the Snowbasin Resort and the eastbound left turn lane at SR-167/Mountain
Green, the existing turn lane geometries appear to adequately accommodate the projected
traffic volumes at resort buildout.

IV.    PARKING
Parking demand at the ski area bases on the weekend was determined based on the skier and
employment forecasts developed for the trip generation analysis. The following summarizes the
assumptions used to create the parking forecasts.

Day Skiers. The existing weekend traffic volumes, parking lot counts and skier volumes were
used to develop the parking demand for day skiers. The data indicated that the peak parking
demand created by day skiers was 1,900 vehicles. For buildout conditions, this demand was
assigned to the two base areas based on the available parking supply at each (roughly 2/3 to
the Earl's Lodge base and 1/3 to the new Area C base).

Overnight Guest/Resident Skiers. The overnight guest and resident skiers were previously
summarized in Table 4. Since Area A and Area C represent slopeside lodging and Area B would
have a lift that connects it to the Earl's Lodge base, and all three areas would have in internal
transit shuttle, it was assumed that there would be no parking demand on the two base area lots
generated by those areas. Similarly, transit service is planned between Area DEF and the ski
area bases, and it was assumed that 50 percent of the skiers from that area would use that
service, so skier parking demand at the day lots was reduced by 50 percent. No transit
reductions were assumed for skier trips from Areas G and H, since it is not yet know whether
transit services would be provided between those areas and the ski area bases. The total
demand was assigned to the two base areas based on the available parking supply at each.

Base Area Commercial Employees. Employee forecasts for the commercial properties
planned in each base area were generated based on information published by the US
Department of Energy on the typical number of retail employees per gross square foot of floor
space. An average vehicle occupancy of 1.6 employees per vehicle was assumed to determine
the parking demand generated by the employees. This vehicle occupancy is based on
employee surveys collected at other ski resorts.

Ski Area/Lodging Employees. Employee forecasts for the ski area were based on the current
employee to ski area capacity ratio on a peak day at Snowbasin and the planned future
mountain capacity. Lodging employee forecasts were generated based on information from
other ski resorts on the typical number of employees per hotel room and per condominium unit.
As above, an average vehicle occupancy of 1.6 employees per vehicle was assumed to
determine the parking demand generated by the employees.

Table 14 shows the projected parking demand at the two ski area bases at buildout of the resort
based on the above assumptions. As indicated, the base areas are projected to generate a
peak parking demand of approximately 3,100 vehicles on the weekend. The planned parking
supply would be 3,700 spaces, so on a typical higher demand weekend the base area lots
would be approximately 83 percent occupied. This represents a reasonable occupancy level,
as it leaves an additional 600 spaces available for peak of peak demand days.

V.      TRAVEL DEMAND MANAGEMENT
Travel demand management (TDM) measures represent actions taken by a development to
limit vehicle trips made to and from the site. Typically these measures encourage site users to
select a travel mode other than a single occupancy vehicle to get to and from the property, such
as carpooling, transit, or walking and biking.

As noted previously, Snowbasin plans on providing an internal shuttle system in Areas ABC and
DEF so that overnight guests and residents of those areas have means to access the ski area
base without using their vehicles. The shuttle is anticipated to reduce vehicle travel within and
between those areas by approximately 4,100 trips per day on the weekend and 2,700 trips on
the weekday. Similarly, a comprehensive system of pedestrian and bicycle trails will promote
walking and cycling within and between Areas ABC and DEF. Snowbasin may also consider
providing transit service between the ski area bases and Area G so residents and guests don't
have to rely on their personal vehicle for trips to the project's primary commercial area.

Several other TDM measures could be implemented by Snowbasin to reduce the number of
trips generated by the project. Table 15 lists various measures targeting a specific resort user
group that have been successfully implemented at other ski resorts. The table includes traffic
reduction estimates for each measure based on usage levels experienced by those other
resorts. As the table indicates, using the I-84 intercept lot for employee parking and providing a
shuttle to the base areas has the greatest potential for reducing trips at the resort, and if all the
measures listed in the table were implemented, traffic from the ski area base could potentially
be reduced by 20 to 25 percent.

VI.       SUSTAINABILITY
Transportation sustainability is accomplished by limiting the traffic demand on the roadway
system; fewer vehicles equals less congestion equals less environmental impacts. Snowbasin
aims to achieve that by providing on-mountain accommodations that allow residents and guests
to drive to the resort once and stay for multiple days instead of making trips back and forth
every day. Additionally, Snowbasin will provide supportive commercial uses within the resort
that allow residents and guests to fulfill many of their trip purposes (such as dining,
entertainment and resort-related shopping) on site, limiting the number of trips to Mountain
Green or Huntsville for those needs. Snowbasin will also provide an internal shuttle system
between the resort development areas that will enable guests to access the ski area bases
without using their vehicle. This system could operate as either an on-call system, a fixed route,
fixed schedule system or hybrid system that offered fixed route service during the peak demand
periods and on-call service during lower demand periods. Snowbasin may also consider similar
transit service between Areas ABC-DEF and the primary commercial center in Area G to help
reduce travel demand on the northern half of Trappers Loop Road between the ski resort and
Huntsville. Finally, a comprehensive system of pedestrian and bicycle trails will promote
alternate modes of travel by providing internal connections to each development area and
connections between Areas ABC and DEF.

Other ways that the resort could reduce travel demand and promote sustainability include:

         Utilize the built I-84 intercept lot for employee parking and consider constructing an
          employee parking lot near Huntsville, then provide shuttle service between those
          locations and the resort.

         Consider providing preferred parking in the day skier lots for vehicles with three or more
          occupants. To promote reduced vehicle emissions and a healthier environment,
          preferred parking could also be extended to hybrid vehicles and other low-emissions
          vehicles.

         Consolidate services that are needed at the resort from any non-resort business,
          whether it be related to laundry, custodial, utility, security, or lawn/landscaping service.

         Provide transit service between the resort, Mountain Green and the Trappers Loop/SR
          39 intersection.

         Consider the use of alternative fuel shuttles for the employee/day skier transit services.

         Provide bicycles for use by resort residents and guests.

         Provide information on shuttles, transit and other alternate modes to visitors and
          residents.

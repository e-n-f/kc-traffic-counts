                                        56th Avenue Corridor ­ Quebec Street to Peña Boulevard
                                                                      Traffic and Safety Report



1.0 INTRODUCTION
In early 2007, the City and County of Denver (CCD) in partnership with the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) initiated an
evaluation of the 56th Avenue corridor between Quebec Street on the west and Peña
Boulevard on the east in Denver, Colorado (See Figure 1-1). Significant development in the
area, including the Stapleton Redevelopment, Prairie Gateway, and growth occurring north
and east toward Denver International Airport, has spurred concerns that 56th Avenue will
require improvements to serve future traffic demand.

The study is comprised of two separate but related efforts:

·   A federally required Environmental Assessment (EA) will identify and evaluate impacts of
    multi-modal transportation improvements on 56th Avenue between Quebec Street and
    Havana Street. This section of the 56th Avenue corridor can be improved with currently
    available and committed construction funds.
·   A Corridor Study will identify corridor congestion and safety issues, evaluate valued
    resources in the corridor, and develop multi-modal improvement options for the
    remainder of the 56th Avenue corridor from Havana Street to approximately 1,200 feet
    east of the northbound ramps at Peña Boulevard.

The purpose of this traffic and safety report is to provide detailed safety and traffic
operations data for both the EA and Corridor Study. The safety analysis will identify the crash
history in both sections of 56th Avenue and compare the crash experience to statewide rates.
The traffic analysis will assess existing traffic conditions, a future (2035) No-Action
Alternative, and preliminary build alternatives.

2.0 TRAFFIC SAFETY ASSESSMENT
2.1 Introduction
A traffic safety assessment of 56th Avenue was conducted to characterize the corridor's crash
experience, including crash frequency, rates, severity, and types. To allow for the ready
insertion of safety data into the EA and Corridor Study documents, where possible, the
analysis summaries were divided into the EA (Quebec Street to Havana Street) and Corridor
Study (Havana Street to Peña Boulevard) sections of 56th Avenue. To avoid redundancy and
overestimation of traffic safety statistics, the intersection of 56th Avenue/Havana Street is
included in the EA section and excluded from the Corridor Study analysis.

2.2 Crash History
Crash data over a three-year period, from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005, were
provided by CCD. A summary of data for each crash was provided, but specific crash records
detailing crash conditions and causes were not available.

CCD staff also provided a list of the 200 intersections within the CCD city limits that
experienced the highest number of crashes. The list is based on the total number of
intersection crashes that occurred during the three-year period between October 27, 2002,
and October 26, 2005 and was used to provide a perspective on the magnitude of crashes at
intersections on 56th Avenue.

Crash Severity
Traffic crashes were categorized into the following three types of crash severity: Property
Damage Only (PDO), Injury (INJ), and Fatal (FAT) crashes.

For the purpose of intersection crash analysis, intersections along 56th Avenue were classified
into the following three categories:

·   Arterial intersections, where another arterial roadway intersects 56th Avenue
·   Collector intersections, where a collector street intersects 56th Avenue
·   Local intersections, where a local street intersects 56th Avenue

Arterial Intersections

There are two arterial intersections along the EA section of 56th Avenue: Quebec Street and
Havana Street; and three arterial intersections (including one interchange) along the Corridor
Study section of 56th Avenue: Peoria Street, Chambers Road, and the Peña Boulevard
interchange. Table 2.2-1 shows the crash severity summary at the arterial intersections.

The five arterial intersections experienced seventy-six crashes over the three-year analysis
period. Fifty-nine of the crashes were property damage only and seventeen of the crashes

                                                                                   Traffic and Safety Report



resulted in at least one injury. No fatal crashes were reported at these intersections during
the three-year analysis period.

Based on the crash data provided by CCD, none of the arterial intersections within the
corridor exhibited a sufficient number of crashes to be included in the list of the 200 highest
crash intersections within CCD. The highest number of crashes at an arterial intersection
within the 56th Avenue corridor occurred at Havana Street, which experienced 23 crashes over
the three-year period. For comparison, the lowest ranking intersection, i.e., the 200th, on the
CCD's high crash frequency list recorded 43 crashes over the same three-year period, 20 more
than the number of crashes recorded at Havana Street and 56th Avenue.

Collector Intersections

No collector streets intersect 56th Avenue within the EA section between Quebec Street and
Havana Street. Uvalda Street and Crown Boulevard intersect 56th Avenue within the Corridor
Study section. These intersections are located between Peoria Street and Chambers Road and
serve the Montbello neighborhood to the south. Table 2.2­2 shows the total crashes at these
intersections by severity.

The collector intersections experienced a total of nine crashes over the three-year period.
Four of the crashes were property damage only and five of the crashes resulted in at least one
injury. No fatal crashes were reported at these intersections.

The crash inventory at collector intersections on 56th Avenue shows fewer crashes per
intersection compared with the arterial intersections. This would be expected since collector
intersections typically serve less traffic than arterial intersections. One area of concern
however is the severity of crashes at the intersection of 56th Avenue at Crown Boulevard. Of
the five crashes, four resulted in at least one injury.

Local Intersections

There are numerous intersections of local streets with 56th Avenue. The highest concentration
of local street intersections occurs in the Montebello area between Peoria Street and
Chambers Road within the Corridor Study section, including: Quentin Street, Revere Street,
Tucson Street, Worchester Street, Potomac Way, Blackhawk Way, and Fairplay Street.
Between Chambers Road and Peña Boulevard, Randolph Street, Laredo Street, and Memphis
Street intersect 56th Avenue. All of these local streets are stop-controlled while 56th Avenue
has free-flow traffic. Table 2.2-3 shows the total crashes at the local intersections by
severity.

The local intersections experienced thirty-one crashes over the three-year period, varying
between zero to nine crashes at each intersection. Twenty-five of the crashes were property
damage only and six resulted in at least one injury. No fatal crashes were reported at local
intersections. The local intersection at Roslyn Street within the EA section recorded nine
crashes, while the twelve local intersections within the Corridor Study section experienced a
total of twenty-two crashes.

The crash inventory of local intersections shows crash totals similar to the totals for collector
intersections. This is expected since local intersections would typically have traffic demands
and traffic patterns that are similar to collector intersections.

Non-Intersection Crashes

Non-intersection related crashes, or midblock crashes that occurred on 56th Avenue during the
three-year period 2003-2005 were also examined. For the purpose of this crash analysis, the

Note: *  indicates an arterial intersection.

The summary of crashes by type shows that a large percentage of total intersection crashes
on 56th Avenue are rear end ( 39%), sideswipe ( 19%), or broadside ( 16%) crashes. These
three crash types account for nearly 75 percent of the intersection crashes and typically
indicate conditions where drivers were not reacting fast enough to surrounding conditions and
were making last second maneuvers to try to avoid other vehicles. The high percentage of
rear end crashes may indicate areas of frequent unexpected stopping, poor visibility, and/or
sight distance issues.

Figure 2-1 shows a summary of crash severity at intersections. Figure 2-2 shows a summary
of the types of crashes at intersections.

Non-Intersection Crash Types

Traffic volumes are highest in the western portion of the corridor and lowest in the eastern
portion, and crash totals generally reflect that pattern as well. Beginning at Quebec Street
and traveling east, crash totals decrease over each section. The two-mile long section of
Quebec Street to Havana Street accounts for over half of the non-intersection crashes in the
six-mile long corridor.

Two fatal crashes occurred in the corridor over the three-year period. One fatal crash
occurred between Valentia Street and Havana Street and was the result of a sideswipe with
the vehicles traveling in opposite directions. The other fatality occurred between Worchester
Street and Potomac Way and was the result of a collision with an unspecified fixed object.
Table 2.2-6 summarizes the crash types for each roadway section.

The summary of crashes by type again shows that a large percentage of crashes are rear end
collisions. Single-vehicle collisions with objects such as fences, light/utility poles, curbs, and
animals make up a large portion of the remainder of crashes. The high percentage of rear end
crashes may indicate areas of frequent unexpected stopping or poor visibility between
intersections along the corridor. The frequency of crashes involving other objects along the
edge of the paved surface of the roadway may indicate excessive speeds and locations where
drivers are unable to keep their vehicle on the paved surface. Figure 2-3 shows a summary of
crash severity for all non-intersection locations. Figure 2-4 shows a summary of non-
intersection crashes by type.

2.3 Crash Rates
For an additional perspective on the corridor crash experience, crash rates by severity in the
56th Avenue corridor were calculated and compared to similar facilities statewide. CDOT
statewide statistics for roadways classified as Urban Principal Arterial (urban non-interstate
freeways and expressways) and Urban Other Principal Arterial were obtained for the
comparison. The characteristics of 56th Avenue are similar to both statewide facility types
presented. However, based on recorded ADTs, 56th Avenue is most comparable to Urban
Other Principal Arterial roadways.

The primary statistic that is used for comparing sections against statewide crash rates for
similar facilities is the Weighted Hazard Index (WHI). The WHI is a statistical measure for
comparing facilities that considers crash frequency and severity. Positive values of WHI
(WHI>0) indicate sections that experience a greater crash experience (frequency and severity)
than similar statewide facilities. Negative WHI values (WHI<0) indicate sections where the
crash experience is less than the statewide experience for similar facilities.

Crash data used for crash rate calculations and analysis include all crashes that occurred on
the 56th Avenue during the three-year period of 2003-2005, regardless of whether a crash
occurred at an intersection or midblock. Crash data and calculated crash rates are
summarized in Table 2.3-1 for the Environmental Assessment section between Quebec Street
and Havana Street; and in Table 2.3-2 for the Corridor Study section between Havana Street
and Peña Boulevard. Corresponding statewide statistics are also presented in these tables.

It should be noted that since the most recent statewide statistics available are from 2004,
statewide crash rates of 2003 and 2004 were used as the comparative base for the three years
(2003, 2004, and 2005) of data on 56th Ave between Havana Street and Peña Boulevard.
Again, it was assumed that daily traffic along this section of 56th Avenue remained stable
during the three-year period, since there was a lack of average daily traffic (ADT) data
available over that span.

2.4 Summary
Based on the crash data provided by CCD, none of the intersections within the corridor
experienced a sufficient number of crashes to be included in the list of the 200 highest
accident intersections within CCD. The highest number of intersection crashes at a single
intersection within the corridor occurred at Havana Street, which totaled 23 crashes over the
three-year period. The lowest ranking intersection on CCD's highest accident list, i.e., the
200th, recorded 43 crashes over the same three-year period.

The analysis of crash data showed that 200 crashes occurred in the corridor of 56th Avenue
between Quebec Street and Peña Boulevard over the three-year period of 2003­2005. Of
these crashes, 148 were property damage only (PDO), 50 resulted in injuries, and two
resulted in fatalities. The two fatal crashes occurred outside the influence areas of
intersections. One crash was with an unspecified fixed object and the other was a sideswipe
crash between vehicles traveling in opposite directions.

With regard to types of crashes, 81 of the 200 crashes within the corridor were rear-end
crashes. Another 34 of the crashes were sideswipe in nature. These two types account for
over half of the recorded crashes. These types of crashes typically indicate conditions where
drivers are not reacting fast enough to surrounding conditions and/or are making last second
maneuvers to try to avoid other vehicles. This may indicate areas of poor visibility or
unexpected stopping within the corridor. Detailed crash reports for the identified crashes
were not available. As a result, recommendations of specific improvement measures can not
be made to address the causes of these crash patterns.

experienced slightly higher PDO, injury, and fatal crash rates. The WHI value of 0.48 indicates
that this section of 56th Avenue has an overall crash experience about equal to the statewide
average for Urban Principal Arterials.

Compared with statewide Urban Other Principal Arterials, the EA section of 56th Avenue
between Quebec Street and Havana Street experienced lower PDO and injury crash rates than
statewide average. Although the fatal crash rate is higher than statewide average, there was
only one fatal crash on the section during the three-year period. The WHI value of -5.26
indicates that this section of 56th Avenue has an overall crash experience lower than the
statewide average for Urban Other Principal Arterials.

Compared with statewide Urban Principal Arterials (urban non-interstate freeways and
expressways), the Corridor Study section of 56th Avenue between Havana Street and Peña
Boulevard experienced slightly higher PDO, injury, and fatal crash rates. The WHI value of
0.08 indicates that this section of 56th Avenue has an overall crash experience about equal to
the statewide average for Urban Principal Arterials.

Compared with statewide Urban Other Principal Arterials, the Corridor Study section of 56th
Avenue between Havana Street and Peña Boulevard experienced lower PDO and injury crash
rates than statewide average. Although the fatal crash rate is higher than statewide average,
there was only one fatal crash on the section during the three-year period. The WHI value of
-5.62 indicates that this section of 56th Avenue has an overall crash experience lower than
the statewide average of Urban Other Principal Arterials.

Based on recorded ADTs, it was determined that 56th Avenue is more comparable to Urban
Other Principal Arterials. As a result, it can be concluded that 56th Avenue experiences a
lower-than-average crash rate when compared to other similar facilities statewide.

3.0 TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES
3.1 Introduction
This section describes the methodologies that were used to develop and evaluate existing and
future traffic conditions for the 56th Avenue corridor. Both the EA and Corridor Study required
the development and analysis of a number of alternatives. Existing and No-Action alternatives
were used to characterize existing traffic operations and to assess future (2035) conditions if
no improvements are made in the corridor. A series of build alternatives were then developed
and tested to determine whether the proposed improvements will serve forecast traffic
demand.

The term No-Action, also frequently referred to as no-build, represented a future year
condition under which the transportation infrastructure in the immediate project area
remained the same as existing conditions, but the transportation infrastructure outside of the
immediate project area developed as forecast for the 2035 conditions. For build alternatives,
the project area infrastructure was modeled to reflect the project area conditions that are
defined for the specific alternative.

3.2 Validation of Regional Travel Demand Model
Future year forecasts for the No-Action and build alternatives were developed using the 2035
DRCOG regional travel demand model. Since this model was developed for regional travel
demand forecasting, land use forecasts and the roadway network within the smaller 56th
Avenue subarea were reviewed in detail to confirm their adequacy for project-level use.

It should be noted that the DRCOG regional travel demand model assigns traffic under
constrained assignment parameters. Each roadway section (link) in the model network has a
defined hourly capacity threshold of level of service E based on the facility type, number of
lanes and area type. The model assigns vehicle demand to a roadway link and reflects
congestion as the assigned volume on a link gets closer to the defined capacity. Therefore, if
other assignment routes are available to specific destinations, the model will assign vehicle
demand to other routes rather than assign vehicle demand that would exceed a defined
capacity threshold. This typically makes it difficult for the model to show future roadways as
being over capacity, unless there are no additional routes to a specific destination (i.e.,
downtown Denver). With this in mind it is important to consider the demand volumes being
served in conjunction with operational indicators such as level of service, v/c ratio, and
average travel speeds that are generated by the model.

Review of 2005 and 2035 DRCOG Regional Travel Demand Models
An initial test of the validity of the regional travel demand model to accurately forecast
project area conditions was to compare the "existing conditions" model to actual traffic
counts. For this analysis, the 2007 traffic counts collected on 56th Avenue for this project
were compared with the daily volume forecasts of the 2005 DRCOG regional travel demand
model.



                                             3-1
                                        56th Avenue Corridor ­ Quebec Street to Peña Boulevard
                                                                      Traffic and Safety Report



In general, the daily traffic forecasts in the 2005 model were less than the 2007 counts, as
expected. The daily forecast volumes on the east end of the corridor from Peoria Street to
Peña Boulevard however were sixty to eighty percent lower than the 2007 counts. Forecasts
for the west end of the corridor from Quebec Street to Peoria street were much closer to the
2007 counts. While large discrepancies between counts and forecasts can be determined
"acceptable" for short portions of a roadway, large discrepancies over several miles on a
single roadway were not considered acceptable.

The model input and output were analyzed to determine the basis for the discrepancies in
traffic forecasts. The primary reason for the discrepancies on the east end of the corridor
was determined to be the rapid growth in development east of Peña Boulevard. Many of the
recently constructed developments (both residential and employment) were not included in
the 2005 model and, as a result, the overall traffic demand forecast for the corridor was
much lower than existing counts.

Since the discrepancies in forecast demand were caused by a lack of land use input, which
changes for each forecast horizon, and only occurred on the east end of the corridor, it was
concluded that the model was properly forecasting demand on 56th Avenue, given the
provided land use data. This information was used to determine that the DRCOG model was
an appropriate tool to forecast demand for the corridor.

Review of 2035 Land Use Forecasts for 56th Avenue Project Area
Since it was determined that land use input plays a vital role in the reasonableness of traffic
forecasts along 56th Avenue, a review of the 2035 land use forecasts was conducted. Land use
data incorporated into the travel demand model is based on forecasts produced by DRCOG
using input received from local jurisdictions in the Denver metro area.

In the 56th Avenue corridor, several large redevelopment efforts are expected to be
completed by the year 2035. These developments include North Stapleton, Prairie Gateway,
and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge (RMANWR) visitor center. Since
many of these developments are still in the planning stages, the model data sets were
checked for general consistency with the most current site plans.

North of 56th Avenue, including the area of Prairie Gateway, Dick's Sporting Goods Park, and
the RMANWR visitor center, land use forecasts of the 2035 DRCOG regional travel demand
model indicate 963 households and 105 jobs. The model's forecast differs from the current
land use plan for the Prairie Gateway area. An estimated 2,500 employees is now planned for
the area, with no households.

South of 56th Avenue in the area of North Stapleton, the model land use forecast indicates
3,805 households and 7,764 jobs. This area includes the existing warehousing facilities along
Quebec Street and Havana Street. The model's forecast is consistent with what is planned for
this area.

In addition, the land use at the eastern end of 56th Avenue was reviewed. It was confirmed
that the 2035 model included both short-term and long-term land use growth east of Peña
Boulevard. The forecast land use growth included both residential and employment
development.

Review of 2035 Roadway Network for 56th Avenue Project Area
The transportation network included in the 2035 DRCOG travel demand model is based on the
adopted 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). Like the land use forecasts, the model was
verified to determine whether the modeled transportation network for the area was
consistent with development plans.

Several new intersections along 56th Avenue are expected by 2035 as part of the Stapleton
Redevelopment. These include Uinta Street (located west of Valentia Street), Verbena Street
(located east of Valentia Street), Central Park Boulevard (located between Valentia Street
and Havana Street), and Dallas Street (located east of Central Park Boulevard). Both Central
Park Boulevard and Dallas Street were included in the DRCOG 2035 demand model. An
additional intersection at Airport Way in the Parkfield neighborhood was included in the 2035
demand model as well. This intersection is located just west of the Peña Boulevard
interchange.

The remainder of the roadway network adjacent to the 56th Avenue corridor was reviewed for
consistency with existing conditions and plans in the RTP. It was determined that the
remainder of the roadway network was accurate and no additional changes needed to be
made. The area examined in the DRCOG 2035 demand model is shown in Figure 3-1.

It was observed that the 2035 DRCOG model does not assume corridor-wide improvements to
I-70. The majority of the corridor remains as a 6 lane freeway east of I-25. However, some
localized improvements are made between select interchange pairs along the stretch of I-70
between Quebec Street and Peña Boulevard.

Methodology for Project-Level Adjustments to Regional Travel
Demand Forecasts
While the regional model was determined by the study team to be valid for forecasting
demand along 56th Avenue, the model's forecasts of traffic demand on the north-south streets
that intersect 56th Avenue, particularly in the Montbello area, required some manual
adjustments. The specific concern was that the regional model was showing a significant
increase in traffic demand on the collector streets in the Montbello area. Since this area is
substantially built out and lacks regional connectivity, it was considered likely that future
demand on the neighborhood's collector streets would be similar to existing demand.

A "screen line" methodology was developed to manually reassign the "excess" forecast traffic
from the collector streets --Uvalda Street and Crown Boulevard--within Montbello to the
adjacent north-south arterial system. Allowing for a modest traffic increase on the collector
street system (two percent annual growth), "excess" traffic demand on Crown Boulevard was
assigned to Chambers Road, while the excess demand on Uvalda Street was assigned to
Havana and Peoria Streets, based proportionally on each street's existing volume.

One additional manual adjustment to the model forecasts was made on the west end of the
56th Avenue corridor. The 2035 model includes a new north-south arterial--Central Park
Boulevard--which runs parallel to Quebec Street. The regional model was inappropriately
assigning trips to Central Park Boulevard to bypass the portion of Quebec Street from 49th
Avenue to 56th Avenue. A select link analysis was performed within the model to determine

the magnitude of traffic using this route. The identified traffic was then manually reassigned
to Quebec Street and removed from Central Park Boulevard. A similar issue with Spruce
Street was also resolved with a manual reassignment.

All of the manual adjustments described above were applied to the 2035 travel demand
model runs for the No-Action and build alternatives.

A letter of concurrence from DRCOG approving the travel demand forecasting methodology is
provided in Appendix C.

3.3 Methodology to Estimate Intersection Turning
    Movements
Morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak hour turning movement forecasts at each intersection
were developed using the adjusted peak-hour directional traffic volume forecasts and the
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report No. 255 procedures for
developing intersection turning movements. This methodology incorporated the recent traffic
counts on 56th Avenue as model "seeds" in developing future turning movements.

3.4 Methodology for Level of Service Analysis
Traffic operations analyses of the 56th Avenue study corridor were based on analytical
procedures described in the Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 Edition (HCM). Synchro 6.0
software, which implements HCM methodology and analytical procedures, was chosen as the
primary assessment tool for the corridor.

Level of Service (LOS) was used to characterize peak hour traffic operations. LOS is measured
using a letter designation from A to F, with LOS A being the best operating condition, and LOS
F being the worst.

For signalized intersections, LOS is described in terms of average delay for vehicles using the
intersection.    This delay measurement involves speed of travel, and includes initial
deceleration delay, stopped delay, vehicle queue start up and lost time, and acceleration
delay. The average delay value typically used to measure LOS at an intersection is calculated
by also including vehicles that were not required to slow or stop at the intersection. The
quality of traffic signal progression in a network as well as individual intersection geometry
and the allocated traffic signal green time to critical traffic movements are the primary
drivers that determine the LOS of signalized intersections. Table 3.4-1 provides definitions
for the interpretation of signalized intersection operation using the LOS concept.

For stop sign-controlled intersections, LOS is also defined in terms of delay. LOS considers
the availability of adequate gaps in conflicting traffic movements to perform a desired
maneuver. LOS is usually defined for the minor street movements at the intersection that are
required to stop before proceeding, as well as left turns from the major street that must wait
for gaps in the opposing traffic flow to complete the desired turning movement. Table 3.4-2
provides definitions for the interpretation of unsignalized intersection operation using the LOS
concept.

3.5 Additional Traffic Analysis Assumptions
As mentioned previously, the Synchro (Version 6.0) traffic analysis software package was used
for all detailed traffic analyses of this study. Traffic system assumptions that were made for
the Synchro analysis are documented in this section. These assumptions include traffic signal
phasing and cycle length, pedestrian movements at signalized intersections, and future
intersection geometry.

Since all of the current traffic signals on 56th Avenue within the study area are connected to
CCD's icons Traffic Management System, the analyses assumed an actuated/coordinated
signal environment that was optimized in the Synchro 6.0 software for future traffic
conditions. The signalized intersections were analyzed using a traffic signal cycle length of
120 seconds, which was the optimized cycle length for the corridor during the AM and PM
peak hours. The noon peak hour was not analyzed under future conditions since it does not
represent the worst peak hour under existing conditions, nor is it expected to represent the
worst peak period under future conditions.

The City and Country of Denver provided guidance that future intersections should be
analyzed in the locations depicted in the North Stapleton Infrastructure Master Plan. It was
understood that these intersection locations were already approved based on the on-going
work with the Stapleton development. Traffic signals at these locations, as well as other
unsignalized intersections along the corridor, may be installed when future traffic volumes
meet respective traffic signal warrants and were assumed as such in the analysis.

Pedestrian crossings of 56th Avenue and intersecting streets were assumed at all signalized
intersections. The required pedestrian crossing time at each location was determined using a
walking speed of 3.5 feet per second and was entered into each intersection's signal timing.
Push button pedestrian activation was assumed at each intersection with five calls per hour
on each intersection leg.

All build alternatives included localized improvements to intersections to maximize
performance. Intersection signal timings were optimized and auxiliary (turning) lanes were
added as necessary in order to achieve acceptable Level of Service D or better. In general,
exclusive right turn lanes (including acceleration lanes) were not included for the six-lane
roadway alternatives except at arterial intersections.

3.6 Bus Service Assumptions
RTD bus service operating on 56th Avenue is limited to one route that provides service along
the portion of 56th Avenue between Peoria Street and Oswego Street (approximately 0.15
mile). As part of a neighborhood service route, Route 54 runs in the eastbound direction
during the AM peak period and westbound in the PM peak period. Nine buses are provided
between 6:30 AM and 11:30 AM while 13 buses are provided between 12:15 PM and 7:00 PM.

Concept plans for RTD bus service in the 56th Avenue corridor for the design year 2035 consist
of three bus routes:

Route 54 is proposed to provide service along 56th Avenue from Crown Boulevard to Chambers
Road. The buses are forecast to run on 15-minute headways during peak periods and 30-
minute headways during off-peak periods. This route is planned to provide service in the
Montebello neighborhood between the Peoria/Smith Road and 40th Avenue/Airport rail
stations.

Route 148 is proposed to provide service on 56th Avenue from Peoria Street east past Peña
Boulevard. The buses are forecast to run on 30-minute headways during peak periods and 60-
minute headways during off-peak periods. This route is planned to provide service between
northern Aurora and the Peoria/Smith Road rail station.

Route 156 is proposed to provide service along 56th Avenue from Peoria Street west past
Quebec Street. The buses are forecast to run on 30-minute headways throughout the day.
The route is planned to provide service between the Peoria/Smith Road rail station and the
Commerce City rail station.

The cross street with the highest daily volume is Quebec Street, which carries approximately
20,000 vehicles per day. Crown Boulevard carries the lowest volume of the studied arterials
and collectors with about 1,500 vehicles per day.

Truck Traffic
As part of the traffic count program, vehicle classifications were recorded using automated
equipment. Classifications were made based on the number of axles and the length of the
vehicle. Any vehicles with three or more axles was counted as trucks. The truck traffic (as a
percentage of total traffic) is shown in Table 4.1-2.

The vehicle classification counts show a high proportion of truck traffic in the 56th Avenue
corridor, with the highest percentage of trucks in the western portion of the corridor. Near
Quebec Street, trucks are about 10 percent of total traffic. Truck percentages along Havana
Street are also near 10 percent. Many distribution centers for various industries are located
south of 56th Avenue between Quebec Street and Peoria Street, which accounts for the higher

truck percentages in that portion of the corridor. Truck demand declines on the east end of
the corridor, with trucks decreasing to about 3 percent of the traffic stream near Peña

4.2 Existing Traffic Operations
General Traffic Patterns
West of Havana Street, the eastbound/westbound directional split of traffic on 56th Avenue is
approximately 50/50 during both peak hours. East of Havana Street, a more pronounced
directional split is observed, with approximately 60 percent of vehicles on 56th Avenue
traveling westbound during the AM peak hour, reversing to eastbound during the PM peak
hour. West of Chambers Road, the directional split is approximately the same with 60
percent of vehicles traveling westbound in the AM peak hour.

56th Avenue is used by commuters to travel between Quebec Street and Havana Street. The
southbound left and westbound right at Quebec Street serve a large proportion of vehicles in
the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The northbound left and eastbound right at Havana
Street show the same pattern.

Volume-to-Capacity Analysis
A roadway's volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio, which compares the traffic volume with the
capacity of a roadway, is an important measure of traffic operations and severity of traffic
congestion.

Consistent with national practice, for this study a v/c ratio less than 0.9 is considered under
capacity. A ratio between 0.9 and 1.0 is considered at capacity. A v/c ratio of 1.0 or greater
means the roadway is over capacity and does not provide the peak hour capacity necessary to
meet the traffic demand.

For existing conditions, the Synchro 6 analysis network was used to determine that one lane
along 56th Avenue provides the capacity for 1,050 vehicles per hour. The capacity for two
lanes in the same direction was estimated at 2,100 vehicles per hour.

To support the environmental studies for the EA, the existing v/c ratio was calculated for two
sections of 56th Avenue between Quebec Street and Havana Street. For each section the v/c
was calculated for the peak direction of travel for each peak hour. From Quebec Street to
Valentia Street the v/c ratio was calculated in the eastbound direction during both peak
hours. Between Valentia Street and Havana Street, the v/c ratio was calculated in the
westbound direction during the AM peak hour and in the eastbound direction during the PM
peak hour.

During the AM peak hour the section from Quebec Street to Valentia Street has a v/c ratio of
0.29. The section from Valentia Street to Havana Street has a v/c of 0.67. During the PM

peak hour the section from Quebec Street to Valentia Street has a v/c of 0.38 while the
section from Valentia Street to Havana Street has a v/c of 0.74.

The v/c ratio was calculated for the Corridor Study as just one section using a weighted
average of roadway sections between intersections. The v/c was calculated in the westbound
direction during the AM peak hour and in the eastbound direction during the PM peak hour.
The average v/c during the AM peak hour is 0.44, during the PM peak hour the average v/c is
0.55. The v/c ratios for existing conditions are shown in Table 4.2-1.

All sections of 56th Avenue are operating under capacity during the peak hours.

Average Speed Calculation
Another way to characterize traffic conditions is by the considering travel speed. As travel
speeds decline, travel time and delay increase. For this analysis, average travel speeds were
modeled using the Synchro software. Travel speeds reflected estimated running speeds and
delays due to traffic signals.

The average speed on 56th Avenue was calculated for two separate sections along the EA
corridor. Speeds were calculated for the peak direction of travel (AM westbound; PM
eastbound).

From Quebec Street to Valentia Street the average speed is 36.4 mph in the AM and 37.6 mph
in the PM. From Valentia Street to Havana Street the average speed is 36.4 mph in the AM
and 31.4 mph in the PM.

The average speed was calculated for the entire Corridor Study section from Havana Street to
Peña Boulevard. The speed was calculated for the westbound direction during the AM peak
hour and in the eastbound direction during the PM peak hour. During the AM peak hour the
average speed is 35.6 mph, during the PM peak hour the average speed is 38.0 mph. The
average speeds are provided in Table 4.2-2.

The average speeds recorded reflect the calculated v/c ratios for the different sections of
roadway. As the v/c increases, the average speed decreases. Each section of 56th Avenue
shows an average speed near the speed limit of 40 miles per hour reflecting the under
capacity conditions previously presented.

Intersection Level of Service
All traffic signals on 56th Avenue within the study area are connected to CCD's ICONS Traffic
Management System. The system uses AM, PM, and off-peak signal timing plans. These
timing plans were used to assess current operations at the signalized intersections in the
corridor. The results of the signalized and unsignalized intersection analyses are shown in
Tables 4-3 and 4-4 respectively.

The analysis indicates that all intersections operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D
or better), with the exception of the Chambers Road intersection, which operates at LOS E on
the stop-controlled approach.

5.0 NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE (2035)
5.1 Introduction
To help assess the need for corridor improvements, a No-Action alternative was defined for
analysis. For this study, the No-Action alternative includes the land use and roadway network
in the DRCOG 2035 regional model. In the No-Action alternative, the existing number of lanes
along 56th Avenue is maintained as input in the Synchro model.

The Synchro/SimTraffic software was used to evaluate each of the corridor alternatives,
including No-Action and several build alternatives. Since 56th Avenue is shown in the regional
model as a six-lane arterial east of Peña Boulevard, the network model used for the Synchro
analysis required several adjustments to reflect the necessary lane transitions from the two-
lane section of 56th Avenue west of the Peña Boulevard interchange to the six-lane section
east of the interchange. The adjustments to the Synchro network included:

·   Southbound Ramps Intersection: Dual left turn lanes westbound on 56th Avenue to the
    southbound on-ramp to Peña Boulevard were used. Both left turn lanes were assumed to
    "trap" two of the three westbound through lanes from the northbound ramps intersection.
    Vehicles in these two westbound lanes would be required to turn left onto southbound
    Peña Boulevard.
·   Northbound Ramps Intersection: An exclusive northbound right turn lane was used from
    the Peña Boulevard off-ramp to eastbound 56th Avenue. The eastbound curb lane, i.e., the
    third lane from the center line, on 56th Avenue east of the interchange complex was
    added at this intersection providing a free right turn movement for the northbound traffic
    from Peña Boulevard.

The 2035 No-Action peak-hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5-1. Roadway geometry
and intersection control, including the improvements to the Peña Boulevard interchange, are
shown in Figure 5-2.

The travel demand forecasts for the year 2035 show a very high volume turning from
westbound 56th Avenue to southbound Peña Boulevard. The demand for this movement is
generated by development to the north and east of the 56th Avenue study area as well as
increased capacity in the Tower Road corridor. The on-ramp to southbound Peña Boulevard
at 56th Avenue is the first location west of E-470 where vehicles can access Peña Boulevard to
travel to Denver. This concentrates demand from a large area to this one access point.

While it is recognized that demands of this magnitude will likely not be served sufficiently by
two left turn lanes, the turning movement forecasts were not adjusted during the analysis
process. Secondary routes to Peña Boulevard, without imposing a toll on trips by using E-470,
were not available to reassign traffic to. One possible solution to this situation would be to
add an on-ramp to southbound Peña Boulevard at the Tower Road interchange. This would
likely reduce the demand at the 56th Avenue interchange.

The results of the traffic analysis for the Quebec Street to Havana Street and Havana Street
to Peña Boulevard sections of the corridor are summarized in the following sections of this
chapter.

5.2 Quebec Street to Havana Street
    (Environmental Assessment section)
    2035 No-Action Traffic Analysis Results
Travel Patterns
Traffic demand on the Quebec Street to Valencia Street section of 56th Avenue, as estimated
using the 2035 DRCOG regional transportation model, is constrained by the limited capacity of
the adjacent Valentia Street to Havana Street section to the east. Even so, 2035 traffic
volume on the Quebec Street to Valentia Street section is forecast to be nearly double that of
today.

Volume-to-Capacity Analysis
The volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio was calculated for future volume demands on 56th Avenue.
To provide a comparison with existing conditions, the v/c was calculated for the same
sections of the corridor in the same travel direction as described in Section 4.2.

From Quebec Street to Valentia Street during the AM peak hour, the v/c is forecast to be
0.57. During the PM peak hour a value of 0.67 is forecast. For the section from Valentia Street
to Havana Street, a v/c of 1.18 is forecast for the AM peak hour and 1.20 is forecast for the
PM peak hour as shown in Table 5.2-1. The forecasts show that the section from Valentia
Street to Havana Street is expected to be over capacity by 2035.

*Over capacity conditions are shown in BOLD.


Average Speed Calculation
The average speed was also calculated for future volume demands for a comparison to
existing conditions (Table 5.2-2). From Quebec Street to Valentia Street an average speed of
36.4 mph is forecast for the AM peak hour and a speed of 37.6 mph is forecast for the PM
peak hour. From Valentia Street to Havana Street an average speed of 26.8 mph is forecast
for the AM peak hour and a speed of 18.4 mph is forecast for the PM peak hour. The decrease
in average speed in the Valentia Street to Havana Street section correlates to the increase in
v/c ratio over the same section.

Intersection Levels of Service
The new intersection at Central Park Boulevard was assumed to be signalized under 2035 No-
Action conditions since it is an arterial connection to 56th Avenue. The results of the analyses
for signalized intersections (Table 5.2-3) and unsignalized intersections (Table 5.2-4) are
summarized below.

The intersections of Spruce Street and Dallas Street were left unsignalized under No-Action
conditions, since neither intersection was expected to meet signal warrants under those
conditions. The levels of service of all the unsignalized intersections along 56th Avenue are
forecast to be undesirable (LOS E or poorer) under 2035 No-Action traffic conditions, as all
stop-controlled movements are forecast to operate at LOS F during both peak hours.

2035 No-Action Traffic Analysis Summary
Traffic operational analysis from Quebec Street to Havana Street under No-Action conditions
forecasts deficiencies at the following intersections.

    (Corridor Study section)
    2035 No-Action Traffic Analysis Results
Travel Patterns
The No-Action roadway network for the Corridor Study section assumed a six lane section
west of Havana Street on 56th Avenue. The highest travel demand exists in the western
portion of the corridor between Havana Street and Peoria Street, with traffic gradually
tapering off towards the east. The two-lane section of 56th Avenue between Peoria Street and
Peña Boulevard limits the amount of through traffic traversing this section. Lack of auxiliary
lanes on 56th Avenue at Uvalda Street and Crown Boulevard is forecast to hinder the flow of
through traffic and increase side street delay.

During the AM peak hour, an average of 1,300 vehicles is forecast in the westbound (peak)
direction. The alternative serves approximately 1,300 vehicles in the eastbound (peak)
direction during the PM peak hour.

Volume-to-Capacity Analysis
The volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio was calculated for future volume demands on 56th Avenue.
To provide a comparison to existing conditions, the v/c was calculated for the same sections
of the corridor in the same travel direction as described in Section 4.2.

From Havana Street to Peña Boulevard during the AM peak hour, the average v/c is forecast
to be 1.18. During the PM peak hour a value of 0.93 is forecast. The forecasts show that the
Corridor Study section is expected to be over capacity during the AM peak hour and at
capacity during the PM peak hour under future traffic conditions.

Average Speed Calculation
The average speed was also calculated for future volume demands for a comparison to
existing conditions. From Havana Street to Peña Boulevard an average speed of 26.0 mph is
forecast for the AM peak hour and a speed of 24.7 mph is forecast for the PM peak hour.

Intersection Levels of Service
A new intersection at Airport Way was assumed to be signalized under 2035 conditions at the
request of CCD staff. In addition, it was assumed that the Chambers Road intersection would
meet signal warrants prior to 2035, and would likely be signalized under both No-Action and

Under No-Action conditions in 2035, four of the six signalized intersections are forecast to
operate at undesirable levels (LOS E or poorer) during at least one peak hour.

·   The Havana Street intersection is forecast to operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour.
    The eastbound and westbound approaches are forecast to be at capacity (LOS E).
·   The Peoria Street intersection is forecast to operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour.
    The westbound approach is forecast to be at capacity (LOS E) while the northbound
    approach is forecast to be over capacity (LOS F).
·   The Peña Boulevard Southbound ramps intersection is forecast to operate at LOS F
    during the AM peak hour and LOS E during PM peak hour. During the AM peak hour, the
    eastbound and westbound approaches are forecast to be over capacity (LOS F). During
    the PM peak hour, the eastbound and westbound approaches are forecast to be at

The intersections of Uvalda Street and Crown Boulevard were left unsignalized under No-
Action conditions, since neither intersection was expected to meet signal warrants under
those conditions. The operations of all the unsignalized intersections along 56th Avenue are
forecast to be undesirable (LOS E or poorer) under 2035 traffic conditions. Many of the stop-
controlled movements are forecast to operate at LOS F during both peak hours.

2035 No-Action Traffic Analysis Summary
Traffic operational analysis from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard under No-Action conditions
forecast deficiencies at the following intersections.

·   Havana Street
·   Peoria Street
·   Uvalda Street
·   Crown Boulevard
·   Peña Boulevard Southbound ramps
·   Peña Boulevard Northbound ramps

The two-lane section of 56th Avenue is forecast to be inadequate for the expected traffic
demand, especially in locations like Havana Street, Peoria Street and Peña Boulevard where
the number of through lanes changes.

    PRELIMINARY BUILD ALTERNATIVES
6.1 Definition of Alternatives
URS developed six build alternatives for the Quebec Street to Havana Street section of 56th
Avenue. These alternatives offer various levels of improvement and are described as follows:

·   Alternative 1: No-Action
·   Alternative 2: Transportation System Management (TSM)  limited improvements to
    intersections and no improvements to roadway capacity.
·   Alternative 3: Maintain existing five lanes, Quebec Street to Valentia Street; widen from
    two to four lanes, Valentia Street to Havana Street
·   Alternative 4: Maintain existing five lanes, Quebec Street to Valentia Street; widen from
    two to four lanes with on-street bicycle lanes, Valentia Street to Havana Street
·   Alternative 5: Maintain existing five lanes, Quebec Street to Valentia Street; widen from
    two to six lanes, Valentia Street to Havana Street
·   Alternative 6: Maintain existing five lanes, Quebec Street to Valentia Street; widen from
    two to six lanes with on-street bicycle lanes, Valentia Street to Havana Street
·   Alternative 7: Widen to six through lanes, Quebec Street to Havana Street
·   Alternative 8: Widen to six through lanes, Quebec Street to Havana Street, with on-street
    bicycle lanes

Table 6.1-1 summarizes the proposed improvements for each section of 56th Avenue under
each alternative.

6.2 Fatal Flaw Screening of Alternatives
A fatal flaw screening process was used to eliminate all non-viable alternatives prior to more
detailed investigations and screening. The following set of evaluation criteria was established
for the initial screening phase to assess the full range of alternatives developed for the 56th
Avenue improvements:

·   Project purpose and need. Alternatives that did not satisfy the project vision, meet goals
    or address issues that were established for this project were eliminated as a result of the
    initial screening, and therefore excluded from further consideration.
·   Environmental impacts. The potential impacts of transportation alternatives on
    environmental resources present in the project area were analyzed. An alternative was
    eliminated during the initial screening if it was found to have major negative impacts on
    environmental resources and these impacts would be difficult to avoid or mitigate.
·   Practicality and feasibility. Various factors, such as extraordinary cost, extreme
    complexity of implementation, outstanding constructability issues, and right-of-way
    limitations, could render an alternative to be impractical or not feasible during the initial
    screening. Alternatives considered as impractical or unfeasible were eliminated.

Alternative 2: TSM Alternative did not meet the purpose and need for the corridor and was
eliminated from further consideration. The alternative did not provide corridor capacity
improvements to meet the forecast future traffic and mobility demands on 56th Avenue.

6.3 Comparison of General Traffic Characteristics
A detailed traffic assessment was conducted on the alternatives that survived the fatal flaw
screening process.     On-street bicycle lanes have a limited effect on traffic operations,
therefore, Alternatives 3, 5 and 7 were analyzed in detail to represent the respective
roadway widening alternatives with and without bicycle lanes.      For example, the traffic
operations analyses for Alternative 3 were assumed to also be representative of Alternative 4
traffic operations.

All of the build alternatives were analyzed for the AM and PM peak hours using the principles
and methodologies described in Section 3.0.

Average Daily Traffic
Average daily traffic forecasts for each Environmental Assessment alternative are shown in
Table 6.3-1. Of the alternatives, the regional forecasting model assigned the least volume of
traffic to the corridor under the No-Action alternative (existing lanes, with no roadway
widening). The highest volume of corridor traffic was forecast for the alternative that
provided the most roadway capacity -- Alternative 7 (six lanes, Quebec Street to Havana
Street).

Average Travel Times and Roadway Congestion
Additional operational parameters (average travel speed and volume/capacity ratios) were
calculated for each Environmental Assessment alternative. In comparing the alternatives it is
important to note that forecast traffic volumes as well as the number of lanes on 56th Avenue

varies between the alternatives (higher traffic volumes were assigned to the higher capacity
alternatives), complicating a direct "apples to apples" comparison of the alternatives.

Average travel speed was calculated using the Synchro analysis networks developed for each
alternative. Average approach delays at each intersection and average link travel times were
used to develop average travel speeds in the peak direction for each peak hour. These
speeds were then averaged into one overall average travel speed. The average forecast
travel speeds for each alternative are shown in Table 6.3-2.

Alternative 7 provides the highest average forecast travel speed during both peak hours. No-
Action conditions provide the lowest average forecast travel speed. In general, the results
show higher travel speeds for alternatives with wider roadway sections.

Roadway congestion was represented by link-based volume to capacity (v/c) ratios. Link
capacities were derived from the signal timings along the corridor in the Synchro analysis
networks for each alternative. A weighted overall v/c was calculated for the peak direction
during each peak hour based on the length of each analysis section. An overall v/c for both
peak hours combined was also calculated. The forecast v/c values for each alternative are
shown in Table 6.3-3.

    Four Lanes from Valentia Street to Havana Street ­
    Analysis of 2035 Traffic Conditions
Introduction
Alternative 3: Widen 56th Avenue to Four Lanes from Valentia Street to Havana Street
included a five lane roadway section on 56th Avenue from Quebec Street to Valentia Street
and a four lane section from Valentia Street to Havana Street. The roadway network east of
Havana Street remained the same as defined in the No-Action Alternative. It is anticipated
that the 2035 traffic volumes on Spruce Street and Dallas Street will warrant traffic signals
under these conditions and traffic signals may be installed at these locations as a result.
These signals are located at approximate ¼- to ½-mile intervals, which were determined to
be acceptable spacing for adequate traffic progression and provision for reasonable signalized
access to 56th Avenue.

Network Assumptions
The following improvements were assumed for study intersections to operate at level of
service D or better. Reasonable intersection improvements were included for intersections
where LOS D was not achievable.

·   Quebec Street: Added a southbound right turn lane.
·   Spruce Street: Installed a traffic signal.
·   Central Park Boulevard: Added an eastbound right turn lane, a westbound right turn lane,
    and a second northbound left turn lane.

·     Dallas Street: Installed a traffic signal.

Alternative 3 peak-hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 6-1. The geometry and traffic
control at each intersection is shown in Figure 6-2.

Results of Travel Patterns Analysis
The highest travel demand along 56th Avenue is forecast between Quebec Street and Valentia
Street under Alternative 3. The additional through lanes provide for more demand to be
forecast through the eastern portion of the section which is demonstrated by the increased
demand from Valentia Street to Peoria Street when compared to no action conditions.

The intersection level of service results are shown in Table 6.4-1.

Under Alternative 3, one of the signalized intersections is forecast to operate at undesirable
levels (LOS E or poorer) during at least one peak hour.

The 56th Avenue/Quebec Street intersection is forecast to operate at LOS E during both peak
hours. During the AM peak hour the westbound approach is forecast to be over capacity (LOS
F) and the southbound approach is forecast to be near capacity (LOS E). The eastbound
approach is forecast to be over capacity (LOS F) and the northbound approach is forecast to
be near capacity (LOS E) during the PM peak hour.

The operational deficiencies at 56th Avenue/Quebec Street are primarily results of vehicles
navigating around the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. The southbound left
turn in particular requires a large amount of green time to serve the demand for that
movement. No other reasonable intersection improvements were found that enabled the
intersection to operate at LOS D or better.

Summary of Traffic Operations
Traffic patterns along the corridor show that with the additional through lanes, the demand
along the entire length of the corridor increases, especially from Valentia Street to Peoria
Street. The directional splits indicate a commuting pattern using the entire length of the
corridor that is westbound in the AM peak hour and eastbound in the PM peak hour.

Improvements were assumed at four of the study intersections to enhance intersection
operations within the corridor to acceptable levels (LOS D or better). Even with
improvements, operational analysis for the Alternative 3 section indicated deficiencies at one
intersection: 56th Avenue/Quebec Street. Besides the improvements assumed for the
intersection, no other reasonable improvements could be determined at Quebec Street that
would raise the level of service to an acceptable level (LOS D).

6.5 Alternative 5: Widen 56th Avenue to Six Lanes from
    Valentia Street to Havana Street ­
    Analysis of 2035 Traffic Conditions
Introduction
Alternative 5: Widen 56th Avenue to Six Lanes from Valentia Street to Havana Street included
five lanes from Quebec Street to Valentia Street and six lanes from Valentia Street to Havana
Street. The surrounding roadway network remained the same as determined in the No-Action
Alternative. It is anticipated that the 2035 traffic volumes on Spruce Street and Dallas Street
will warrant traffic signals under these conditions and traffic signals may be installed at these
locations as a result. These signals are located at approximate ¼- to ½-mile intervals, which
were determined to be acceptable spacing for adequate traffic progression.

Network Assumptions
The following improvements were assumed to study intersections to provide operations at LOS
D or better. Reasonable improvements were included for intersections where LOS D was not
achievable.

·   Quebec Street: Added a southbound right turn lane.
·   Spruce Street: Installed a traffic signal.
·   Central Park Boulevard: Added a westbound right turn lane, an eastbound right turn lane,
    a second northbound left turn lane, and a second westbound left turn lane.
·   Dallas Street: Installed a traffic signal.

Alternative 5 peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 6-3. The number of roadway
lanes and intersection geometry are shown in Figure 6-4.

Results of Travel Patterns Analysis
The highest travel demand along 56th Avenue continues to be forecast between Quebec Street
and Valentia Street under Alternative 5. The additional through lanes provide for more
demand to be forecast through the eastern portion of the section that is demonstrated by the
increased demand from Valentia Street to Peoria Street.

Under Alternative 5, one of the signalized intersections is forecast to operate at undesirable
levels (LOS E or poorer) during at least one peak hour.

The 56th Avenue/Quebec Street intersection is forecast to operate at level of service E (LOS
E) during both peak hours.       During the AM peak hour, the eastbound, northbound, and
southbound approaches are forecast to be near capacity (LOS E). The southbound and
eastbound approaches are forecast to be over capacity (LOS F) and the northbound approach
is forecast to be near capacity (LOS E) during the PM peak hour.

The operational deficiencies at 56th Avenue/Quebec Street are primarily results of vehicles
navigating around the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. The southbound left
turn in particular requires a large amount of green time to serve the demand for that
movement. No other reasonable intersection improvements were found that enabled the
intersection to operate at LOS D or better.

Summary of Traffic Operations
Traffic patterns along the corridor show that with the additional through lanes, the demand
along the entire length of the corridor increases, especially from Valentia Street to Peoria
Street. The directional splits indicate a commuting pattern using the entire length of the
corridor that is westbound in the AM peak hour and eastbound in the PM peak hour.

Improvements were assumed at four of the study intersections to enhance intersection
operations within the corridor to acceptable levels (LOS D or better).        Even with
improvements, operational analysis for Alternative 5 indicated deficiencies at one
intersection: 56th Avenue/Quebec Street.        Besides the improvement assumed for the
intersection, no other reasonable improvements could be determined at Quebec Street that
would raise the level of service to an acceptable level (LOS D).

6.6 Alternative 7: Widen 56th Avenue to
    Six Lanes from Quebec Street to Havana Street -
    Analysis of 2035 Traffic Conditions
Introduction
Alternative 7: Widen 56th Avenue to Six Lanes from Quebec Street to Havana Street examined
forecast traffic conditions with six lanes from Quebec Street to Havana Street. The portion of
56th Avenue east of Havana Street remained in the existing condition. The surrounding
roadway network remained the same as determined in the No-Action Alternative. It is
anticipated that the 2035 traffic volumes on Spruce Street and Dallas Street will warrant
traffic signals under these conditions and traffic signals may be installed at these locations as
a result. These signals are located at approximate ¼ to ½ mile intervals, which were
determined to be acceptable spacing for adequate traffic progression.

Network Assumptions
The following improvements were assumed to study intersections along the improved sections
of the corridor to provide operations at LOS D or better. Reasonable improvements were
included for intersections where LOS D was not achievable.

·   Quebec Street: Added a southbound right turn lane.
·   Spruce Street: Installed a traffic signal.
·   Central Park Boulevard: Added an eastbound right turn lane, a westbound right turn lane
    and a second northbound right turn lane.

Alternative 7 peak-hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 6-5. The number of roadway
lanes and intersection geometry are shown in Figure 6-6.

Results of Travel Patterns Analysis
The highest travel demand is forecast in the western portion of the corridor between Quebec
Street and Valentia Street under Alternative 7. The additional through lanes to Havana Street
provide for more demand to be forecast through the corridor to Peoria Street, but projected
volumes continue to show a large number of vehicles accessing the corridor at Central Park

Under Alternative 7 conditions in 2035, one of the signalized intersections is forecast to
operate at undesirable levels (LOS E or poorer) during at least one peak hour.

The 56th Avenue/Quebec Street intersection is forecast to operate at LOS E during the AM
peak hour and LOS F during the PM peak hour. During the AM peak hour, the eastbound,
northbound, and southbound approaches are forecast to be near capacity (LOS E). The
southbound, northbound, and eastbound approaches are forecast to be over capacity (LOS F)
during the PM peak hour.

The operational deficiencies at 56th Avenue/Quebec Street are primarily results of vehicles
trying to navigate around the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. The
southbound left turn in particular requires a large amount of green time to serve the demand
for that movement. No other reasonable intersection improvements were found that enabled
the intersection to operate at LOS D or better.

Summary of Traffic Operations
Traffic patterns along the corridor show that with the additional through lanes, the demand
along the entire length of the corridor increases, especially from Valentia Street to Peoria
Street. The directional splits indicate a commuting pattern using the entire length of the
corridor that is westbound in the AM peak hour and eastbound in the PM peak hour.

At three of the study intersections, improvements were assumed to enhance intersection
operations within the corridor to acceptable levels (LOS D or better).       Even with
improvements, operational analysis for the Alternative 7 indicated deficiencies at one
intersection: 56th Avenue/Quebec Street. Besides the improvement assumed for the
intersection, no other reasonable improvements could be determined at Quebec Street that
would raise the level of service to an acceptable level (LOS D).

No-Action: Three of the intersections are forecast to operate at LOS E or F. Two of the
intersections, Spruce Street and Dallas Street were assumed to be unsignalized and had stop-
controlled approaches that operate at LOS F. The intersection at Quebec Street is forecast to
operate at LOS E. The level of service results show that No-Action conditions will not
adequately serve the demand forecast for 2035 at most intersections.

Alternative 3: Widen to Four Lanes from Valentia Street to Havana Street conditions forecast
one intersection to operate at LOS E or F. Quebec Street is forecast to operate at LOS E. The
level of service results show that demand forecast for 2035 is adequately served by most of
the intersections in the corridor. At Quebec Street, the critical movements are forecast to be
over capacity, causing the degraded levels of service.

Alternative 5: Widen to Six Lanes from Valentia Street to Havana Street conditions forecast
one intersection operating at LOS E or F. Quebec Street is expected to operate at LOS E
because the westbound approach is forecast to be over capacity. The remainder of the
intersections in the corridor is expected to operate at acceptable levels and serve the
demand forecast for the year 2035.

Alternative 7: Widen to Six Lanes from Quebec Street to Havana Street conditions forecast
one intersection operating at LOS E or F. Quebec Street is expected to operate at LOS E since
the westbound approach is forecast to be over capacity. The remainder of the intersections
in the corridor is expected to operate at acceptable levels and serve the demand forecast for

The intersection level of service results during the PM peak hour (Table 6.7-2) show that
most intersections are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better)

Reasonable improvements were made to the 56th Avenue/Quebec Street intersection to allow
it to operate as well as possible given the traffic demands. Under all the aforementioned
alternatives excluding No-Action and Alternative 2, this intersection consists of dual left-turn
lanes, three through lanes and one right-turn lane on the northbound and southbound
approaches, respectively; and dual left-turn lanes, dual through lanes and one right-turn lane
on the eastbound and southbound approaches respectively. Due to right-of-way restrictions, it
was determined that no further improvements can be made to increase the intersection LOS
to "D" or better for the design year 2035.

7.0 HAVANA STREET TO PEÑA BOULEVARD
    (CORRIDOR STUDY SECTION)
    PRELIMINARY BUILD ALTERNATIVES
7.1 Definition of Alternatives
URS developed seven different build alternatives for the Havana Street to Peña Boulevard
section of 56th Avenue. Each alternative for this section of 56th assumes a six-lane section from
Quebec Street to Havana Street. All of these alternatives offer various levels of improvement
and are identified as follows:

·   Alternative 1: No Action.
·   Alternative 2: Transportation System Management (TSM)  limited improvements to
    intersections and no improvements to roadway capacity.
·   Alternative 3: Improve parallel roads.
·   Alternative 4: Construct new parallel road.
·   Alternative 5: Widen the section from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard to four lanes.
·   Alternative 6: The same improvements as Alternative 5 with the addition of on-street
    bicycle lanes from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard.
·   Alternative 7: Widen the section from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard to six lanes.
·   Alternative 8: The same improvements as Alternative 7 with the addition of on-street
    bicycle lanes from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard.

Table 7.1-1 summarizes the proposed improvements for each section of 56th Avenue under
each alternative.

7.2 Fatal Flaw Screening of Alternatives
A fatal flaw screening process was used to eliminate all non-viable alternatives prior to more
detailed investigations and screening. The following set of evaluation criteria was established
for the initial screening phase to assess the full range of alternatives developed for the 56th
Avenue improvements:

1. Project goals and issues. Alternatives that did not satisfy the project vision, meet goals
    or address issues that were established for this project were eliminated as a result of the
    initial screening, and therefore excluded from further consideration.

2. Environmental impacts. The potential impacts of transportation alternatives on
    environmental resources present in the project area were analyzed. An alternative was
    eliminated during the initial screening if it was found to have major negative impacts on
    environmental resources and these impacts would be difficult to avoid or mitigate.

3. Practicality and feasibility. Various factors, such as extraordinary cost, extreme
    complexity of implementation, outstanding constructability issues, and right-of-way
    limitations, could render an alternative to be impractical or not feasible during the initial
    screening. Alternatives considered as impractical or unfeasible were eliminated.

Alternative 2, which considered limited improvement at intersections and no improvements to
roadway capacity, did not meet the study's project goals and issues and was eliminated
during the initial "fatal flaw" screening process. Similarly, Alternatives 3 and 4 that

considered only "off corridor" improvements also did not meet the study's project goals and
issues and were eliminated during the initial "fatal flaw" screening process.

7.3 Comparison of General Traffic Characteristics
All of the Proposed Action Alternatives were analyzed using the same principles and
methodologies from the previous analyses as described in Section 3.0, for the AM and PM peak
hours.

On-street bicycle lanes have a very limited effect on traffic operations, therefore, only
Alternatives 5 and 7 were analyzed in detail. Alternatives 6 and 8 were assumed to have the
same traffic operations as the corresponding alternative without bicycle lanes.

Average Daily Traffic
The summary of average daily traffic forecasts for each Corridor Study alternative presented
in Table 7.3-1 shows that Alternative 7 averaged the highest forecast daily traffic along the
length of the corridor. No-Action conditions averaged the lowest forecast daily traffic. As the
capacity along the corridor is increased, regional mobility improved, allowing more traffic to
use the corridor on a daily basis.

Corridor Study Affect of Parallel Corridors
During the analysis process, it was noted that as capacity was added to 56th Avenue,
additional traffic began to use the facility. This condition begged the question, if 56th Avenue
is not expanded, where does all the traffic that cannot be served go? The DRCOG travel
demand model was used to quantify the volume changes on parallel corridors, as capacity was

restricted on 56th Avenue. The change in daily volume was averaged over three screen lines
at Havana Street, Peoria Street and Chambers Road. Table 7.3-2 presents the average daily
amount of diverted traffic on select parallel roadways as well as the total amount of traffic
diverted from 56th Avenue itself. During the analysis process it was noted that 104th Avenue
did not serve much (<1%) of the diverted traffic from 56th Avenue, therefore it was not
included in the table.

The analysis shows that fifteen percent of drivers that would prefer to use 56th Avenue use an
alternate route when only four lanes are provided between Havana Street and Peña
Boulevard. When only two lanes are provided over this same stretch, fifty percent of drivers
use an alternate route. The highest proportion of the diverted traffic uses I-70 as its
alternate route under both conditions. The diversion of traffic onto parallel facilities under
the two- and four-lane alternatives will likely result with higher traffic volumes through the
Montbello neighborhood and surrounding residential areas.

Average Travel Times and Roadway Congestion
Additional operational parameters were calculated for each Corridor Study alternative.
Average travel speed forecasts were calculated to demonstrate the ability of the proposed
improvements to increase the mobility along the corridor. Roadway congestion values were
calculated to demonstrate how the improvements will meet the forecast demand in 2035.

Average travel speed was calculated using the Synchro analysis networks developed for each
alternative. Average approach delays at each intersection and average link travel times were
used to develop average travel speeds in the peak direction for each peak hour. These
speeds were then combined into one overall average travel speed. The average travel speed
forecasts for each alternative are shown in Table 7.3-3.

Alternative 7 forecasts the highest average travel speed during both peak hours. No-Action
conditions forecast the lowest average travel speed. In general, the results show higher
travel speeds for alternatives with wider roadway sections.

Roadway congestion was represented by link-based volume to capacity (v/c) ratios. Link
capacities were derived from the signal timings along the corridor in the Synchro analysis
networks for each alternative. A weighted overall v/c was calculated for the peak direction
during each peak hour based on the length of each analysis section. An overall v/c for both
peak hours combined was also calculated. The forecast v/c values for each alternative are
shown in Table 7.3-4.

7.4 Corridor Study Alternative 5: Widen 56th Avenue to
    Four Lanes from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard ­
    Analysis of 2035 Traffic Conditions
Introduction
The Corridor Study Alternative 5: Widen 56th Avenue to Four Lanes from Havana Street to
Peña Boulevard roadway network included a four lane roadway section on 56th Avenue from
Havana Street to Peña Boulevard.

It is anticipated that the 2035 traffic volumes on Uvalda Street and Crown Boulevard will
warrant traffic signals under these conditions and traffic signals may be installed at these
locations as a result. These signals are located at approximate ½ to 1 mile intervals, which
are acceptable spacing for adequate traffic progression and provision for reasonable
signalized access to 56th Avenue.

Network Assumptions
The following improvements were assumed to study intersections to provide operations at LOS
D or better. Reasonable improvements were included for intersections where LOS D was not
achievable.

·   Havana Street: Added a second westbound left turn lane. Converted the westbound right
    turn lane into a shared through/right lane.
·   Peoria Street: Added a second westbound left turn lane.
·   Uvalda Street: Installed a traffic signal.
·   Crown Boulevard: Installed a traffic signal.

The Alternative 5 peak-hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 7-1. The geometry and
control at each intersection is shown in Figure 7-2.

Results of Travel Patterns Analysis
The highest travel demand is forecast in the western portion of the Corridor Study between
Havana Street and Peoria Street under Alternative 5. The additional through lanes allow
more demand to be forecast through the eastern portion of the section that is demonstrated
by the increased demand from Peoria Street to Peña Boulevard.

During the AM peak hour, an average of 2,800 vehicles is forecast in the westbound (peak)
direction. The alternative serves approximately 2,700 vehicles in the eastbound direction
during the PM peak hour.

·   The 56th Avenue/Havana Street intersection is forecast to operate at level of service
    (LOS) F during the PM peak hour. During this period, the eastbound approach is forecast
    to be over capacity (LOS F). This is the location where the roadway transitions from
    three eastbound lanes to two eastbound lanes.
·   The 56th Avenue/Peoria Street intersection is forecast to operate at LOS E during the PM
    peak hour. During this period, the eastbound approach is forecast to be over capacity
    (LOS F).
·   The operational deficiencies at Havana Street and Peoria Street are primarily results of
    vehicles traversing 56th Avenue in the eastbound direction. The eastbound through
    demands are higher than the capacity provided by two through lanes. The reduction in
    the number of eastbound lanes from three to two creates a bottleneck which does not
    allow the entire three lane demand to traverse the corridor in the eastbound direction.
    The effect of this bottleneck is demonstrated in the levels of service at Havana Street and
    Peoria Street.

Summary of Traffic Operations
Traffic patterns along the corridor show that with the additional through lanes, the demand
along the entire length of the corridor increases, especially from Peoria Street to Peña
Boulevard. The directional splits indicate a commuting pattern using the entire length of the
corridor that is westbound in the AM peak hour and eastbound in the PM peak hour.

Improvements were assumed at four of the study intersections to enhance intersection
operations within the corridor to acceptable levels (LOS D or better). Even with
improvements, operational analysis under Alternative 5 conditions indicated deficiencies at
two intersections: Havana Street and Peoria Street. These deficiencies are primarily a result
of the bottleneck caused by the reduction in number of through lanes from three to two at
this location within the corridor.

7.5 Corridor Study Alternative 7: Widen 56th Avenue to
    Six Lanes from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard ­
    Analysis of 2035 Traffic Conditions
Introduction
Corridor Study Alternative 7: Widen 56th Avenue to Six Lanes from Havana Street to Peña
Boulevard includes six lanes from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard.

It is anticipated that the 2035 traffic volumes on Uvalda Street and Crown Boulevard will
warrant traffic signals and traffic signals may be installed at these locations as a result. These
signals are located at approximate ½ to 1 mile intervals, which were determined to be
acceptable spacing for adequate traffic progression.

Network Assumptions
The following improvements were assumed to study intersections to provide operations at LOS
D or better. Reasonable improvements were included for intersections where LOS D was not
achievable.

·   Havana Street: Added second westbound left turn lane and converted the northbound
    through lane to a shared through/right lane.
·   Peoria Street: Added northbound right turn lane and second westbound left turn lane.
·   Uvalda Street: Installed traffic signal.
·   Crown Boulevard: Installed traffic signal.
·   Chambers Road: Added third northbound left turn lane.

The Alternative 7 peak-hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 7-3. The number of roadway
lanes and intersection geometry are shown in Figure 7-4.

Results of Travel Patterns Analysis
The highest travel demand is forecast in the western portion of the Corridor Study section
under Alternative 7. The additional through lanes provide for more demand to be forecast
through the eastern portion of the section which is demonstrated by the increased demand
from Peoria Street to Peña Boulevard.

During the AM peak hour, an average of 4,100 vehicles is forecast in the westbound (peak)
direction. The alternative serves approximately 3,700 vehicles in the eastbound direction
during the PM peak hour.

Under Alternative 7 conditions in 2035, one of the signalized intersections is forecast to
operate at undesirable levels (LOS E or poorer) during at least one peak hour.

·   The 56th Avenue/Havana Street intersection is forecast to operate at LOS E during the PM
    peak hour. During that period, the northbound, southbound, and eastbound approaches
    are forecast to be over capacity (LOS F).
·   The operational deficiencies at Havana Street are primarily results of vehicles traversing
    56th Avenue in the eastbound direction. The eastbound through vehicle demands are
    higher than the capacity provided by three through lanes. This results from the green time
    required to serve both the westbound left turn movement and the northbound
    movements, which limits the green time for eastbound/westbound movements.

Summary of Traffic Operations
Traffic patterns along the corridor show that with the additional through lanes, the demand
along the entire length of the corridor increases, especially from Peoria Street to Peña
Boulevard. The directional splits indicate a commuting pattern using the entire length of the
corridor that is westbound in the AM peak hour and eastbound in the PM peak hour.

Improvements were assumed at four of the study intersections to enhance intersection
operations within the corridor to acceptable levels (LOS D or better).    Even with
improvements, operational analysis for Alternative 7 indicated deficiencies at one
intersection: Havana Street.

* Undesirable operations (LOS E or poorer) are shown in BOLD.
* Unsignalized intersections are shown in italics

No-Action: Three of the intersections are forecast to operate at LOS E or F. One of the
intersections, Uvalda Street, was assumed to be unsignalized. Uvalda Street had a stop-
controlled approach that operates at LOS F. The intersection at Peoria Street is forecast to
operate at LOS E. The intersection at the Peña Boulevard Southbound ramps is forecast to
operate at LOS F. The level of service results show that No-Action conditions will not
adequately serve the demand forecast for 2035 at several intersections.

Alternative 5 conditions forecast all of the intersections to operate at LOS D or better during
the AM peak hour. The corridor is expected to serve the demand forecast for the year 2035.

Alternative 7 conditions forecast all of the intersections to operate at LOS D or better during
the AM peak hour. The corridor is expected to serve the demand forecast for the year 2035.

The intersection level of service results during the PM peak hour (Table 7.6-2) show that
most intersections are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better)
under most of the Alternatives.

* Undesirable operations (LOS E or poorer) are shown in BOLD.
* Unsignalized intersections are shown in italics

No-Action: Five of the intersections operate at LOS E or F. Two of the intersections, Uvalda
Street and Crown Boulevard, were assumed to be unsignalized and had stop-controlled
approaches that operate at LOS F. The intersections at Havana Street, the Peña Boulevard
Southbound ramps and the Peña Boulevard Northbound ramps are forecast to operate at LOS
E. The level of service results show that No-Action conditions will not adequately serve the
demand forecast for 2035 at most intersections.

Alternative 5 conditions forecast two intersections operating at LOS E or F. Havana Street is
expected to operate at LOS F since the eastbound approach is forecast to be over capacity.
Peoria Street is forecast to operate at LOS E since the eastbound approach is forecast to be
over capacity. The remaining intersections in the corridor are expected to operate at
acceptable levels and serve the demand forecast for the year 2035.

Alternative 7 conditions forecast one intersection operating at LOS E or F. Havana Street is
expected to operate at LOS E since the eastbound approach is forecast to be over capacity.
The remaining intersections in the corridor are expected to operate at acceptable levels and
serve the demand forecast for the year 2035.

With the increased demand along 56th Avenue resulting from the additional through lanes, the
eastbound lanes operate poorly during the PM peak hour at Havana Street and Peoria Street.
During the PM peak hour, the signals at Havana Street and Peoria Street must serve both the
northbound movements and the westbound left turn movements in addition to the eastbound
through movement in one cycle; the amount of green time the eastbound movement receives
is reduced. The reduction in green time given to the eastbound through movement reduces
the capacity the corridor can carry in the eastbound direction. This does not occur in the
westbound direction since most intersections along the corridor are three-legged
intersections which do not have a southbound approach requiring green time, or have
southbound approaches with very low volumes.

8.0 CONCLUSIONS
It is important to note that the DRCOG model runs for each of the different alternatives
projected operations on 56th Avenue at or near capacity. This is mainly a result of the
constrained assignment conditions discussed in section 3.2. With key additions of auxiliary
(turning lanes) at intersections, each alternative for both the Environmental Assessment and
the Corridor Study was able to carry the modeled 2035 traffic at Level of Service D or better
at most intersections. Even so, "trouble spots" remained in each alternative where traffic
was at or over capacity (Levels of Service E and F) for specific movements within the
intersection.

For the Environmental Assessment section under 2035 No-Action conditions, the two-lane
section of roadway between Valentia Street and Havana Street is not able to serve the
forecast demand. This section of roadway is expected to be over capacity. The unsignalized
intersections along the study section are forecast to operate at LOS F. In addition, the
intersections at Quebec Street, Central Park Boulevard, and Havana Street are forecast to
operate at LOS E or F during at least one peak hour.

Alternative 3: Widen 56th Avenue to Four Lanes from Valentia Street to Havana Street peak
hour traffic is forecast to operate at capacity along the length of the study section. The
intersection with Quebec Street is forecast to operate at LOS E during both peak hours.

Alternative 5: Widen 56th Avenue to Six Lanes from Valentia Street to Havana Street peak
hour traffic is forecast to operate under capacity along the length of the study section. The
intersection at Quebec Street is forecast to operate at LOS E during both peak hours.

Alternative 7: Widen 56th Avenue to Six Lanes from Quebec Street to Havana Street peak
hour traffic is forecast to operate under capacity along the length of the study section. The
intersection at Quebec Street is forecast to operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS
F during the PM peak hour.

For the Corridor Study section under No-Action conditions, the two-lane section between
Peoria Street and Peña Boulevard is not able to serve the forecast demand. This section of
roadway is expected to be over capacity. The unsignalized intersections along the study
section are forecast to operate at LOS F. In addition, the intersections at Peoria Street, the
Peña Boulevard Southbound ramps, and the Peña Boulevard Northbound ramps are forecast to
operate at LOS E or F during at least one peak hour. The alternative is forecast to serve
approximately 1,300 vehicles in the westbound direction during the AM peak hour and 1,300
vehicles in the eastbound direction during the PM peak hour. In addition, the No-Action
alternative is forecast to serve 50 percent less traffic on a daily basis compared to Alternative
7. This increases the likelihood that traffic volumes in the Montbello and surrounding
neighborhoods will increase as drivers find alternate routes parallel to 56th Avenue.

Alternative 5: Widen 56th Avenue to Four Lanes from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard peak
hour traffic is forecast operate at capacity along the length of the study section. The
intersections at Havana Street and Peoria Street are forecast to operate at LOS E or F during
the PM peak hour. The alternative is forecast to serve approximately 2,800 vehicles in the
westbound direction during the AM peak hour and 2,700 in the eastbound direction during the
PM peak hour. In addition, Alternative 5 is forecast to serve 15 percent less traffic on a daily
basis compared to Alternative 7. This increases the likelihood that traffic volumes in the

Montbello and surrounding neighborhoods will increase as drivers find alternate routes
parallel to 56th Avenue.

Alternative 7: Widen 56th Avenue to Six Lanes from Havana Street to Peña Boulevard peak
hour traffic is forecast to operate at capacity along the length of the study section. The
intersection of Havana Street is forecast to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour. The
alternative is forecast to serve approximately 4,100 vehicles in the westbound direction
during the AM peak hour and 3,700 in the eastbound direction during the PM peak hour. In
addition, Alternative 7 is forecast to serve the highest volumes on a daily basis compared to
the other Corridor Study alternatives. This decreases the likelihood that traffic volumes in
the Montbello and surrounding neighborhoods will increase since most drivers are able to use
56th Avenue to traverse the corridor.

56th Avenue itself is forecast to experience high peak hour directional volumes. This
characteristic of the modeled traffic behavior on 56th Avenue is due in large part to the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge.

The size of the RMANWR severely restricts travel between Quebec Street and Peña Boulevard
from 56th Avenue to 96th Avenue. This creates an excess of demand on both Quebec Street
and 56th Avenue in the peak direction of travel. For all of the alternatives presented here,
these high forecast volumes strain the capacity of the roadway since the predominant portion
of traffic is traveling in only one direction.

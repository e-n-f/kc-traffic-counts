IV.    OLD BUSINESS

       There was none at this time.

V.     NEW BUSINESS

       A. Prospect Hill Neighborhood Traffic Request(s)

          4th Street & Maple Street Multi-way Stop Request: Reid stated the
          Engineering Department had conducted a traffic analysis for the
          intersection of 4th &Maple. There is not a significant line of sight issue,
          the traffic counts were low with an 85th percentile speed around 30 MPH
          and there had been one accident in the past three years (analysis and
          warrants available in the Engineering Department). The warrants were not
          met; therefore, the staff recommendation is not in favor of the multi-way
          stop request.

          Marked Parking Spaces: Reid stated the marked parking spaces are
          normally done in an area with a high turn over of vehicles. The City has
          mostly done these types of spaces in the Downtown area. The markings
          do not last and have to be redone frequently, especially during the winter
          months when the Street Department uses salt on the streets. The staff
          recommendation is not in favor of the marked parking spaces.
Crosswalks on 4th Street: Reid stated the City abides per MUTCD
guidelines which does not encourage the installation of marked crosswalks
at an intersection where there is not a stop control. Maple Street currently
stops for 4th Street and there are marked crosswalks. Ryterband
questioned as to why there is a marked crosswalk on Kirkwood Avenue at
Maple Street where there is not a stop control. Neff stated this crosswalk
is treated as a mid-block crossing and when school is in session there is a
crossing guard. Ryterband asked about the crosswalks around IU. Neff
stated these are also considered mid-block crosswalks and are codified in
the Bloomington Municipal Code. The staff recommendation is not in
favor of the marked crosswalks.

Speed limit reduced to 25 MPH: Reid stated the City is currently
discussing changing the speed limit on certain City streets (i.e. designated
local streets) to 25 MPH city wide. Ryterband asked why only "locally"
designated streets were being looked at. Reid stated these are normally
lower volume streets that would not necessarily require an Engineering
study to be conducted. The staff recommendation is in support of the
request to lower the speed limit to 25 MPH.

 Ryterband asked if the volume and speed counts could have been affected
by the bad weather. Reid stated the City had a small window in which to
do the traffic counts but they had been put out after the roads had been
cleared. Weber asked what the time table was for the implementation of
the city wide 25 MPH change if approved. Reid stated the City Traffic
Department has to have all City signs changed out to a new reflective
material and they could make the change with this project. The City has
received a $100,000 grant through MPO to help with the change out. Neff
stated the City has until 2015 to have all new signs installed.

Chris Sturbaum: He is a resident in the neighborhood. He would like to
thank the City for their support of the neighborhood's request for the
lower speed limit. The request for the multi-way stop at 4th & Maple is
the most important. He understands the warrants are not met but they
have had other stops signs installed without such warrants. There are no
stop signs currently on 4th Street from the Rosehill Cemetery to Rogers
Street. Sturbaum stated that as part of the 3rd Street Traffic Calming
project residents on 4th Street were concerned about the traffic diverting to
their street. The stop sign and marked crosswalks would calm traffic and
be safe for children who walk to Fairview School. Sturbaum stated the
neighborhood made the request about marking the parking spaces because
these markings seemed to slow down traffic on 5th Street when they were
installed.

George Bull ­ 806 W. 4th Street: He lives on the corner and his house was
hit by a car prior to the three year accident limit. There is not a stop sign
from Rosehill to Rogers Street. The neighborhood gets several cut
through traffic from 3rd Street, 2nd Street and 5th Street. The stop sign at
4th & Maple would help the children who get on and off the school bus.
The bus stop is at this intersection. Bull stated he felt the traffic counts
were not accurate since the counters went down after the snow and when it
first started to melt.

Karen Knight ­ W. 3rd Street resident: She is in support of the West 3rd
Street Traffic Calming projects and feels the counts that were presented in
the packet were not accurate. She had counts from July 2010 that were
higher than what was recently presented. Avila asked where the counts
were conducted that Knight had. She stated they were on 4th Street from
Rogers Street to Jackson Street. Avila stated that stretch is more a
commercial area and thinks that is why the counts were higher.

Ken Farrell ­ 815 W. 4th Street: He strongly supports a multi-way stop at
4th & Maple for the same reasons Mr. Bull does. He also feels the counts
were lower due to the snow on the road. Farrell questioned on why some
streets had traffic calming (i.e. Covenanter Drive) and others did not.
Reid stated for a neighborhood to apply for traffic calming, they need to
go through the Neighborhood Traffic Safety Program (NTSP). The traffic
calming on Covenanter Drive and 6th Street was done prior to this
program.

Rachel Gugllelmo ­ 620 W. 4th Street: She has three children and is
concerned about the speed of vehicles. Even though the 85th percentile
speed is 30 MPH what about those cars that go over that. She can't
understand why the Commission would oppose the multi-way stop
request.

Richard Lewis ­ 720 W. 3rd Street: He is in favor of reducing the speed
limit to 25 MPH. There are no stops signs on 4th Street for a long stretch.
The neighborhood gets a lot of cut through traffic from Kirkwood. Lewis
stated that there is a visibility issue on Maple Street as you are looking to
the west. You have to pull out onto 4th Street before you can see if there
are any cars or bicyclists coming. The crosswalks and multi-way stop
would help this problem.

Patrick Murray ­ 525 W. 3rd Street: He is in favor of the multi-way stop
request. This is a safe route to school path to Fairview School as well as
the area being a bus stop for Jr. High & High School students. He likes
the lowering of the speed limit to 25 MPH.

David Walter ­ 6th & Ritter: He does not live in the neighborhood but has
lived in the area for 29 years. He agrees with the residents that the multi-
way stop would be a benefit.
   Weber stated that stop signs are not to be installed for traffic calming. He
   feels there is a problem at the intersection but would like to possibly look
   at other ideas to slow down traffic. Weber stated he feels the intersection
   of 4th & Maple is similar to the intersections on West 6th Street where
   there are traffic calming circles installed.

   Weber made the motion to recommend the denial of the request for
   marked parking spaces on West 4th Street as well as the request for marked
   crosswalks on 4th Street at Maple Street. Neff seconded the motion. The
   motion carried with a vote of 5-1-0 (Ryterband opposed).
   Neff made the motion to recommend the denial of the request for a multi-
   way stop at 4th Street and Maple Street. Weber seconded the motion. The
   motion carried with a vote of 5-1-0 (Ryterband opposed).
   The request for the lower speed limit did not require a vote since the City
   is currently looking at implementing a City wide proposal on certain City
   streets, of which this stretch of 4th Street would be included.

B. West 4th Street from Walnut Street to Gentry Street ­ proposal for
   redesign of on street parking

   Reid stated the City had received a request a couple of months ago from
   the Chocolate Emporium for a handicap parking space in this area. The
   streetscape proposal was brought up at this time and the possibility of
   angled parking on 4th Street from Gentry to the alley just east of College
   Avenue. Reid showed an aerial photo from the 1940s when the parking in
   this area had been angled. Reid stated there are two signal modification
   projects to be done within the next couple of months at 4th & Walnut and
   4th & College and the angled parking could be implemented upon the
   completion. Ryterband stated she thought one of the spaces was to be
   handicap between College and Gentry. She also did not understand why
   the City wanted to put more on street parking in front of the parking
   garage when they were trying to encourage people to use the garages
   more. Avila stated he thought that more people than just those businesses
   in the building (i.e. WFHB and the Waldron Art Center) would benefit
   from these additional on street parking spaces. Weber asked if the
   handicap space would be the first space on the north side of 4th Street just
   west of College Avenue. Reid stated this would be the most ideal
   location. Ryterband stated she is concerned because 4th Street is the path
   for bicyclists to travel from the west side of town to the university. Neff
   stated that the lane widths would stay the same and there would be
   adequate space for bicyclists. Buff Brown stated he feels that the angled
   parking proposal would be an added benefit for pedestrians. He is in favor
   of back in angled parking which is favored among pedestrians and
   bicyclists. The space is not as wide and you do not need a buffer. This
   would allow room for a possible tree plot near the Waldron Art Center.
          Brown stated there could be more parallel spaces added on the south side
          of 4th Street just west of College Avenue. There currently are straight and
          right turn lanes. The right turn lane could be eliminated for the parking.
          Weber asked if the City has ever considered back in angle parking. Reid
          stated they have had discussions about back in angled parking but not on a
          two-way street. Weber made the motion to recommend the approval of
          the request for the West 4th Street parking redesign as presented by the
          Engineering Department. This includes a handicap parking space and
          angled parking. Neff seconded the motion. The motion carried with a
          vote of 5-0-1 (Ryterband abstained).

       C. West 3rd Street from Patterson Drive to Franklin Road/Wynnedale Drive ­
          request for speed limit change

          Reid stated currently the speed along this stretch of W. 3rd Street goes
          from 45 MPH to 40 MPH. The design speed for the West 3rd Street
          project is 40 MPH but the staff recommendation is to lower the speed limit
          to 35 MPH. Batcho stated there is a large volume of traffic that travels
          this road (i.e. large trucks, Mueller Parkway residents) and the lower speed
          limit would be a big benefit. Ryterband questioned on why the speed limit
          is not lowered to 30 MPH. If some speeds were over 50 & 70 MPH when
          the roadway was two lanes the improvements to four lanes will only make
          the speeds worse. Reid stated there is not a visibility issue and the
          proposal is to lower the speed limit than what the design speed is. Kelly
          Huffman, Master Rental, stated he agreed the speed limit should be 30
          MPH. He talked with the City and since they are going to allow u-turns at
          each signal then the lower speed limit could help to eliminate problems
          especially with large vehicles. Huffman feels the 35 MPH limit is too
          high and will only encourage people to use 3rd Street as a drag race to
          reach the next signal. Reid stated the City is currently discussing allowing
          vehicles to make u-turns at the lights. Neff stated if vehicles are allowed
          to make the u-turns they would only be able to do so on a protected left
          turn. Neff made the motion to recommend the approval of the request to
          change the speed limit to 35 MPH on West 3rd Street from Patterson Drive
          to Franklin Road/Wynnedale Drive. Weber seconded the motion. The
          motion carried with a vote of 5-0-1 (Ryterband abstained).

Meeting Date:          February 23, 2011   
 
Subject:               19th Street and Dunn Street Pedestrian Signal 
 
Report:      The  City  of  Bloomington  Engineering  Department  received  a  request  from  Indiana  University 
Transit  for  a  Traffic  Signal  at  the  intersection  of  Dunn  Street  and  19th  Street.   Indiana  University  Transit,  through 
our  Metropolitan  Planning  Organization  (MPO)  received  a  grant  for  improvements  to  the Park  and  Ride  Facility 
located  adjacent  to  Memorial  Stadium.  These  improvements  include  shelters  and  bathroom  facilities  for 
transit  riders,  sidewalks  and  signalization  improvements  to  the  intersection  of  19th  Street  and  Dunn  Street. 
Traffic  counts  were  conducted  in  the  fall  of  2010,  and  pedestrian  warrants  were  met  toward  the  installation 
of  a  traffic  signal.  At  the  same  time  vehicular  volumes  were  not  significant  enough  (on  approach  street/drive) 
to meet the signal warrant. 
      An  H.A.W.K.  (HighIntensity  Activated  CrossWalK)  was  deemed  to  be  a  more  appropriate  signal  to  address 
the  need  as  met  by the  traffic  warrants.  Attached  to  this  memo  is  an  informational  page  better  describing  how 
a  H.A.W.K.  signal  functions,  as  well  as traffic data for this intersection. Staff reviewed the request and conducted 
traffic counts and a review of the warrants to be met for the installation of a traffic signal.  (attached) 
 
Staff supports the usage of the pedestrian signal as opposed to the usage of a full traffic signal at this location as a 
better fit to accommodate the needs of the intersection.

1.0 Executive Summary

The proposed 4,400 square-foot McDonald's will be located in southern Roanoke County,
Virginia, on the southeast quadrant of the US 220 (Franklin Road) at Indian Grave Road
intersection. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the site location. The development will consist of a
McDonald's fast-food restaurant with drive-thru window (ITE land use code 934). As shown in
Table 1, this development is expected to generate approximately 1,434 new daily trips, 111 new
trips during the AM peak hour, and 74 new trips during the PM peak hour.

The study area includes the signalized intersections of US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable
Road and US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane. Also included are two
unsignalized intersections with access to the proposed site: Indian Grave Road at an existing
business driveway and a proposed right-in right-out driveway from US 220.

As currently proposed, the development will moderately increase traffic at these intersections.
The following roadway improvements are recommended to mitigate potential operational issues
and provide for LOS D or better throughout the study area with full build-out of the development
in 2013. A year 2019 analysis was also performed.

Access to the proposed site will be provided via one full-movement entrance onto Indian Grave
Road at the current location of the driveway to an existing business and by one right-in/right-out
driveway onto US 220, as shown on the site plan included in the Appendix.

Key Findings and Conclusions

Description

       The proposed McDonald's restaurant is located in southern Roanoke County, Virginia,
       on US 220 at Indian Grave Road.

       At full build-out in 2013, the development is expected to include a 4,400 square foot fast-
       food restaurant. It is anticipated that the site will generate approximately 1,434 new daily
       trips with 111 new trips in the AM peak hour and 74 new trips in the PM peak hour.

       Two access points will be provided to the development, one right-in/right-out driveway
       on US 220 and one full-movement driveway on Indian Grave Road.

       In 2012, US 220 carries approximately 29,000 vehicles per day in the vicinity of the site,
       Indian Grave Road carries approximately 2,000 vehicles per day in the vicinity of the
       site, and Buck Mountain Road carries approximately 7,000 vehicles per day at US 220.

Existing and Background Level of Service Summary

       Existing (2012) Summary:

               Two signalized intersections and one unsignalized intersection were analyzed in
               the AM and PM peak hours, including US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable
               Road and US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane. Both
               signalized intersections operate at an overall level of service (LOS) C or better in
               both the AM and PM peak hours. However, some lane groups operate at LOS E
               and LOS F. The unsignalized intersection of Indian Grave Road at Business
               Driveway operates at LOS B or better for all movements during the AM and PM
               peak hours.

       2013 and 2019 Background Summary:

               Two signalized intersections and one unsignalized intersection were analyzed in
               the AM and PM peak hours, including US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable
               Road and US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane. Both
               signalized intersections are expected to operate at an overall LOS D or better in
               both the AM and PM peak hours. However, some lane groups will continue to
               operate at LOS E and LOS F. The unsignalized intersection of Indian Grave
               Road at Business Driveway is expected to continue to operate at LOS B or better
               for all movements during the AM and PM peak hours.

        2013 and 2019 Build-out Summary

                Two signalized intersections and two unsignalized intersections were analyzed in
                the AM and PM peak hours, including US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable
                Road and US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane. Both
                signalized intersections are expected to operate at an overall LOS D or better in
                both the AM and PM peak hours. However, some lane groups will continue to
                operate at LOS E and LOS F. The unsignalized intersections of Indian Grave
                Road at Business Driveway and US 220 at Site Driveway are expected to operate
                at LOS B or better for all movements during the AM and PM peak hours.

No off-site pedestrian or bicycle networks are proposed for this development.

2.0 Introduction

The proposed development will be located in southern Roanoke County, Virginia, on US 220 at
Indian Grave Road. The site is bounded to the west by Indian Grave Road, to the north by US
220, and to the south and east by commercial and low-density residential development. Although
it is generally a north/south route, US 220 runs in an approximate east/west direction adjacent to
the site, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, for the purposes of this report, US 220 will be referred
to as the east-west route.

It is anticipated that at full build-out, the proposed development will include a 4,400 square-foot
McDonald's fast-food restaurant with a drive-through window. The latest site plan dated
February 6, 2012, is included in the Appendix.

The anticipated construction and occupancy timeline for full build-out of the proposed
development is approximately 1 year ­ 2013. Currently the land that the proposed development
will occupy is undeveloped.

The purpose of this traffic impact analysis is to examine the potential traffic impacts and required
improvements needed to support the proposed McDonald's. This report has been prepared for
submittal to Roanoke County and Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to evaluate
existing conditions as well as future build-out (2013) and build-out plus 6 years (2019) traffic
conditions that include additional trips associated with the proposed development. The scope was
developed in coordination with VDOT staff.

3.0 Project Background
3.1 Study Area

The study area for this analysis includes the following intersections:

            US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable Road (Signalized)

            US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane (Signalized)

            Indian Grave Road at Business Driveway (Unsignalized)

            US 220 at Site Driveway (Unsignalized)

Current McDonald's development plans include one roadway connection to US 220 and one
roadway connection to Indian Grave Road via an existing business driveway.

3.2 Existing Land Use

The McDonald's site currently is zoned General Commercial (C-2) and is undeveloped. Land use
and development in the study area include commercial and residential uses or undeveloped land.
The proposed zoning will accommodate the proposed development but will require a Special Use
Permit to allow the drive-through.

3.3 Existing Roadway Network

US 220, Buck Mountain Road, and Indian Grave Road are the primary roadways within the study
area. US 220 is a major north/south highway that connects the City of Roanoke to the City of
Greensboro, NC, to the south. Buck Mountain Road is an east/west connector that runs from US
220 west to the community of Starkey. Indian Grave Road is a north/south connector that
extends south from US 220.

Figure 3 depicts the existing laneage for the study area intersections. The following information
provides a short description of existing roadway characteristics of each facility.

        US 220 ­ is a four-lane divided roadway. The posted speed limit is 45 miles per hour
        (mph) within the study area.
        Buck Mountain Road ­ is a two-lane undivided roadway. The posted speed limit is 40
        mph within the study area.

                                                                                      July 9, 2012

        Indian Grave Road ­ is a two-lane undivided roadway. The posted speed limit is 25
        mph within the study area.

3.4 Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities

There are no existing pedestrian or bicycle facilities on any of the primary roadways in the
vicinity of the proposed development.

3.5 Existing Traffic

AM and PM peak hour weekday turning movement counts were performed as follows:

        US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable Road ­ March 21, 2012

        US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane ­ March 20, 2012

        Indian Grave Road and Business Driveway ­ March 20, 2012

Existing count data are provided in the Appendix.

3.6 Transportation Improvements

Based on a review of the VDOT FY 2012-2017 Six-Year Improvement Plan, there are no planned
or programmed roadway improvements within the project area.

4.0 Traffic Generation
Traffic generation potential for the proposed development was determined using traffic
generation rates published in Trip Generation (Institute of Transportation Engineers [ITE], 8th
Edition, 2008).

4.1 Proposed Development Trip Generation

Table 2 summarizes the estimated daily, AM, and PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed
development at full build-out.

Source: ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition



Table 2 indicates the proposed development has the potential to generate approximately 1,434
new daily trips, with approximately 111 of those occurring in the AM peak hour and 74 occurring
in the PM peak hour. During the AM and PM peak hours, approximately 50% of the new daily
trips are accounted for by pass-by traffic. No internal capture trips apply to this development.

4.2 Additional Development Trip Generation

There are four approved but un-built developments in the vicinity of the proposed development:

        Walmart Outparcels

        Clearbrook Lane

        Buck Mountain Road


                                                   10

                                                                                     July 9, 2012

        Slate Hill


Based on discussion with VDOT staff, the future build-out (2013) scenario includes 25% of the
total trips generated by each of these approved developments and the build-out plus six years
(2019) scenario includes 100% of the total trips generated by these approved developments.

5.0 Traffic Distribution and Assignment

The distribution of the peak hour trips generated by the proposed McDonald's was developed
using several variables, including the distribution of population within the area and the roadway
network available to serve the site. The directional distribution and assignment of trips generated
by the proposed development is based on a detailed analysis and review of existing roadway
volumes, an understanding of travel patterns within the study area, and from assumptions of
travel patterns for the proposed land use.

Based on a review of the above-mentioned sources as well as conversations with VDOT staff, the
proposed site traffic distribution was developed for the site. The following trip distribution
pattern applies to the full build-out (2013 and 2019) development conditions:

        50% to/from the west on US 220

        30% to/from the east on US 220

        8% to/from the north on Clearbrook Village Lane

        5% to/from the south on Indian Grave Road

        5% to/from the west on Buck Mountain Road

        2% to/from the north on Stable Road

The anticipated McDonald's development primary site traffic distribution and percent assignment
are illustrated in Figure 4.

6.0 Proposed Site Access

US 220 will be the primary corridor providing access to the proposed development. An existing
business driveway will provide site access from Indian Grave Road. One right-in/right-out
(RIRO) entrance to the development is proposed on US 220 approximately 450 feet east of Indian
Grave Road.

7.0 Projected Traffic Volumes
7.1 Historic Traffic Growth

Historic traffic growth is the increase in traffic volumes due to usage increases and non-specific
growth throughout an area. Based on a review and analysis of VDOT historic traffic count data
within the study area on US 220 and conversations with VDOT staff, traffic on study area
roadways was computed to grow at a rate of approximately 0.5 percent per year in addition to the
growth from the approved but not yet built developments and the subject development.
Supporting documentation for these growth rates is provided in the Appendix.

7.2 2013 and 2019 Build Traffic

Existing traffic counts were conducted in March 2012 and therefore represent 2012 conditions.
To obtain total 2013 and 2016 background traffic volumes, existing 2012 traffic volumes were
grown using the aforementioned compounded annual growth rate.

Per Section 4.2, there are four approved developments in the project vicinity. It is estimated that
25% of the trips generated by these approved developments will be present in 2013 and 100%
will be present in 2019. The projected (2013) AM and PM peak hour background turning
movement volumes are shown on Figure 5 and Figure 6, and the projected (2019) AM and PM
peak hour background turning movement volumes are shown on Figure 7 and Figure 8.

Once the background traffic volumes were established, traffic associated with the proposed
McDonald's development was added to develop build traffic volumes for 2013 and 2019. The
future (2013) AM and PM peak hour build-out turning movement volumes are shown on Figure
9 and Figure 10, and the future (2019) AM and PM peak hour build-out turning movement
volumes are shown on Figure 11 and Figure 12.

8.0 Intersection Operational Analysis

Capacity analyses at the intersections in the AM and PM peak hours ( Appendix) were performed
for the following scenarios:

        Existing 2012

        2013 Background

        2013 Build-out with the proposed development

        2019 Background

        2019 Build-out with the proposed development

Analyses were completed to determine the operating characteristics of study area intersections
and roadways using Synchro Version 7.0, which uses methodologies contained in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) [TRB Special Report 209, 2000]. The measure of
effectiveness provided by Synchro includes level of service (LOS) and its corresponding control
delay, which is expressed in seconds per vehicle.

Signal timings from the Buck Mountain Road Development TIA performed by Ramey Kemp &
Associates, Inc. in April 2010 were used for the Existing 2012 scenario. The cycle lengths were
retained for the 2013 and 2019 scenarios, but the splits were optimized in Synchro.

Intersection turning movement counts were used with information about the number of lanes and
traffic control to determine existing and future levels of service. Level of service (LOS) describes
traffic conditions ­ the amount of traffic congestion ­ at an intersection or on a roadway. LOS
ranges from A to F ­ A indicating a condition of little or no congestion and F a condition with
severe congestion, unstable traffic flow, and stop-and-go conditions. For intersections, LOS is
based on the average delay experienced by all traffic using the intersection during the busiest
(peak) 15 minute period. LOS A through D are generally considered satisfactory based on
standard industry practice. Each of the aforementioned scenarios was analyzed during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours. Synchro intersection level of service results are illustrated in
the following figures:

        Figure 13 - 2012 Existing LOS

        Figure 14 - 2013 Background LOS

                                                                                      July 9, 2012

        Figure 16 - 2019 Background LOS

        Figure 17 - 2019 Build-out LOS

Performance analyses were also completed using SimTraffic microsimulation with Synchro
Version 7.0. The network was seeded for 15 minutes and the simulation was run for 60 minutes
ten times for each scenario in the AM and PM peak hours. It should be noted that several delay
results differ drastically between the Synchro and SimTraffic output, particularly in the 2019
conditions. These differences may be a result of the differences in the way Synchro and
SimTraffic calculate delays. Observations of SimTraffic simulations indicate that the movements
with long reported delays did not experience as much delay as reported. The SimTraffic output
generally appears to provide both absolute and relative delay values that are inconsistent with
Synchro analyses, traffic volumes, and observations of SimTraffic simulation conditions.


Queuing analyses were also completed using SimTraffic simulations. The maximum queue was
compared with existing and proposed turn lane storage lengths to determine whether the existing
storage lengths have sufficient capacity to accommodate the computed peak hour queues.
Because SimTraffic did not report queues for the proposed intersection of US 220 at Site
Driveway, the 95th % queues from Synchro are reported for the proposed intersection.

            8.1 US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable Road

            This signalized intersection currently includes the following lane configuration:

                     US 220 (eastbound) ­ two left-turn lanes with 350 feet of storage, two through lanes, and
                     one channelized right-turn lane with 200 feet of storage

                     US 220 (westbound) ­ one left-turn lane with 650 feet of storage, one through lane and
                     one shared through-right lane

                     Buck Mountain Road (northbound) ­ one left-turn lane with 125 feet of storage, one
                     shared left-through lane, and one right-turn lane

                     Stable Road (southbound) ­ one shared left-through-right lane

            Tables 3A and 3B show levels of service and delay for the intersection under existing (2012),
            projected (2013) background and build-out, and projected (2019) background and build-out
            conditions using Synchro and SimTraffic, respectively. Table 3C shows the maximum queue

           Synchro analysis indicates that the intersection operates at an overall LOS D or better but with
           some movements operating at LOS E and LOS F for all analysis conditions. Several results differ
           drastically between the Synchro and SimTraffic output. Specifically, the eastbound through
           movement experiences 39.9 seconds of delay per vehicle and 40.9 seconds of delay per vehicle
           for the 2019 Background PM condition and the 2019 Build PM condition respectively according
           to Synchro. This represents an increase of 2.5% in delay from Background to Build-out. This is
           relatively consistent with the volume increase from background to build-out (19 vehicles, or a
           1.2% increase) for this movement. Based on the SimTraffic output, however, the eastbound
           through movement experiences 234.3 seconds of delay per vehicle and 270.1 seconds of delay per
           vehicle in the 2019 Background PM condition and 2019 Build PM condition respectively, an


                                                                                    32
                                                                                 McDonald's Roanoke
                                                                                         July 9, 2012

increase of 15.3% in delay from background to Build-out. This amount of increase in delay for a
movement with such a small increase in volume is inconsistent with the fact that the cycle length
(180 seconds) and all splits remain the same in both background and build-out conditions.
Observations of SimTraffic simulations of the 2019 Build PM condition did not indicate that the
eastbound through volumes experienced as much delay as is reported in the SimTraffic delay
report.

The SimTraffic maximum queues for the eastbound right-turn movement exceed the storage
length in the PM peak hour in all scenarios. However, this is due to through traffic blocking
access to the right turn lane. The average maximum queues for this movement never exceed 78
feet, so right turn queues are not expected to spill out of the right-turn lane into the through lanes.
The northbound left-turn queues also exceed the storage length but may be accommodated by the
existing taper. No roadway improvements are recommended at this intersection.

8.2 US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane

This signalized intersection currently includes the following lane configuration:

          US 220 (eastbound) ­ one left-turn lane 250 feet of storage, two through lanes, and one
          right-turn lane with 175 feet of storage

          US 220 (westbound) ­ one left-turn lane with 225 feet of storage, two through lanes, and
          one right-turn lane with 275 feet of storage

          Indian Grave Road (northbound) ­ one left-turn lane and one shared through-right lane

          Clearbrook Village Lane (southbound) ­ one left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage, a
          shared left-through lane, one right-turn lane, and one right-turn lane with 300 feet of
          storage

Tables 4A and 4B show levels of service and delay for the intersection under existing (2012),
projected (2013) background and build-out, and projected (2019) background and build-out
conditions using Synchro and SimTraffic, respectively. Table 4C shows maximum queue results
under existing (2012), projected (2013) background and build-out, and projected (2019)
background and build-out conditions from SimTraffic.

All queue lengths are in feet.
(*) Represents one right-turn bay and one continuous right-turn lane.



Analysis indicates that the intersection operates at an overall LOS D or better but with some
movements operating at LOS E or LOS F for all analysis conditions. The eastbound left queues
are projected to be greater than the storage length in the 2019 PM peak hour conditions.
However, SimTraffic reports that the average maximum queues are substantially shorter. Due to
through traffic blocking the westbound right turn lane, right turn queues are reported to be much
longer than those observed via SimTraffic. SimTraffic indicates that the maximum observed
queues for the westbound right-turn movement increase by 89 feet in the PM peak hour from
background to build-out in the year 2019 even though it also indicates that the delay for this
movement will decrease. Regardless, queues for this movement are not expected to spill out of
the right-turn lane into the through lanes. Queues for the southbound left may also exceed the
available storage in the 2019 scenarios but can be accommodated via the shared left/through lane.
No roadway improvements are recommended at this intersection.

                      The westbound approach of the Business Driveway is currently stop-controlled. Analysis
                      indicates that the stop-controlled critical movements - the westbound left and right turns - operate
                      at LOS C or better for all analysis conditions. Northbound queues on Indian Grave Road from
                      US 220 may extend through this intersection in the 2013 and 2019 conditions. However, the
                      business driveway is only expected to become blocked for a short duration during the AM and
                      PM peak hours as the maximum queues represent the longest queue observed during the
                      SimTraffic analysis. To mitigate the northbound queues on Indian Grave Road from US 220


                                                                                                              36

extending past the business driveway, the northbound stop bar may be moved further north
approximately 30 feet since it is currently set back significantly from the intersection. Based on
turn lane warrants performed in accordance with the VDOT Road Design Manual for the
intersection under the 2013 and 2019 build-out traffic conditions, no turn lanes are required at this
intersection.

8.4 US 220 at Site Driveway

A right-in/right-out driveway that will be shared with future development east of the site is
proposed on US 220 east of Indian Grave Road. At the location of the proposed driveway, US
220 currently includes the following lane configuration:

        US 220 (eastbound) ­ two through lanes

        US 220 (westbound) ­ two through lanes

Tables 6A and 6B show levels of service and delay for the intersection under projected (2013)
build-out and projected (2019) build-out conditions using Synchro and SimTraffic, respectively.
Table 6C shows the Synchro 95th percentile queue results under projected (2013) build-out and
projected (2019) build-out conditions from SimTraffic.

                  95th % queues from Sy nchro; SimTraffic does not report queues for this intersection.


The northbound approach of the Site Driveway will be stop-controlled. Analysis indicates that
the stop-controlled critical movement - the northbound right turns - are expected to operate at
LOS B or better for the Build-out traffic conditions. No queuing issues are expected at this
intersection. Based on turn lane warrants performed in accordance with the VDOT Road Design
Manual for the intersection under the 2013 and 2019 build-out traffic conditions, the eastbound
right-turn on US 220 meets criteria for a full turn lane with 200 feet of storage and a 200 foot
taper. However, it should be noted that there may not be adequate spacing between Indian Grave
Road and the Site Driveway to provide the full 200 feet of taper. The following improvements
are recommended at this intersection based on VDOT turn lane warrants:

        Provide a northbound channelized right-turn lane on the Site Driveway

        Provide an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane on US 220 with 200 feet of storage and
        up to 200 feet of taper

It should be noted that based on the proposed site plan, ample storage is being provided between
the McDonald's drive-through and the driveway on US 220.

8.6 Access Management

Per VDOT access management regulations for minor arterials with a posted speed limit of 45
miles per hour, partial access entrances must be spaced 305 feet apart (centerline to centerline).
The spacing between the proposed right-in/right-out driveway on US 220 and Indian Grave Road
is approximately 450 feet, which meets VDOT requirements. Indian Grave Road is a local street,
so VDOT regulations do not apply for the spacing between the Business Driveway and US 220.

9.0 Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the potential traffic impacts associated with the McDonald's development and the
evaluation of those impacts for full build-out (2013) and build-out plus 6 years (2019) conditions,
the following recommendations and conclusions are offered.

9.1 Improvements Needed as a Result of McDonald's

US 220 at Buck Mountain Road / Stable Road

The existing US 220 at Buck Mountain / Stable Road intersection operates at LOS D or better and
queuing conditions that do not exceed capacity and is projected to continue to do so under 2013
and 2019 build-out conditions. No roadway improvements are recommended at this intersection.

US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane

The existing US 220 at Indian Grave Road / Clearbrook Village Lane intersection operates at
LOS D or better and is projected to do so under 2013 and 2019 build-out conditions. Queues for
the eastbound left-turn movement may exceed the available storage in the 2019 PM peak hour
conditions. However, the proposed development will not impact that movement, and this turn
lane cannot be extended without reducing the storage for the westbound left at Buck Mountain
Road. To mitigate northbound queues extending past the business driveway to the south, it is
recommended that the stop bar for the northbound through/right lane be moved north
approximately 30 feet to provide additional storage.

Indian Grave Road at Business Driveway

The existing Indian Grave Road at Business Driveway intersection operates at LOS D or better
and is projected to do so under 2013 and 2019 build-out conditions. Therefore, no improvements
are recommended at this intersection.

US 220 at Site Driveway

The proposed US 220 at Site Driveway intersection is projected to operate at LOS D or better
under 2013 and 2019 build-out conditions. However, the eastbound right-turn movement is
expected to meet VDOT storage and taper warrants. The following improvements are
recommended at this intersection:

        Provide a northbound channelized right-turn lane on the Site Driveway

                                                                                   July 9, 2012

        Provide an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane on US 220 with 200 feet of storage and
        up to 200 feet of taper (as much as constructible)

No off-site pedestrian or bicycle networks are proposed for this development. Figure 18 depicts
the recommended roadway laneage for the study area intersections.

Re:       Traffic Impact Analysis
          Proposed McDonald's Development at Franklin Road and Indian Grave Road
          Roanoke County, Virginia

Dear Mr. McPherson:

The following assumptions are provided for your review and comment. After receipt of VDOT
comments, we will use these assumptions to complete a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) for the
proposed development to assess its potential impact at the study intersections. The proposed
4,400 SF McDonald's will be located on the southeast quadrant of the Franklin Road and
Indian Grave Road signalized intersection in Roanoke County, Virginia (see Figure 1 ­
Vicinity Map, Figure 2 ­ Site Location Map, and Figure 3 ­ Site Plan).

NOTE: This TIA will be exempt from the VDOT Traffic Impact Regulations (Chapter 527) for
special use permit submittal since the proposed development does not exceed Chapter 527 trip
generation thresholds (5,000 trips per day). The proposed 4,400 SF McDonald's development
(ITE land use code 934) generates 2,184 trips per day, 217 AM peak hour trips, and 149 PM
peak hour trips in the peak hour of adjacent street traffic.

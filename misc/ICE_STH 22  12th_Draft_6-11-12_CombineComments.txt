Introduction
This report provides an evaluation of the intersection of State Trunk Highway (STH) 22 (also
known as Main Street) and 12th Street located in the City of Clintonville, Waupaca County,
Wisconsin (Refer to Exhibits 1 and 2 Г Project Location Maps in Appendix A). The study
includes an evaluation of peak hour traffic operations, estimations of future traffic volumes at the
intersection, traffic control warrant studies, alternative traffic control evaluations, and a crash
evaluation.
The operational analysis, crash evaluation and warrant study were conducted for the STH 22 and
12th Street intersection to determine the expected weekday morning, weekday midday and
weekday evening peak hour operating conditions and recommendations for the intersection. The
intersection was evaluated for the existing signal control and proposed roundabout control under
the existing year 2012 and the projected year 2025 and 2035 traffic volume scenarios. This
report documents the procedures, findings, and conclusion of the intersection control evaluation.
Recommended improvements were identified considering existing intersection geometrics and
additional traffic expected to be generated by the local community and nearby businesses.
The construction costs listed in this document were based on 2012 dollars. The R/W needs and
costs listed in this document covers new fee. Temporary Limited Easements (TLE) would also
be required; however, costs for the TLE would be neglible so the totals were not included.

Study Area Intersection
STH 22 project corridor is a two-lane undivided urban highway. STH 22 serves as the main
northbound and southbound roadway in Clintonville. The east leg of 12th Street is a local street
and the west leg of 12th Street is County Highway C. The intersection of 12th Street with STH 22
is close to a 90░ angle. Both STH 22 and 12th Street are posted as 25 miles per hour leading up
to, and through, the intersection.
On-street parking is allowed on both sides of the street for STH 22 and for 12th Street. However,
parking is restricted immediately next to the intersection on all 4 legs. There are no designated
bike lanes on STH 22 nor on 12th Street. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street for
STH 22 and for 12th Street.
The property located in the northeast quadrant of the intersection is the Post Office with one
access off of 12th Street. The properties located in the southeast quadrant are all commercial
businesses with store fronts immediately at the back of the sidewalk. The property located in the
southwest quadrant is a strip mall with a large parking lot adjacent to the roadway right of way.
They have one access point off of STH 22 and one off of 12th Street. The property located in the
northwest quadrant is a bank with one access point off of STH 22 and two access points off of
12th Street.
                 STH 22 is a
                 designated                         This intersection is located within the
                 Wisconsin Long                     connecting highway limits.

Safety
A Safety Screening Analysis was completed in March, 2012, by the WisDOT Traffic Section.
Very few crashes have occurred at the STH 22 and 12th Street intersection. Only two crashes
occurred between 2005 and 2010. One was an angle crash and one was a left turn angle crash.
Both occurred in 2006. The Safety Screening Analysis concluded that the intersection is not
considered a safety problem.

Operation and Maintenance Cost Assumptions
Operation and maintenance costs can vary significantly for various design elements of a project,
at times becoming a significant decision factor in alternative selection. For this project, the
operation and maintenance costs do not play a large role in determining the type of control to be
used at the intersection of STH 22 and 12th Street since the total yearly costs are similar between
the alternatives. The following are assumptions used to generate the comparison between the
intersection controls assuming a single lane on each approach for comparison purposes:
Overhead Street Lights:
     Assume 150 KW HPS Street Lights. Assume 550 KWH per year at $0.12 per KWH = $66
     per year for electricity per bulb.
     Maintenance/Bulb Replacement - $800 per bulb life (includes equipment and
     labor/overhead) assumes 4 year life (5 replacements) = $200 per year.
     Assume 10% of poles will be knocked down over the design life and need replacement.
     o Cost per pole is estimated at $2000 at 10% = $200/20 years = $10 per year.
     TOTAL PER STREET LIGHT - $276 per light per year.
Traffic Signals:
     Assume LED lighted intersection, 3 signal heads for each approach (12 total), 12 vehicular
     signals at 10 watts/hr and 8 pedestrian signals at 8 watts/hr = approximately 184 watts/hr
     per intersection = 1,612 KWH per year per intersection. Assume $0.12 per KWH = $193
     per year per intersection for power consumption.
     Cost per bulb replacement = $200 per bulb (includes labor/overhead and assumes more
     than one bulb changed for each trip) = $200 per bulb life with 44 bulbs per intersection and
     4 replacements (5 year average life) = $35,200/20 years = $1,760 per year per intersection.
     Signal Retiming/Adjustments - $1500 per occurrence with two re-timings during life =
     $3000 per intersection/20 years = $150 per year.
     Assume 1 signal pole per intersection will be knocked down over the design life and need
     replacement = $10,000/20 years = $500 per year.
     TOTAL PER SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION = $2,603 per year per intersection.
Signs (Assume sign is replaced every 8 years). Therefore cost per intersection is:
     Signalized:
      o No additional signs required.



                                                                                         Page 3 of 6
     Single Lane Roundabout:
      o 8 signs (four yield signs, four roundabout ahead signs) @ $200 per sign at 2.5
         replacements in 20 years = $4000 or $200 per year.
Landscape Maintenance:
     The primary difference for landscape maintenance between each alternative is the
     landscape maintenance of the center island of a roundabout. Assume 10% of the cost of
     landscaping per year for maintenance and replacement of plant material. This provides
     replacement of plant materials once during the 20 year design life, with the remainder of
     the costs spent on mowing, mulching, etc. Assume $10,000 is spent on the initial
     landscaping elements resulting in $1000 per year for maintenance.
Pavement marking differences between the various alternatives are minor so differences in
annual maintenance costs were not calculated.

Existing Traffic Signal Control
The intersection of STH 22 and 12th Street currently has a pre-timed signal control and the NB
movement is coordinated with the intersection to the South, STH 22 and 8th Street. Table 1 on
the next page provides the results of an operational analysis of existing roadway geometrics and
traffic control (pre-timed traffic signal) with current and forecasted traffic volumes.
This intersection will operate at acceptable levels of service through forecasted 2035 travel
conditions. Minor signal timing modifications may be required in the PM peak hour in 2035.
The existing corner radii in all four quadrants do not accommodate WB-50 through WB-65
trucks turning right without encroachment into the opposing lanes on the receiving leg of the
movements. The largest vehicle that can turn right with no encroachment is a WB-40 truck.
Increasing the corners on the east side is not recommended. The east leg is not designated as a
truck route and the City of Clintonville has the route signed as prohibiting trucks. Also, the
city's Public Works Manager does not favor increasing the east corners.
Increasing the corners on the west leg is recommended. The west leg of 12th Street is also CTH
C and is designated as a truck route. The city's Public Works Manager does favor increasing the
west corners. The signals in the west corners have been clipped by trucks a few times and the
city has replaced or repaired the signals at least 3 to 4 times. Increasing the corners to
accommodate WB-65's would likely require channelized right turn islands resulting in a
significantly wider intersection. In addition to the significant impacts to the corner properties, the
wide intersection would require the removal of on-street parking stalls near the intersection.
Since the number of trucks turning right is very low (only 3 total during a 16-hour period onto
and from the west leg), increasing the corner radii to accommodate WB-65 trucks are not
recommended. However, accommodating a WB-50 truck on the west corners is recommended.
Widening the west corners to accommodate WB-50 trucks can be accomplished with little
impacts to the corner properties. Refer to the exhibit in Appendix A for a layout of the signalized
alternative.

The traffic signal control will require a minor amount of R/W from all three of the four corners
surrounding the intersection. Approximately 218 sf of R/W at an approximate cost of $500 will
be required in to accommodate the widening and realignment of the sidewalks.
The probable construction cost for the traffic signal control intersection is estimated at $236,960.

Roundabout Control
Roundabout control is expected to provide LOS A traffic operations with minimal queuing at all
approaches under the existing 2012 and projected 2025 and 2035 volumes.
The roundabout control will require R/W from all four properties surrounding the intersection.
Approximately 10,870 sf of R/W at an approximate cost of $1,300,000 to $1,500,000 will be
required in order to accommodate the roundabout.
This alternative will have significant impacts to the surrounding properties resulting in the
acquisition and relocation of seven commercial businesses, including the post office. The
acquisition of the buildings is the reason the real estate cost listed above is so high. This
alternative will also require loss in parking in the parking lot for the strip mall in the southwest
corner and in the parking lot for the bank in the northwest quadrant. The impacts to the property
accesses are also significant. Both the strip mall in the southwest quadrant and the bank in the
northwest quadrant will lose an access off of 12th Street.
The probable construction cost for the roundabout control intersection is estimated at $744,100.

Recommendations
Converting the intersection to a roundabout control will have significant impacts to the existing
properties surrounding the intersection including the acquisition and relocation of seven
commercial properties. One of the properties includes the Post Office. The real estate costs for
the roundabout option would reach up to $1,500,000. Also, the removal of the post office and
six businesses from the downtown area of Clintonville could have an adverse effect on the
downtown economic viability.

Replacing the existing traffic signal control with new traffic signals provides acceptable traffic
operations with high Level of Service for all intersection approaches through the year 2035.
Also, widening the west corners slightly to accommodate WB-50 trucks so they don't encroach
into the opposing lanes, along with making minor adjustments to the sidewalks near the
intersection to provide adequate room for the signal equipment and pedestrians, are
recommended to be included with this alternative. Replacing the existing traffic signal control
with new traffic signals, and modifying the geometrics as mentioned above, is the recommended
alternative.

Practical Feasibility




                        west corners have been clipped by trucks a few times and the city has
                        replaced or repaired the signals at least 3 to 4 times. Increasing the corners
                        to accommodate WB-65's would likely require channelized right turn
                        islands resulting in a significantly wider intersection. In addition to the
                        significant impacts to the corner properties, the wide intersection would
                        require the removal of on-street parking stalls near the intersection. Since
                        the number of trucks turning right is very low (only 3 total during a 16-hour
                        period onto and from the west leg), increasing the corner radii to
                        accommodate WB-65 trucks are not recommended. However,
                        accommodating a WB-50 truck on the west corners is recommended.
                        Widening the west corners to accommodate WB-50 trucks can be
                        accomplished with little impacts to the corner properties.

                        Minor modifications to the sidewalks to better accommodate pedestrian
                        traffic and provide room for the signal equipment is recommended and
                        included in this alternative.

                        The LOS of all 4 legs of the intersection will remain high through the 2035
                        traffic volumes.

Introduction
This report provides an evaluation of the intersection of State Trunk Highway (STH) 22 (also
known as Main Street) and 12th Street located in the City of Clintonville, Waupaca County,
Wisconsin (Refer to Exhibits 1 and 2 Г Project Location Maps in Appendix A). The study
includes an evaluation of peak hour traffic operations, estimations of future traffic volumes at the
intersection, traffic control warrant studies, alternative traffic control evaluations, and a crash
evaluation.
The operational analysis, crash evaluation and warrant study were conducted for the STH 22 and
12th Street intersection to determine the expected weekday morning, weekday midday and
weekday evening peak hour operating conditions and recommendations for the intersection. The
intersection was evaluated for the existing signal control and proposed roundabout control under
the existing year 2012 and the projected year 2025 and 2035 traffic volume scenarios. This
report documents the procedures, findings, and conclusion of the intersection control evaluation.
Recommended improvements were identified considering existing intersection geometrics and
additional traffic expected to be generated by the local community and nearby businesses.
The construction costs listed in this document were based  on 2012 dollars.

Study Area Intersection
STH 22 project corridor is a two-lane undivided urban highway. STH 22 serves as the main
northbound and southbound roadway in Clintonville. The east leg of 12th Street is a local street
and the west leg of 12th Street is County Highway C. The intersection of 12th Street with STH 22
is close to a 90░ angle. Both STH 22 and 12th Street are posted as 25 miles per hour leading up
to, and through, the intersection.
On-street parking is allowed on both sides of the street for STH 22 and for 12th Street. However,
parking is restricted immediately next to the intersection on all 4 legs. There are no designated
bike lanes on STH 22 nor on 12th Street. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street for
STH 22 and for 12th Street.
The property located in the northeast quadrant of the intersection is the Post Office with one
access off of 12th Street. The properties located in the southeast quadrant are all commercial
businesses with store fronts immediately at the back of the sidewalk. The property located in the
southwest quadrant is a strip mall with a large parking lot adjacent to the roadway right of way.
They have one access point off of STH 22 and one off of 12th Street. The property located in the
northwest quadrant is a bank with one access point off of STH 22 and two access points off of
12th Street.

Safety
A Safety Screening Analysis was completed in March, 2012, by the WisDOT Traffic Section.
Very few crashes have occurred at the STH 22 and 12th Street intersection. Only two crashes
occurred between 2005 and 2010. One was an angle crash and one was a left turn angle crash.
Both occurred
         whatinare2006. The Safety Screening Analysis concluded that the intersection is not

considered a safety problem.

Operation and Maintenance Cost Assumptions
Operation and maintenance costs can vary significantly for various design elements of a project,
at times becoming a significant decision factor in alternative selection. For this project, the
operation and maintenance costs do not play a large role in determining the type of control to be
used at the intersection of STH 22 and 12th Street since the total yearly costs are similar between
the alternatives. The following are assumptions used to generate the comparison between the
intersection controls assuming a single lane on each approach for comparison purposes:
Overhead Street Lights:
     Assume 150 KW HPS Street Lights. Assume 550 KWH per year at $0.12 per KWH = $66
     per year for electricity per bulb.
     Maintenance/Bulb Replacement - $800 per bulb life (includes equipment and
     labor/overhead) assumes 4 year life (5 replacements) = $200 per year.
     Assume 10% of poles will be knocked down over the design life and need replacement.
     o Cost per pole is estimated at $2000 at 10% = $200/20 years = $10 per year.
     TOTAL PER STREET LIGHT - $276 per light per year.
Traffic Signals:
     Assume LED lighted intersection, 3 signal heads for each approach (12 total), 12 vehicular
     signals at 10 watts/hr and 8 pedestrian signals at 8 watts/hr = approximately 184 watts/hr
     per intersection = 1,612 KWH per year per intersection. Assume $0.12 per KWH = $193
     per year per intersection for power consumption.
     Cost per bulb replacement = $200 per bulb (includes labor/overhead and assumes more
     than one bulb changed for each trip) = $200 per bulb life with 44 bulbs per intersection and
     4 replacements (5 year average life) = $35,200/20 years = $1,760 per year per intersection.
     Signal Retiming/Adjustments - $1500 per occurrence with two re-timings during life =
     $3000 per intersection/20 years = $150 per year.
     Assume 1 signal pole per intersection will be knocked down over the design life and need
     replacement = $10,000/20 years = $500 per year.
     TOTAL PER SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION = $2,603 per year per intersection.
Signs (Assume sign is replaced every 8 years). Therefore cost per intersection is:
     Signalized:
      o No additional signs required.



                                                                                         Page 3 of 6
     Single Lane Roundabout:
      o 8 signs (four yield signs, four roundabout ahead signs) @ $200 per sign at 2.5
         replacements in 20 years = $4000 or $200 per year.
Landscape Maintenance:
       The primary difference for landscape maintenance between each alternative is the
             howmaintenance
       landscape   about a      of the center island of a roundabout. Assume 10% of the cost of
             separate   section
       landscaping per year  for maintenance and replacement of plant material. This provides
             that explains
       replacement  of plant what
                             materials once during the 20 year design life, with the remainder of
             the  existing traffic mulching, etc. Assume $10,000 is spent on the initial
       the costs spent on mowing,
             signalelements
       landscaping   and system
                              resulting in $1000 per year for maintenance.

            refer to table 1
The intersection of STH 22 and 12th Street currently has a pre-timed signal control and the NB
movement is coordinated with the intersection to the South, STH 22 and 8th Street. Table 1 on
the next page provides the results of an operational analysis of existing roadway geometrics and
traffic control (pre-timed traffic signal) with current and forecasted traffic volumes.
This intersection will operate at acceptable levels of service through forecasted 2035 travel
conditions. Minor signal timing modifications may be required in the PM peak hour in 2035.

     lanes? The largest vehicle that can turn right with no encroachment is a WB-40 truck.
Increasing the corners on the east side is not recommended. The east leg is not designated as a
truck route and the City of Clintonville has the route signed as prohibiting trucks. Also, the
city's Public Works Manager does not favor increasing the east corners.
Increasing the corners on the west leg is recommended. The west leg of 12th Street is also CTH
C and is designated as a truck route. The city's Public Works Manager does favor increasing the
west corners. The signals in the west corners have been clipped by trucks a few times and the
city has replaced or repaired the signals at least 3 to 4 times. Increasing the corners to
accommodate WB-65's would likely require channelized right turn islands resulting in a
significantly wider intersection. In addition to the significant impacts to the corner properties, the
wide intersection would require the removal of on-street parking stalls near the intersection.
Since the number of trucks turning right is very low (only 3 total during a 16-hour period onto
and from the west leg), increasing the corner radii to accommodate WB-65 trucks are not
recommended. However, accommodating a WB-50 truck on the west corners is recommended.
Widening the west corners to accommodate WB-50 trucks can be accomplished with little
impacts to the corner properties. Refer to the exhibit in Appendix A for a layout of the signalized
alternative.



                                                                                           Page 4 of 6
The traffic signal control will require a minor amount of R/W from all three of the four corners
surrounding the intersection. Approximately 218 sf of R/W at an approximate cost of $500 will
be required in to accommodate the widening and realignment of the sidewalks.
The probable construction cost for the traffic signal control intersection is estimated at $236,960.

Roundabout Control
Roundabout control is expected to provide LOS A traffic operations with minimal queuing at all
approaches under the existing 2012 and projected 2025 and 2035 volumes.
The roundabout control will require R/W from all four properties surrounding the intersection.
Approximately 10,870 sf of R/W at an approximate cost of $1,300,000 to $1,500,000 will be
required in order to accommodate the roundabout.
This alternative will have significant impacts to the surrounding properties resulting in the
acquisition and relocation of seven commercial businesses, including the post office. The
acquisition of the buildings is the reason the real estate cost listed above is so high. This
alternative will also require loss in parking in the parking lot for the strip mall in the southwest
corner and in the parking lot for the bank in the northwest quadrant. The impacts to the property
accesses are also significant. Both the strip mall in the southwest quadrant and the bank in the
northwest quadrant will lose an access off of 12th Street.
The probable construction cost for the roundabout control intersection is estimated at $744,100.

Recommendations
Converting the intersection to a roundabout control will have significant impacts to the existing
properties surrounding the intersection including the acquisition and relocation of seven
commercial properties. One of the properties includes the Post Office. The real estate costs for
the roundabout option would reach up to $1,500,000. Also, the removal of the post office and
six businesses from the downtown area of Clintonville could have an adverse effect on the
downtown economic viability.

Replacing the existing traffic signal control with new traffic signals provides acceptable traffic
operations with high Level of Service for all intersection approaches through the year 2035.
Also, widening the west corners slightly to accommodate WB-50 trucks so they don't encroach
into the opposing lanes, along with making minor adjustments to the sidewalks near the
intersection to provide adequate room for the signal equipment and pedestrians, are
recommended to be included with this alternative. Replacing the existing traffic signal control
with new traffic signals, and modifying the geometrics as mentioned above, is the recommended
alternative.

Practical Feasibility




                        west corners have been clipped by trucks a few times and the city has
                        replaced or repaired the signals at least 3 to 4 times. Increasing the corners
                        to accommodate WB-65's would likely require channelized right turn
                        islands resulting in a significantly wider intersection. In addition to the
                        significant impacts to the corner properties, the wide intersection would
                        require the removal of on-street parking stalls near the intersection. Since
                        the number of trucks turning right is very low (only 3 total during a 16-hour
                        period onto and from the west leg), increasing the corner radii to
                        accommodate WB-65 trucks are not recommended. However,
                        accommodating a WB-50 truck on the west corners is recommended.
                        Widening the west corners to accommodate WB-50 trucks can be
                        accomplished with little impacts to the corner properties.

                        Minor modifications to the sidewalks to better accommodate pedestrian
                        traffic and provide room for the signal equipment is recommended and
                        included in this alternative.

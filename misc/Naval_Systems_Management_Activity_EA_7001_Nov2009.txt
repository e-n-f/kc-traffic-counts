                                   Abstract

This environmental assessment (EA) evaluates the potential impacts on the
human environment of relocating the Navy Systems Management Activity (NSMA)
from several locations in Arlington County, VA to a new, consolidated
facility at Naval Support Facility (NSF) Anacostia in the District of
Columbia. The proposed relocation is to comply with the Base Realignment and
Closure (BRAC) Act of 2005. In addition to the No Action Alternative, two
alternatives are considered in the EA: the Anacostia Alternative (preferred),
which would construct the new facility on a site at NSF Anacostia near the
intersection of Brookley Avenue and Thomas Road; and the Bellevue
Alternative, which would construct the new facility on a vacant parcel of
Bellevue Navy Housing. Neither action alternative would result in significant
adverse impacts on the human environment. Preparation of an environmental
impact statement is not required.

Executive Summary

This environmental assessment (EA) has been prepared pursuant to
Section 102 (2) (c) of the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) (42 USC 4331 et seq.), the regulations issued by the
President's   Council   on  Environmental   Quality  (CEQ)   for
implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR 1500-
1508), and the Department of the Navy's NEPA procedures
contained in 32 CFR 775.


ES.1 Proposed Action
The proposed action is to relocate the Navy Systems Management
Activity (NSMA)'s 800 personnel, equipment, and programs from
their current, various locations in Arlington County, VA, to
Naval Support Facility (NSF) Anacostia in Washington, DC. To
accommodate the agency, a new facility would be constructed,
consisting of two elements: an administrative building and a
warehouse. The agency would occupy the new facility by September
2011.

The administrative building would provide approximately 160,000
gross square feet of space, with a footprint of approximately
32,000 square feet. The warehouse would be approximately 23,000
square   feet  in   size.   Both   buildings  would  incorporate
sustainable design features sufficient to obtain a Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) "Silver" rating. They
would also incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) features
consistent with the Navy's goal of no net increase in stormwater
volume and in sediment and nutrient loadings for major
renovation and construction projects.


ES.2   Purpose and Need
The purpose and need for the proposed relocation of NSMA to NSF
Anacostia is to comply with the Base Realignment and Closure
(BRAC) Act of 2005, which mandates that Navy organizations
currently in leased space in Arlington County, VA be relocated
to DoD-owned facilities in the National Capital Region.

ES.3      Alternatives
ES.3.1     Reasonableness Criteria

Three criteria were used      to    evaluate   the   reasonableness   of
potential alternatives:

   ·   Criterion 1 ­ The alternative must comply with the 2005 BRAC
       mandate to relocate NSMA to a DoD-owned facility in the
       National Capital Region.

   ·   Criterion 2 ­ The alternative must provide adequate
       administrative   and  warehousing   space  that meets the
       operational and security requirements of NSMA.

   ·   Criterion 3 ­ The administrative building and the warehouse
       must be as close to each other as possible; while co-
       location is not strictly required, it should be preferred
       unless there is a clear, strong advantage that can make up
       for the disadvantage of keeping the administrative and
       warehousing functions of NSMA physically apart.

ES.3.2     Alternatives Considered but Dismissed

The Navy considered and dismissed alternatives that would have
relocated NSMA either to existing space at the Washington Navy
Yard or to Building 168 at NSF Anacostia. In both cases, it
would have been necessary to build the proposed warehouse at a
separate location due to the lack of available space. However,
neither alternative presented the type of strong advantage that
would have made these options compatible with Criterion 3.
Therefore, these alternatives were dismissed.

ES.3.3     Alternatives Considered in the EA
Anacostia Alternative (Preferred): Under this alternative, a
combined facility (administrative and warehousing) would be
constructed on NSF Anacostia on a site about three acres in
size, located northwest of the intersection of Brookley Avenue
and Thomas Road. The northern part of the site consists of a
parcel formerly occupied by Building 150, now demolished. The
southern part of the site consists of a paved lot occupied by
several temporary trailers and a semi-permanent building that
would be moved to a location to be determined on NSF Anacostia
to make room for the proposed combined facility.




Executive Summary                  ES-2
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


Bellevue Alternative: Under this alternative, the proposed
combined facility would be constructed on a parcel of the Navy's
Bellevue Housing property, located to the south of NSF
Anacostia, between Bolling Air Force Base and the Naval Research
Laboratory.

No Action Alternative: Under the No Action Alternative, NSMA
would not relocate from its current multiple locations in
Arlington County to a Navy-owned facility. The No Action
Alternative is not a reasonable alternative because it would be
inconsistent with Criterion 1 and would put the Navy in
violation of the 2005 BRAC Act. However, it is considered in the
EA consistent with CEQ regulations.


ES.4 Impacts
ES.4.1   No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no changes to
existing conditions at NSF Anacostia or Bellevue Housing and no
impacts.

ES.4.2   Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)
Land Use and Plans: Implementation of the Anacostia Alternative
would result in a change in land use at the project site, which
is currently half-open, half-occupied by parking lots, temporary
trailers, and a semi-permanent building. After the proposed
action is completed, the site would be occupied by a half-
administrative, half-light industrial facility. While this would
represent a change in land use, the new land use would be
compatible with its surroundings. The new facility would be
outside all existing restricted areas. Because of its moderate
scale and the functional and visual separation of NSF Anacostia
from the neighborhoods to the east by South Capitol Street and
I-295, there is no potential for indirect land use impacts
outside the installation.

The Anacostia Alternative generally supports the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital ­ Federal Elements ­
Federal Workplace. It would have no adverse effect on ongoing
plans, initiatives, and projects at NSF Anacostia or in its
vicinity.




                                 ES-3                    Executive Summary
Environmental Assessment


Socioeconomics: In the short or medium term, because of the
relatively short distance between the current locations of NSMA
in Arlington County, VA and NSF Anacostia, it is not expected
that the proposed relocation of the agency would result in a
significant number of NSMA employees moving their residences. In
the long term, with normal personnel turnover, proximity to
Anacostia would become a factor to consider for new personnel
seeking housing, resulting in a change in NSMA staff's overall
residential patterns. However, such change would take place
slowly and progressively, with negligible impacts at both the
local and regional level.

Construction of the proposed facility would have a positive
impact on the local economy as it would generate design and
construction jobs and revenues. However, in the context of the
Washington DC regional economy, this impact would be small.

The proposed relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia would not
disproportionately affect minority or economically disadvantaged
populations protected under Executive Order (EO) 12898. Nor
would it affect children under EO 13045.

Transportation: The Anacostia Metrorail Station, near the
intersection of Firth Sterling Avenue and Howard Road, SE, is
located approximately 4,500 feet from the project site. In
addition to the distance, the lack of adequate sidewalks and the
reputation of the surrounding neighborhood as a high-crime area
are likely to discourage Metrorail users. The Navy has prepared
a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) that outlines measures to
encourage transit usage among NSMA employees. At this stage, the
number of NSMA employees who would regularly ride Metrorail
cannot be estimated. However, it can be expected that any
increase in passenger loads at Anacostia Station would be
absorbed into the increase planned for by the Washington
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

The relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia would generate new
traffic to and from the installation. To assess the impacts of
this traffic increase on the local road network, a level of
service (LOS) analysis was conducted for six intersections in
the vicinity of the installation for the year 2011. The analysis
showed that LOS under the Anacostia Alternative would be the
same as under no action conditions, though with slightly
increased delays: all study intersections would operate at an
overall LOS C or better, with the exception of the intersection
of South Capitol Street at Firth Sterling Avenue, which would
operate at LOS D during the PM peak period. LOS D is an


Executive Summary             ES-4
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


acceptable LOS in a dense urban area such as Washington, DC.
Thus, the Anacostia Alternative is not expected to result in
significant traffic impacts.

Construction of the proposed new NSMA facility would not
increase NSF Anacostia's parking capacity. NSMA employees would
use existing surplus parking. Demand is expected to exceed the
supply of parking within walking distance (0.25 mile) of the
facility by about 163 spaces. The Navy would implement measures
to reduce parking demand from its employees in order to better
match the supply and to comply with the National Capital
Planning Commission's (NCPC) parking ratio requirements for
Federal facilities in the District of Columbia. Such measures,
primarily designed to encourage employees to commute by transit
or to rideshare, are delineated in a TMP prepared for this
proposed action. It is not expected that any significant number
of NSMA employees would seek parking on public streets.

Air Quality: Quantitative and qualitative evaluation showed that
the local emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate
matter (PM10 and PM2.5) that would be generated by the new traffic
resulting from the proposed action would not be significant. The
only long-term stationary source of new emissions would be the
heating boiler(s) of the proposed facility. Based on the size
and function of the facility, these emissions are not expected
to be significant. In the short term, construction of the
proposed facility would cause some air quality impacts. These
impacts would be minimized using standard best management
practices (BMPs) and would not be significant. Because the
proposed action would take place in a non-attainment area for
ozone (O3) and PM2.5, a General Conformity Rule (GCR) analysis has
been conducted. The expected increases in annual emissions of
the relevant criteria pollutants or their precursors would not
exceed the applicable de minimis levels. Therefore, a formal
conformity determination is not required. Additionally, the
increase in annual emissions is not projected to exceed 10
percent of the Washington DC regional emissions inventory;
therefore, the Anacostia Alternative would not result in
significant regional air quality impacts.


Noise: Equipment and vehicle operations during the construction
of the proposed NSMA facility would result in temporary noise
impacts. These impacts would not be significant. Based on
general acoustical principles, the increase in traffic that
would result from the proposed action is not expected to cause a
noticeable increase in ambient noise levels.


                                 ES-5                    Executive Summary
Environmental Assessment


Cultural Resources: The proposed action under this alternative
would have no effect on National Register-listed or eligible
architectural or archaeological resources. The site where the
proposed facility would be built has been extensively disturbed
and has little potential to contain intact archaeological
resources. If, however, archaeological artifacts or skeletal
remains were uncovered by construction activities, work would
stop immediately. The Navy would consult with the DC Historic
Preservation Office (DCHPO) and other parties, as appropriate,
before resuming any activities that could disturb the find.

Natural Resources: Construction of the proposed new facility
would disturb the project site's soils over an area of
approximately three acres. The flatness of the site would
contribute    to    minimizing  construction-related   erosion.
Additionally, BMPs such as silt barriers or the seeding of
exposed soils would be used to further limit the risk of
erosion. Land disturbing activities affecting more than 50
square feet in the District of Columbia require the preparation
of an erosion and sediment control plan to be reviewed and
approved by the DC Department of the Environment, Watershed
Protection Division. Preparation and implementation of an
approved erosion and sediment control plan in compliance with
this requirement would ensure that erosion-related impacts are
minimal and not significant.

Implementation of the Anacostia Alternative would have no direct
impact on surface water resources. The project site does not
contain wetlands; nor is it located within the 100-year
floodplain. In the long term, construction of the proposed
facility would increase the amount of impervious surfaces at the
site, which is currently partly pervious. However, LID features
would minimize impacts on stormwater volume and sediment and
nutrient loadings. These features would be incorporated into the
stormwater management plan required by the District of Columbia
for projects disturbing more than 5,000 square feet. Thus,
impacts on both the quantity and the quality of the stormwater
runoff generated by the project site would be minimal and not
significant.

Impacts to biological resources would be negligible. A few trees
and some marginal habitat that may accommodate common urban
species would be lost. The new facility's landscaping would
partially offset this loss. The proposed action would have no
effect on threatened or endangered species, including the
shortnose sturgeon, which may be present in the Potomac and
Anacostia rivers. Nor would the proposed action have a

                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


significant adverse impact on migratory birds protected under
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

Hazardous Materials and Waste. NSMA operations at its proposed
new consolidated facility would require the storage and use of
hazardous materials and result in the generation, storage, and
disposal of hazardous waste. Small amounts (no more than ten
pounds) of simunition (non-lethal training rounds similar to
paintballs) would occasionally and temporarily be stored in the
proposed warehouse. These rounds are classified 1.4S, meaning
they create minimal explosive risk. They and all hazardous
materials and waste would be handled in accordance with
applicable Navy guidelines and requirements, and local and
Federal laws and regulations, resulting in no adverse impacts to
the human environment. Recent subsurface investigations of the
project site have found that petroleum-impacted soils may be
present. Prior to beginning any soil disturbing activities, the
Navy   would  review   this  finding   and   conduct  additional
investigations, as needed. If the presence of contaminated soils
is confirmed, appropriate measures would be taken to remove and
dispose of the impacted soils in accordance with applicable
regulations.

ES 4.3   Bellevue Alternative
Land Use and Plans: Implementation of the Bellevue Alternative
would result in a change in land use at the project site. The
site is currently open and undeveloped, part of a larger parcel,
also   mostly   undeveloped.   Construction   of   the   proposed
consolidated facility would introduce a new land use to the
area,   in  the   form  of   a  half-administrative,   half-light
industrial compound. This new land use would not be entirely
compatible with its surroundings, as it would be close to
residential uses (Bellevue Housing, Bolling Housing). However,
there would remain sufficient undeveloped buffers between the
proposed facility and the nearest residential areas to minimize
any adverse impacts to the livability or desirability of the
existing and future military housing neighborhoods. Any adverse
impacts would be minor. As under the Anacostia Alternative,
there would be no impact to off-base land uses.

The Bellevue alternative generally supports the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital ­ Federal Elements ­
Federal Workplace. It would have no adverse effect on the
several plans, initiatives, and projects in the vicinity of the
project site, with one partial exception: the site where the
proposed facility would be built under this alternative is


                                 ES-7                    Executive Summary
Environmental Assessment


included  in   the  Bellevue   Housing  privatization  project.
Therefore, implementation of this alternative would require
removing at least the site and its immediate surroundings from
the project's land lease area and keeping them under direct
government control. The alternative would not otherwise affect
the privatization project. The adverse impact, therefore, would
be minor.

Socioeconomics: The impacts of the Bellevue Alternative would be
the same as those of the Anacostia Alternative. These impacts
would be negligible.

Transportation: The impacts of the Bellevue Alternative would be
the same as, or similar to, those of the Anacostia Alternative
and would not be significant. However, the projected parking
deficit would be greater because there is no existing parking
within reasonable walking distance of the project site. In
addition to measures promoting transit usage and ridesharing,
additional measures to make existing remote existing parking
usable by NSMA employees (e.g., shuttle service between remote
parking   areas  and   the   new  facility)   may  be   required.
Implementation of this alternative would require additional
parking studies. No impacts on public parking are expected.

Air Quality: The impacts of the Bellevue Alternative would be
the same as those of the Anacostia Alternative and would not be
significant.

Noise: The impacts of the Bellevue Alternative would be the same
as those of the Anacostia Alternative and would not be
significant.

Cultural Resources: Construction of the proposed NSMA facility
under the Bellevue Alternative would likely disturb Site 51SW7,
a prehistoric archaeological site that was found to be
potentially eligible for listing in the National Register during
a survey conducted in 1994. Consistent with the 1994 report's
recommendations and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, The Navy would conduct a
Phase II evaluation of Site 51SW7 to determine its National
Register eligibility prior to beginning any ground-disturbing
activities. Following completion of the Phase II survey and its
review and approval by the DCHPO, potential adverse effects to
the site from the proposed action would be evaluated and, if
appropriate, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) would be drafted to
define mitigation measures. These measures would ensure that any
adverse    effects   are   mitigated    and   not   significant.


Executive Summary             ES-8
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


Implementation of the proposed action would not begin until the
Section 106 consultation process is complete.

Natural Resources: The impacts of the Bellevue Alternative would
be similar to those of the Anacostia Alternative and would be
negligible.

Hazardous   Materials  and   Waste:   As   under  the  Anacostia
Alternative and for the same reasons, there would be no
significant adverse impacts pertaining to hazardous materials
and waste. However, no subsurface investigations have been
conducted at the alternate site and no information pertaining to
potential soil contamination is available. Therefore, should the
Navy select this site for constructing the proposed NSMA
facility, due diligence would be made to ascertain the presence
of any contaminants in the soil above applicable regulatory
thresholds. Any impacted soils would be removed and disposed of
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.


ES.5   Conclusion
Based on the analyses contained in the EA, the proposed
relocation of NSMA under either the Anacostia Alternative
(preferred) or the Bellevue Alternative would not result in
significant   adverse   impacts   on   the human environment.
Preparation of an EIS is not required.

1.       Purpose and Need

This environmental assessment (EA) evaluates the impacts on the
human environment of relocating the Navy Systems Management
Activity (NSMA) from various locations in Arlington County,
Virginia, to a new facility at Naval Support Facility (NSF)
Anacostia in Washington, DC. The proposed relocation is to
comply with the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act of 2005.
The EA has been prepared pursuant to Section 102 (2) (c) of the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 USC 4331 et seq.),
the   regulations   issued   by  the   President's  Council   on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) for implementing the procedural
provisions of NEPA (40 CFR 1500-1508), and the Department of the
Navy's NEPA procedures contained in 32 CFR 775.


1.1     Background
1.1.1    BRAC Mandate for NSMA

On September 8, 2005, the BRAC Commission issued its final
recommendations to the President following its review of the
Secretary of Defense's recommendations issued on May 13, 2005.
The President approved the final recommendations on September
15, 2005 and forwarded them to Congress. Congress did not alter
any of the BRAC Commission's recommendations and on November 9,
2005, the recommendations became law. The BRAC Commission's
recommendations must now be implemented as provided for in the
Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (Public Law 101-510),
as amended.

BRAC Recommendation #149 provides for the closure of several
leased Navy installations in the National Capital Region and the
relocation of the organizations occupying these installations to
Department of Defense (DoD)-owned space in the National Capital
Region. NSF Anacostia and the Washington Navy Yard were among
the Navy facilities identified by the BRAC Commission as most
likely relocation sites.

This recommendation   meets the DoD's objective to reduce its
reliance on leased    space, which historically has been more



                              1-1                 Purpose and Need

costly than government-owned space and generally does not meet
current anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) requirements.

NSMA is one of the Navy organizations affected by the BRAC
mandate to move out of leased space and relocate to a DoD
facility. NSMA's mission is to provide logistics support to the
Navy. Logistics is the management of the flow of goods,
information, or other resources between the point of production
and the point of consumption or use. Warehousing, inventory,
handling, packaging, transportation, and delivery are all
elements of logistics.

NSMA currently occupies several separate leased administrative
facilities in the Crystal City and Clarendon neighborhoods of
Arlington County, VA. The agency additionally maintains a
warehouse, also located in Arlington County. A total of
approximately 800 persons work at these locations.


1.1.2    NSF Anacostia

NSF Anacostia is located in the southwestern quadrant of the
District of Columbia, along the eastern shore of the Anacostia
River, near the river's confluence with the Potomac and across
the Potomac from Arlington County (See Figures 1-1 and 1-2). NSF
Anacostia is a component of Naval Support Activity (NSA)
Washington, one of four NSAs within Naval District Washington
(NDW).

In compliance with the 2005 BRAC Act, NSF Anacostia is in the
process of becoming a joint base with Bolling Air Force Base
(AFB), home to the Air Force's 11th Wing and located immediately
to the south of NSF Anacostia. The Anacostia-Bolling joint base
will be managed under NSA Washington and NDW.

Even before the BRAC mandate to become one joint base, NSF
Anacostia and Bolling AFB, though administratively distinct,
were physically continuous and shared a perimeter fence and
entry gates. Both installations have broadly similar missions.
They provide support to personnel assigned to the National
Capital area, including personnel administration and assistance,
personnel property movement, medical care, fire protection and
emergency response, housing, distinguished visitor and high-
ranking personnel transportation, and various morale, welfare,
and recreation activities. Both installations also support
representational activities such as the Navy Ceremonial Guard
and the Air Force Honor Guard.

                   Relocation OF NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


The future Anacostia-Bolling joint base occupies 958 acres (351
acres for NSF Anacostia and 607 acres for Bolling AFB). It is
bounded by the Anacostia River and the Potomac River to the
west, South Capitol Street and Interstate Highway 295 (I-295) to
the east, Poplar Point and the Frederick Douglass Memorial
Bridge to the north, and the Navy's Bellevue Housing to the
south. Bellevue Housing provides housing for enlisted military
personnel and their families. It is located at the Naval
Research Laboratory (NRL). Like NSF Anacostia, NRL is a
component of NSA Washington. Its main facilities lie to the
south of Bellevue Housing. Although Bellevue Housing has its own
access gate, which it shares with NRL, the westernmost, mostly
undeveloped part of the property is within Bolling AFB and can
be reached via the base's South Gate.


1.2     Purpose and Need
The purpose and need for the proposed relocation of NSMA to NSF
Anacostia is to comply with the BRAC mandate to relocate Navy
organizations currently in leased space in Arlington County to
DoD-owned facilities in the National Capital Region.


1.3 The NEPA Process
NEPA provides for the consideration of environmental issues in
Federal agency planning and decision-making. Under NEPA, Federal
agencies must prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or
an EA for any Federal action, except those actions that are
determined to be "categorically excluded." An EIS is prepared
for those Federal actions that may significantly affect the
quality of the human environment. An EA is a concise public
document that serves to provide sufficient evidence and analysis
for determining whether to prepare an EIS. The EA includes brief
discussions of the following:

  ·   The need for the proposal.

  ·   The alternatives (as required under Section 102 [2] [E] of
      NEPA).

  ·   The environmental    impacts       of   the   proposed     action    and
      alternatives.




                                   1-3                         Purpose and Need
Environmental Assessment


The EA results in either a Finding of No Significant Impact
(FONSI) or a decision to prepare an EIS. If, based on this EA,
the Navy determines that the proposed action would have no
significant impacts on the quality of the human environment, a
FONSI will be issued. If the Navy determines that the proposed
action would have a significant impact on the quality of the
human environment, preparation of an EIS will be initiated.




Purpose and Need             1-4
2. Proposed Action and Alternatives

The Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) regulations for
implementing NEPA establish a number of policies for Federal
agencies, including using "...the NEPA process to identify and
assess the reasonable alternatives to proposed actions that will
avoid or minimize adverse effects of these actions upon the
quality of the human environment" (40 CFR 1500.2[e]). This
chapter describes the proposed action (Section 2.1) and the
alternatives considered by the Navy to meet its purpose and need
(Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2). Section 2.2.3 addresses the No
Action Alternative.


2.1   Proposed Action
The proposed action is to relocate NSMA's 800 personnel,
equipment, and programs from their current, various locations in
Arlington County, VA, to NSF Anacostia in Washington, DC. To
accommodate the agency, a new facility would be constructed,
consisting of two elements: an administrative building and a
warehouse (see Figure 2-1).

The administrative building would provide approximately 160,000
gross square feet of space, with a footprint of approximately
32,000 square feet. It would be a reinforced steel-framed
masonry structure on a pile foundation system. About half the
roof would be dedicated to a green roof feature and about 30
percent to a paved deck accessible to personnel during breaks
and lunch hour.

To accommodate NSMA's security requirements, the building would
include   five   independent   zoned   Sensitive   Compartmented
Information Facility (SCIF) areas. Fenestration would be limited
to the public lobby area.

Interior spaces would include closed offices and open work
areas, conference rooms, a photographic laboratory, storage
areas, restrooms, mechanical and electrical rooms, and support
spaces (e.g., stairwells and elevators). Connections to existing
utility systems (water, sanitary and storm sewers, electricity,
and data) would be provided.


                              2-1                     Alternatives
Environmental Assessment


Exterior work would involve lighting, roadway improvements,
paved parking (46 parking spots) and driving areas, sidewalks,
stormwater management features, and landscaping.

The warehouse would be built adjacent to the administrative
facility. It would be approximately 23,000 square feet in size,
with an 18-foot overhead clearance and an open SCIF environment,
as required by NSMA's operations. It would include three loading
docks. On average, three tractor trailers would access or leave
the facility every day to load or unload materials and
equipment.

Both the administrative building and the warehouse would
incorporate sustainable design features sufficient to obtain a
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) "Silver"
rating. In addition to the green roof already mentioned, such
features may include low water usage landscaping, room occupancy
sensors,   and  use   of   regional   recyclable and   non-toxic
construction materials, among others.

Additional sustainability features would be incorporated in the
final design, consistent with the Navy's requirement that Low
Impact Development (LID) techniques be used to meet the goal of
no net increase in stormwater volume and in sediment and
nutrient   loadings  for   major   renovation  and   construction
projects. LID must be used for all projects that will be under
construction in 2011. For projects scheduled to be under
construction prior to that date, the voluntary incorporation of
LID features consistent with the policy is strongly encouraged.
LID utilizes strategies that allow for the storage, filtration,
evaporation, and/or retention of runoff close to its source. For
instance, runoff from the new facility's roof and new paved
areas would be collected and routed through on-site storm drains
and grass swales to a bio-retention/bio-filtration area where
the first half-inch of runoff would be retained and filtered
before being discharged to the existing storm drainage system.

Per the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Section
438, "the sponsor of any development or redevelopment project
involving a Federal facility with a footprint that exceeds 5,000
square feet shall use site planning, design, construction, and
maintenance strategies for the property to maintain or restore,
to the maximum extent technically feasible, the predevelopment
hydrology of the property with regard to the temperature, rate,
volume,   and  duration   of  flow."  Navy   guidance   for  the
implementation of this policy is under development. However, the

intent of the policy would be considered in the final design of
the proposed facility.

Stand-off distances consistent with applicable AT/FP standards
would be provided. Other AT/FP features would include a mass
notification system, external lighting, and an intrusion
detection system. Access to the facility would be restricted to
authorized personnel and visitors.

The facility would be operational with all personnel, equipment,
and program moved in by September 2011.


2.2     Alternatives
NEPA regulations call for the consideration and assessment in
the EA of reasonable alternatives. Alternatives that are not
reasonable do not need to be evaluated. Consistent with this
requirement, Section 2.2.1 describes the alternatives the Navy
considered but dismissed from further consideration in the EA
because these alternatives were found not to be reasonable.
Section 2.2.2 describes the alternatives that are being carried
forward and evaluated in this EA. Section 2.2.3 addresses the No
Action Alternative.

Three criteria were used to evaluate the reasonableness of each
potential alternative:

  ·   Criterion 1 ­ The alternative must comply with the 2005 BRAC
      mandate to relocate NSMA to a DoD-owned facility in the
      National Capital Region.

  ·   Criterion 2 ­ The alternative must provide adequate
      administrative   and  warehousing   space  that meets the
      operational and security requirements of NSMA.

  ·   Criterion 3 ­ The administrative building and the warehouse
      must be as close to each other as possible; while co-
      location is not strictly required, it should be preferred
      unless there is a clear, strong advantage that can make up
      for the disadvantage of keeping the administrative and
      warehousing functions of NSMA physically apart.

Criterion 2 significantly constrained the range of feasible
alternatives since only installations with either adequate
existing space or sufficient room for new construction could be
considered. The Navy identified three DoD-owned facilities in


                                  2-3                          Alternatives
Environmental Assessment


the National Capital Region that could potentially accommodate
NSMA: the Washington Navy Yard; NSF Anacostia; and Bellevue
Housing, just south of NSF Anacostia and Bolling AFB (see
Section 1.1.2).


2.2.1     Alternatives Considered but Dismissed
2.2.1.1   Relocating NSMA to the Washington Navy Yard

Early in the planning process, the Navy considered relocating
NSMA to the Washington Navy Yard. However, the Washington Navy
Yard    could   only   accommodate   NSMA's    requirement   for
administrative space, because the Navy Yard has no adequate
existing warehousing space available. Nor does it have any room
to construct a new warehouse adequate to NSMA's needs.
Therefore, any alternative that would relocate NSMA to the
Washington Navy Yard would require keeping the administrative
building and warehouse separate. Under Criterion 3, such an
alternative could be reasonable only if it presents a strong
advantage that could make up for the disadvantage of keeping the
agency's administrative and warehousing functions physically
apart.

With respect to the Washington Navy Yard, only one factor could
be considered to constitute such a strong advantage: a small
group of NSMA employees is already present in Building 111. The
cost and inconvenience of moving these employees would be
avoided if the rest of the agency joined them. Therefore, the
Navy considered renovating Building 111 for use by NSMA.

However,   independent  planning   considerations  resulted   in
Building 111's being assigned to a different command. This
eliminated the possibility of NSMA's moving to the building and
made it likely that the NSMA employees in Building 111 would
have to move to join the rest of the agency in its new building.
This eliminated the only strong advantage of relocating NSMA to
the Navy Yard. Even if the NSMA employees currently in Building
111 were able to stay in that building, there is no available
space at the Navy Yard that could adequately accommodate the
rest of agency. Therefore, alternatives that would relocate NSMA
to the Washington Navy Yard were eliminated from further
consideration. Such alternatives are not considered in the rest
of this EA.

                  Relocation OF NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


2.2.1.2   Relocating NSMA to Existing Space at NSF Anacostia

The Navy next considered relocating NSMA to existing space on
NSF Anacostia. One existing building was identified that could
potentially be renovated to accommodate the agency: Building 168
(see Figure 2-2). Renovating Building 168 for use by NSMA,
however, would mean that the administrative and warehousing
functions of the agency could not be co-located because there is
no room adjacent to Building 168 to construct the required
warehouse. Since there is no existing space on NSF Anacostia
that could be used by the agency as a warehouse, if NSMA moved
to Building 168, a new warehouse would have to be built at a
separate location. Under Criterion 3, this physical separation
of NSMA's administrative and warehousing functions could be a
reasonable alternative provided there is a strong advantage in
adopting it.

Upon initial consideration, the one primary advantage of
accommodating NSMA in existing rather than new space was
financial, as renovation of an existing facility could be
expected to be less costly that constructing a new one. However,
a cost analysis showed that because of the extensive renovations
and modifications that would be required to make Building 168
adequate to NSMA's needs, this option would in fact be less
cost-effective than new construction. This eliminated the only
strong   advantage  there   would  have   been  in   moving  the
administrative functions of NSMA to Building 168 and thus
keeping them separate from the warehousing functions. Therefore,
the alternative was found to fail under Criterion 3 and is not
considered further in this EA.


2.2.2     Alternatives Carried Forward

Following the elimination of alternatives that would have
relocated NSMA to existing space at either the Washington Navy
Yard or NSF Anacostia and, therefore, kept the administrative
and warehouse functions of NSMA physically separate (see
Sections 2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.2, respectively), only alternatives
involving the construction of a new, integrated facility with
the proposed administrative building and warehouse adjacent to
each   other  were   selected for   further consideration  and
evaluation in the EA.

Environmental Assessment


2.2.2.1   Relocating NSMA to a New Combined Facility at      NSF
Anacostia (Anacostia Alternative - Preferred Alternative)

After   reviewing   existing   operational   and   environmental
constraints as well as existing and planned land uses at NSF
Anacostia, the Navy identified one site on the installation that
could accommodate the proposed combined facility. This site,
about three acres in size, is located northwest of the
intersection of Brookley Avenue and Thomas Road (see Figures 2-2
and 2-3).

The northern part of the site consists of a parcel formerly
occupied by Building 150, now demolished. A narrow, unused
parking lot separates this parcel from a large, fenced vehicle
storage yard to the north. The southern part of the site
consists of a paved lot occupied by several temporary trailers
that would be relocated to a location to be determined on NSF
Anacostia to make room for the proposed combined facility. To
the south, the site is separated from Thomas Road by Building
387 and surrounding chain link fence enclosure. Building 387 is
a semi-permanent building that would be moved to a location to
be determined on NSF Anacostia to make room for the proposed
combined facility. In addition to these relocations, the small
stretch of Brookley Avenue fronting the site on the east would
be realigned a short distance to the east to increase the amount
of usable land (see Figure 2-3).

Because it has been disturbed previously and is readily
available for redevelopment, this site is the Navy's preferred
location for the proposed combined NSMA facility. Building the
proposed facility at this location as shown in Figure 2-3 is the
Navy's Preferred Alternative.

2.2.2.2 Relocating NSMA to a New Combined Facility on Bellevue
Housing Property (Bellevue Alternative)

Upon review, the northwestern corner of Bellevue Housing was
found adequate to accommodate a combined facility for NSMA on a
three-acre site fronting McGuire Avenue (See Figure 2-2). This
area is within the Bolling AFB - NSF Anacostia perimeter fence.
It is currently open and vegetated with grass and a few hardwood
trees.

The option of developing this parcel as an annex to NSF
Anacostia was already considered in the Anacostia Annex Site
Development Plan completed in December 2004. As indicated in
Section 1.1.2 of this EA, NSF Anacostia and Bolling AFB are

being combined into a joint base under Navy management. Under
the Bellevue Alternative, the portion of Bellevue property where
the NSMA facility would be located would be withdrawn from the
ongoing Bellevue Housing privatization process (see Section
3.1.2.2) and administratively attached to the joint base.


2.2.3    No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, NSMA would not relocate from
its current multiple locations in Arlington County to a DoD-
owned facility. The agency would continue to operate as at
present.

The No Action Alternative is not a reasonable alternative
because it would be inconsistent with Criterion 1 and would put
the Navy in violation of the 2005 BRAC Act. However, it is
considered in this EA consistent with CEQ's regulations.


2.3     Summary Comparison of Alternatives
Table 2-1 shows a summary comparison of the impacts of the
alternatives considered in this EA. Impacts are more fully
described and evaluated in Chapter 4.

3. Affected Environment

CEQ's regulations (40 CFR Part 1500 et seq.) implementing NEPA
require documentation that succinctly describes the environment
of the area(s) potentially affected by the alternatives under
consideration. The primary study area for this EA consists of
the two sites - the preferred site at NSF Anacostia and the
alternate site on Bellevue Housing-NRL property just south of
Bolling AFB ­ that are being considered for the proposed
combined NSMA facility, and their immediate surroundings. For
some resources, a larger area is described because potential
impacts could occur beyond the boundaries of the sites. The
impacts on the environment of the alternatives being considered
by the Navy are described in Chapter 4.

For the purposes of this and the following chapters, the
physically unified but administratively diverse Federal property
comprising NSF Anacostia, Bolling AFB, and the parcel of
Bellevue Housing-NRL property containing the alternate site is
collectively referred to as the "Bolling-Anacostia Installation"
or "the Installation."


3.1     Land Use and Plans
3.1.1     Existing Land Use
3.1.1.1   General

The Bolling-Anacostia Installation occupies part of a long and
relatively narrow strip of land extending between the Potomac
and Anacostia rivers to the north and west, and South Capitol
Street, Overlook Avenue, and I-295 to the east and south. In
addition to the Installation, this stretch of riverside land
contains other large institutional compounds such as the NRL
facilities and the District of Columbia's Blue Plains wastewater
treatment plant. Military family housing developments (Air Force
Housing on Bolling AFB and Bellevue Housing) are the only
residential uses within this area.

The South Capitol Street/Overlook Avenue/I-295 corridor creates
a strong functional and visual break between these government


                              3-1              Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


uses and the neighborhoods that lie on higher ground east of I-
295, separated from the low-lying riverside plain by a wooded
slope. The area east of I-295 is predominantly in residential
use (Barry Farm and Congress Heights neighborhoods), though a
large institutional compound ­ the 173-acre St. Elizabeth's West
Campus, currently being redeveloped for use by the US Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) ­ is also present, overlooking NSF
Anacostia. To the north of NSF Anacostia, the shore of the
Anacostia River is occupied by parkland (Poplar Point, Anacostia
Park).

The Bolling-Anacostia Installation covers approximately 973
acres (351 acres for NSF Anacostia, 607 acres for Bolling AFB,
and 15 acres for the Bellevue Parcel containing the alternate
site), with about 3.3 miles of shoreline and 276 facilities (56
at NSF Anacostia and 220 at Bolling AFB). The Installation is
surrounded by a perimeter fence and can only be accessed through
one of three guarded gates: the North Gate at Firth Sterling
Avenue, the Main Gate (Arnold Gate) at Malcolm X Avenue, and the
South Gate, off Overlook Avenue. An unused railroad right-of-way
runs along the eastern flank of much of the Installation,
terminating at the Blue Plains wastewater treatment plan.

NSF Anacostia is a low-density, loosely organized facility,
whose northern portion is characterized by recreational uses
(ball fields) and some residential and community support
functions (e.g., a small exchange, gym, and dining hall in
Building 72). The southern part of NSF Anacostia, north of
Defense Boulevard, is dominated by the airfield operated by HMX-
1, the US Marine Corps squadron in charge of the presidential
helicopters. East of the airfield, the area between Defense
Boulevard and the Installation's perimeter fence along South
Capitol Street is dominated by industrial, maintenance, and
vehicle storage functions. The central and waterside portions of
NSF Anacostia contain scattered mission/administrative uses.

Bolling AFB is characterized by similar uses but in different
proportions. The southern and western-central portions of the
base are dominated by residential, community support, and
recreational uses. Much of the existing housing, however, is
scheduled for demolition as part of its recently completed
privatization. Mission/administrative functions are mostly found
in the eastern-central part of the base. The northern part,
adjacent to NSF Anacostia, is dominated by the Defense
Intelligence Agency Center (DIAC) and associated parking
facilities. Bolling AFB also has a small helicopter landing pad,
just south of DIAC.

                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


Existing land uses at the Installation create operational
constraints that have to be taken into account when siting new
facilities (See Appendix A). In particular, each of the two
airfields has safety zones that must remain clear of obstacles.
Several facilities have explosive safety quantity­distance arcs.
Also, several tenant agencies have high security requirements
and must be allowed to restrict physical and visual access to
their facilities. These agencies include, on NSF Anacostia, HMX-
1 and the White House Communication Agency; on Bolling AFB,
DIAC.

Department of Defense (DoD) anti-terrorism/force protection
(AT/FP) standards must be incorporated into all inhabited new
construction and major renovation work funded under the Military
Construction process. Standoff distance must be coupled with
appropriate building hardening to provide the necessary level of
protection to personnel. Where conventional standoff distances
can be met, conventional construction may be used for the
buildings without specific analysis of blast effects, except as
otherwise required by the standards. When required distances
cannot be achieved, hardening measures should be applied to
mitigate the distance deficit. Current AT/FP standards are
contained in United Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01.

3.1.1.2   Preferred Site

In its current condition, the preferred site consists of two
fairly distinct halves. Most of the northern half is occupied by
a square-shaped grassy field where Building 150 used to stand.
Building 150, an administrative facility, was demolished a few
years ago. Small paved parking lots (presumably once serving
Building 150) remain to the north and south of the field.

The southern half of the site is occupied by several single- and
double-wide trailers on an asphalt parking lot. The trailers
house administrative functions. Farther south, Building 387, a
semi-permanent structure surrounded by a fence, separates the
site from Thomas Road. Other adjacent land uses are Building 356
and surrounding fence to the west, and a large, also fenced
vehicle storage yard to the northwest and north. Brookley Avenue
runs along the site's eastern edge. The preferred site is within
a part of NSF Anacostia dominated by industrial, maintenance,
and vehicle storage functions.

Environmental Assessment


3.1.1.3   Alternate Site

The alternate site consists entirely of an open, grassed area
within a larger, similarly undeveloped parcel just south of
McGuire Avenue and extending southward to Magazine Road, SW.
Though currently vacant, this parcel is part of Bellevue
Housing, the Navy's military family housing development that
extends to the east and southeast. Bellevue Housing consists of
188 townhouses built in 1996. The developed parts of Bellevue
are separated from the alternate site by the unused railroad
right-of-way mentioned in Section 3.1.1.1.

The alternate site is also directly across Doolittle Park, a
residential area scheduled for demolition as part of the
privatization of Air Force housing at Bolling AFB (See Section
3.1.2.2). Once the existing houses are demolished, that portion
of Bolling AFB will become available for redevelopment. The 2008
NSF Anacostia-Bolling AFB Joint Master Plan Phase 1 Concept
Report (see Section 3.1.2.2) shows that area as a potential
"Secure Mission" use.


3.1.2    Relevant Planning Documents, Initiatives, and
Projects
3.1.2.1   Washington, DC

Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital ­ Federal Elements ­
Federal Workplace

Development in the District of Columbia is guided by a number of
plans and guidelines that aim to preserve Washington's unique
aesthetic quality and historical heritage as the nation's
capital, while accommodating and fostering demographic and
economic growth. The two main planning agencies for the District
of Columbia are the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC),
which represents the Federal interest, and the District of
Columbia   Office  of   Planning  (DCOP),  a   District  agency.
Transportation planning is conducted by the District of Columbia
Department of Transportation (DDOT).

NCPC and DCOP prepare the Comprehensive Plan for the National
Capital, which provides a statement of principles, goals,
objectives, and planning policies for the future growth and
development of Washington, DC. The Comprehensive Plan has two
parts: the Federal Elements, prepared by NCPC, which contain
recommendations directed at Federal lands and the Federal


Existing Environment          3-4
                Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


interest in the National Capital Region; and the District
Elements, prepared by the DCOP, which deal with non-Federal
lands within the District of Columbia. The Federal Workplace
Element is the part of the Comprehensive Plan relevant to the
proposed action evaluated in this EA, which consists of
relocating a Federal agency to a site on Federal property.

As stated in the Federal Workforce Element, the overall goal of
the Federal government in the National Capital Region is to:

    Locate   the   Federal   workforce to   enhance  the
    efficiency, productivity, and public image of the
    Federal government; to strengthen the economic well-
    being and expand employment opportunities of the
    region and the localities therein; and to give
    emphasis to the District of Columbia as the seat of
    the national government.

NSF Anacostia, Bolling AFB, and NRL are three of the existing
Federally-owned workplaces identified in the element. The
workplace policies listed in the element that are relevant to
the proposed action considered in this EA are the following:

(A) With respect to existing       facilities    and     resources,    the
Federal government should:

  1. Give preference to established urban areas, or areas that
     are under redevelopment with infrastructure and services in
     place, when locating Federal workplaces.
  2. Support regional and local agency objectives that encourage
     compact forms of growth and development when locating
     Federal workplaces.
  3. Support regional and local agency efforts to coordinate
     land   use  with   the   availability  or   development  of
     transportation alternatives to the private automobile,
     including walking, bicycle riding, and public transit [...]
     when locating Federal workplaces.
  4. Locate Federal facilities within walking distance of
     existing or planned fixed guideway transit services [...]
     Priority should be given to locations within walking
     distance to Metrorail due to its extensive reach into the
     region's residential areas.
  5. Locate Federal workplaces in areas where efficiencies are
     gained through proximity to a market of private suppliers
     of goods and services.
  6. Utilize available Federally-owned land or space before
     purchasing or leasing additional land or building space.


                                3-5                    Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


      Agencies should continuously monitor utilization rates of
      land and building space to ensure their efficient use.
   7. Consider the modernization, repair, and rehabilitation of
      existing Federally-owned facilities for Federal workplaces
      before developing new facilities.
   8. Minimize development of open space by selecting disturbed
      land or brownfields for new Federal workplaces or by
      reusing existing buildings or sites.

(B) With respect to the regional distribution        of   Federal
workplaces, the Federal government should:

   1. Achieve within the District of Columbia a relative share of
      the region's Federal employment (civilian and military)
      that is not less than 60 percent of the region's.
   2. Locate   employees   near   other   Federal  agencies   and
      departments with which they regularly interact.
   3. Locate Federal workplaces in urban areas, giving first
      consideration to the District of Columbia and second
      consideration to other centralized community business areas
      and areas of similar character, including other specific
      areas that may be recommended by local agencies [...].

Additionally, the element notes that warehousing, utility,
supply, and storage activities within the District of Columbia
should give priority to locations that are easily accessible
from the regional highway system and without negative traffic
impacts to the local arterial and roadway system.

South Capitol Street Corridor Improvements

DDOT has been conducting a broad planning effort to improve
conditions along the South Capitol Street corridor and turn it
into an urban boulevard that can function as a symbolic gateway
into the nation's capital. The study area for that project
includes South Capitol Street down to a point south of Firth
Sterling Avenue and is, therefore, adjacent to the northeastern
part of NSF Anacostia. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) was published for the project in January 2008.

The centerpiece of the proposed corridor improvements, and the
component that is the most relevant to NSF Anacostia, is the
proposed realignment of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge,
which carries South Capitol Street across the Anacostia River.
The bridge would be widened and realigned south of its current
location. Suitland Parkway and South Capitol Street would

                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


intersect at grade just south of the realigned bridge, north of
NSF Anacostia.

Anacostia Waterfront Initiative ­ Poplar Point

DCOP's Anacostia Waterfront Initiative (AWI) is a multi-year,
multi-agency comprehensive planning effort to transform the
Anacostia River into a world-class urban waterfront. "The vision
of the AWI is of a clean and vibrant waterfront with parks,
recreation uses and urban waterfront settings ­ places for
people to meet, relax, encounter nature and experience the
heritage of the waterfront neighborhoods. The AWI also seeks to
ensure that the social and economic benefits derived from a
revitalized waterfront are shared by those neighborhoods and
people living along the Anacostia River for whom the river has
been distant and out of reach."

The AWI's study area includes the shores of the Anacostia River
to the Maryland state line. It encompasses the area immediately
north of NSF Anacostia and South Capitol Street, known as Poplar
Point. A development plan for Poplar Point was prepared by DCOP
in 2003. The plan aims to realize Poplar Point's potential as a
prime waterside recreational area and public gathering spot. An
EIS is currently being prepared by the District of Columbia and
the National Park Service to assess the impacts of redevelopment
alternatives. The redevelopment of Poplar Point will include
approximately 70 acres of parkland in perpetuity that may
feature wetlands, landscaped areas, pedestrian walkways, bicycle
trails,   seating,   open   sided   shelters,   natural   areas,
recreational use areas, and memorial sites. For the remaining
acreage of the 130-acre site, the District of Columbia is
considering proposals for a cultural institution or museum,
transit, a sports complex or stadium, and residential and
commercial uses.

Redevelopment of St. Elizabeth's West Campus

In December 2008, the General Services Administration (GSA)
issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the consolidation of the
DHS to the historic West Campus of St. Elizabeth, located on a
hilltop across I-295 from NSF Anacostia. Under the alternative
selected for implementation, 3.8 million gross square feet of
office and shared-used space would be provided in both new and
reused buildings on the West Campus, complemented by 750,000
gross square feet to be built on St. Elizabeth's East Campus
under a Memorandum of Agreement with the District of Columbia,
which controls the East Campus. Also part of the project are


                                 3-7                  Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


transportation improvements, including changes to the Malcolm X
Avenue/I-295 interchange, across from Bolling AFB's Main Gate.
The interchange would be reconfigured to connect to a new road
that would extend between Firth Sterling Avenue and Malcolm X
Avenue and provide access to the West Campus. 2016 is the build-
out date for this project.

Other Projects

   ·   Barry Farm Redevelopment: the District of Columbia has
       issued a plan for the redevelopment of the 37-acre Barry
       Farm/Park Chester/Wade Road neighborhood, located between
       Suitland Parkway to the north, Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue
       to the east, Firth Sterling Avenue to the west, and St.
       Elizabeth's West Campus to the south. The plan aims to
       create a mixed income community of various housing types
       with a total of 1,391 housing units and a vibrant mixed-use
       main street at Firth Sterling Avenue. The enhancement of
       community facilities, provision of a pedestrian bridge
       across Suitland Parkway to the Anacostia Metro Station, and
       increasing of the community's connectivity to greater
       Anacostia by extending the street grid through the
       neighborhood are other significant elements of the plan. The
       target date for this redevelopment is 2018.

   ·   Anacostia Streetcar Project: the District of Columbia is in
       the process of designing and constructing a new streetcar
       line that will extend between the 11th Street Bridge and the
       Anacostia Metro Station. The opening of the line, previously
       scheduled for late 2009, has recently been postponed to
       2012.

3.1.2.2    Naval District Washington and Bolling AFB-NSF Anacostia

Regional Shore Infrastructure Plan

In 2005, Naval District Washington (NDW) completed a Regional
Shore Infrastructure Plan (RSIP) to serve as a long-term
planning tool for the installations under its purview, including
NSF Anacostia. The policy objectives guiding the development of
the RSIP were to (1) Reduce footprints and costs (2) Increase
existing capabilities and sustainability and (3) Maximize
mission efficiencies. Consistent with these objectives, the RSIP
recommended four guiding concepts for future development: (1)
Capitalize on joint resources (2) Sustain a high quality of life
with superior service and facilities (3) Recognize NDW as a



Existing Environment             3-8
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) center
and (4) Maximize existing facilities for highest and best use.

Anacostia Annex Site Development Plan

This plan was completed in 2004. It was prepared as a first step
to guide the future development of the site in anticipation of
the 2005 BRAC round, on the assumption that the installation
would become a focus for new development. The plan's driving
objectives were to (1) Determine the highest and best use for
the site (2) Enhance the waterfront setting (3) Enhance the
physical amenities for workers and visitors (4) Create a
cohesive, unified level of development and (5) Upgrade the
existing physical form of the site. The plan's key elements were
the creation of (1) a campus core (2) a walkable campus and (3)
a pattern of uses, all intended to better integrate the
installation and provide stronger physical and functional
focuses.

NSF Anacostia-Bolling AFB Joint Base Master Plan - Phase 1 ­
Concept Report

BRAC 2005 called for the unification of NSF Anacostia and
Bolling AFB into one joint base under NDW. To guide compliance
with this mandate and consistent with DoD's Supplemental
Guidance for Implementing and Operating a Joint Base for Real
Property Matters (15 April 2008), the Navy has initiated
preparation of a joint base master plan. Phase 1 of the project,
completed in December 2008, created a concept plan to aid in the
development of the full master plan (Phase 2, ongoing). The
primary purpose of the Concept Plan is to provide data,
analysis, and considerations that will serve as a basis for
further study and in-depth planning. It provides guidance for,
but does not determine or bind, the future joint base master
plan. Main areas of consideration include sustainability, land
use, parking and density, and multi-modal transportation. The
Concept Plan includes three land use planning options. Under all
options, the preferred site for the proposed NSMA facility is
within an area mapped for mission/administrative uses. This area
is bounded by the installation's boundary to the east, Thomas
Road to the south, Mitcher Road and Defense Boulevard to the
west, and Defense Boulevard to the north. The area immediately
south across Thomas Road from the preferred site, is mapped for
industrial use. At the southern end of the installation, the
area across McGuire Avenue from the alternate site is mapped as
a "secure mission" area, that is an area proposed for facilities
with special security and perimeter requirements.

Bolling AFB Housing Privatization

Housing on Bolling AFB has recently been privatized under the
Air Force Privatization Program. As part of this privatization,
a total of 782 existing units will be demolished, 119 new units
will be built, and 47 units will be renovated, for an end-state
of 670 units (The Landings at Bolling). As part of this project,
the housing area just across McGuire Avenue from the alternate
site, Doolittle Park, is scheduled for demolition after
residents are relocated. The parcel will then be returned to the
Air Force for redevelopment. Demolition and construction
activities have begun and all work is scheduled to be completed
in 2012, though families may begin to move into some of the new
units in early 2011.

Bellevue Housing Privatization

The Navy's Bellevue Housing development is in the process of
being privatized along with other Navy family housing within NDW
as part of a Public/Private Venture (PPV). Under the PPV,
ownership of the housing units will be transferred to a limited
liability company (LLC), which will lease the underlying land
from the government for approximately 50 years. The Bellevue
conveyance area encompasses approximately 65 acres, including
the triangle-shaped parcel within which the alternate site is
located. Other than the unit ownership transfer and land lease,
no change would be made at Bellevue Housing as part of the
project. All existing units would remain and no new units would
be constructed.

3.1.2.3    Design Reviews

Two Federal agencies review and approve      Federal   construction
projects in the District of Columbia:

   ·   NCPC, which is the Federal government's central planning
       agency for Federal land and buildings in the National
       Capital Region. NCPC reviews a wide range of plans and
       projects from memorials and museums to new Federal office
       buildings to communications towers and perimeter security
       projects. Through its review, NCPC ensures that Federal
       development meets the highest design standards and complies
       with the Commission's policies, including the Comprehensive
       Plan for the National Capital: Federal Elements.

   ·   The Commission of Fine Arts (CFA). Established in 1910, CFA
       is charged with giving expert advice to the President,


Existing Environment             3-10
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


      Congress, and the heads of departments and agencies of the
      Federal and District of Columbia governments on matters of
      design and aesthetics, as they affect the Federal interest
      and preserve the dignity of the nation's capital.


3.2     Socioeconomics

3.2.1 Demographic and Economic Profile

The Bolling-Anacostia Installation is located in Ward 8 of
Washington DC. Ward 8 is one of the two city wards located south
of the Anacostia River. The Installation is within Census Tract
(CT) 73.1; census tracts immediately east of the Installation
(across South Capitol Street and I-295) include, from north to
south: CT 74.01; CT 98.09; CT 73.02; and CT 98.07. These five
census tracts constitute the demographic study area for this EA.
It should be noted, however, that CT 98.09 coincides with the
East and West campuses of St. Elizabeth's Hospital; as such,
data for this tract are not representative of the local
community.

Table 3-1 summarizes Census 2000 demographic information               for
Washington, DC, Ward 8, and the demographic study area.

As can be seen, both Ward 8 and the four census tracts across I-
295 from the Installation are home to a large majority of
African-Americans. The contrasting racial make-up of CT 73.1,
which is closer to the general US population's than to the
District's, Ward 8's, or the neighboring census tracts', likely
reflects the presence there of a substantial amount of military
housing (Bellevue, Bolling), with a more transient and diverse
resident population.

Census 2000 data also suggest that the demographic study area is
home to a higher proportion of children and youths (under 18
years of age) than the District of Columbia as a whole, also a
characteristic of Ward 8. In this respect, CT 73.01 is not
significantly different from the rest of the study area, which
likely reflects the presence of military family housing on the
Installation. Most housing is located at or near the south end
of the Installation, far from the proposed site but surrounding
the alternate site to the north and east (however, Doolittle
Park, the residential parcel directly north of the site, across
McGuire Avenue, is scheduled for demolition and redevelopment
for yet to be determined non-residential functions).

Post-Census 2000 estimates indicate that the population of
Washington DC has been increasing (the estimate for July 2007 is
588,292) and that the non-Hispanic white population has
increased relative to other racial and ethnic groups. In 2007,
this population was estimated to represent about 32.5 percent of
the District's residents (data available on the website of the
DC Office of Planning). No Ward­ or CT-levels estimates are
available. However, the District-wide demographic changes just
summarized are not of such scope as to have significantly
changed the demographic characteristics of the study area.

Economic data characterizing the study area, along with Ward 8
and Washington, DC as a whole for comparison, are presented in
Table 3-2.

Based on these data, the study area is substantially poorer than
the District of Columbia as a whole, though somewhat more
prosperous than Ward 8 as a whole. Outliers are CT 98.09 and CT
73.01. CT 98.09 encompasses St. Elizabeth's Hospital and, as
such, is not representative of the local situation. Nor is CT
73.01, though for a different reason: economic data for this
tract likely reflect that most or all of its residents are
military personnel families associated with Bolling-Anacostia or
other military installations in the area.


3.2.2 Environmental Justice and Protection of Children

Signed on February 11, 1994, Executive Order (EO) 12898, Federal
Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations
and Low-Income Populations, directs all Federal departments and
agencies to incorporate environmental justice considerations in
achieving their mission. Each Federal department or agency is to
accomplish this by conducting programs, policies, and activities
that substantially affect human health or the environment in a
manner that does not exclude communities from participation in,
deny communities the benefits of, nor subject communities to
discrimination under such actions because of their race, color,
or national origin.

Environmental Assessment


According to CEQ guidance on EO 12898, "minority populations
should be identified where either: (a) the minority population
of the affected area exceeds 50 percent or (b) the minority
population percentage of the affected area is meaningfully
greater than the minority population percentage in the general
population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis [...]
Low-income populations in an affected area should be identified
using the annual statistical poverty thresholds from the Bureau
of the Census."

Based on the data presented in Section 3.2.1, the demographic
study area qualifies as an Environmental Justice community on
both racial and economic grounds.

EO 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks
and Safety Risks, was signed on April 21, 1997. Because the
scientific community has recognized that children may suffer
disproportionately from environmental health and safety risks,
the EO directs Federal agencies to identify and assess such
risks, and consequently to ensure that their policies, programs,
activities,   and   standards   address  effects  on   children.
"Environmental health and safety risks" are defined as "risks to
health or to safety that are attributable to products or
substances that the child is likely to come in contact with or
ingest." Regulatory actions that are affected by this EO are
those substantive actions that involve an environmental health
risk or safety risk that an agency has reason to believe may
disproportionately affect children.

As the demographic data summarized in Section 3.2.1 indicate,
the proportion of persons under 18 years of age is higher in the
population of the demographic study area than it is in the
population of the District of Columbia as a whole, particularly
in CT 73.01, which contains the Installation. The underage
residents of this tract are most likely concentrated in the
southern part of the Installation, in the Bellevue and Bolling
military family housing areas. Both Bolling AFB and NSF
Anacostia have Child Development Centers (CDCs). NSF Anacostia's
is located near the northern tip of the property, off Robbins
Road. Bolling AFB's CDC is in the west-central part of the base.
Neither CDC is close to either of the sites being considered.

3.3     Transportation
Access to the Bolling-Anacostia Installation is primarily via
mass transit or personal motor vehicle. Because of the location
of the Installation and lack of easy and safe pathways,
pedestrian and bicycle access can be considered minor.


3.3.1     Transit Access

Regional transit access is via Metrorail or Metrobus.

3.3.1.1   Metrorail

The nearest Metrorail station to the Installation is the
Anacostia Station, near the intersection of Firth Sterling
Avenue and Howard Road, SE. The most direct route from the
station to the Installation (via the North Gate) is along Firth
Sterling Avenue. The walking distance is a little more than half
a mile. This distance is slightly above the upper limit that
NCPC, in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan
for the National Capital, considers a reasonable walking
distance between a Metrorail station and a place of employment
(from 2,000 feet to half a mile). Additionally, there is no
continuous sidewalk along Firth Sterling Avenue between the
station and the gate: past the intersection with the Suitland
Parkway, pedestrians must walk on the side of the road or on
grass. On their way, Installation-bound pedestrians must cross
the Suitland Parkway and South Capitol Street. There is a
crosswalk across the Suitland Parkway, but according to the DDOT
Traffic Services Administration, this is a high pedestrian
accident intersection. There is no crosswalk at all across South
Capitol Street. Finally, the reputation of the surrounding
neighborhood as a high-crime area is likely to further
discourage potential Metrorail users who would have to walk
between the station and the Installation in the morning and the
evening.

Shuttle   service  between   the  Metrorail   station  and   the
Installation via the North Gate partly mitigates this situation.
One shuttle is run by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), but
it is limited to DIA employees. Another shuttle is run by the
Air Force between 5:25 and 9:15 in the morning and 3:10 and 6:48
in the evening, with 20-minute headways. The shuttle stops at
several places on NSF Anacostia and Bolling AFB. The closest
stop to the preferred site is Stop #4, near the intersection of
Thomas Road and Brookley Boulevard, SW. The ride between the


                                  3-15                 Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


Metrorail station and Stop #4 takes between 20 and 30 minutes,
depending on the direction. The shuttle also stops near Building
168 (Stop #1). There is no stop within walking distance of the
alternate site. The attractiveness of the Air Force shuttle
service is diminished by the lack of mid-day service, which may
leave employees stranded. The DIA and the Air Force shuttles
both operate under waivers from DoD transportation regulations
that prohibit the use of government transportation between
residences and workplaces.

3.3.1.2    Metrobus

Seven Metrobus lines run along South Capitol Street and have
stops near the Installation. Information on these lines is
provided in Table 3-3.

Only Line W-4 provides service throughout the day. Line W-4
serves the Main Gate at South Capitol Street and Malcolm X
Avenue, and the North Gate at South Capitol Street and Firth
Sterling Avenue. So does Line A-9, but on a much more limited
schedule since, like the other lines, it only provides rush-hour
service. With the exception of Line W-4, the bus lines that run
along South Capitol Street near the Installation are primarily
designed to move people between downtown Washington and the
Maryland suburbs during peak periods.


3.3.2     Vehicular Access
3.3.2.1   Regional and Local Access

Regional vehicular access to the Installation from the west and
south is via I-395 and I-295, which, to the south, connect to I-
495   (the   Capital    Beltway)   in Virginia   and   Maryland,
respectively. To the north, I-395 and I-295 are connected by the
Southwest-Southeast Freeway, which extends between the 14th
Street and the 11th Street Bridges.

Regional access from the north and east is via South Capitol
Street, the Suitland Parkway (which connects to South Capitol
Street via Firth Sterling Avenue, SE), and the Anacostia Freeway
(DC 295, which connects with I-295 at the 11th Street Bridge).
South Capitol Street and I-295 run parallel immediately east of
the Installation. From South Capitol Street, the Installation
can be reached directly or via Overlook Avenue, SW. From I-295,
the Installation is reached via Malcolm X Avenue, SE.

Vehicles enter the Installation through one of three guarded
gates: the North Gate at South Capitol Street and Firth Sterling
Avenue; the Main Gate (Arnold Gate) at South Capitol Street and
Malcolm X Avenue; and the South Gate, off Overlook Avenue. The
Main Gate is the busiest of the three gates: for instance, on
November 18, 2008, between 5:00 AM and 9:30 AM, a total of 3,491
vehicles entered the Installation through the Main Gate, as
opposed to 1,641 through the North Gate and 2,349 through the
South Gate.

3.3.2.2   Study Intersections

A study was conducted to assess the potential vehicular traffic
impacts of the proposed action on six intersections in the
vicinity of the Installation (the study intersections). The
study intersections are (see also Figure 3-1):

   4. South Capitol Street and Firth Sterling Avenue (signalized)
   5. Overlook Avenue, SW at the South Gate (signalized)
   6. Overlook Avenue, SW at Chesapeake Street, SW (signalized).

Study intersections #1 to 3 provide access to the       Main Gate;
study intersection #4 provides access to the North     Gate; study
intersections #5 and 6 provide access to the South     Gate. These
are the intersections that would be most impacted by   the traffic
generated by the proposed action.

3.3.2.3    Roadway Inventory

The study intersections connect with each other a total of six
roadways, briefly characterized below:

   ·   The I-295 section of the Anacostia Freeway is classified as
       an interstate highway. It branches off the Southeast-
       Southwest Freeway in Northeast DC, crosses the Anacostia
       River on the 11th Street Bridge, then runs southward to the
       Capital Beltway (I-495) near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in
       Prince George's County, Maryland. To the northeast, the I-
       295 section of the Anacostia Freeway connects with the DC
       295 section, providing access to the Baltimore-Washington
       Parkway and US 50. The speed limit is 50 miles per hour
       (MPH). Annual Daily Traffic (ADT) is 85,000 vehicles.

   ·   South Capitol Street is classified as an expressway south of
       M Street and along the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge
       over the Anacostia River, where it continues south, parallel
       to I-295. The classification of the roadway changes from
       expressway to minor arterial south of the intersection with
       Firth Sterling Avenue, SE. The posted speed limit is 35 MPH
       north of Firth Sterling Avenue and 40 MPH south of it. ADT
       is 52,750 vehicles.

   ·   Firth Sterling Avenue, SE is a four-lane collector road that
       runs southwest to northeast between South Capitol Street and
       Howard Road, SE. This road is a main route for motorists and
       pedestrians traveling between NSF Anacostia, the Anacostia
       Metrorail station, and Historic Anacostia. The speed limit
       on Firth Sterling Avenue is 25 MPH. ADT is 10,600 vehicles.

3.3.2.4   Existing Traffic Conditions

To determine existing traffic conditions, manual traffic turning
movement counts were taken on Tuesday March 17 and Wednesday
March 18, 2009, during the AM (6:30-8:30) and PM (3:30-5:30)
peak periods at the six study intersections. The AM and PM peak
hours were determined based on these peak-period counts. The
counts were analyzed to determine the four highest consecutive
15-minute volumes (the peak hour) during each peak period. The
peak hours were found to be:

  ·   AM Peak Hour: 7:00-8:00 AM
  ·   PM Peak Hour: 4:15-5:15 PM

ADT volumes for roadway links were derived from 2007 traffic
volumes available from DDOT, adjusted for 2009 using an annual
growth rate of + 2 percent. The ADT of a roadway is the typical
daily traffic volume in both directions.

Using the existing traffic volumes, the six study intersections
were analyzed consistent with the procedures set forth in the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board,
Updated 2000. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS) program was
used to determine operational levels of service (LOS). Existing
traffic signal timings were used for the analysis.

LOS is a measurement of traffic flow in terms of speed and
travel time, freedom to maneuver, comfort, and convenience.
There are six LOS, designated by the letters A through F, with
LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the
worst. LOS for intersections are measured in terms of vehicle
delay,   with   somewhat    different   values   for   signalized
intersections and un-signalized ones, as shown in Table 3-4.

   C                             >20-35        C                              >15-25
   D                             >35-55        D                              >25-35
   E                             >55-80        E                              >35-50
   F                       More than 80        F                        More than 50


The LOS for a signalized intersection reflects the average delay
for the entire intersection or the delay for individual
movements. For un-signalized intersections, the LOS reflects the
delay for side street traffic attempting to enter the mainline.
The study intersections are all signalized, except intersection
#3.

Additional results provided by the computer model are the delay
per vehicle in seconds, and the volume/capacity (v/c) ratio. The
v/c ratio is a comparison between the volume of traffic entering
the intersection from one or all approaches and the possible
capacity of one or all approaches.

An LOS C or better is the desirable goal for a roadway facility.
However, in major urban areas such as Washington, DC, LOS D is
considered acceptable. LOS E and F are generally considered
unacceptable.

A summary of the existing LOS for the six study intersections,
including delay and v/c ratios, is shown in Table 3-5. The
analysis shows that all six intersections operate at overall LOS
C or better. The complete traffic impact study can be found in
Appendix C.

3.3.3     Parking

There are numerous parking facilities scattered throughout the
Installation, including two two-story parking garages located
near the intersection of Thomas Road and Defense Boulevard.
While some parking areas are reserved for specific agencies or
buildings, other are open to all Installation employees.
However, drivers can be expected to use only parking within
reasonable walking distance of their final destination. This
distance varies with the driver's purpose and the duration and
destination of the trip. For example, workers usually are
willing to walk longer distances to their destination than are
shoppers; also, the acceptable walking distance is generally
greater when a garage is available. For the purposes of this EA,
the   acceptable  walking   distance  from   parking  to   final




                                                               3-21                                        Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


destination (the proposed NSMA facility) can be estimated to be
0.25 mile, or a 5-minute walk.

Based on parking supply and utilization data obtained from the
draft Bolling AFB Transportation Management Plan (2009) amended
based on information provided by the NSF Anacostia Department of
Public Works (NSF Anacostia DPW, September 2, 2009), there are
832 available parking spaces within 0.25 mile of the preferred
site (this number excludes parking reserved for specific
agencies or users as well as handicapped parking). Of these
spaces, from 501 to 463 were found to be unoccupied during the
mid-day period. Fourteen of the 832 spaces are located on the
preferred site, with a utilization rate ranging from 21 percent
in mid-morning to 71 percent in mid-afternoon. The draft Bolling
AFB Transportation Management Plan shows no available parking
within 0.25 mile of the alternate site.


3.4     Air Quality
3.4.1    National Ambient Air Quality Standards

The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), under the
requirements of the 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1977
and 1990, has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for six air pollutants, referred to as criteria
pollutants (40 CFR 50). These are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM10: diameter
equal to or less than 10 micrometers, and PM2.5: diameter equals
to or less than 2.5 micrometers), lead (Pb), and sulfur dioxide
(SO2). The NAAQS include primary and secondary standards. The
primary standards were established at levels sufficient to
protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. The
secondary standards were established to protect the public
welfare from the adverse effects associated with pollutants in
the ambient air. Table 3-6 shows the primary and secondary
standards.

3.4.2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard Attainment
Status

Areas that meet the NAAQS for a criteria pollutant are designated
"in attainment." Areas where a criteria pollutant level exceeds
the NAAQS are designated "nonattainment" areas. O3 nonattainment
areas are further categorized based on the severity of their
pollution problem - marginal, moderate, serious, severe, or
extreme. CO and PM10 nonattainment areas are categorized as
moderate or serious. A maintenance area is one that has been re-
designated an attainment area from a previous nonattainment
status and has an approved maintenance plan under Section 175 of
the CAA. When insufficient data exist to determine an area's

Environmental Assessment


attainment status,         it   is   designated   unclassifiable,   or   in
attainment.

The proposed action evaluated in this EA would take place in
Washington, DC, a moderate nonattainment area for O3, a
nonattainment area for PM2.5, and an attainment area for all
other criteria pollutants.


3.4.3    State Implementation Plans

The CAA, as amended in 1990, mandates that state agencies adopt
state implementation plans (SIPs) that target the elimination or
reduction of the severity and number of violations of the NAAQS.
SIPs set forth policies to expeditiously achieve and maintain
attainment of the standards.

The   SIPs   currently   applicable    to   the   Washington, DC
nonattainment area are the Plan to Improve Air Quality in the
Washington, DC-MD-VA Region, State Implementation Plan for 8-
Hour Ozone (MWCOG, May 23, 2007) and the Plan to Improve Air
Quality in the Washington, DC-MD-VA Region, State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for Fine Particle (PM2.5)(MWCOG, March 7, 2008).

The O3 SIP is a plan to improve air quality in the Washington, DC
region to meet the eight-hour O3 standard by 2009. It consists of
a Reasonable Further Progress Plan, 2002-2008; an attainment
plan; an analysis of reasonably available control measures; an
attainment demonstration; contingency plan for attainment; and
mobile source budgets for 2008, 2009, and 2010. The plan
establishes a base year inventory for 2002 and projected
inventories for 2008 and 2009.

The PM2.5 SIP is a plan to demonstrate continued improvement and
compliance with the 1997 NAAQS for PM2.5 in the Washington region
in 2009. The Plan consists of base year inventories for 2002,
projection   inventories   for   2009,    an   attainment  plan,   a
demonstration of reasonably available control measures, motor
vehicle   emission   budgets   for   2009    and   2010,  attainment
demonstration, and contingency plans for attainment.


3.4.4    Local Ambient Air Quality

Ambient air quality conditions in the Washington, DC area are
monitored at many locations. The most recent available data (for
the year 2008) from nearby monitoring stations are used here to

describe existing ambient air quality in the project area. These
data are shown in Table 3-7. All measurements are below the
standards, with the exception of O3, consistent with the region's
status as a nonattainment area for this pollutant. For PM2.5, the
readings provided in Table 3-7 are below the NAAQS, although the
region as a whole is in nonattainment for this criteria
pollutant. This reflects the improvement toward achieving the
standard that has taken place over the past few years.

3.4.5      2008 Air Emission Inventory at NSF Anacostia

Various stationary sources at NSF Anacostia emit air pollutants,
including diesel generators and boilers. Based on the type of
pollutant emitted, the CAA sets forth permit rules and emission
standards for sources of certain sizes. The USEPA oversees
programs for stationary-source operating permits (Title V) for
new or modified major stationary source construction and
operation. NSF Anacostia is classified as a major source and
operates under a Title V permit (#011). The estimated on-base
annual emissions from stationary sources reported in the most
recent Title V permit renewal are summarized in Table 3-8, along
with the thresholds for major source designation. Actual
emissions are well below the potential to emit or the major

source thresholds (status as a major source is based on the
potential to emit, not actual emissions).

3.4.6     Clean Air Act Conformity

The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 expand the scope and
content of the CAA's conformity provisions in terms of their
relationship to a SIP. Under Section 176(c) of CAAA, a project is
in "conformity" if it corresponds to a SIP's purpose of
eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations, and
achieving the expeditious attainment, of the NAAQS. Conformity
further requires that such activities would not:

   ·   Cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in
       any area.
   ·   Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation
       of any standard in any area.
   ·   Delay the timely attainment of any standard or any required
       interim emission reduction or other milestone in any area.

The USEPA published final rules on general conformity (40 CFR
Parts 51 and 93 in the Federal Register on November 30, 1993) that
apply to Federal actions in nonattainment areas. The rules specify
de minimis (threshold) emission levels by pollutant to determine
the applicability of conformity requirements for a project. In
this case, the project area is located in a moderate nonattainment
area for O3 in an O3 transport region and a nonattainment area for
PM2.5. The applicable de minimis are 100 tons per year (tpy) (91
metric tpy) for NOx, PM2.5, and SO2 (as PM2.5 precursor) and 50 tpy


Existing Environment                   3-26
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


of volatile organic compounds (VOC; NOx and VOC are precursors of
O3).


3.5   Noise
The main sources of noise at the Bolling-Anacostia Installation
are on-base military helicopter operations; commercial aircraft
operations at Ronald Reagan-National Airport (DCA), across the
Potomac River from the Installation; and vehicular traffic,
particularly on South Capitol Street and I-295. Secondary
sources   of  noise   include on-base   traffic  and  equipment
operation. Outside the Installation, highway and street traffic
is the major noise source.

Helicopter operations at the Air Force helipad or the HMX-1
airfield are sporadic and not a steady source of noise. While
noise from DCA is steady, review of the airport's 2004 FAR Part
150 Noise Exposure Maps (both "existing" for 2000-2001 and
projected for 2009) indicates that the Installation and nearby
neighborhoods are well outside the 65-dBA day-night average
level (DNL) contour, the accepted threshold for incompatibility
with residential land uses. This is in contrast with the
conditions described by the previous noise maps (developed in
1990 and describing 1989 conditions), which showed the 65-dBA
contour extending over a substantial portion of Bolling AFB (but
not outside the base). The improvement is attributable to the
replacement of noisier aircraft by quieter ones and the
implementation of noise-reducing measures. The 2004 Part 150
study's noise exposure grid maps show DNL on the Installation to
be in the 60-50 dBA range.



3.6   Cultural Resources
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
requires Federal agencies to integrate consideration of historic
preservation issues into the early stages of their planning
projects. Under Section 106, the head of any Federal agency
having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed Federal
or Federally-financed undertaking is required to account for the
effects of this undertaking on any district, site, building,
structure, or object that is included or eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places. Eligibility
determinations are based on National Register criteria for
architectural integrity. Section 106 consultation in the


                                 3-27                 Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


District of Columbia is conducted       with   the   DC   Historic
Preservation Office (DCHPO).


3.6.1    NSF Anacostia and the Preferred Site

The only historic properties in the general vicinity of the
preferred site are Buildings 168 and 169, eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places. Neither building is
adjacent to the site. With regard to archaeology, the northern
half of the preferred site was previously occupied by Building
150, now demolished; the southern half is occupied by parking
lots and a temporary building (Building 387). Thus, past
construction and demolition activities have disturbed the site
and there is little potential for any archaeological resources
to be present.


3.6.2     Bolling AFB/Bellevue Housing and the Alternate
Site

Bolling AFB contains a historic district, the Bolling Field
Historic District, eligible for listing in the National
Register. The district includes 75 buildings dating from 1933-
1945. It extends between the eastern boundary of the property
and Brookley Avenue from just north of the Main Gate down to and
inclusive of the Westover housing area. In addition to this
historic district, Bolling AFB contains areas with significant
potential for prehistoric and historic archaeological resources.
According to the EA prepared in 2001 for the construction of
DIAC, twenty-three archeological sites have been identified on
the property.

In 1994, the Navy conducted a Phase 1b archaeological survey of
the portion of Bellevue Housing located west of the abandoned
railroad right-of-way that runs along the eastern edge of the
Installation. This work was performed to support the proposed
demolition of the housing units then present on the property
(these units dated back to 1941 and have since been demolished).
The alternate site considered for the proposed NSMA facility is
within the area that was surveyed.

One shovel test ­ Location 19 ­ yielded historic and prehistoric
material. Location 19 was interpreted as previously-identified
Site 51SW7, originally thought to be located farther west. While
no further work was recommended with regard to the historic



Existing Environment          3-28
                    Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


component of the site, the survey report concluded that the
prehistoric component retained integrity and was potentially
eligible for listing in the National Register. Phase II
evaluation was recommended for any project that would disturb
the site. Based on the map contained in the 1994 report, Site
51SW7 is within or adjacent to the alternate site. (Historic and
prehistoric   material  was   recovered  at   two  other  survey
locations, to the west and south of Site 51SW7, but no further
work was recommended for these isolated finds.)

No architectural surveys have been conducted at Bellevue Navy
Housing. Per information provided in the draft EA for the
privatization of Bellevue and other Navy housing, the Navy has
evaluated the eligibility of Bellevue's 188 units and associated
facilities. Bellevue Navy Housing was completed in 1996. Based
on available background information, the Navy concluded that the
housing units and supporting facilities do not have the
exceptional historical or architectural merit that would allow
them to meet the National Register criteria applying to
buildings less than 50 years old.


3.7     Natural Resources
3.7.1     Geology, Topography, and Soils
3.7.1.1   General

The Installation is located in the Atlantic Coastal Plain
physiographic province, at the confluence of the Potomac and
Anacostia rivers. The geology of the coastal plain is
characterized by alternating layers of marine and terrestrial
sediments consisting of gravel, sands, silts, and clays
deposited on an eroded crystalline basement rock surface.

The   Installation  is   generally  flat   with  no  significant
topographic features. Elevations range from near sea level along
the shoreline to approximately 25 feet. The higher points are
generally the artificial result of filling.

Most of the Installation's soils consist of fill and altered
soils classified as Udorthents or Urban Land by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The fill consists of
unconsolidated materials and materials from past excavations and
dredging. Its potential to support construction and landscaping
is limited. Many existing facilities have experienced settling
and separation of the different facility elements. Special


                                    3-29                 Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


foundation design is required for most building loads. Other
soil series mapped on the Installation include Christiana-Urban
Land Complex; Dunning; Galestown-Urband Land Complex; Keyport
Fine Sandy Loam; Melvin Silt Loam; and Muirkirk.

3.7.1.2   Preferred Site

The preferred site is flat and located in an area mapped by NRCS
as Urban Land, reflecting past and existing development
(demolished Building 150; parking lots). In April 2004, soil
borings were taken and analyzed as part of a limited site
investigation conducted to provide information on the potential
presence of hazardous materials (the conclusions of this
investigation are summarized in Section 3.8). Borings were taken
at 14 locations across the site, to a maximum depth of 16 feet.
In most spots, fill was found to a depth of approximately 3 to 4
feet, depending on the location, atop an underlying layer of
lean clay all the way to the bottom of the probe. In one area in
the southeastern part of the site, fill was found all the way to
the bottom of the probe (GP-13). At another location (GP-6),
concrete was encountered under about 4.5 feet of fill.

3.7.1.3   Alternate Site

The alternate site is flat and located in an area mapped as
Galestown-Urban Land Complex by NRSC. The Galestown soil series
consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on
uplands. Available water capacity is moderate and shrink-swell
potential is low. The water table is deeper than 6 feet. It is
not a hydric soil. "Urban Land" refers to soils that are
supporting roadways and other improvements. The site is
currently vacant but was once part of a residential development
now demolished (see Section 3.6.2).


3.7.2     Water Resources
3.7.2.1   General

The Installation is located just south of the confluence between
the Anacostia River and the Potomac River. At this location,
both rivers are tidally-influenced freshwater bodies. Due to the
predominantly urban character of its watershed, the Anacostia
River has long been characterized by poor water and sediment
quality. As stated in the EIS prepared in 2007 for the
replacement of the 11th Street bridges, the Anacostia River is
listed as an Impaired Waterbody by the District of Columbia and


Existing Environment          3-30
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


as an Impaired Water by the USEPA. Studies have shown that
significant amounts of contaminants enter the Anacostia River
from the Northwest and Northeast branches (whose convergence
forms the river, approximately 8 miles from its mouth), and that
the movement of suspended particulate matter from the upper
river is likely an important contaminant transport mechanism.
Movement and the rate of deposition vary according to location.
South of the 11th Street bridges, the river widens and deepens
sufficiently to allow energy to dissipate and remaining fine
particulates   to   settle.   This  limits   the  transport   of
contaminants from the Anacostia into the Potomac River, where
water quality generally is less impaired.
The Anacostia and Potomac rivers in the District of Columbia are
designated for Class D (protection of human health related to
consumption of fish and shellfish) beneficial use. Additional
designated uses include primary and secondary contact recreation
(Class A and B, respectively), and protection of aquatic life
(Class C). Based on the 2000 305(b) report available on the DC
Department of the Environment's website, in the area of the
Installation, neither river supports the Class A or Class D
uses; only the Potomac supports the Class B use; both rivers
support the Class C use.

The Installation drains to the west toward the Potomac River.
Runoff from impervious areas at NSF Anacostia is collected
through a network of pipes, culverts, inlets, and pump stations
that discharge to the Potomac and Anacostia rivers through seven
outfalls.    Stormwater   discharges   are   covered    by   the
installation's National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit.

Based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) 110001 0025B, a portion of Bolling AFB
(centered on the marina near the southwestern corner of the
base) is within the 100-year floodplain while most of NSF
Anacostia is within the 500-year floodplain. Flooding is
controlled by a concrete seawall and earth levee that has been
constructed along the shoreline. According to the 2004 Site
Development Plan for NSF Anacostia, parts of the seawall have
deteriorated and this may potentially impair flood control.
During storm events, localized flooding may occur as a result of
the failure of the storm sewer drains combined with the
generally flat character of the property.

Review of the National Wetlands Inventory Map shows no wetlands
within the boundaries of the Installation.



                                 3-31                 Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


3.7.2.2   Preferred Site

There are no natural or artificial bodies of water on or
adjacent to the preferred site, which is located on the landside
edge of NSF Anacostia. The site is currently about half
pervious, half impervious. Runoff from the paved portions of the
site drains to the storm sewer system and ultimately to the
Potomac River. Like most of NSF Anacostia, the preferred site is
located within the 500-year floodplain but outside the 100-year
floodplain. There are no wetlands on or adjacent to the site,
part of which was previously developed (Building 150, now
demolished), part of which consists of paved parking lots.

3.7.2.3   Alternate Site

There are no natural or artificial bodies of water on or
adjacent to the alternate site. The site is separated from the
Potomac shoreline by developed land, including a large parking
lot to the northwest. The alternate site is currently entirely
undeveloped and pervious. It is located outside the 100- or 500-
year floodplains. It does not contain any wetlands.


3.7.3     Biological Resources
3.7.3.1   General

Past land filling and development at the Installation have
resulted in the loss of any native vegetation and wildlife. The
only animal and plant species likely to be encountered are those
most common in urbanized waterfront areas. Most undeveloped
areas are covered with grass; trees are relatively few and
widely scattered. Animal species that may be present include
common   birds,  such   as   the   northern mockingbird   (Mimus
polyglottos), Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), American
robin (Turdus migratorius), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata),
European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), pigeon (Columba livia),
Canada goose (Branta canadensis), and seagulls (Larus spp.) as
well as common mammals such as the gray squirrel (Sciurus
carolinensis), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and
various shrews (Sorex spp.) and rodents.

3.7.3.2   Preferred Site

The preferred site consists of a square-shaped, grassed area
surrounded by paved lots and roadways. Approximately 20
scattered trees ranging in size from 8-inch oak trees to 15-inch


Existing Environment          3-32
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


evergreens to a 32-inch oak, are present on the site. The
potential of the site as wildlife habitat is minimal. The larger
trees may provide some perching and possibly nesting habitat for
birds as well as some nesting and foraging habitat for
squirrels.

3.7.3.3   Alternate Site

Like the preferred site, the alternate site has minimal
potential as wildlife habitat. It consists mostly of an open,
grassed parcel with a scattering of trees that may offer some
marginal habitat for birds and squirrels.

3.7.3.4   Threatened and Endangered Species

No species protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are
known to occur at the Installation. As previously noted, the
potential of the Installation and proposed project sites as
wildlife habitat is minimal. However, one protected species ­
the shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), listed as
endangered - may occur in the Potomac or the Anacostia River in
the vicinity of the Installation.

3.7.3.5   Migratory Birds

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 is the primary legislation
in the United States established to conserve migratory birds.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking, killing or
possessing of migratory birds unless permitted by regulation.

DoD operates under a Memorandum of Understanding with the US
Fish and Wildlife Service for Migratory Bird Treaty Act
coordination on activities, such as the proposed action, that
are not specifically related to military readiness. The
Memorandum of Understanding states that the Department of
Defense shall accomplish the following prior to starting any
activity that is likely to affect populations of migratory
birds:

  1) Identify the migratory bird species likely to occur in the
     area of the proposed action and determine if any species of
     concern could be affected by the activity.

  2) Assess and document, through the project planning process,
    using NEPA when applicable, the effect of the proposed
    action on species of concern.



                                  3-33                 Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


   3) Engage in early planning and scoping with the US Fish and
      Wildlife Service relative to potential impacts of a
      proposed action, to proactively address migratory bird
      conservation, and to initiate appropriate actions to avoid
      or minimize the take of migratory birds.

Because of the marginal character of the habitat present on the
Installation, in particular the lack of any significant amount
of forest, its potential to support migratory birds is minimal.
However, because of the proximity of the Potomac River, it is
possible that bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) may forage
in the vicinity of the Installation. Recently delisted from the
ESA, the bald eagle is still protected under the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act as well as under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection
Act. No bald eagle nest exists on the Installation, which lacks
the type of tall, mature trees favored by the eagle for nesting.


3.8     Hazardous Materials and Waste
3.8.1    General

The various activities on the Installation make use of different
types of hazardous materials and produce different types of
hazardous waste, including, for instance, fuels, solvents, oils,
paints, organic substances, used paint, dirt contaminated with
oil and other organic liquids, and batteries.

NSF Anacostia is regulated as a Large Quantity Generator (LQG)
of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA) of 1976. An LQG generates 2,200 pounds or more of
hazardous waste, or more than 2.2 pounds of acute hazardous
waste, per calendar month. All hazardous waste generated by the
LQG that is not treated onsite must be manifested and sent to an
offsite treatment, storage, and disposal facility permitted to
handle hazardous waste, or sent to an approved designated
facility (e.g., a recycling facility). Hazardous waste at NSF
Anacostia is handled, stored, and disposed of in accordance with
applicable local and Federal laws and regulations.

To satisfy the requirements of the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act (SARA), which amended the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
as well as RCRA for former and current hazardous waste sites,
NSF Anacostia and Bolling AFB have been investigating and
remediating hazardous waste contamination areas as part of the
DoD's   Environmental  Restoration   (ER)   Program.  Based   on


Existing Environment          3-34
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


information contained in the 2008 NSF Anacostia-Bolling AFB
Joint Base Master Plan Phase I Concept Report, there are no
active ER sites on NSF Anacostia. There are five ER sites on
Bolling AFB.


3.8.2   Preferred Site

The preferred site is partially occupied by a few trailers and a
semi-permanent building with primarily administrative functions.
Therefore, no significant amount of hazardous materials is
currently stored on the site, and no significant amount of
hazardous waste is currently generated there. No ER sites are
located within or adjacent to the preferred site.

In early 2008, under contract from the Navy, Schnabel
Engineering LLC conducted a limited subsurface investigation of
the site to provide current information on potential soil
contamination. Fourteen boring locations were analyzed. All soil
samples were screened for volatile organic compounds (VOCs); six
soil samples were analyzed for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons ­
Diesel Range Organics/Gasoline Range Organics (TPH-DRO/GRO); and
two samples were analyzed for priority pollutant metals, semi-
VOCS (SVOCs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

The analysis detected metals, TPH-DRO, and acetone (a VOC) in
the samples. No SVOCs, TPH-GRO, or PCBs were detected. Results
were compared to the Risk-Based Screening Levels (RBSLs)
developed for the District of Columbia Department of the
Environment (DDOE)'s Underground Storage Tank Program. For metal
for which RBSLs do not exist, results for compared to the
USEPA's Risk-Based Concentrations (RBC).

Arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc were
detected in both soil samples analyzed for metals. Arsenic
concentrations exceeded the RBSLs; however, Schnabel Engineering
LLC stated that they believe these concentrations to be within
the range naturally occurring in area soils. Chromium was
measured in excess of the RBSL for chromium VI but below the
RBSL for chromium III (which cannot be distinguished from
chromium VI by the analysis). Chromium naturally occurs as
chromium III. Schnabel Engineering LLC did not believe that the
chromium concentrations encountered were due to the presence of
chromium VI. All other metals were encountered at concentrations
below the applicable RBSLs.




                                 3-35                 Existing Environment
Environmental Assessment


TPH-DRO was detected in the six soil samples analyzed for it,
with concentrations ranging from 26 to 78 milligrams per
kilogram (mg/kg), below the DDOE RBSL of 100 mg/kg. Acetone was
detected at a concentration of 39 microgram/kg, below the RBSL
of 48,200,000 microgram/kg.

Based on a review of soil samples recovered during a separate
geotechnical investigation, Schnabel Engineering LLC noted the
presence of petroleum odors with a photo-ionization detector
(PID) reading of 4 parts per million (ppm) in one sample
collected at 83.5 to 85 feet below grade at a boring (B-3) in
the north central part of the site. The source of these odors
could not be determined by the analysis but petroleum impacted
soil may be present.


3.8.3    Alternate Site

The alternate site is currently undeveloped and no hazardous
materials are stored there. Nor is any hazardous waste generated
or stored at the site. There is no ER site within or immediately
adjacent to the alternate site.




Existing Environment          3-36
4. Environmental Consequences

This chapter describes the potential environmental impacts that
would result from implementing the alternatives being considered
by the Navy for the relocation of NSMA to a DoD-owned facility
in the National Capital Region. When applicable, mitigation
measures to minimize or avoid adverse impacts and permitting
requirements are also discussed.

As explained in Chapter 2, three alternatives are being
evaluated: the No Action Alternative, the Anacostia Alternative
(the preferred alternative) and the Bellevue Alternative.


4.1     Land Use and Plans
4.1.1     No Action Alternative
4.1.1.1   Land Use

The No Action Alternative would have no impacts on land use at
or near the Installation or on either of the sites considered
under the two action alternatives. There would be no change to
existing conditions as described in Section 3.1.1.

4.1.1.2   Relevant Planning Documents, Initiatives, and Projects

Generally, the No Action Alternative would not result in adverse
impacts to any of the plans and projects described in Section
3.1.2. It would not impede or prevent the implementation of any
planning policy, the achievement of any planning goal, or the
completion of any ongoing project. Nor, however, would it
actively support or promote any of these policies, goals, or
projects.


4.1.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)
4.1.2.1   Land Use

Implementation of the Anacostia Alternative would result in a
change in land use at the preferred site. The site is currently


                                4-1         Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


half-open, half-occupied by parking lots, temporary trailers,
and a semi-permanent building (Building 387). The trailers and
Building 387 would be moved to an on-base location to be
determined. After the proposed action is completed, the site
would be occupied by a combined facility, a half-administrative,
half-light industrial use.

While this would represent a change in land use, the new land
use would be compatible with its surroundings. The proposed
facility, along with associated security requirements and stand-
off distances, would be similar, in function and general
appearance, to existing facilities on NSF Anacostia and Bolling
AFB. It would be outside all existing restricted areas,
including the safety zones associated with the nearby HMX-1
compound. Due to the moderate scale of the proposed facility,
and to the functional and visual separation of NSF Anacostia
from the neighborhoods to the east by South Capitol Street and
I-295, there is no potential for indirect land use impacts
outside the installation.

4.1.2.2   Relevant Planning Documents, Initiatives, and Projects

Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital ­ Federal Elements ­
Federal Workplace

The construction of the proposed new combined NSMA facility
under the Anacostia Alternative would support most of the
relevant policies of the Federal Workplace Element of the
Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital, as detailed below.

   9. Give preference to established urban areas, or areas that
      are under redevelopment with infrastructure and services in
      place, when locating Federal workplaces.
      Locating NSMA to NSF Anacostia, a developed facility in the
      District of Columbia, would support this policy.

   10. Support regional and local agency objectives that encourage
       compact forms of growth and development when locating
       Federal workplaces.
       Constructing a combined facility with administrative and
       warehousing   functions  consolidated   into  one   compact
       facility would support this policy.

   11. Support regional and local agency efforts to coordinate
       land   use  with  the   availability  or  development  of
       transportation alternatives to the private automobile,
       including walking, bicycle riding, and public transit [...]


Environmental Consequences      4-2
               Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


   when locating Federal workplaces.
   NSF Anacostia is located in an area of the District of
   Columbia   that  is   the   object  of   multiple   planning
   initiatives and redevelopment projects (e.g. South Capitol
   Street   Corridor    Improvements,   Anacostia    Waterfront
   Initiative), which collectively are expected to make the
   area more accessible to alternative transportation modes.

12. Locate Federal facilities within walking distance of
    existing or planned fixed guideway transit services [...]
    Priority should be given to locations within walking
    distance to Metrorail due to its extensive reach into the
    region's residential areas.
    The preferred site is a little more than half a mile from
    the Anacostia Metrorail Station. Combined with distance,
    deficiencies in the existing infrastructure outside the
    Installation make walking from the station to the site an
    unattractive option for present and future NSF Anacostia
    workers. These issues are discussed in more detail in
    Section 4.3.2.1. The Navy has prepared a Transportation
    Management Plan (TMP) that outlines measures to encourage
    transit usage by NSMA employees.

13. Locate Federal workplaces in areas where efficiencies are
    gained through proximity to a market of private suppliers
    of goods and services.
    Locating the proposed new facility in the District of
    Columbia would be consistent with this policy.

14. Utilize available Federally-owned land or space before
    purchasing or leasing additional land or building space.
    Agencies should continuously monitor utilization rates of
    land and building space to ensure their efficient use.
    Moving NSMA from multiple leased spaces to one consolidated
    facility on an existing DoD installation would support this
    policy.

15. Consider the modernization, repair, and rehabilitation of
    existing Federally-owned facilities for Federal workplaces
    before developing new facilities.
    The Navy considered options that would have relocated NSMA
    to existing Federal facilities. The reasons for which such
    options were not retained are explained in Section 2.2.1 of
    this EA.

16. Minimize development of open space by selecting disturbed
    land or brownfields for new Federal workplaces or by


                               4-3            Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


      reusing existing buildings or sites.
      Construction of the proposed consolidated facility on the
      preferred site, which was previously occupied by Building
      150, would support this policy.

The Anacostia Alternative would also support policies pertaining
to the regional distribution of Federal workplaces by (1) moving
NSMA to the District of Columbia, consistent with the policy
that no less than 60 percent of the region's Federal employment
be in the District and that Federal workplaces be located in
urban areas and (2) moving NSMA closer to the Washington Navy
Yard, consistent with the policy that employees be located near
other agencies with which they interact.

Finally, the Anacostia Alternative would be consistent with
locating warehousing, utility, supply, and storage activities
within the District of Columbia in places that are easily
accessible from the regional highway system and without negative
traffic impacts to the local arterial and roadway system
facilities (traffic impacts are addressed in Section 4.3.2).

On-going Plans and Projects in the District of Columbia

The proposed action under the Anacostia Alternative would have
no adverse effect on the several ongoing plans, initiatives, and
projects outlined in Section 3.1.2.1. Relocating NSMA to a
consolidated facility at the preferred site would not create
conditions that could impede or prevent the completion or
success of these projects.

Naval District Washington and Bolling AFB-NSF Anacostia

The Anacostia Alternative is generally consistent with the
existing RSIP for NDW facilities, the 2004 Site Development
Plan, and the recent NSF Anacostia-Bolling AFB Joint Base Master
Plan - Phase 1 ­ Concept Report. One partial exception is the
following: in the Concept Report's proposed land use maps, the
area within which the preferred site is located is mapped for
Mission/Administrative use. Being partly light industrial and
requiring special security features, the proposed NSMA facility
may not be entirely consistent with the Mission/Administration
designation. The Secure Mission designation would be more
appropriate. However, as its title indicates, the Concept Report
presents only broad concepts that can and will be modified and
refined during the ongoing second phase of the joint-base master
planning process. While the construction of the proposed
consolidated NSMA facility on the preferred site may require


Environmental Consequences     4-4
                     Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


adjusting the future land use maps, it is not expected to
adversely affect the effort to develop a successful master plan
for the future joint base.

The Anacostia Alternative would have no                   effect    on    the
privatization of Bolling or Bellevue housing.

4.1.2.3   Design Reviews

Consultation with NCPC and CFA is ongoing, consistent with the
applicable review requirements for Federal projects in the
District of Columbia. Implementation of the proposed action
would not begin until all necessary approvals have been
obtained.


4.1.3     Bellevue Alternative
4.1.3.1   Land Use

Implementation of the Bellevue Alternative would result in a
change in land use at the alternate site. The site is currently
vacant,   part  of   a   larger  parcel,   also mostly  vacant.
Construction of the proposed consolidated facility would
introduce a new land use to the area, in the form of a half-
administrative, half-light industrial compound.

This new land use would not be entirely compatible with its
surroundings, as it would be adjacent to the Bellevue Housing
development, located immediately to the east and southeast. To
the north, across McGuire Avenue, several Air Force residential
neighborhoods   extend    as   well.   Thus,   implementing   this
alternative   would    result   in    the   construction   of   an
administrative/light    industrial   facility   with   substantial
security requirements in an area otherwise characterized mostly
by residential uses.

However, the area of Air Force housing closest to the alternate
site ­ Doolittle Park ­ is scheduled for demolition as part of
the housing's privatization. Also, no expansion of the Bellevue
neighborhood west of the unused railroad right-of-way (which
separates the undeveloped, triangular parcel containing the
alternate site from the existing units) is planned under the
ongoing privatization process. This would ensure that sufficient
undeveloped buffers exist around the proposed facility to
minimize any adverse impacts to the livability or desirability



                                     4-5            Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


of the existing military housing      neighborhoods.   Any   adverse
impacts would remain minor.

The alternate site is well outside any restricted area,
including the safety zones associated with the airfields present
on Bolling AFB and NSF Anacostia. There is no potential for
impacts on land uses outside the Installation because of the
strong visual and functional separation created by the Bellevue
Housing development and I-295 between the Installation and the
residential neighborhoods to the east.

4.1.3.2   Relevant Planning Documents, Initiatives, and Projects

Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital ­ Federal Elements ­
Federal Workplace

Like the Anacostia Alternative, and for the same reasons (see
Section 4.1.2.2), the Bellevue Alternative would generally be
consistent with the relevant policies of the Federal Workplace
Element of the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital,
with, however, the following differences:

   4. Support regional and local agency efforts to coordinate
      land   use  with   the   availability or  development  of
      transportation alternatives to the private automobile,
      including walking, bicycle riding, and public transit [...]
      when locating Federal workplaces.
      The alternate site is farther removed from available and
      planned alternative modes of transportation than is the
      preferred site.

   5. Locate Federal facilities within walking distance of
      existing or planned fixed guideway transit services [...]
      Priority should be given to locations within walking
      distance to Metrorail due to its extensive reach into the
      region's residential areas.
      The alternate site is not within walking distance from the
      Anacostia Metrorail Station; it is also far from the
      nearest existing shuttle stop. These issues are discussed
      in more detail in Section 4.3.3.1.

   8. Minimize development of open space by selecting disturbed
      land or brownfields for new Federal workplaces or by
      reusing existing buildings or sites.
      Unlike the preferred site, the alternate site is currently
      entirely open. However, the larger parcel within which it
      is located was once occupied by a residential development


Environmental Consequences      4-6
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


     that appears to have been demolished in the mid to late
     1990's (see Section 3.6.2). Thus, it is likely that some or
     all of the site has already been disturbed.

The Bellevue Alternative, like the Anacostia Alternative and for
the same reasons, would also support the policies pertaining to
the regional distribution of Federal workplaces (see Section
4.1.2.2). Finally, again like the Anacostia Alternative, the
Bellevue   Alternative   would   be  consistent  with   locating
warehousing, utility, supply, and storage activities within the
District of Columbia in places that are easily accessible from
the regional highway system and without negative traffic impacts
to the local arterial and roadway system facilities (traffic
impacts are addressed in Section 4.3.3).

On-going Plans and Projects in the District of Columbia

The proposed action under the Bellevue Alternative would have no
effect on the several ongoing plans, initiatives, and projects
outlined in Section 3.1.2.1. Relocating NSMA to a consolidated
facility at the alternate site would not create conditions that
could impede or prevent the completion or success of these
projects.

Naval District Washington and Bolling AFB-NSF Anacostia

The Bellevue Alternative is generally consistent with the
existing RSIP for NDW facilities. The 2004 Site Development Plan
included a concept for the development of the triangular parcel
within which the alternate site is located that is generally
consistent with the proposed action (the concept was for the
relocation of the Office of Naval Research from Arlington
County). The site is not included in the more recent NSF
Anacostia-Bolling AFB Joint Base Master Plan - Phase 1 ­ Concept
Report. However, it can be noted that the Concept Report's
proposed land use maps designate the area directly across from
the site (an area presently occupied by the Doolittle Park
residential development) as a Secure Mission use. Building the
proposed consolidated NSMA facility on the alternate site would
be compatible with this neighboring designation, should it be
maintained during Phase 2 of the joint base master planning
process.

Under the Bellevue Alternative, the proposed NSMA facility would
be built within a parcel that is included in the Bellevue
Housing privatization project. Therefore, implementation of this
alternative would require removing at least the alternate site


                                 4-7            Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


and its immediate surroundings from the privatization project's
land lease area and keeping them under direct government
control. The alternative would not otherwise affect the
privatization project since the parcel within which the
alternate site is located is mostly undeveloped and no new
construction or development is included in the privatization of
Bellevue. Any adverse impacts, therefore, would remain minor.

The   Bellevue  Alternative   would   not  affect  the   ongoing
redevelopment of the privatized Bolling AFB housing. The
neighborhood closest to the alternate site and with the most
potential to be affected by the proposed action under this
alternative ­ Doolittle Park ­ is scheduled for demolition.
Other housing areas are sufficiently far from the alternate site
not to be affected by the construction there of the proposed
NSMA facility (See also Section 4.1.3.1).

4.1.3.3   Design Reviews

The site plan and design of the proposed consolidated facility
would be the same under the Bellevue Alternative as under the
Anacostia Alternative. Consultation about the design with NCPC
and   CFA  is   ongoing,   consistent   with applicable  review
requirements for Federal projects in the District of Columbia.
Implementation of the proposed action would not begin until all
necessary approvals have been obtained.


4.2     Socioeconomics

4.2.1 No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, NSMA would remain at its
current locations in Arlington County, VA. There would be no
change to existing socioeconomic conditions and no impacts.


4.2.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)
4.2.2.1   Demographics and Economy

Under the Anacostia Alternative, the workplace of approximately
800 NSMA personnel currently at different locations in Arlington
County, VA, would be relocated to a new facility at NSF
Anacostia. This would be the only substantial increase in the
working population of the Installation for the foreseeable


Environmental Consequences      4-8
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


future. Other on-going relocation and consolidation             projects
would result in no significant net change.

In the short or medium term, because of the relatively short
distance between the current locations of NSMA in Arlington
County, VA and NSF Anacostia, it is not expected that the
relocation of the agency would result in a significant number of
NSMA employees moving their residences. In the long term, with
normal personnel turnover, proximity to NSF Anacostia would be a
factor to consider for new personnel seeking housing. This would
eventually result in a change in NSMA staff's overall
residential   patterns  relative  to   existing  or   no  action
conditions. However, such change would take place slowly and
progressively, with negligible impacts at both the local and
regional level.

Construction of the proposed combined NSMA facility would have a
positive impact on the local economy, as it would generate
design and construction jobs and revenues. However, in the
context of the Washington DC regional economy, this impact would
be small.

4.2.2.2 Environmental Justice and Protection of Children

As explained in Section 3.2.2, NSF Anacostia is located in a
part of Washington DC that qualifies as an Environmental Justice
community on both racial and economic grounds. Implementation of
the proposed action under the Anacostia Alternative, however, is
not expected to have disproportionate adverse impacts on this
community. As shown elsewhere in this chapter, the alternative
would not have any significant impacts that could adversely
affect the local community, including impacts on area land use,
local traffic, or air quality. More localized impacts, in
addition to not being significant, would be contained within NSF
Anacostia, a limited-access installation separated from nearby
residential neighborhoods by major transportation facilities.
These impacts would not be noticeable outside the site or the
Installation. Therefore, the Anacostia Alternative does not
raise concerns under EO 12898.

Nor does the alternative raise concerns under EO 13045. There
are no concentrations of children near the preferred site that
could be affected by the proposed action. During construction of
the proposed facility, the location of NSF Anacostia and
controlled access make it unlikely that neighborhood children or
youths could come sufficiently close to the site to put
themselves at risk of accident. Similarly, because of distance,


                                 4-9            Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


children or youths from the military housing areas located south
of NSF Anacostia (Bolling and Bellevue housing) are unlikely to
come near the project site. NSF Anacostia's CDC is located near
the northern tip of the installation, far from the preferred
site. For these reasons, no disproportionate adverse impacts to
children are expected.


4.2.3     Bellevue Alternative
4.2.3.1   Demographics and Economy

Under   the  Bellevue   Alternative,  as under  the  Anacostia
Alternative and for the same reasons (see Section 4.2.2.1), no
demographic impacts are expected. There would be a small
positive impact on the regional economy.

4.2.3.2 Environmental Justice and Protection of Children

As under the Anacostia Alternative and for the same reasons (see
Section 4.2.2.2), the Bellevue Alternative raises no concern
under EO 12898. Nor does it raise significant concerns under EO
13045. Although the alternate site is relatively close to the
Bellevue and Bolling residential areas, which are home to many
children   and  youths,   it  would   be  secured   both  during
construction and after the completion of the proposed facility,
so that children are unlikely to be able to enter it and put
themselves at risk. Measures to minimize construction-related
impacts, such as wetting or seeding to prevent fugitive dust,
would also minimize the potential impacts on children nearby. In
general, the distance between the site and the closest
residential areas would be sufficient to minimize any risks from
either the construction or the operation of the proposed
facility. For these reasons, no disproportionate adverse impacts
to children are expected.


4.3     Transportation
4.3.1     No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, NSMA would remain at its
current locations in Arlington County, VA and would not relocate
to either the preferred or the alternate site. There would be no
impacts to transportation systems.

To provide a baseline to evaluate the traffic impacts of the two
action alternatives, however, projected LOS for the six study
intersections were determined for the year 2011. Based on a
review of existing projects (see Section 3.1.2), no significant
changes to the area's roadway network or significant new traffic
generators will be on line by 2011 (in particular, no
significant net change in Bolling AFB and NSF Anacostia
personnel is expected). Therefore, no action 2011 conditions
were modeled assuming only a background two-percent-per-year
growth rate, which was added to the 2009 traffic volumes. The
results of the analysis are shown in Table 4-1. The full traffic
impact analysis is in Appendix C.

As can be seen by comparing Table 4-1 and Table 3-5, all but one
of the study intersections are projected to continue to operate
at overall LOS C or better. The exception is intersection #4
(South Capitol Street at Firth Sterling Avenue), which is
projected to operate at LOS D during the PM peak hour, as


                                                               4-11                                   Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


opposed to C under existing conditions. As previously noted, in
a major urban area such as Washington, DC, LOS D is considered
acceptable.


4.3.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)

Under the Anacostia Alternative, the proposed combined facility
would be built on the preferred site. NSMA's 800 personnel would
occupy the facility in 2011. As noted in Section 4.3.1, this is
the only significant change in the working population of Bolling
AFB and NSF Anacostia that is expected to occur between now and
2011. Similarly, no significant change in the study area's
roadway network and no significant new generators of traffic are
expected to come on line during that short period.

4.3.2.1   Transit Access

As noted in Section 3.3.1.1, the Anacostia Metrorail Station,
near the intersection of Firth Sterling Avenue and Howard Road,
SE, is located a little more than half a mile from NSF
Anacostia's   North  Gate.   The  preferred  site   is  located
approximately 1,700 feet from the gate. Thus, NSMA employees
using Metrorail would have to walk approximately 4,500 feet
between the Metro station and their workplace, a 17-minute walk
(assuming a 3-mile-per-hour walking speed). In addition to the
distance, the lack of adequate sidewalks and the reputation of
the surrounding neighborhood as a high-crime area are likely to
discourage Metrorail users.

The Navy has prepared a Transportation Management Plan (TMP)
that outlines measures to encourage transit usage among NSMA
employees. Such measures include, among others, improved shuttle
service between the Metro station and the installation as well
as working with DDOT to improve pedestrian infrastructure along
Firth Sterling Avenue. At this stage, the number of NSMA
employees   who  would  regularly   ride  Metrorail   cannot  be
estimated. However, it can be expected that any increase in
passenger loads at the Anacostia Station would be absorbed into
the increase planned for by the Washington Metropolitan Area
Transit Authority (WMATA), which is projected to be about 50
percent between 2005 and 2030 for Green Line stations in
Southeast Washington.

Barring significant changes in bus routes and schedules, few
NSMA employees are expected to ride Metrobus to and from work.
As can be seen in Table 3-3, the Metrobus lines that run near


Environmental Consequences    4-12
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


NSF Anacostia originate and end in Maryland. However, 70 percent
of NSMA's current employees reside in Virginia and only 29
percent reside in Maryland. Since it is unknown where in
Maryland these 29 percent are located, it is not possible to
estimate how many may live close enough to one of the existing
bus lines to find it an attractive option to ride the bus to and
from work, but this number can be expected to be small and
unlikely to create capacity problems for Metrobus.

4.3.2.2   Vehicular Access

In the short term, construction of the proposed consolidated
NSMA facility would generate some additional traffic, as
construction equipment, trucks, and construction workers travel
to and from the project site. However, these impacts would be
small and temporary and are not expected to be noticeable.

In the long term, relocating approximately 800 NSMA employees to
NSF Anacostia would generate additional traffic on nearby
roadways. The impacts of the resulting increase in traffic on
the study intersections were analyzed by adding the number of
vehicle trips that would be generated by the proposed relocation
to the projected no action 2011 traffic volumes. The complete
traffic impact analysis can be found in Appendix C.

Trip Generation

Estimating the number of vehicle trips generated by NSMA
required determining the likely modal split, that is the
percentage of employees using different modes of transportation.
Data available in the December 2004 Anacostia Annex Site
Development Plan (Section 3.6) were used to that effect (this
approach yields fairly conservative results since it does not
take into account the transportation management measures that
NSMA would implement to promote the use of alternative commuting
methods among its employees and encourage ridesharing; these
measures are outlined in the TMP prepared by the Navy for this
proposed action).

On this basis, the number of vehicle trips to the site on a
typical workday was calculated as shown in Table 4-2.

departure rates were determined by analyzing gate traffic counts
conducted on November 18, 2008. On this basis, 44 percent of the
trips (284 vehicles) would arrive during the AM peak hour (7:00-
8:00 AM) and 42 percent (271 vehicles) would depart during the
PM peak hour (4:15-5:15 PM). The distribution of these trips
among the Installation's three gates was calculated using the
same November 2008 counts. The number of visitors/deliveries
during the AM and PM peak hours was assumed to be 14 vehicles.

Traffic Distribution

The distribution of project-generated vehicular traffic on the
roadways providing access to and from the project site is a key
element in determining traffic impacts on the surrounding
intersections. The following residential location data were
provided by NSMA: 70 percent of existing NSMA employees reside
in Virginia, 29 percent in Maryland, and 1 percent in another
jurisdiction, assumed to be Washington DC for the purposes of
this analysis. Generally, distributing vehicle trips over the
road network requires finer-grained data (preferably employees'
residential zip codes), which were not made available for this
study.   Therefore,  the  analysis  must   rely  on   reasonable
assumptions with regard to the residential distribution of
NSMA's employees.

To this end, the residential distribution of DoD employees
relocating from Arlington County to Fort Belvoir, VA, as
presented in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for BRAC
Implementation and Related Army Actions (June 2007), was used as
a stand-in (with minor adjustments) for the residential
distribution of NSMA employees, also DoD employees currently
located in Arlington County.

                        Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


On this basis, it was estimated that 40 percent of the NSMA
employees would enter the study area from southbound South
Capitol Street, 32 percent would enter it from southbound I-295,
26 percent from northbound I-295, and 2 percent from westbound
Suitland Parkway. Sixty two percent of the traffic is expected
to use the North Gate; 26 percent the Main Gate; and 12 percent
the South Gate. Peak-hour trips calculations are summarized in

2011 LOS Analysis

The study intersections were analyzed to estimate 2011 LOS under
the Anacostia Alternative. Existing traffic signal timings were
used to allow for direct comparison with the other alternatives
(however, future signal timing modifications may improve delays,
if needed.) Table 4-4 summarizes the results of the analysis.

LOS under the Anacostia Alternative would be the same as under
no action conditions, though with slightly increased delays. All
study intersections would operate at overall LOS C or better,
with the exception of intersection #4 (South Capitol Street at
Firth Sterling Avenue), which would operate at LOS D during the
PM peak period, as it would under no action conditions. As
previously noted, LOS D is an acceptable LOS in a dense urban
area such as Washington, DC.

Thus, based on the LOS analysis, implementation of the proposed
action under the Anacostia Alternative is not expected to result
in significant adverse traffic impacts. Existing roadways and
intersections   would  continue   to   operate  under   capacity.
Intersection delays and v/c ratios would increase marginally.

4.3.2.3    Parking

As indicated in Section 3.3.3, there are                                                                    an estimated 832
general use parking spaces within 0.25 mile                                                                  of the preferred
site. Of these, a recent survey found that                                                                   from 463 to 501
remain available during the day, or an average                                                              of 482.

Of the existing parking spaces, 14 are located on the preferred
site and would be lost. However, 46 new spaces would be built as
part of the new NSMA facility. It is expected that a portion of
the new parking would be reserved for the agency's leadership,
handicapped employees, and visitors. Although no specific
information on how many spaces would remain open for general use
is available at this time, it can reasonably be assumed that
there would be enough such spaces to offset the loss of the 14
existing spaces and very few more, if any. Thus, the total
number of unrestricted parking spaces within 0.25 mile of the
facility would not change significantly.

                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


Because no significant net change in personnel numbers (other
than that resulting from the proposed relocation of NSMA) is
expected to occur at either NSF Anacostia or Bolling AFB by
2011, it can be assumed that all existing surplus parking within
the 0.25-mile radius will remain available for use by NSMA
employees. Therefore, the total number of parking spaces
available for use by NSMA employees after the relocation would
be approximately 482, or a space to employee ratio of 1:1.66 or
0.60. (The ratio may actually be lower because much of the
potentially available parking is located in two garages and the
upper floor of both garages is not usable by all vehicles
because of low ramp clearances; also, some of the potentially
available parking may in fact have become unavailable by the
time NSMA relocates to the site.)

As shown in Table 4-2, a total of approximately 645 new vehicles
can be expected to require parking at NSF Anacostia after the
proposed relocation. Therefore, the demand is projected to
exceed the supply by approximately 163 spaces.

NSMA would implement measures to reduce parking demand by its
employees in order to better match the supply and meet NCPC's
parking ratio requirements for Federal facilities in the
District of Columbia (outside the central employment area) ­ 1
space for every 4 employees. Such measures are delineated in the
TMP prepared by the Navy for this proposed action. They include
efforts to encourage transit usage, ridesharing, telecommuting,
and flexible working hours. While these measures can be expected
to help make good the projected deficit in parking spaces,
however, reaching the applicable NCPC parking ratio would
require     Installation-wide    measures     and   inter-agency
collaboration (e.g., for pedestrian improvements outside the
Installation). It is expected that these issues will be further
addressed in an Installation-wide TMP being prepared in
association with the ongoing joint-base master planning effort
briefly described in Section 3.1.2.2 of this EA.

Because of the location of NSF Anacostia, it is not expected
that any significant number of NSMA employees would seek parking
on public streets. Thus, the proposed action would have no
impact on public parking.

4.3.3     Bellevue Alternative
4.3.3.1   Transit Access

Because of the remote location of the alternate site, it is
likely that, without special measures, a very small number of
NSMA employees, if any, would commute to the new facility by
mass transit. At a minimum, measures to make transit use more
attractive would have to include extending the route of the
existing Air Force shuttle to serve the new facility. Other
measures, such as a dedicated shuttle reserved for NSMA
employees, on the model of what was done for DIAC, may also have
to be considered. In any case, the number of new transit trips
that would be generated by the proposed action under this
alternative is not expected to be any higher than under the
Anacostia Alternative; it would have no significant adverse
impact on existing transit infrastructure or service.

4.3.3.2   Vehicular Access

The short-term, construction-related traffic impacts of the
Bellevue Alternative would be the same as those of the Anacostia
Alternative and, for the same reasons, would not be significant.

To evaluate the potential long-term traffic effects of the
Bellevue Alternative, a similar mode split and trip generation
to those used for the Anacostia Alternative were assumed.
However, because of the location of the alternate site,
different traffic distribution assumptions were developed. It
was estimated that under this alternative, 86 percent of the
relocated NSMA employees would enter the study area from
northbound I-295, 9 percent would enter from southbound I-295,
and 5 percent would enter from South Capitol Street. Seventy-
five percent of this traffic would use the South Gate; 20
percent the Main Gate; and 5 percent the North Gate. Projected
peak hour traffic is shown in Table 4-5. Projected 2011 LOS are
presented in Table 4-6.

LOS under the Bellevue Alternative would be the same as under no
action conditions, though with slightly increased delays. All
study intersections would operate at overall LOS C or better,
with the exception of intersection #4 (South Capitol Street at
Firth Sterling Avenue), which would operate at LOS D during the
PM peak period, as it would under no action conditions. As
previously noted, LOS D is an acceptable LOS in a dense urban
area such as Washington, DC.

4.3.3.3    Parking

Under the Bellevue Alternative, because of the remote location
of the project site and the lack of existing surplus parking
within walking distance, the projected parking shortage would be
greater that under the Anacostia Alternative. Implementing
appropriate transportation management measures would reduce
parking demand. These measures could be supplemented by other
measures to make surplus parking far from the site usable, for
instance by providing shuttle service between the more remote
parking lots or garages and the new facility. Even with such
measures, it is not certain that NSMA could operate at the
alternate site without constructing new, nearby parking for its
employees. Should the Navy select the Bellevue Alternative for
implementation, therefore, additional studies would be required
to address the potential parking deficit. As under the Anacostia
Alternative, however, it is not expected that any significant
number of NSMA employees would seek parking on public streets.
Thus, there would be no impact on public parking.


4.4      Air Quality
4.4.1     No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, existing conditions         would
continue. This would have no impact on air quality.


4.4.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)

Two factors associated with the proposed relocation of NSMA have
the potential to result in air quality impacts: the resulting
additional traffic on local roads and the construction and
operation of the new facility.

4.4.2.1    Traffic-related Impacts

The primary automobile-related air pollutants are CO, PM (PM10
and PM2.5), and the precursors of O3, NOx and VOCs. Project-level
air quality impacts from traffic are generally evaluated on two
scales:

   ·   Microscale level for CO and PM: A microscale analysis (also
       referred to as a hot-spot analysis) of traffic-related
       impacts at intersections or free-flow sites provides


Environmental Consequences       4-20
                   Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


      estimates of localized concentrations for direct comparison
      to the NAAQS and/or other applicable impact thresholds.

  ·   Mesoscale level for NOx and VOCs: NOx and VOCs, precursors of
      O3, are usually of regional concern in nonattainment areas.
      Potential emission increases from additional vehicle miles
      traveled (VMT) may affect regional O3 levels. Since O3 is a
      problem of regional concern and subject to air transport
      phenomena under different weather conditions, O3-related
      impacts are generally evaluated on a regional basis by the
      appropriate regional Metropolitan Planning Organization
      (MPO; in the case of the District of Columbia, the
      Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments [MWCOG]),
      using regional O3 airshed models. This type of mesoscale
      analysis is generally not conducted on a project-by-project
      basis and is not necessary for this EA.

CO Impacts

Future CO concentrations were modeled based on the traffic
impact analysis summarized in Section 4.3.2.2. The study
intersection with the highest projected traffic volume was
selected   for  the   analysis.  This  intersection   is  study
intersection #4, South Capitol Street and Firth Sterling Avenue
(worst-case intersection).

The modeling was performed in two steps:

  ·   Vehicle exhaust emission factors were estimated using the
      USEPA Mobile6.2 emission factor model with input parameters
      that are applicable to the Washington, DC area as provided
      by the MWCOG Air Quality Division.

  ·   The estimated emission factors were subsequently used as
      input for the USEPA CAL3QHC dispersion model to calculate CO
      concentrations at the worst-case intersection with worst-
      case meteorological conditions.

A more detailed description         of    the   modeling   procedures    is
presented in Appendix B.

The results of the analysis are presented            in Table 4-7.      The
expected concentrations are well below both          the 1-hour and     the
8-hour CO NAAQS. Therefore, the Anacostia           Alternative is      not
expected to result in significant impacts           with respect to      CO
emissions.

          NAAQS CO one-hour standard is 35 ppm; the eight-hour standard is 9 ppm.


PM Impacts

Potential traffic-related PM (PM2.5 and PM10) impacts were
evaluated   consistent with  the  available  guidelines and
qualitative hot-spot analysis procedures established by the
USEPA (March 2006).

While the proposed action would involve an increase in traffic
volumes near the Installation, this increase would almost
exclusively consist of personal vehicles commuting to and from
the proposed new facility. While some new truck traffic would be
associated with the proposed action, it would be negligible
compared to commuting traffic. Thus, the proposed action is not
one of the projects listed in the USEPA's guidelines that
require further qualitative PM2.5 and PM10 hot-spot analysis.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed action would
not cause or contribute to a violation of the PM NAAQS; nor
would it increase the frequency of an existing exceedance of the
PM2.5 NAAQS. The Anacostia Alternative would not have significant
PM impacts.

4.4.2.2    Construction-related Impacts

Construction of the proposed consolidated NSMA facility would
cause short-term, minor air quality impacts. The principal air
quality concern associated with construction activities is the
emission of fugitive dust. Mobile emission sources, such as
construction vehicles and equipment as well as private passenger
vehicles used to access the work area, would also contribute to
construction-phase air pollution.

However,   construction-related   effects   are   by   definition
temporary and can be effectively minimized by using standard
best   management   practices   (BMPs).   For   instance,   water


Environmental Consequences                 4-22
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


applications and periodic sweeping can aid in preventing dust
from becoming airborne. Thus, short-term air quality impacts
from the proposed construction activities are not expected to be
significant.

4.4.2.3   Stationary Source Operational Impacts

The only long-term stationary source of new emissions would be
the heating boiler(s) for the proposed new facility. At this
stage, no sufficient information is available to allow for a
quantitative estimate of the emissions that would result from
the operation of the new facility. When the project reaches a
design stage that allows for such an estimate, the Navy will
update NSF Anacostia's Title V permit as required. Based on the
size and function of the facility, emissions are not expected to
cause a significant increase in NSF Anacostia's total air
emissions.

4.4.2.4   Clean Air Act Conformity

Because the proposed action would take place in a non-attainment
area for O3 and PM2.5, a General Conformity Rule (GCR) analysis
was conducted according to the guidance provided in the final
rule for Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to
State or Federal Implementation Plans (USEPA, November 30,
1993).    Under  the   GCR,   reasonably   foreseeable   emissions
associated with all operational and construction activities,
both direct and indirect, must be quantified and compared to the
annual de minimis levels applicable to the pollutants for which
the project area is in nonattainment or is a maintenance area.
For an O3 moderate nonattainment area in a transport region and
PM2.5 nonattainment area, such as Washington, DC, the de minimis
levels are: 100 tons per year (tpy) (91 metric tpy) for NOx, PM2.5
and SO2 (SO2 is a precursor of PM2.5); and 50 tpy (46 metric tpy)
for VOCs. Estimated annual NOx, VOC, PM2.5, and SO2 emissions from
the construction and operation of the proposed NSMA facility are
presented in Table 4-8. The methodologies used to develop these
estimates are detailed in Appendix B.

Under the GCR, if the expected total direct and indirect annual
emissions of a criteria pollutant (or its precursors) for which
the project area is in nonattainment or maintenance do not
exceed the applicable de minimis, the Federal action has minimal
air quality impact and is determined to conform for the
pollutant in question; no further analysis is necessary.
Conversely, if the emissions are projected to be above the de
minimis, a formal general conformity determination is required


                                  4-23           Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


for that pollutant. As shown in Table 4-8, the expected
increases   in  the   annual   emissions  of   relevant   criteria
pollutants would not exceed the applicable de minimis levels.
Therefore, a formal conformity determination is not required for
the   proposed   action    under   the   Anacostia    Alternative.
Additionally, the increase in annual emissions is not projected
to exceed 10 percent of the Washington DC regional emissions
inventory; therefore, the Anacostia Alternative would not result
in significant regional air quality impacts.

A Record of Non-Applicability is included in Appendix B.

4.4.3      Bellevue Alternative

Under this alternative, all emission sources and emissions
resulting from the proposed relocation of NSMA would be the same
as or similar to those under the Anacostia Alternative.
Therefore, impacts on air quality would be the same and would


Environmental Consequences                   4-24
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


not be significant for the reasons explained in Section 4.4.2.
As under the Anacostia Alternative, a formal general conformity
determination would not be required.


4.5     Noise
4.5.1     No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no changes to
existing noise levels at the Installation and no impacts.


4.5.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)

The increase in local traffic that would result from the
proposed relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia and the operation
of equipment and vehicles during the construction of the
proposed consolidated facility would result in noise impacts.
These impacts would not be significant. Operation of the
proposed new facility is not expected to significantly affect
ambient noise levels in the long term.

4.5.2.1   Traffic-related Impacts

Traffic on nearby South Capitol Street and I-295 is a dominant
source of noise on the Installation and in surrounding areas. In
areas where traffic is the dominant noise source, noise impacts
from traffic increases can be evaluated based on the size of the
increase using general acoustical principles. For example, if
the existing traffic volume on a street is 100 vehicles per hour
(vph) and the future volume is projected to be 150 vph, a 50
percent increase, ambient noise levels would increase by
approximately 2 dBA. If traffic were to double, from 100 vph to
200 vph, noise levels would increase by 3 dBA. According to
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) guidelines, a change in
noise of 3 dBA is considered a barely perceptible change.

Based on the traffic impact analysis summarized in Section
4.3.2, while the proposed relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia
would result in an increase in traffic on I-295 and South
Capitol Street, this increase would be far from what would be
required to add 3 dBA to existing noise levels. Therefore, the
traffic-related noise impacts of the proposed action would be
minimal and not significant.

Environmental Assessment


4.5.2.2   Construction-related Impacts

Noise would result from the construction of the proposed NSMA
facility, including noise from construction equipment, trucks,
and personnel vehicles commuting to and from the project site.
However, these noise impacts would not be significant because
(1) they would be temporary and vary substantially with the
construction phase: in general they would be highest in the
early stages of construction and decline thereafter (2) they
would be mostly limited to weekday working hours, when general
ambient noise is highest (3) they would be localized and
unlikely to be perceptible from outside the immediate vicinity
of the project site. No sensitive noise receptors are located
nearby: the closest such receptor is the NSF Anacostia CDC near
the northern tip of NSF Anacostia, well away from the site, and
(4) they would be typical of a mid-size construction project
similar to numerous projects under way every day in the District
of Columbia.


4.5.3     Bellevue Alternative

Noise impacts under the Bellevue Alternative would be the same
as under the Anacostia Alternative. For the same reasons as
explained in Section 4.5.2, they would not be significant.


4.6     Cultural Resources
4.6.1     No Action Alternative

Implementation of the No Action Alternative would not have any
effects on known or potential cultural resources.


4.6.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)

As explained in Section 3.6.1, the preferred site, where the
proposed NSMA facility would be built under this alternative,
has previously been disturbed and has little potential to
contain unknown archaeological resources. Additionally, the site
is not located within or adjacent to the Bolling Field Historic
District or any other known National Register-listed or eligible
architectural resource. The site is sufficiently remote from
Buildings 168 and 169 and from the Bolling Field Historic
District to make the potential for indirect, visual impacts


Environmental Consequences     4-26
                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


minimal. Therefore, implementation of the Anacostia Alternative
is not expected to have any adverse effects on cultural
resources. The DCHPO concurred with this finding of no effect by
letter dated September 30, 2009 (copy in Appendix D).

However, if during construction, archaeological artifacts or
skeletal remains were uncovered, work would stop immediately.
The Navy would consult with the DCHPO and other parties, as
appropriate, before resuming any activities that could disturb
the find.


4.6.3    Bellevue Alternative

Construction of the proposed NSMA facility under the Bellevue
Alternative would likely disturb Site 51SW7, a prehistoric
archaeological site that was found to be potentially eligible
for listing in the National Register during a survey conducted
in 1994 (see Section 3.6.2). Consistent with the 1994 report's
recommendations and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, should the Navy choose to
implement this alternative, it would conduct a Phase II
evaluation of Site 51SW7 to determine its National Register
eligibility prior to beginning any ground-disturbing activities.
Following completion of the Phase II survey and its review and
approval by the DCHPO, potential adverse effects to the site
from the proposed action would be evaluated and, if appropriate,
a memorandum of agreement (MOA) would be drawn to define
measures that would ensure that any adverse effects to the site
are mitigated and not significant. Implementation of the
proposed action would not begin until the MOA is signed by all
appropriate parties and the Section 106 consultation process is
complete.

The alternate site is not located within or adjacent to the
Bolling Field Historic District. It is sufficiently remote from
the district to make the potential for indirect, visual impacts
minimal.


4.7     Natural Resources
4.7.1    No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, NSMA would not relocate from
its current locations in Arlington County, VA to a new,


                                 4-27           Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


consolidated facility. There would be no new construction and no
impacts to natural resources.


4.7.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)
4.7.2.1   Geology, Topography, and Soils

Construction of the proposed NSMA consolidated facility would
not require the kind of deep excavation or blasting that could
affect the project site's geological substrate. Nor would the
proposed construction affect the topography of the site, which
is mostly level. No significant topographic features would be
either created or destroyed.

Construction of the proposed new facility would disturb the
project site's soils over an area of approximately three acres.
As indicated in Section 3.7.1.2, these soils are mapped as Urban
Land by NRCS, reflecting previous disturbance. Throughout, the
top layer consists of fill of indeterminate origin and various
depths. Thus, no natural or pristine surface soils would be
disturbed. The primary soil-related concern associated with
construction activities is increased erosion, as exposed soil
particles are carried off by wind or water. The flatness of the
project site would contribute to minimizing construction-related
erosion. Additionally, standard BMPs, such as silt barriers or
the seeding of exposed soils, would be used to further limit the
risk of erosion.

Land disturbing activities affecting more than 50 square feet in
the District of Columbia require the preparation of an erosion
and sediment control plan to be reviewed and approved by the DC
Department of the Environment, Watershed Protection Division.
Preparation and implementation of an approved erosion and
sediment control plan in compliance with this requirement would
ensure that erosion-related impacts are minimal and not
significant.

4.7.2.2   Water Resources

Implementation of the Anacostia Alternative would have no direct
impact on surface water resources, as no body of water is
present on, or adjacent to, the preferred site. The site does
not contain wetlands; nor is it located within the 100-year
floodplain. In the long term, construction of the proposed
facility would increase the amount of impervious surface on the
site, which is currently partly pervious. However, as explained


Environmental Consequences     4-28
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


in Section 2.1, the design of the facility would include
elements consistent with the Navy's policy to incorporate LID
features to construction projects with the goal of generating no
net increase in stormwater volume and in sediment and nutrient
loadings. These elements would be incorporated into the
stormwater management plan required by the District of Columbia
for projects disturbing more than 5,000 square feet. As a result
of these measures, it is expected that impacts on both the
quantity and the quality of the stormwater runoff generated by
the project site would be minimal and not significant.
Consequently, no significant adverse impacts to water quality in
the Anacostia River or the Potomac River ­ into which stormwater
from the Installation discharges ­ are expected.

In the short term, construction-related erosion could result in
a temporary deterioration of stormwater runoff. However, the
measures taken to minimize erosion (see Section 4.7.2.1) would
also minimize any impacts on runoff and surface water. Any
remaining impacts would cease with construction and would not be
significant.

4.7.2.3   Biological Resources

Impacts   to   biological   resources   would   be   negligible.
Implementation of the Anacostia Alternative likely would result
in the loss of the few trees currently present in the unimproved
portions of the site. However, reasonable efforts would be made
to preserve the more mature trees and reuse them as part of the
facility's landscaping, if possible. Any loss would be partly or
fully made up by new plantings consisting of native plants,
shrubs, and trees.

To the extent that the existing trees and open, grassed areas at
the preferred site provide habitat for animal species, this
habitat would be lost. However, as noted in Section 3.7.3.2, any
existing habitat on the site is of marginal value at best and
likely to accommodate only the most common and adaptable urban
species. The loss would be in part offset by the facility's
landscaping, which would provide some new habitat of similar
quality to the existing one and usable by the same species.

As explained in Section 3.7.3.4, no threatened or endangered
species are known to occur on the Installation and the impacted
character of the preferred site makes it unlikely that it could
harbor any rare or fragile species. As noted in Section 4.7.2.2,
the alternative would not have any significant adverse effect on
water quality in the Potomac River or the Anacostia River; nor,


                                  4-29           Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


therefore, could it affect the shortnose sturgeon, a listed
species   that   may   be   present  in   these   rivers.   Thus,
implementation of the Anacostia Alternative is not expected to
result in any adverse effect to species protected under the ESA.

The Anacostia Alternative is not likely to result in any
noticeable adverse impacts to migratory birds protected under
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. The primary feature of
the Installation that can attract species of migratory bird ­
the shoreline of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers ­ would not be
affected at all.


4.7.3     Bellevue Alternative
4.7.3.1   Geology, Topography, and Soils

The impacts of the proposed action under the Bellevue
Alternative would be similar to those of the Anacostia
Alternative (see Section 4.7.2.1) and would not be significant.
The geological substrate of the area would not be affected. The
alternate site is generally level and no significant topographic
features would be either removed or created. About three acres
of Galestown-Urban Land Complex soil would be disturbed.
Standard BMPs would be used to minimize the risk of increased
erosion. As under the Anacostia Alternative, an erosion and
sediment control plan would be required, to be reviewed and
approved by the DC Department of the Environment, Watershed
Protection Division. Implementation of the plan would ensure any
impacts are minimal.

4.7.3.2   Water Resources

Implementation of the Bellevue Alternative would have no direct
impact on surface water resources, as no body of water is
present on, or adjacent to, the alternate site. The site does
not contain wetlands, nor is it located within the 100-year
floodplain. In the long term, construction of the proposed
facility would increase the amount of impervious surface on the
site, which is currently entirely pervious. However, as
explained in Section 4.7.2.2, the incorporation of LID features
in the facility's design would ensure impacts pertaining to
stormwater runoff are minimal. A stormwater management plan
would be prepared, as required by the District of Columbia for
projects disturbing more than 5,000 square feet. Because impacts
on the quantity and quality of runoff would be minimal, no
significant adverse impacts to water quality in the Potomac


Environmental Consequences     4-30
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


River ­ into which stormwater from the alternate site discharges
­ are expected.

In the short term, as under the Anacostia Alternative,
construction-related erosion could result in a temporary
deterioration of stormwater runoff. However, the measures taken
to minimize erosion would also minimize any impacts on runoff.
Remaining impacts, which would cease with construction, would
not be significant.

4.7.3.3   Biological Resources

The impacts of the Bellevue Alternative on biological resources
would be negligible. Construction of the proposed new NSMA
facility on the alternate site would result in the loss of the
vegetation existing on the site. This vegetation consists of
grass and a few trees. If possible, existing trees of sufficient
maturity would be preserved and incorporated in the facility's
landscaping. Any loss would be partially made up by new
plantings consisting of native plants, shrubs, or trees.

As is the case for the preferred site, any wildlife habitat at
the alternate site is marginal in quality and likely to be used
only by the most common and adaptable urban species. The loss of
this habitat would be a negligible impact. No species protected
under the ESA are known to occur on the Installation and no
effects   to  protected   species  are   expected.  Because  the
alternative would have no effect on water quality in the Potomac
River, it has no potential to affect the shortnose sturgeon, a
listed species that may occur in the Potomac. For the same
reasons as the Anacostia Alternative, the Bellevue Alternative
is not expected to affect migratory birds.


4.8     Hazardous Materials and Waste
4.8.1     No Action Alternative

Implementation of the No Action Alternative would have no effect
pertaining to hazardous materials or waste.


4.8.2     Anacostia Alternative (Preferred)

NSMA operations at its proposed new consolidated facility would
likely require the storage and use of hazardous materials and


                                  4-31           Environmental Consequences
Environmental Assessment


result in the generation, storage, and disposal of hazardous
waste. In addition to standard products used for building
maintenance and routine operations (e.g., paints, solvents),
simunition would occasionally and temporarily be stored in the
proposed warehouse. Simunition is non-lethal practice small arm
ammunition,   similar  to   paintballs  but  usable   with  most
conventional weapons. It allows for more realistic and effective
training. The type of simunition that would be stored at the
site consists of paint and wax rounds classified as 1.4S.
Division 1.4 explosives are explosives that present a minor
explosion hazard; any explosive effects are largely confined to
the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size
or range is to be expected; an external fire would not cause
instantaneous explosion of the package. Compatibility group S
refers to substances or articles so packed or designed that any
hazardous effects arising from accidental functioning are
limited to the extent that they do not hinder or prohibit fire
fighting or other emergency response efforts in the immediate
vicinity of the package. No more than 10 pounds of simunition
would be present at the site at any one time. Temporary storage
and transport of small quantities of this low-risk material is
not expected to result in any significant impacts on or off the
site. Simunition and all hazardous materials and waste would be
handled in accordance with applicable Navy guidelines and
requirements, and local and Federal laws and regulations. Proper
storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and waste
would ensure that the proposed relocation results in no adverse
impacts to the environment.

The preferred site does not contain nor is it adjacent to any ER
sites. Thus, the Anacostia Alternative has no potential to
affect any ongoing cleanup effort. However, as explained in
Section 3.8.2, recent subsurface investigations have found that
petroleum-impacted soils may be present on the site. Prior to
the beginning of any soil disturbing activities, the Navy would
review this finding and conduct additional investigations, as
needed. If the presence of contaminated soils is confirmed,
appropriate measures would be taken to remove and dispose of
these soils in accordance with applicable regulations. By
providing the opportunity to clean up contaminated soils if any
are present, the proposed action has the potential to result in
a positive impact.

                 Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


4.8.3    Bellevue Alternative

Impacts would be the same as those described in Section 4.8.2
for the Anacostia Alternative, expect with respect to soil
contamination. No subsurface investigations have been conducted
at the alternate site, and no information pertaining to
potential soil contamination is available. However, should the
Navy select this site for constructing the proposed NSMA
facility, due diligence would be made to ascertain the presence
of any contaminants in the soil above applicable regulatory
thresholds. Any contaminated soils would be removed and disposed
of in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.


4.9     Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts are "the incremental impacts of the action
when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-
Federal) or person undertakes such other actions"(40 CFR
1508.7).

As explained elsewhere in this chapter, the proposed action
under either action alternative would have no or negligible
adverse   impacts  on   the   following   resources: land  use,
socioeconomics, cultural resources, topography and soils, water
resources, biological resources, and hazardous materials and
waste. Therefore, the proposed action would not generate any
significant cumulative impacts in these areas.

The proposed action would generate small adverse impacts to
vehicular traffic in the area near the Installation by 2011,
along with associated noise and air quality impacts. Other
projects currently being planned in the area are expected to
affect transportation, air quality, and noise conditions as
well, though in a much more substantial way. These projects
include the South Capitol Street corridor improvements, the
redevelopment of Poplar Point, the redevelopment of St.
Elizabeth's West Campus, the replacement of the 11th Street
bridges, and the redevelopment of Barry Farm.

All these projects together will generate cumulative traffic
impacts along with associated noise and air quality impacts. For
this reason, transportation planning is an on-going concern in
the affected part of the District of Columbia. Multiple roadway
and transit improvements are being planned that will address the
expected increase in local traffic and employment. For those

projects with Federal involvement, NEPA documentation has been
or will be prepared to evaluate potential impacts and define
appropriate   mitigation   measures,   including    policies  that
encourage transit usage and ridesharing, and reduce noise and
air emission levels. In particular, environmental impacts
statements (EIS) have been completed for the South Capitol
Street   improvements,   the   consolidation    of   DHS   to  St.
                                             th
Elizabeth's, and the replacement of the 11      Street bridges; an
EIS is under way for the redevelopment of Poplar Point.

Continuation   of  these   planning  efforts   and   the  Navy's
participation in them for its undertakings at the Bolling-
Anacostia Installation (for instance, NEPA documentation will be
prepared as part of the ongoing joint base master plan effort)
will ensure that cumulative impacts are properly minimized and
mitigated.


4.10     Conclusion
Based on the above analyses, the proposed relocation of NSMA
under either the Anacostia Alternative (preferred) or the
Bellevue Alternative would not result in significant adverse
impacts on the human environment. Preparation of an EIS is not
required.

B.1     Introduction
This appendix details the following analyses conducted to assess
the air quality impacts of the proposed action evaluated in the
EA:

  ·   Mobile source CO impact modeling.
  ·   Mobile source PM impact evaluation.
  ·   General Conformity Applicability Analysis.


B.2     Mobile Source CO Impact Modeling Analysis
This section describes the methods used for the microscale (hot
spot) ambient CO dispersion modeling analysis. The analysis
includes estimates of emission factors and prediction of CO
concentrations at the worst-case intersection. The results of
the analysis are in the form of ambient concentration levels for
averaging periods corresponding to the CO NAAQS. The CO impact
analysis was conducted based on the results of the traffic
analysis for the Anacostia Alternative (preferred Alternative)
described in the EA.


B.2.1    Modeled Intersection Location

CO impacts were estimated for a weekday AM and PM peak hour at
the following intersection:

  ·   South Capitol Street      and      Firth   Sterling   Avenue   (study
      intersection #4).

This intersection was selected         for CO modeling based on its
potential for being subject to        the maximum increase in traffic
and traffic congestion, with          the highest projected traffic
volumes. The resulting estimates      are, therefore, conservative.

Based on USEPA guidance, reasonable receptor locations include
sidewalks, residences, schools, hospitals, parking or vacant
lots, and other places continuously accessible to the public.
Since sidewalks are generally critical for CO impact analysis, a
total of 27 receptors were posited along the roadways of the
modeled intersection three meters from the roadway edge. CO
concentrations were modeled at these receptors.

B.2.2     Mathematical Models

The projected CO concentrations were determined in two steps:
(1) vehicle exhaust emission factors were estimated using the
Mobile 6.2 emission factor model with Washington DC-specific
input parameters provided by the Metropolitan Washington Council
of Governments (MWCOG) Air Quality Division and (2) these
emission factors were subsequently used as input for the
microscale   dispersion    model   CAL3QHC   to    calculate    CO
concentrations   at   representative   intersections.   A    brief
description of the two computer models follows:

   ·   MOBILE6.2 calculates emission factors for 28 individual
       vehicle types in low and high-altitude regions of the United
       States. MOBILE6 emission factor estimates depend on various
       conditions, such as ambient temperatures, travel speeds,
       operating modes, fuel volatility, and mileage accrual rates.

   ·   CAL3QHC (Version 2) predicts CO concentrations from motor
       vehicles traveling near roadway intersections. The model
       incorporates inputs such as roadway geometries, receptor
       locations, meteorological conditions including wind speed,
       stability, etc., and vehicular emission factors predicted by
       MOBILE 6.

Total ambient CO concentrations near an intersection consist of
two components ­ local source contributions (i.e., vehicular
emissions near the intersection) and background contributions
from other mobile, stationary, and natural sources in the
project vicinity. Background CO levels were obtained from the
most recent available ambient air measurements collected at the
monitoring site closest to the project area; specifically, the
air quality monitoring station located at 34th Street and Dix
Street in Washington DC. These levels are 3.0 ppm for a one-hour
and 2.6 ppm for an eight-hour averaging period. A USEPA default
persistence factor of 0.70 was used to convert the one-hour CO
concentrations    calculated    by    CAL3QHC   to    eight-hour
concentrations. The persistence factor represents a combination
of the hourly variability of traffic and meteorological
conditions.

Worst-case   meteorological  conditions that   result  in  the
potentially highest one-hour CO concentration levels were used
in the CAL3QHC dispersion modeling.

B.2.3         Analysis Results

The predicted worst-case CO concentrations for the selected
intersection are shown in Table B-1. The predicted levels are
well below the one-hour and eight-hour CO NAAQS.

              NAAQS CO one-hour standard is 35 ppm; the eight-hour standard is 9 ppm.




B.3       Mobile Source PM Impact Evaluation
Since the project is in a nonattainment area for the PM2.5 NAAQS,
potential traffic-related PM (PM2.5 and PM10) impacts were
evaluated based on the available guidelines and procedures
outlined by the USEPA in:

  ·   Transportation Conformity Guidance for Qualitative Hot-spot
      Analyses in PM2.5 and PM10 Nonattainment and Maintenance Areas
      (USEPA, March 2006).

Future traffic conditions were evaluated based on the traffic
forecasts used for the CO impact analysis. Based on this
evaluation, a determination was made as to whether the proposed
action is a project with a PM concern that requires a hot-spot
analysis. The guideline identifies five categories of project
actions with potential air quality concerns that require a
qualitative PM2.5 and PM10 hot-spot analysis. These are identified
at 40 CFR 93.123[b][1](i) through (v) as follows:

  (i)    New   or expanded  highway projects  that  have  a
    significant number of or significant increase in diesel
    vehicles.

  (ii)    Projects affecting intersections that are at Level-of-
     Service (LOS) D, E, or F with a significant number of
     diesel vehicles, or those that will change to LOS D, E, or
     F because of increased traffic volumes from a significant


                                              B-3                                 Appendix B

       number of diesel vehicles related to the project.

   (iii) New bus and rail terminals and transfer points that
      have a significant number of diesel vehicles congregating
      at a single location.

   (iv)   Expanded bus and rail terminals and transfer points
     that significantly increase the number of diesel vehicles
     congregating at a single location.

   (v)     Projects   in  or   affecting  locations,   areas,   or
      categories of sites that are identified in the PM2.5 and PM10
      applicable implementation plan or implementation plan
      submission, as appropriate, as sites of violation or
      possible violation.

Although the proposed action would involve a potential increase
in traffic volumes, the additional trips would be mostly from
passenger vehicles commuting to and from the project site rather
than diesel trucks. Therefore, the proposed action does not fall
into any of above project categories that could have potential
PM air quality impacts and require further hot spot analysis.


B.4      General Conformity Applicability Analysis
The 1990 amendments to the CAA require Federal agencies to
ensure that their actions conform to the appropriate State
Implementation Plan (SIP) in a nonattainment area. A SIP is a
plan that provides for the implementation, maintenance, and
enforcement of the NAAQS. A SIP includes emission limitations
and control measures to attain and maintain the NAAQS.
Conformity to a SIP, as defined in the CAA, means conformity to
a SIP's purpose of reducing the severity and number of
violations of the NAAQS to achieve attainment of the standards.
The Federal agency responsible for an action is required to
determine if its action conforms to the applicable SIP.

The USEPA has developed two sets of conformity regulations.
Federal actions are differentiated into transportation projects
and non-transportation-related projects:

   ·   Transportation projects are governed by the "transportation
       conformity" regulations (40 CFR Parts 51 and 93), effective
       on December 27, 1993 and revised on August 15, 1997.




Appendix B                       B-4
                  Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


  ·   Non-transportation projects are governed by the "general
      conformity" regulations (40 CFR Parts 6, 51 and 93)
      described in the final rule for Determining Conformity of
      General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation
      Plans published in the Federal Register on November 30,
      1993, effective January 31, 1994, and not updated since.

Since the proposed action is a non-transportation project, only
the general conformity rule (GCR) applies.


B.4.1 Attainment and Nonattainment

The general conformity rule applies to Federal actions occurring
in a nonattainment or maintenance area for the NAAQS. Federal
actions occurring in areas that are in attainment with the NAAQS
are not subject to the conformity rule.

Under the requirements of the 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA), as
amended in 1977 and 1990, the USEPA established NAAQS for six
criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), inhalable particulate matter
(PM10 and PM2.5), and lead (Pb).

Areas that meet the NAAQS for a criteria pollutant are in
"attainment;" areas where the criteria pollutant level exceeds
the NAAQS are in "nonattainment." O3 nonattainment areas are
subcategorized based on the severity of their pollution problem
(marginal, moderate, serious, severe, or extreme). Particulate
Matter (PM) and CO nonattainment areas are classified into two
categories (moderate or serious). When insufficient data exist
to determine an area's attainment status, it is designated
unclassifiable (or attainment).

The proposed action would occur at Naval Support Facility (NSF)
Anacostia in Washington, DC, an area currently in nonattainment
for PM2.5, moderate nonattainment for 8-hour O3, and attainment
for the other criteria pollutants. O3 is principally formed from
precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) through chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Similarly,
SO2 is considered a precursor of PM2.5.


B.4.2    De Minimis Emissions Levels

Under the GCR, threshold (de minimis) rates of emissions were
established for those Federal actions with the potential to have


                                  B-5                            Appendix B

thresholds.

B.4.3    Regional Significance

A Federal action that results in emissions that do not exceed
the de minimis for a criteria pollutant may still be subject to
a general conformity determination if the direct and indirect
emissions from the action exceed 10 percent of the total
emission inventory for a particular criteria pollutant in a
nonattainment or maintenance area. If the emissions exceed this
ten percent threshold, the Federal action is considered to be a
"regionally significant" activity.


B.4.4    Analysis

Pursuant to the GCR, all reasonably foreseeable emissions (both
direct and indirect) associated with the proposed action were
quantified and compared to the annual de minimis levels to
determine potential emissions impacts.


Appendix B                                     B-6
                    Relocation of NSMA to NSF Anacostia, District of Columbia


Direct emissions are emissions of a criteria pollutant or its
precursors that are caused or initiated by a Federal action and
occur at the same time and place as the action. Indirect
emissions, occurring later in time and/or further removed in
distance from the action itself, must be included in the
determination if both of the following apply:

  ·   The Federal agency can practicably control the emissions and
      has continuing program responsibility to maintain control.

  ·   The emissions caused by the Federal action are reasonably
      foreseeable.

Increased direct and indirect emissions from the demolition and
construction associated with the proposed action would result
from the following potential activities:

  ·   Use of diesel and gas-powered construction equipment.

  ·   Movement of    trucks    containing    construction     and    removal
      materials.

  ·   Commuting of construction workers.

The change in operational emissions would result from the change
in workplace location due to the proposed action, which would
cause an increase in the total vehicle miles traveled (VMT).
(Another operational source ­ the boilers of the new facility ­
would contribute some emissions; however, at this stage,
sufficient information is not available to quantify these
emissions. Based on previous experience, and how much below the
de minimis the estimated emissions are, boiler-related emissions
are not expected to make any significant difference).

In estimating construction-related emissions, equipment usage
and   the  duration   of  construction activities  first   were
determined based on the size of the facility to be constructed.
The increased emissions were then calculated using USEPA
guidance and emission factors.

The Navy is proposing to construct a 32,000 square feet (SF)
administrative building and a 23,000 SF warehouse. Integrated
into the construction are exterior lighting, paved parking and
driving areas, roadways and sidewalks, stormwater management
facilities, and landscaping. The preferred alternative involves
siting the facility on approximately three acres northwest of
the intersection of Brookley Avenue and Thomas Road at NSF


                                    B-7                             Appendix B
Environmental Assessment


Anacostia. The alternative option is to site the facility on a
three-acre parcel at Bellevue Housing.


B.4.5     Construction Emissions

B.4.5.1      Activity Data

In estimating construction-related emissions, assumptions about
the usage of equipment, the likely duration of each activity,
and manpower estimates for the construction were based on the
information contained in the EA and supporting documentation.
The weekly duration of each activity was assumed to be eight
hours per day and five days per week. Estimates as to
construction crew and equipment requirements and productivity
are based on data presented in:

    ·   2003 RS Means Facilities Construction Cost Data, R.S. Means
        Co., Inc., 2002

The proposed action includes two basic types of activities:

    ·   Relocation or demolition of:

          o Several semi-permanent buildings.
          o Parking or other paved areas.
          o Rough grading of the entire three-acre site in
            preparation for construction.

    ·   Construction of:

          o Administration building.
          o Warehouse building.
          o Open space including lighting, roadway improvements,
            paved parking and driving areas, sidewalks, storm
            water management, and landscaping.

All equipment to be used is assumed to be diesel-powered unless
otherwise noted. Each piece of equipment is assumed to be
operated continuously for six hours during each working day.
Pieces of equipment to be used for the construction and
demolition activities include, but are not limited to:

    ·   Compressors.
    ·   Cranes.
    ·   Dozers.
    ·   Drill rig and auger.


Appendix B                       B-8

   ·   Gas engine vibrators.
   ·   Gas welding machines.
   ·   Graders.
   ·   Loaders.
   ·   Pavement breakers.
   ·   Pavers.
   ·   Pumps.
   ·   Rollers.


B.4.5.2     Equipment Emission Estimates

Estimates of operational emissions from construction equipment
were calculated based on the estimated hours of equipment use
and the emission factors for each type of equipment. Emission
factors for VOC, NOx, and CO were taken from USEPA's NONROAD
emission factor model using the national default model inputs
for nonroad engines, equipment, and vehicles of interest
provided with the model (USEPA December 2008). The average
equipment horsepower (hp) values and equipment power load
factors were also provided by the NONROAD model. Emission
factors related to construction-associated delivery trucks were
estimated using the USEPA's Mobile6 emission factor model
because the model provides a specific emission factor database
for various truck classifications.

Emission factors (in grams of pollutant per hour per horsepower)
were multiplied by the estimated running time and equipment
average horsepower to calculate the total grams of pollutant
from each piece of equipment. Finally, the total grams of
pollutant were converted to tons of pollutant.

The USEPA recommends the following formula to calculate hourly
emissions   from  nonroad  engine  sources  including  cranes,
backhoes, etc.:

       Mi   = N x HP x LF x EFi
       Where:
            Mi =      mass of emissions of ith pollutants during
                      inventory period;
            N =       source population (units);
            HP =      average rated horsepower;
            LF =      typical load factor; and
            EFi =     average emissions of ith pollutant per unit
                      of use (e.g., grams per horsepower-hour).




                                   B-9                            Appendix B
Environmental Assessment


Typical load factor values were obtained from Median Life,
Annual Activity, and Load Factor Values for Nonroad Engine
Emissions Modeling (USEPA, December 2008).

Estimated emissions from the operation of on-site construction
equipment is presented in Table B-3. A sample calculation for a
front end loader engine NOx emissions during construction is
provided below:

             Operational Hours   =    79 hours (1 loader x 13 days
                                 x 6 hr/day)

       Operational Emissions     =    79 hours x 93 hp x 21% x 5.14
                                 grams/hp-hr

                                 = 0.01 tons (Table B-3)


B.4.5.3      Vehicle Emission Estimates

Truck and worker's vehicle operations would result in indirect
emissions. However, the only activities that can be reasonably
quantified   are  vehicle    operations  within  NSF   Anacostia.
Construction-related   motor    vehicle operations   within   the
installation are assumed to be as follows:

   ·   Pickup, dump and other construction-related trucks would
       travel at an average speed of 25 miles per hour (mph), for a
       total estimated on-base running time of two hours per
       working day.
   ·   Each worker's vehicle would take a 20-minute round trip
       within NSF Anacostia at an average speed of 25 mph.

Emission factors for motor vehicles were calculated for both
trucks (including dump, delivery and tractor trucks that were
modeled as heavy-duty diesel vehicles) and commuter vehicles
(modeled as light-duty gasoline vehicles) using the Mobile 6.2
mobile source emission factor model with Washington DC area-
specific modeling input parameters provided by WMCOG. The
modeled emission factors were then multiplied by the estimated
vehicle operational hours to determine motor vehicle emissions.
Tables B-4 and B-5 show the worksheets for estimating vehicular
emissions associated with 2010 construction activities.

B.4.5.4     Asphalt Curing Emission Estimates

Asphalt curing-related VOC emissions were estimated based on the
amount of paving anticipated for parking lots and roadways. The
following assumptions were used:

  ·   Pavement would consist of hot mix asphalt concrete.

  ·   Emulsified asphalt would be used for Tack Coats, with an
      application rate of 0.15 gal/yd2 (VDOT, 2002) and an
      emission factor of 0.219 lbs/ton (Metropolitan Washington
      Air Quality Committee, May 21, 2004).

  ·   Cutback asphalt would be used for Prime Coats, with an
      application rate of 0.25 gal/yd2 (VDOT, 2002) and an
      emission factor of 2.095 lbs/ton (Metropolitan Washington
      Air Quality Committee, May 21, 2004).

The calculation   of    asphalt   concrete   paving   VOC   emissions    is
provided below:

      Estimated pavement area = 8,280 yd2
      Asphalt density = 8.34 lb/gal

Total VOC              = (8,280 yd2) x [(0.15 gal/yd2 x 0.219
                       lbs/ton) + (0.25 gal/yd2 x 2.095 lbs/ton)] x
                       (8.34 lbs/gal) / (4,000,000 lbs2/ton2)
                       = 0.015 tons

B. 4.6 Operational Vehicular Emissions

The change in vehicular operational emissions due to the
proposed relocation was predicted based on the change in VMT
forecasted by estimating the average road distance from employee
residences   to  their   workplace   for   existing  and   future
conditions. The same methods used for construction worker
commuting vehicle emission estimates were then used for
predicting employee operation vehicle emissions (Table B-7).


B.4.7 Compliance Analysis

Based on the results of the analysis of NOx, VOC, PM2.5, and SO2
emissions   performed  consistent   with  the   Final  Rule   for
Determining Conformity of Federal Actions to State or Federal
Implementation Plans, the proposed action would not require a
formal conformity determination. The results of this analysis
are presented in Table B-8. These results show no exceedance of
the de minimis criteria of 100 tpy for NOx, PM2.5, and SO2 and 50
tpy of VOC on an annual basis. Furthermore, the project would
not be regionally significant because it would result in
emissions that do not make up ten percent or more of the
regional emission inventory for NOx, VOC, PM2.5, and SO2.
Therefore, the proposed action would have minimal air quality
impacts and would not require a formal conformity determination.

 1. Emissions from the proposed facility's boiler(s) are not included due to lack of
 information needed for a quantitative estimate; however, based on the size of the building and
 the existing total emissions at the installation, , they are not likely to result in an
 exceedance of the de minimis.

1.0   PROJECT OVERVIEW

This traffic impact study was prepared to support the Environmental
Assessment (EA) for the Relocation of the Navy Systems Management
Activity (NSMA) to Naval Support Facility (NSF) Anacostia, Washington,
DC. Figure 1 shows the location of NSF Anacostia.

The study's purpose is to evaluate the impacts on local traffic that
would result from the proposed relocation of 800 NSMA employees from
their current, multiple workplaces in Arlington County, Virginia, to
one consolidated facility on NSF Anacostia, at a site northwest of the
intersection of Brookley Avenue and Thomas Road (Preferred Site, see
Figure 2). The proposed relocation is in compliance with the 2005 Base
Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act of 2005, which mandates the closure
of several leased Navy installations in the National Capital Region
and the relocation of the organizations occupying these installations
to Department of Defense (DoD)-owned space in the National Capital
Region.

The study also considers the impacts of relocating the 800 NSMA
employees to a similar facility built at an alternative location
(shown on Figure 2). This alternative site is part of the Bellevue
Housing development south of NSF Anacostia and Bolling Air Force Base
(AFB).

The relocation of NSMA to its new facility is scheduled to be
completed by September 2011. Therefore, 2011 is the target year for
this study.

2.0   PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT

2.1. Project Location

NSF Anacostia is located in the southwestern quadrant of the District
of Columbia, along the eastern shore of the Anacostia River, near the
river's confluence with the Potomac. The installation is across the
Potomac from Arlington County, where existing NSMA facilities are
located (See Figure 2).

In compliance with the 2005 BRAC Act, NSF Anacostia is in the process
of becoming a joint base with Bolling AFB, home to the US Air Force's
11th Wing, located immediately to the south of NSF Anacostia. The
Anacostia-Bolling joint base will be managed by the Navy. NSF
Anacostia and Bolling AFB, although historically administratively
distinct, are physically continuous and share a perimeter fence and
entry gates (North, Main [or Arnold], and South gates, shown on Figure
2). Together, they occupy 958 acres (351 acres for NSF Anacostia and
607 acres for Bolling AFB) bounded by the Anacostia River and the
Potomac River to the west, South Capitol Street and Interstate Highway
295 (I-295) to the east, Poplar Point and the Frederick Douglass

Memorial Bridge to the north, and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)
and Bellevue Housing to the south. Part of Bellevue (including the
alternative site) is included within the Bolling-Anacostia boundary.

2.2   Site Plan

A layout of the proposed combined facility at the preferred site is
shown in Figures 3 and 4. The facility will include 46 parking spaces.
Nearby existing parking lots and garages (all located on the
installation) will provide additional parking for employees.

2.3   Existing Land Use

Area Land Use

The Bolling-Anacostia installation occupies part of a long and
relatively narrow strip of land extending between the Potomac and
Anacostia rivers to the north and west, and South Capitol Street,
Overlook Avenue, and I-295 to the east and south. In addition to the
installation, this stretch of waterside land contains other large
institutional compounds such as NRL and, farther south, the District
of Columbia's Blue Plains wastewater treatment plant. Large tracts of
military family housing (Air Force Housing on Bolling AFB and the
Navy's Bellevue Housing) are also present.

The area east of I-295 is predominantly in residential use (Barry Farm
and Congress Heights neighborhoods), though a large institutional
compound ­ the 173-acre St. Elizabeth's West Campus, currently being
prepared for use by the US Department of Homeland Security ­ is also
present, overlooking NSF Anacostia from across the interstate. To the
north of NSF Anacostia, the shore of the Anacostia River is occupied
by parkland (Poplar Point, Anacostia Park).

Across the Anacostia River and west of South Capitol Street, land use
consists primarily of low-density commercial and industrial areas with
some residential developments. The area east of South Capitol Street
is in a transitional stage. Formerly characterized by warehouses,
nightclubs,   and  industrial   uses,   it   has  undergone  extensive
redevelopment centered on such large-scale projects as the Washington
Nationals Major League Ballpark, between N Street and Potomac Avenue
SE; the US Department of Transportation on M Street; and numerous new
office and residential buildings and developments along M Street and
New Jersey Avenue. Redevelopment of the Southeast Federal Center, on M
Street, into a new mixed-used neighborhood, has also begun.

Project Site Land Use

The preferred site is currently mostly vacant. Its northern half was
previously occupied by Building 150, an administrative facility now
demolished (see Figure 4). The southern half of the site is occupied

by a parking lot and several trailers that will be relocated to make
room for the new facility. Nearest Thomas Road, Building 387, a semi-
permanent facility, will be relocated as well. The alternative site is
vacant and undeveloped.

2.4   Proposed Land Use

The proposed action will change the land use of the project site by
building a new facility that will comprise (1) an administrative
building with approximately 160,000 gross square feet of space and a
footprint of approximately 32,000 square feet and (2) a warehouse
approximately 23,000 square feet in size (see Figure 3).         The
warehouse will have three loading docks; on average, no more than
three tractor trailers a day will access or leave the facility,
although they will not do so every day. Smaller delivery trucks will
also access the facility on a daily basis.

2.5   Phasing and Timing

The facility is planned to be operational with                all   personnel,
equipment, and program moved in by September 2011.

2.6   Study Area

The study area for this project is bounded by the Anacostia River on
the north, I-295 on the east, the NRL campus on the south, and the
Potomac River on the west. Figure 5 shows the six intersections that
are being evaluated in this study.

2.7   Planned Roadway Improvements

Several transportation improvement projects          are    planned   in   the
vicinity of the study area, including:

  ·   Realignment of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge and new
      signalized traffic circle at South Capitol Street and Suitland
      Parkway (2012).

  ·   Reconstruction of the 11th Street bridges with a new full
      interchange with the Anacostia Freeway to separate local and
      interstate traffic via two bridges (2013).

  ·   Construction of a     new   urban   diamond   I-295/Suitland     Parkway
      Interchange (2015).

  ·   Reconstruction of the Malcolm X Avenue/I-295 interchange to
      connect to a new road that will extend between Firth Sterling
      Avenue and Malcolm X Avenue and provide access to the West Campus
      of St. Elizabeth's Hospital (2016).

Traffic Impact Study



The 11th Street bridges project, the South Capitol Street project,   and
the I-295/Suitland Interchange modification are included in          the
Anacostia Waterfront Initiative Transportation Master Plan and       are
programmed in the Constrained Long Range Plan (CLRP) and             the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

The listed roadway improvements have not been included in the
evaluation of no-action conditions presented here because none are
expected to be completed by 2011, the horizon year for this study.

2.8    Planned Development Projects

Similarly, no planned and approved development projects within or near
the study area are expected to have an impact on traffic conditions by
2011. No significant net change to the installation's personnel
loadings (both Bolling and Anacostia) is expected by 2011. In the
installation's vicinity, the relocation of the Department of Homeland
Security to the West Campus of St. Elizabeth's Hospital is scheduled
for 2016; the completion of the Barry Farm renovation project is
expected by 2018; no definitive plans or schedule are currently
available for the redevelopment of Poplar Point, which, for this
reason, is not included in the latest MWCOG population projections.

3.0    EXISTING CONDITIONS

3.1    Roadway Inventory

The roadways within the study area that are expected to be directly
impacted by the proposed action are discussed in this section. Figure
6 shows the roadway classification for the area's network.

   ·   The I-295 section of the Anacostia Freeway is classified as an
       interstate highway. It branches off the Southeast-Southwest
       Freeway in Northeast DC, crosses the Anacostia River on the 11th
       Street Bridge, then runs southward to the Capital Beltway (I-495)
       near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Prince Georges County,
       Maryland. To the northeast, the I-295 section of the Anacostia
       Freeway connects with the DC 295 section of the Anacostia
       Freeway/Kenilworth Avenue corridor, providing access to the
       Baltimore Washington Parkway and US 50. Within the study area, I-
       295 runs in a north-south direction. Northbound I-295 provides
       access to Bolling AFB's main gate via Malcolm X Avenue. The speed
       limit is 50 miles per hour (MPH). Annual Daily Traffic (ADT) is
       85,000 vehicles.

   ·   South Capitol Street is classified as an expressway south of M
       Street and along the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge over the
       Anacostia River, past which it continues south, parallel to I-
       295. The classification of the roadway changes from expressway to
       minor arterial south of its intersection with Firth Sterling

3.2     Existing Traffic Volumes

To determine existing traffic operations in the study area, manual
traffic turning movement counts were taken on Tuesday March 17 and
Wednesday March 18, 2009, during the AM (6:30-8:30) and PM (3:30-5:30)
peak periods at the following six intersections (see Figure 5):

   1.   South Capitol St. (Southbound) and Malcolm X Ave. (signalized)
   2.   South Capitol St. (Northbound) and Malcolm X Ave. (signalized)
   3.   I-295 off ramp at Malcolm X Ave. SE (un-signalized)
   4.   South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling Ave. (signalized)
   5.   Overlook Ave. SW at South Gate (signalized)
   6.   Overlook Ave SW at Chesapeake St SW (signalized)

The field data sheets for each intersection and peak period are
provided in Attachment A. A determination of the AM and PM peak hours
was made based on these peak-period counts. Turning movement counts
were analyzed to determine the four highest consecutive 15-minute
volumes (the peak hour) during each peak period. The peak hours were
determined to be:

   ·    AM Peak Hour: 7:00-8:00 AM
   ·    PM Peak Hour: 4:15-5:15 PM

ADT volumes for roadway links were derived from        DC Department of
Transportation (DDOT) 2007 traffic volumes adjusted    for 2009 using an
annual growth rate of +2%. The ADT of a roadway is     the typical daily
traffic volume in both directions. The 2007 DDOT ADT   volumes are shown
in Figure 7.

  Figure 7.     DDOT Traffic Volume Map (2007)




Threshold capacity for link ADT volumes is based upon the following
DDOT guidelines:

Facility Type                    Lanes     Threshold Capacity in ADT
Minor Collector                  2         10,000
Major Collector/Minor Arterial   4         20,000
Major Arterial                   4         30,000

3.3   Traffic Capacity Analysis

Using the existing traffic volumes as determined by the counts, the
six study intersections were analyzed using the procedures set forth
in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Transportation Research Board,
Updated 2000. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS) program was used to
determine traffic operational levels of service (LOS). Existing
traffic signal timings were used for all analyses.

LOS is a measurement of traffic flow in terms of speed and travel
time, freedom to maneuver, comfort, and convenience.  There are six
LOS, designated by the letters A through F, with LOS A representing
the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst. LOS for
intersections are measured in terms of vehicle delay, with somewhat
different values for signalized intersections and un-signalized
intersections, as shown in Table 1.

                                        Table 1
               LOS Values for Signalized and Un-signalized Intersections

          Signalized Intersections                       Un-signalized Intersections
Level of Service (LOS)       Vehicle Delay        Level of Service (LOS)   Vehicle Delay
                             (Seconds)                                     (Seconds)

      A                    Less than 10                 A                   Less than 10
      B                    >10-20                       B                   >10-15
      C                    >20-35                       C                   >15-25
      D                    >35-55                       D                   >25-35
      E                    >55-80                       E                   >35-50
      F                    More than 80                 F                   More than 50


The LOS for signalized intersections can reflect the average delay for
the entire intersection and the delay for individual movements. For
un-signalized intersections, the LOS reflects the delay for side
street traffic attempting to enter the mainline. All intersections in
this analysis are signalized, except Intersection #3 (I-295 off ramp
at Malcolm X Ave SE). Additional results provided by the analysis are
delay per vehicle in seconds, and volume/capacity (v/c) ratios.    The
v/c ratio is a comparison between the volume of traffic entering the
intersection from one or all approaches and the possible capacity of
one or all approaches.

An LOS C or better is the desirable goal for a roadway facility.
However, in major urban areas such as Washington, DC, LOS D is
considered acceptable. LOS E and F are considered to be at or below
capacity and are generally unacceptable. A summary of existing LOS for
the 6 study intersections, including delays and v/c ratios, is shown
in Table 2.     The analysis of existing conditions shows that all
intersections in the study area operate at overall LOS C or better.

3.4       Public Transportation

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA or Metro)
provides access to NSF Anacostia and Bolling AFB via several Metrobus
routes and one Metrorail station. The Air Force runs a shuttle service
between the Metro station and the Bolling-Anacostia installation.

Metrorail
The nearest Metrorail station is the Anacostia Station, near the
intersection of Firth Sterling Avenue and Howard Road, SE, a little
more than half a mile from NSF Anacostia's North Gate. Anacostia-
Bolling employees commuting by Metro have to walk to the installation
via Firth Sterling Avenue. However, there is no continuous pedestrian
route with sidewalks along this stretch of Firth Sterling Avenue. Past
the intersection with the Suitland Parkway, pedestrians must walk on
the side of the road or on grass. On their way to the installation,
pedestrians must cross the Suitland Parkway and South Capitol Street.
There is no crosswalk across South Capitol Street. There is a
crosswalk across the Suitland Parkway, but according to DDOT Traffic
Services   Administration,  this   is  a   high  pedestrian   accident
intersection. Finally, the reputation of the surrounding neighborhood

NSMA Relocation

as a high-crime area further discourages potential pedestrians.
Existing shuttle services partly mitigate this situation (see below).

Metrobus
Seven Metrobus lines run along South Capitol Street, with stops near
Bolling and Anacostia. Information on these lines is summarized in
Table 3.

Only Line W-4 provides service throughout the day. Line W-4 serves the
Main Gate at South Capitol Street and Malcolm X Avenue, and the North
Gate at South Capitol Street and Firth Sterling Avenue. So does Line
A-9, but on a much more limited schedule since, like the other lines,
it only provides rush-hour service. With the exception of Line W-4,
the bus lines that run along South Capitol Street near the project
site are primarily designed to move people between downtown Washington
and the Maryland suburbs during peak periods. The project site is
approximately 1,700 feet from the North Gate; as previously noted,

there is no crosswalk across South Capitol at the North Gate. Along
with the limited schedules, these factors are likely to discourage
potential bus riders.

Shuttle Services
Existing shuttle service between the Anacostia Station and NSF
Anacostia via the North Gate includes a shuttle run by the Air Force
between 5:25 and 9:15 in the morning and 3:10 and 6:48 in the evening,
with 20-minute headways. The shuttle stops at several places on NSF
Anacostia and Bolling AFB. The closest stop to the preferred site is
Stop #4, near the intersection of Thomas Road and Brookley Boulevard.
The ride between the Metrorail station and Stop #4 takes between 20
and 30 minutes, depending on the direction. The shuttle does not stop
within walking distance of the alternative site. The appeal of this
shuttle service is diminished by the lack of mid-day service, which
may leave employees stranded. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
runs another shuttle, but it is limited to DIA employees. Both
shuttles operate under waivers from DoD transportation regulations
that prohibit use of government-run transportation between residences
and workplaces. A shuttle map and schedule are included in attachment
D.

4.0   NO ACTION CONDITIONS (2011)

4.1   Affected Roadway Network

Under No Action conditions, the proposed relocation of NSMA would      not
occur, with no impacts on the road network near NSF Anacostia          and
Bolling AFB. Analysis of the No Action Alternative provides            the
baseline for evaluating the impacts of the action alternatives.        The
year of analysis is 2011, which is when the new NSMA facility           is
scheduled to be fully occupied.

4.2   Planned Roadway Improvements and Approved Development Projects

No planned roadway improvements in the vicinity of the project area
have been included in the analysis because all known planned and
approved projects have completion dates later than 2011.

4.3   Traffic Capacity Analysis

To estimate 2011 no action peak hour LOS, a two-percent-per-year
growth rate was assumed and added to the 2009 traffic volumes. A
summary of the LOS analysis results, including delays and v/c ratios,
is shown in Table 4. The analysis shows that all intersections in the
study area are projected to operate at LOS C or better, with the
exception of Intersection #4 (South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling
Ave.), which would operate at LOS D (from C under existing conditions)
during the PM peak hour.

5.0       ANACOSTIA ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONS (2011)

5.1       Trip Generation

The number of vehicle trips generated by NSMA was determined based on
the number of employees expected to drive to and from work during the
AM and PM peak hours. Under the proposed action, a total of 800
employees would relocate to NSF Anacostia. The expected modal split
(percentage of employees using different modes of transportation) was
determined based on modal split information provided in the December
2004 Anacostia Annex Site Development Plan (Section 3.6). The number
of vehicle trips to the site on a typical workday was calculated based
on the modal split. Results are shown in Table 5.

pool.


A total of 645 vehicle trips is expected to be generated by the site
every AM and PM. Hourly arrival rates and departure rates of employees
were determined by analyzing gate traffic counts conducted on November
18, 2008. Based on these counts, 44% of the trips (284 vehicles) are
expected to arrive during the AM peak hour and 42% (271 vehicles)
would depart during the PM peak hour. The percentage of vehicle
entering or exiting each gate during the peak hours was also
calculated   based  on  the   November  18   counts.  The   number  of
visitors/deliveries during the AM and PM peak hours was assumed to be
14 vehicles.

5.2     Traffic Distribution

The distribution of the project-generated vehicular traffic on the
roadways providing access to and from the proposed project site is a
key element in determining traffic impacts on the surrounding
intersections.

For this analysis, the following residential location data were
provided by the Navy: 70% of the existing NSMA employees reside in
Virginia, 29% in Maryland and 1% in another jurisdiction, assumed to
be Washington DC for the purposes of this analysis. However,
distributing vehicle trips over the road network requires finer-
grained data (generally, employees' residential zip codes), which were
not made available for this study. Therefore, reasonable assumptions
had to be made with regard to the residential location of NSMA
employees. To this end, the residential distribution of DoD employees
relocating from Arlington County to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, as
presented in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for BRAC
Implementation and Related Army Actions (June 2007), was used as a
stand-in (with minor adjustments) for the residential distribution of
NSMA employees, also DoD employees located in Arlington County.

On this basis, it was estimated that 40% of the NSMA employees would
enter the study area from southbound South Capitol Street, 32% would
enter from southbound I-295, 26% from northbound I-295, and 2% from

westbound Suitland Parkway. Distributing these traffic volumes on the
local network, 62% of the traffic is expected to use the North Gate;
26% is expected use the Main Gate; and 12% is expected to use the
South Gate. The assignment of project-generated peak hour traffic was
based upon these assumed traffic distribution percentages.

5.3   Peak Hour Trip Generation

Trips occurring during peak hours as a result of the project are shown
in Table 6. Approximately 241 vehicles would enter and 57 vehicles
would exit the site during the AM peak hour. During the PM peak hour,
approximately 49 vehicles would enter and 236 vehicles would exit the
site.

5.4   Traffic Capacity Analysis

Using estimated 2011 traffic volumes, the six study intersections were
analyzed using the HCS program to determine LOS for future conditions
under the Anacostia Alternative. Existing traffic signal timings were
used to allow for a direct comparison with the no action and the
existing   condition   scenarios.   However,  future   signal   timing
modifications might improve delays. Table 7 shows the projected 2011
LOS under the Anacostia Alternative. The analysis shows that, under
this alternative, LOS would be very similar to existing and no action
LOS, with slightly increased delays. All study intersections would
operate at an overall LOS C or better, with the exception of
Intersection #4 (South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling Ave.), which
would operate at LOS D during the PM peak period, as it would under no
action conditions.

6.0       BELLEVUE ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONS (2011)

6.1       Trip Generation

The number of vehicle trips generated by NSMA is the same under this
alternative as it would be under the Anacostia Alternative.

6.2       Traffic Distribution

The distribution of the generated vehicular traffic on the roadways
providing access to the Bolling-Anacostia installation would change
under this alternative.

Using the same methodology as was used for the Anacostia Alternative
conditions analysis, it was estimated that 86% of the NSMA employees
would enter the study area via northbound I-295, 9% would enter it via
southbound I-295, and 5% would enter it via South Capitol Street.
Distributing these traffic volumes on the local network, 75% of the
traffic is projected to use the South Gate; 20% is expected to use the
Main Gate; and 5% is expected to use the North Gate. The assignment of
project-generated peak hour traffic was based on these projected
traffic distribution percentages.

6.3   Peak Hour Trip Generation

Trips projected to occur during the AM and PM peak hours under the
Bellevue Alternative are shown in Table 8. The total traffic would
remain the same as under the Anacostia Alternative, but the gate
volumes and the local network traffic volumes would change.

6.4   Traffic Capacity Analysis

Using the estimated 2011 traffic volumes, the six study intersections
were analyzed to determine LOS under the Bellevue alternative. Table 9
shows the results of the analysis. LOS under the Bellevue Alternative
would be very similar to those under the Anacostia Alternative. All
study intersections would operate at overall LOS C or better, with the
exception of Intersection #4 (South Capitol St. at Firth Sterling
Ave.), which would operate at LOS D during the PM peak period, as it
would under no action conditions.

7.0   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1   Traffic Impacts

Based on the analyses summarized above, the relocation of NSMA under
either of the alternatives considered is not expected to significantly
degrade intersection LOS in the study area. Intersection delays and
v/c ratios would increase marginally. The intersection of South
Capitol Street and Firth Sterling Avenue would continue to operate at
LOS D during the PM peak hour, as it is expected to do under no action
conditions. LOS D is acceptable in major urban areas such as
Washington, DC. All the other study intersections would experience
small increases in traffic volumes, but they would continue to operate
at LOS C or better. Therefore, the proposed action is not expected to
have a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions in the study
area.

7.2       Recommendations

The roadways and intersections of the study area would continue to
operate under capacity after the proposed relocation of NSMA has taken
place. No roadway improvements or other mitigation measures are
recommended.

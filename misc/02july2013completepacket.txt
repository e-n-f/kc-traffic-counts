                              CITY MANAGER'S REPORT

City Manager Fleming reported on the success of the Downtown Patios. There were
some concerns expressed about the location of the patios, but steps will be taken to
rearrange the existing patios to accommodate four more. He met with some of the
restaurant owners today to discuss the placement changes and he felt the owners were
receptive. He will attend the CML Conference in Vail, from Wednesday, June 19th

Districts: Where art and economic development meet; State and local implementation of
recreational marijuana; Broadband and emerging telecommunication issues; Healthy
urban forests; Working with non-profits: Strengthen your community; and Making the
State Historical Fund work in your community.

park. It will have a small fountain, natural features, and be pedestrian and wheel chair
friendly. There will be room to commemorate others should the need ever arise.

The Committee's next step is to seek City Council approval to submit the plans to City
staff for review and discussion. If approved the Committee would like to turn over the
maintenance of the memorial to the City once it is completed. Staff estimates annual
costs for lighting, irrigation and landscape maintenance could be up to $1,000 annually.

Officer Sampson introduced members of the Helburg Family and to the citizens who
assisted in this project.

COUNCIL COMMENTS

Council member Loo inquired whether the Committee is looking for land or donations.
Officer Sampson stated it will be a publicly funded project. Chief Goodman has been
asked to request a City donation through the budget process.

PUBLIC COMMENT

Debbie Fahey, 1118 W. Enclave Circle, Louisville, CO, felt it was time to acknowledge a
police officer, who was killed in the line of duty.

COUNCIL COMMENT

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton suggested the following: The group meet with the Horticulture &
Forestry Advisory Board; the project be publicly funded and be engineered toward low
maintenance.

A member of the committee noted the design will contain some low maintenance ideas,
such as anti-graffiti benches and pre-powdered trellis work, which should provide low
maintenance.

Chief Goodman stated the State of Colorado created a Peace Officer's memorial in
Camp George West, Golden. The Helburg family documented the history of the
Constable's death and presented it to the oversight committee. The state was reluctant
to classify Constable Helburg as a peace officer, but the family was persistent and
prevailed. There is a memorial to Victor Helburg in the lobby of the police department,
which was created by Sergeant Mike Miller and his father. When the Police Department
was built, there was a plan for a park with a picnic tables and trees, but due to budget
constraints, it was removed. A budget presentation for the Helburg Memorial Park was
not made but may be forth coming in the future.

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton and Council member Sackett applauded the effort of the Helburg
family and all the volunteers and supporters.

             DISCUSSION ­ FOOD TRUCK COMMUNITY PARK EVENT

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton requested a staff presentation.

Parks and Recreation Director Stevens explained two "Food Truck in the Park" events
have been held so far this year and each has drawn between 2,000 to 2,300 people to
Community Park. Council and the public were asked to share their perspectives on
the impact the Wednesday evening events have had on the neighborhoods, the
restaurants throughout Louisville and the community at large. Staff and the event
sponsor, Todd Stevenson, Project Louisville LLC, will use this information to help

manage the remaining Food Truck events scheduled this year and inform discussions
regarding future events.

The Parks and Recreation Department issued special event permits authorizing 8 food
trucks in Community Park on May 22, June 12, June 26, July 10, July 24, August 7 and
August 21, 2013. The event sponsor requested authorization for four additional food
trucks to better serve the public and mitigate some of the long lines. The event is
popular among families with younger children however staff has received complaints
from residents of neighborhoods surrounding Community Park about parking/traffic
issues, noise, trash and persons not respecting private property. Downtown restaurants
have voiced concern the events negatively affect their revenue and the Downtown
Business Association submitted a letter opposing the Food Truck events. Staff will work
with the DBA and local restaurateurs to evaluate the impact of these events on existing
businesses and coordinate a follow-up discussion for planning next year.

COUNCIL COMMENT

Council member Sackett voiced his concern the success of the Food Truck event is at
the expense of the downtown restaurants. He felt this part-time program is detrimental
to the full-time businesses in Louisville.

Council member Jasiak reported attending both events and felt they provide for a
wonderful family outing. She heard comments from the DBA and the downtown
restaurants relative to their lost revenue and from some downtown merchants, who
would like to take part in the event by providing packed to go picnics or having the
attendees return to the downtown for drinks and dessert. She felt there was room for
cross promotion.

PUBLIC COMMENT

Todd Stevenson, Project Louisville LLC, event sponsor, reported on the success of the
first two events. Four additional trucks will be added to the eight, three of which will be
from Louisville. He emphasized very little trash has been collected from the first two
events. He explained they have tried to address all the issues regarding noise,
trespassing and parking through Facebook, by asking people who attend the events to
be conscientious where and how they park. They encourage people to bring a picnic
lunch, or pick up some dinner downtown and bring it to the park. They have requested
guidance from both the food trucks operators and the event attendees on how to make
this event more neighborhood friendly. They provide free maps, which have the names
and addresses of all 23 restaurants, the types of food they provide and any special
offers they may want to advertise.

COUNCIL COMMENTS

Council member Jasiak inquired whether downtown businesses could circulate coupons
or information about their specials to attendees. Mr. Stevenson stated they try to keep it

reach out for more sponsors.

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton stated the City issued a permit for this event through this
summer season and the Council will reevaluate the event at its conclusion.

             DISCUSSION/DIRECTION/ACTION ­ CITYWIDE PARKING
                     ORDINANCES AND ENFORCEMENT

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton requested a staff presentation.

Police Chief Goodman explained on February 26, 2013, the Police Department
presented City Council an overview of Louisville's parking ordinances and the Police
Department's parking violations enforcement practices, philosophies, and procedures.
The following five topics were discussed by Council: 1) the impact on neighborhoods of
heavily attended special events in Old Town and the Community Park; 2) the
consequences of too few off-street parking spaces for single and multifamily residences;
3) the intensity of parking violation ordinances enforcement by the Police Department;
4) Louisville does not have an ordinance restricting how long a properly registered
vehicle may be parked on a street and 5) the question of whether Louisville's municipal
code and ordinances related to parking need consolidation or refinement. He noted
about two dozen parking summons were issued at the first Street Faire of the season.
Tickets were issued for blocking driveways, parking in handicapped parking spaces
without permits, and parking encroachments in a no parking zone.

PUBLIC COMMENT

Susan Honstein, 727 Pine Street, Louisville, CO, a downtown resident, reported the
events are great for the City, but negatively impact the neighborhoods. Street parking is
not available for the residents and cars park all the way up to the stop signs, which
block any visual clearance, making it a dangerous situation. She felt the City should
partner with the businesses to supply a larger parking inventory. The residential
neighborhoods are impacted at lunch hours, during the week and all weekends. She
asked whether the curbs could be painted to eliminate over-parked neighborhood.

Michael Menaker, 1827 W. Choke Cherry Drive, Louisville, CO stated the parking issue
is a result of a vibrant downtown. He sympathized with the residential neighborhood.
He proposed the grain elevator be the new home for Lucky Pie and Sweet Cow and the
City develop the old post office site as a parking structure.

COUNCIL COMMENTS

Council member Sackett felt something has to be done to resolve the parking problems
downtown and it should be a very high priority. He stated if the City does not resolve
the parking problem it will kill the charm of Old Town.

Council member Jasiak asked Planning Director Russ about the discussion of striping
South Street to provide diagonal parking, which would increase the number of spaces.

Planning Director Russ explained the Public Works Department discussed this option
with the South Street residents on the potential of putting diagonal parking west of Main
Street to Grant Avenue. In their evaluation it was determined there were too many
driveways, which access South Street, and therefore the benefit of diagonal parking
was compromised by driveways and the net gain would be marginal. Many of the
driveways west of Main Street have alley access as well as street access. Diagonal
parking east of Main Street works as a two way, which was a key recommendation in
the parking plan. The Public Works Department is looking at the resurfacing program to
tie parking to the gateway project scheduled for next year. Public Works will go back to
the neighborhood, with the results of the study, which calls for two-way diagonal parking
east of Main Street and maintaining parallel parking west of Main Street.

Council member Jasiak thanked Ms. Hontein for her comments and stated she shared
her concerns. She noted it is not a 12-night Street Faire issue and agreed a solution
must be found.

City Manager Fleming noted the South Street Gateway underpass will open up
pedestrian access to the east side of the tracks. The City is actively looking for ways to
increase parking availability as part of the development of the area, and to provide a
safe crossing over Highway 42 to the Sports Complex parking. He asked Planning
Director Russ to address the Parking Study.

Planning Director Russ explained the Planning staff will be updating the 2009
Downtown Parking Utilization Study. The study will be conducted in July and repeated
in November. The study area will be expanded to include the RM zoning district and
Jefferson Avenue (larger portion of Old Town) to better understand parking demands
being placed in residential areas. The study will follow the methodology established in
2009. Staff will count the number of cars parked hourly (8 am to 8 pm) in Downtown
and at three different times (9 AM, noon, and 6 PM) in the surrounding neighborhoods.
The study will document parking conditions on Tuesday-Wednesday as well as Friday-
Saturday. The intent is to understand the utilization of parking. He noted there has
been no additional development in the downtown area, other than The Rex rooftop.

The Downtown Parking Utilization Study will illustrate the peak parking demand for
Downtown's current square footage, and reflect very different data than 2009. This
update will quantify parking utilization rates of both the public (on-street and off) and
private parking surface lots serving Downtown Louisville. Any additional square footage
in the downtown area will illustrate the fee in lieu of parking is ridiculously low at $3,500
and does not truly pay for a parking space. The results of the Parking Utilization Study
Update will be used to inform parking policy discussions with City Council and the
Planning Department will make recommendations on modifying the code, if necessary.

The Planning Division plans to complete studies three times a year, July, November and
in April in order to get meaningful data.

COUNCIL COMMENT
Council member Loo heard from an organizer of the Street Faire, the busiest nights this
season will be July 19, August 2, August 9 and August 16. She requested an
addendum to the study to include those nights and stressed the importance of getting
those high volume nights into the study. She felt Ms. Honstein's recommendation of
painting the curb was an excellent short term solution. With respect to the number of
summons written, she was not opposed to the issuance of a summons if it were
warranted.

Chief Goodman addressed the recommendation of painting curbs and explained in
Colorado they are not enforceable unless accompanied by a sign. He felt the paint is
fairly inexpensive, but signage is very expensive.

Council member Loo asked if cars are being ticketed for encroachment. Chief Goodman
stated they are not being ticketed due to the very high volume of cars encroaching into
the intersection.

Council member Loo asked if warnings were too expensive. Chief Goodman stated it is
not too expensive, but it is ineffective, because at the next Street Faire someone else
will park there. He noted if warnings are given, sooner or later, tickets would have to be
issued. He explained the Police Department was surprised by the number of cars at
the Street Faire very early in the evening.

Council member Loo suggested the Public Relations Manager provide a press release
asking people who attend the downtown events to be respectful of the property owners
and not block their driveway or they will be ticketed. Council member Jasiak suggested
the Mayor welcome them at the beginning of the Street Faire and remind them where
they park may impact the neighbors and be mindful of where they park next time.

City Manager Fleming stated staff can work with the DBA, to incorporate this message
in their advertisement for the Street Faire. He suggested the Mayor, when introducing
the bands, encourage people to be mindful when parking and not infringe on the rights
of neighbors. He would get some cost estimate for painting curbs. He did not share the
opinion that the cost of paint is fairly inexpensive.

Council member Loo asked about changing the ordinance to address the remodel of
existing buildings downtown and the provision to provide parking and/or to increase the
parking fees. She asked if this would be only for remodeling.

Planning Director Russ confirmed it was for a remodel of a certain size (50% more). He
explained many homes in Old Town were scraped off before there was a parking
ordinance. Many home in Old Town do not have parking spaces and when they get

scraped or remodeled they are required to bring in two parking spaces off the alley.
The challenge in Old Town is there are homes which do not have parking.

Council member Loo asked if the issue is for homes, which do not have driveways and
park on the street. Planning Director Russ stated it is about a walkable community,
which was established in the Old Town Overlay District to create the downtown. He
stated the real issue is how the alleys are maintained or not maintained in terms of
access and sightlines. Access to the alley in the wintertime may be very difficult. He
stated it is a comprehensive study specific to Old Town and has many components.

Council member Loo stated Louisville does not have an ordinance stipulating how long
a properly registered vehicle be parked on a City street. With the exception of a few
instances, she did not see a problem unless there was overwhelming citizen sentiment
to the contrary.

Council member Jasiak disclosed she lives in Old Town and does have a driveway.
She disagreed with the statement Old Town is not walkable because of driveways. She
addressed the argument of gaining a one and a half parking space when a driveway is
removed, to provide more street parking for people who do not live in Louisville. She
stated taking the parking away from the residents does not make sense. The primary
source of friction over parking comes from the residents themselves. Looking at the
broader topic of remodels/driveways in Old Town, she wanted to hear from residents.

PUBLIC COMMENT

Susan Honstein, 727 Pine Street, Louisville, CO suggested the study on the impact of
the neighborhoods for Tuesday and Wednesday, commence at 7:00 p.m. instead of
6:00 p.m. She felt this is more than one issue. It is also about a sense of safety and
security in the neighborhood including the safe ingress and egress from the
neighborhood.

COUNCIL COMMENTS

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton summarized the parking issues as follows: There did not appear
to be concern over how long a registered vehicle can remain on a City Street; there are
more issues than parking; the downtown parking should be a part of the study following
the survey and Council must address the parking, by way of either a parking structure or
several parking lots.

Deputy City Manager Balser stated when the Council receives their budget packet; they
will see a CIP Budget for parking.

forward with a Branding, Directional, and Wayfinding Project. This was identified in the
2010 Parking and Pedestrian Action Plan as a capital improvement aimed at increasing
the accessibility and visibility of underutilized parking spaces throughout Downtown.
The City's 2012 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) included funding to install
upgraded parking and wayfinding signs for Downtown.

Staff prepared a Downtown sign plan intended to provide navigational assistance to
travelers visiting Downtown Louisville, which would be easy to understand and could
ultimately be used Citywide. The Downtown sign plan was the result of an intensive
three month planning and design process, which included Planning Staff reviewing
alternative sign packages with the Business Retention and Development (BRaD)
Committee; the Louisville Revitalization Commission (LRC), the Downtown Business
Association (DBA), and City Council. The City Council then directed staff to move
forward with an RFP for fabrication of the signs. The project came in at half the budget.
Signs were placed in some downtown areas to receive public comment.

In July of 2012 staff was contacted by Xcel and advised they were beginning an
outreach program directed at understanding how municipalities were using their utility
poles. Two utility pole brands are used in Louisville: Mountain States and Sternberg.
The Mountain States utility pole has a much higher weight rating than the Sternberg
poles. A Mountain States pole can withstand 9 SF of sign loading, whereas a Sternberg
pole can only withstand 3 SF of sign loading. Unfortunately the current downtown
circular sign is slightly larger than 3 SF (3.14 SF to be exact) and most of the
Downtown poles are Sternberg poles. The supplemental rectangular directional signs
would add another .6 SF per sign. Based on this information, staff would need to reduce
the overall size of the Downtown signs to continue to use the Sternberg poles located
throughout Downtown.

Staff can create a sign program which does not involve the Xcel utility poles. The signs
could be placed on new City owned poles, which would be similar to street sign poles.
However, if we use individual poles for the sign program then the project could end up
cluttering the downtown area with too many poles. Staff requested direction on which
option to follow: a) make smaller signs to mount to the Sternberg poles, or b) use new
City owned poles for the Downtown Sign program.

COUNCIL COMMENT

Council member Sackett asked for staff's recommendation. Principal Planner
McCartney stated branding signs could be placed on City owned poles and be of any
size. There would not be a need for a lot of signs because the downtown area is small.
The next question is whether the signs should be used to provide direction to public
areas or as a directional for downtown and ultimately as a wayfinding plan, not limited to
the downtown district.

Council member Sackett supported staff's recommendation.

Council member Loo commented she did not approve the signage and the City Council
asked for more choices on colors and design. She addressed branding and stated the
City already has branding on the letterhead. She stated the signage doesn't work and
changing the branding must have community buy-in.

Council member Jasiak stated the signage is a result of the best of intentions, but she
agreed it did not work. She felt what was needed was big directional signage. She
suggested concentrating on directional signage and putting the branding aside for now.

City Manager Fleming explained the staff brought the signage issue before the City
Council to receive direction. He suggested waiting for results of the parking analysis
would be helpful to the signage project. The design can then be revisited.

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton agreed there can be improvements made to the signage. He
apologized to the Planning staff for the miscommunication.

City Manager Fleming stated branding is difficult because it is hard to please everyone.

No items to report.

    COUNCIL COMMENTS, COMMITTEE REPORTS, AND IDENTIFICATION OF
                      FUTURE AGENDA ITEMS

Mayor Pro Tem Dalton suggested a future agenda item include discussion on a code
revision to the historic preservation ordinance. The code includes a method for creating
a historic district, which does not adequately protect the rights of property owners. He
addressed the draft of the Jefferson Park Survey and the intonation recommending the
creation of a Jefferson Park Historic District. He felt the City Council should discuss this
matter at a study session.

                                        ADJOURN

MOTION: Mayor Pro Tem Dalton moved for adjournment, seconded by Council member
Jasiak. All were in favor. The meeting was adjourned at 8:55 p.m.

SUMMARY:
The applicant, Passco Companies Development: Carey Levy has requested a three
year extension of the expiration of two separate Final Planned Unit Development (PUD)
plans. The first of the two projects is located on Lots 1 and 2 of the Colorado
Technological Center (CTC) Subdivision, Filing 2. The second project is located on Lot
12 of the CTC Subdivision, Filing 2. The following map illustrates the location of the two
projects:

                                           28
SUBJECT:    APPROVE PUD EXTENSION

DATE:       JULY 2, 2013                                                       PAGE 2 OF 3


 The Final PUD for Lots 1&2 includes a 104,800 square foot two-story flex office
 building. It was originally approved by City Council on December 4, 2007. The final
 PUD for Lot 12 was originally approved by City Council on November 2, 2009 and
 consists of one 40,200 SF flex office building and two additional 18,825 SF flex office
 buildings. The Applicant is only requesting a three year time extension. No
 modifications or amendments are being requested for either project.

 Section 17.28.200 (PUD ordinance) of the Louisville Municipal Code (LMC) states:

        "no building permit shall be issued more than 36 months after city council
        approval of the plan unless an extension of time is approved pursuant to
        subsection 17.28.210.B."

 There is a footnote attributed to the above section which states the extension granted
 "shall be measured from the original expiration date of such PUD." Therefore the new
 start dates for these PUD time extensions will vary based on their original PUD dates.

 The LMC does not permit the issuance of a building permit for Lots 1 and 2 after
 December 4, 2013. The PUD for Lot 12 expired on November 2, 2012, so the
 opportunity for issuance of a building permit has already expired. The applicant has
 stated the difficult real estate market has prevented the project from moving forward
 with construction at this point in time. The three year extension has been requested to
 allow time for the real estate market to turn around so the project can be constructed.

 SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION
 Subsection 17.28.210.B of the LMC states that the proposed time extension must be
 approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council under the procedures
 authorized for final plan approval. Generally, this requirement is intended to serve two
 purposes. First, the City design guidelines change over time and a three year window
 allows the City to ensure that development proposals remain consistent with current
 standards as they are updated. Second, over a period of three years the context of the
 area surrounding a project may change. The three year expiration date allows a
 reexamination of the project in light of any contextual changes to the area surrounding
 the project.

 The Comprehensive Plan for the City was updated in May of this year. However, no
 changes in policies were recommended for the Colorado Technology Center.
 Furthermore, there have been no modifications to the Industrial Development Design
 Standards and Guidelines (IDDSG) or any significant changes to the area surrounding
 either of the two projects. The only modification requested for both projects is a three
 year extension of the approval time. All other aspects of the original plans as approved
 by City Council, remain unchanged.

SUBJECT:    APPROVE PUD EXTENSION

DATE:       JULY 2, 2013                                                       PAGE 3 OF 3

 Staff believes time extensions for both applications are appropriate and recommend
 approval of a three year extension of the expiration of both Final PUD plans.

 FISCAL IMPACT:
 The proposed development for lots 1&2 and lot 12 Colorado Technological Center,
 Filing 2 includes a 104,800 square foot two-story flex office building (Lots 1 & 2) and a
 total of 77,850 square foot flex office buildings (Lot 12). This space could introduce new
 jobs and employees into the local economy. The requested extension will grant the
 developer additional time to complete the projects. Staff did not identify a negative
 fiscal impact to the City of Louisville associated with this request.

 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:
 Both applications were heard by the Planning Commission on June 13, 2013. After a
 brief presentation by staff and the applicant, the Commissioners voted unanimously to
 recommend approval of the requested extensions. The Commissioners did not have
 any questions for staff or the applicant.

 RECOMMENDATION:
 Staff recommends that City Council approve Resolution No. 33, Series 2013 and
 Resolution No. 34, Series 2013

SUMMARY:
Staff requests City Council action on a proposed Economic Development Business
Assistance Package (BAP) for the expansion of the Blue Parrot Restaurant. The
proposed business assistance is similar in nature to other retail expansion agreements
recently granted, including partial rebates of building permit fees, construction use tax,
retail sales tax, and a sign fee waiver.

DISCUSSION:
The Blue Parrot has been a Louisville institution since 1919. It was started by Mike and
Mary Colacci serving traditional Italian and now the 5th generation of the family works at
the restaurant.

The owners are considering expanding the restaurant by constructing an outdoor deck
to build upon downtown's summer allure of outside dining. The deck is envisioned to be
constructed on the east side of the building over the existing ramp adjacent to the alley.
Initial cost estimates for the deck is $25,000.

The restaurant is also considering installing a community mural on the top portion of the
building façade. To help facilitate completing the mural, the City may waive the sign
review fee charged by the Planning Department and allow access to historic photos at
the Historical Museum.

The restaurant currently has 23 employees and with the expansion hope to grow to 30
within 5 years. The employee wages are not above the Boulder County average wage,
but this is typical for retail operations.

The Blue Parrot meets the general criteria by which assistance may be granted in
accordance with the Business Assistance Policy. The assistance would be funded by
permit fees, construction use tax, and increased sales tax from the construction and
operation of the new deck.

City Staff estimates The Blue Parrot will generate new revenue of approximately $1,400
from building permit fees and construction use taxes directly to the City in the first year
of operation, given an investment of $25,000 for the tenant improvements.

DATE:       JULY 2, 2013                                                      PAGE 2 OF 3

 Approximately $50 of that amount is fees designated for Open Space and Historic
 Preservation purposes.

 The Company also estimates adding $60,000 per year of retail sales at the facility from
 customers. These sales would generate $1,800 per year of sales tax revenue. The
 sales tax rebate is for a period of three years and is not to exceed $25,000.

 Based upon the estimated revenue projection, staff recommends the following:

 Proposed Assistance                                              Approximate
                                                                     Value
 Building Permit-Fee Rebate
 50% rebate on permit fees for tenant finish                          $450
 (Excludes tap fees)

 Building Use Tax Rebate
 50% rebate on Building Use Tax for core and shell and
 Tenant finish (excludes 0.375 % Open Space tax
 and 0.125% Historic Preservation tax)                                $200

 Sales Tax Rebate
 40% rebate of City's General 3% sales tax on increased sales
 above the previous12 month period for three years
 (capped at $25,000)                                                 $2000

 Sign Fee Waiver                                                      $100


 Total Estimated Assistance                                         $2,750

 Staff suggests the assistance be provided at 50% of the actual Building Use Tax plus
 Building Permit Fee paid. Staff suggests the City's incentive be void if The Blue
 Parrot does not complete the improvements by December 31, 2014, or does not
 remain in business there for five years.

 FISCAL IMPACT:
 The total fiscal impact would not exceed a total of 50% of the City's permit fees and
 50% building use taxes paid (excluding the 0.375 % open space tax, 0.125% Historic
 Preservation tax, water and sewer tap fees, and impact fees) based on the tenant
 improvement estimated cost of $25,000 at 640 Main Street. Sales Tax rebates are
 estimated to total $2000 over the 3 year period but not to exceed $25,000.

 The applicant, BVZ Architects, has submitted a plan to develop the Coal Creek Station
 property as a mixed use project. The property is 10.97 acres and was platted as part of
 the Caledonia Place subdivision in 1890. Parts of the property have been re-platted
 over the years to allow for commercial development, including the railroad car
 restaurant, the Louisville Cyclery building, the former 7-11 building, and the Tim's Trains
 building. The small building that was formerly a State Farm office is on a separate lot
 and not part of this development request. The remainder of the property is vacant.




                                                                 South Boulder Rd

 The proposed development includes 34,335 square feet of commercial space, replacing
 13,440 square feet of existing commercial space for a net increase of 20,895 square
 feet. The request includes 51 residential units: 34 as duplexes and 17 as townhomes.

 The property is located within the Highway 42 Revitalization Area and therefore must be
 rezoned in accordance with Chapter 17.14 ­ Mixed Use Zone District in the LMC with a

 applicant is requesting modifications to the adopted Land Use Plan (Exhibit A) to allow
 for a more functional layout. The applicant is also requesting a change to the use table
 in Section 17.14.050 of the Louisville Municipal Code (LMC) to allow for duplexes in the
 MU-R zone district.

 REQUEST:
 The applicant requests a preliminary plat and PUD to allow for the development of 51
 residential units and 34,335 square feet of commercial space. The applicant also
 requests a rezoning and modifications to LMC Chapter 17.14 to allow duplexes and
 adjust the Land Use Plan (Exhibit A).

 Zoning
 Section 17.14.020 of the LMC requires any property undergoing new development or
 redevelopment in the Revitalization Area first be rezoned consistent with the Land Use
 Plan referenced as Exhibit A. The applicant proposes a modification to the Land Use
 Plan to allow for a more functional layout.

 The proposal rearranges the streets to fit the proposed development and offsite
 connections while maintaining the intent and enhancing connectivity. The proposal also
 moves some of the commercial area from along South Boulder Road to along Highway
 42, providing better visibility and access. The last major change removes the park
 along Highway 42. The applicant proposes, as an alternative, a centrally located park
 and linear multi-use path through the development that would be publicly accessible but
 privately maintained.

 Staff believes these changes are reasonable and beneficial to the development and the
 City, and recommends approval of the changes to the Land Use Map and the rezoning.

 Preliminary Subdivision Plat
 Blocks
 The proposed block layout complies with the Mixed Use Development Design
 Standards and Guidelines (MUDDSG) and matches in scale and style with the existing
 residential neighborhood to the south. The eastern residential portion matches the
 north-south lot orientation of the Nicola DiGiacomo subdivision immediately to the
 south, while the western portion matches the east-west lot orientation of Caledonia
 Place. The block lengths and widths are appropriate, and alley access is provided for
 all residential units. The commercial section follows the requirements of the MUDDSG
 by moving the buildings to the street and providing parking behind.

 Streets and Alleys
 The streets in the development are intended to serve local traffic and provide alternative
 routes for a small amount of through-traffic. As such, the streets are narrow and
 designed to accommodate on-street parking. The street sections have been approved
 by the Public Works Department. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the streets,
 except for the southeast portion of Front Street where there is limited right-of-way.
 Bicycle traffic will be handled on-street, as it is in Old Town, and the low speeds and
 traffic volumes will provide for a safe environment without the need for dedicated bike
 lanes or a separate trail.

 The applicant proposes realigning the southern east-west portion of Cannon Circle to
 better serve the development, meet signal spacing requirements to allow for a traffic
 signal on Highway 42, and to align with the access to the Harney/Lastoka Open Space
 east of Highway 42. Business access to Fordyce Auto will be provided by access
 easements across Lot 1, Block 1, and a right-in-right-out access will be maintained at
 the location of the current intersection of Cannon Circle and Highway 42 to allow for
 truck access to Fordyce Auto. The owner of Fordyce Auto has agreed to these
 changes.

 The alleys meet City standards, though there are some concerns with the southernmost
 east-west alley just north of Little Italy. It is currently an unimproved public alley that the
 applicant intends to improve. The applicant is requesting the City maintain the alley,
 while the Public Works Department is requesting the alley be made private and the
 Homeowners' Association maintain it. Staff suggests a condition of approval requiring
 this issue be resolved before the final plat and PUD are approved. The western end of
 the alley, as shown on the plat, is the private property of the homeowners to the south.
 The applicant has agreed to work with the property owners to provide access, and staff
 recommends a condition of approval requiring access be provided before the final plat
 and PUD are approved.

 The Public Works Department has expressed some concern that the turning radii at
 some intersections may be too tight for fire trucks and other large vehicles. Staff

 Public Land Dedication
 LMC Section 16.16.060 requires a public land dedication for subdivisions unless
 "satisfactory dedication arrangements were made and approved by the City Council at
 the time of annexation or previous subdivision of the same property." This property was
 previously subdivided as Caledonia Place in 1890 and, given its approval at that time;
 staff assumes the public land dedication was considered adequate by City Council.

 Additionally, the applicant is providing a privately maintained public trail and park space
 as shown on the Land Use Map Exhibit A. Furthermore, no additional park space was
 identified as needed in the City of Louisville's 2011 Park Recreation Open Space and
 Trails Master Plan (PROST). Finally, LMC Chapter 3.18 requires that new development

 pay impact fees to mitigate the increased demand on City services, including parks and
 open space. This development will be required to pay those impact fees at the time
 building permits are issued. Therefore, staff has determined that a public land
 dedication is not required.

 Preliminary PUD Development Plan
 Land Use
 The proposed land uses comply with the proposed zoning and LMC Chapter 17.14,
 except for the residential density and the inclusion of duplexes. LMC Section 17.14.060
 sets the minimum residential density in the MU-R district at 12 units per acres; the
 applicant is requesting a density of 6.9 units per acre. The use table in LMC Section
 17.14.050 does not allow duplexes in the MU-R district; the applicant is requesting 34
 duplex units.

 Section 17.14.090(A)(2)(b)(i) of the LMC allows for waivers or modifications to the
 underlying zoning requirements through the PUD process if "the proposed development
 represents an improvement in site and building design over that which could be
 accomplished through strict compliance with otherwise applicable district standards."

 Staff believes the waiver for reduced density is justified because it will provide a better
 transition between the commercial development and the existing residential
 neighborhoods to the south. Also, this development is outside the quarter-mile primary
 influence area for the proposed FasTracks stations, so the higher densities associated
 with transit-oriented development are not necessary and will likely not impact ridership.

 Section 17.14.090(A)(2)(b)(ii)(a) of the LMC states the uses allowed in the MU-R district
 may not be waived or modified through the process described above. Therefore, a
 code change is required to allow duplexes in the MU-R district. Given the requested
 reduction in density, duplexes make sense and will serve as an appropriate transition to
 the Little Italy neighborhood. The proposed change will only allow duplexes in the MU-
 R district north of Little Italy, preserving the intended uses and density in the core of the
 redevelopment area.

 Bulk and Dimension Standards
 The proposed development complies with the yard and bulk standards of LMC Chapter
 17.14 and the MUDDSG, except for a few areas for which the applicant is requesting
 waivers under LMC Section 17.14.090.

 In the MU-R zone district, there is a 40% minimum lot coverage requirement, a
 maximum front setback of 10 feet, and a requirement that at least 70% of the street-
 facing property lines contain buildings. The proposed lot coverage for the residential
 lots varies between 30% and 40%. The front setback for most lots is 12 feet, though
 some lots have significantly larger front setbacks where the roads start to curve, going
 to 30 feet. The 70% frontage requirement is met on most lots, but there are a few lots

 with larger, curved front lot lines where the frontage drops to around 60%. Considering
 the reduced density and lot layout, these deviations from the yard and bulk standards
 are reasonable.

 Lot line coverage              70%                            60%

 There are four units in two duplexes proposed for the area to be zoned RM. In RM, the
 minimum lot size is 7,000 square feet, with a minimum lot area per dwelling unit of
 3,500 square feet. The four lots on which the units will sit, plus the surrounding outlot,
 total more than 17,000 square feet, giving over 4,250 square feet per unit. However,
 because each unit is on its own lot, none of the lots meet the 7,000 square foot
 minimum size requirement, or the 60 foot minimum width requirement. Waivers to the
 lot size, lot area per unit, and lot width requirements are therefore required.

 Because of the small lots and shared walls of the duplexes, there are also waivers
 required for setbacks and lot coverage.

 Italy neighborhood. The overall scale and density will be the same as is allowed by
 right in the RM district.

 An alternative option would be to adjust the Land Use Plan and rezone this area MU-R
 to match the rest of the development, but there are more allowed uses in MU-R than in
 RM. Keeping it RM will prevent any of the more intense uses from intruding on the
 established neighborhood in the future.

 In the MU-CC zone district, the minimum lot coverage is 30% and the maximum setback
 is 60 feet from Highway 42 or South Boulder Road and 30 feet from interior streets.
 Buildings A, B, and C, along South Boulder Road, meet these requirements, along with
 the others in LMC Section 17.14.060, but building D along Highway 42 does not. The
 proposed lot coverage for Lot 1, Block 1, on which Building D sits, is 10%. The setback
 to Highway 42 is 120 feet, while the setbacks to Cannon Circle are 32 feet to the south
 and 111 feet to the west. The low lot coverage and large setbacks are caused in part
 by the easement required to provide access to Fordyce Auto, and in part by the
 circulation requirements of a drive-through restaurant. Given the location, constraints,
 and surrounding development, staff recommends these waivers be approved.

 Section 17.14.060 of the LMC requires a minimum building height of 35 feet and two
 stories, while allowing a maximum height of 45 feet and three stories in both the CC and
 MU-R districts. The maximum building height in RM is 35 feet, with no minimum. The
 applicant is proposing one story buildings in the MU-CC district with a maximum height
 of 35 feet. In the MU-R district, the duplexes will have two stories, with a maximum
 height of 35 feet and the townhomes will have three stories with a maximum height of
 45 feet. In the RM district, the duplexes will have a maximum height of 35 feet.

 The applicant is requesting a waiver to allow one story buildings in the MU-CC district,
 and buildings shorter than 35 feet in MU-CC and MU-R. Staff recommends approving
 these modifications under LMC Section 17.14.090 because the lower heights will be
 more compatible with the density of the development and the adjacent neighborhood.
 The proposal complies with the height transition standards where abutting the RM zone

 Under the MUDDSG, the development must provide 102 off-street parking spaces for
 the residential units, plus 7 guest spaces that may be provided on-street under Section
 4.1(C). The applicant is proposing 102 off-street spaces and 32 on-street spaces in the
 residential area. In the commercial area, Buildings A, B, and C meet the retail parking
 requirement of one space per 300 square feet, and Building D complies with the
 maximum allowance of 1.25 spaces per 300 square feet for restaurants.

 As part of an earlier agreement, this development is required to provide two parking
 spaces to the former State Farm office building. Those spaces are provided at the
 northwest corner of the development.

 Transportation
 The applicant has provided a Traffic Impact Analysis, which shows the traffic generated
 by the development will not adversely affect the surrounding roads (attachment 7). The
 South Boulder Road and Highway 42 intersection will continue to operate at a peak
 hour Level of Service (LOS) C, its current LOS, through the year 2035. The accesses
 to the development off of South Boulder Road and Highway 42 will operate at LOS A or
 B through 2035.

 The internal streets are adequate for site circulation. The Cannon Circle connection will
 allow drivers going from eastbound South Boulder Road to southbound Highway 42 to
 avoid the signal at South Boulder Road and Highway 42, alleviating the need for a
 dedicated right turn lane at that intersection. The connection of Front Street to Griffith
 Street will allow access to Downtown and the signal at Main Street and South Boulder
 Road.

 Parks, Recreation, Trails and Open Space
 The applicant is proposing a multi-use trail and linear park through the development,
 from the northwest to the southeast. At the southeast, the trail will connect to the
 sidewalk along Highway 42 and the signal at Cannon Circle, allowing access to the
 proposed soft-surface trail along the Harney/Lastoka Open Space east of Highway 42.
 At the northwest, the trail will connect to the sidewalk along South Boulder Road which,
 along with the traffic signal at Main Street, will provide access to the north and west
 areas of the City.

 Through the center of the development, the trail will run through a landscaped buffer
 between the residential and commercial portions of the site. The portion of the trail
 along South Boulder Road is currently shown as a standard five-foot sidewalk instead of
 the eight-foot multi-use path. Staff recommends a condition of approval requiring the
 entire sidewalk along South Boulder Road be expanded to eight feet to match the rest
 of the trail and provide access to the paved trail along the north side of Harney/Lastoka
 and being requested with the Safeway Redevelopment. The portion of the sidewalk in
 front of Union Jack Liquor will not be expanded as it is not part of this development, but
 any future redevelopment of that lot will allow the path to be completed. The Parks and

 Recreation Department has reviewed the proposal and requested the trail not be
 dedicated to the City, but be maintained by the HOA.

 Urban Form
 The proposed development matches the desired urban form for the Revitalization Area.
 Except for Building D, the commercial structures are fronted towards the street with
 parking provided behind the building. The residential units are on connected urban
 streets with alley access. The proposed development will provide an attractive anchor
 to one of the most important intersections in the City while acting as a compatible
 neighbor to the adjacent established residential neighborhood.

 FISCAL IMPACT:
 The applicant has submitted a fiscal impact study completed by Economic and Planning
 Systems based on the City's fiscal model (attachment 8). The study estimates positive
 net ongoing revenues of $103,783 per year ($42,305 operations and $61,478 capital)
 and a negative net one-time capital cost of $189,939. Based on these estimates, it will
 take the development less than four years to pay back the capital fund expenditures
 associated with its construction.

 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:
 The Planning Commission held a public hearing on June 13, 2013 to consider the
 applicant's proposal, and passed a resolution recommending approval of the zoning
 change, preliminary plat, preliminary PUD, and LMC amendments by a 5-1 vote. The
 biggest concern expressed by Planning Commission was the waivers requested for
 Building D in the commercial portion.

 Some members of the Commission felt the proposed plan for that lot strayed too far
 from the intent of the Redevelopment Area and would have negative impacts on the
 existing homes in Little Italy. Subsequently, staff has met with the applicant to work on
 alternative designs that could alleviate these concerns before final PUD submittal.
 However, given the constraints on the site from the required access for Cannon Circle,
 Highway 42, and Fordyce Auto, there is no way to meet all of the yard and bulk
 requirements of LMC Chapter 17.14 without significantly reconfiguring the proposed
 development.

 Another suggestion made by Planning Commission was that the eight foot path be
 continued all the way along South Boulder Road. Staff has incorporated this suggestion
 into the recommended conditions of approval. Besides these issues, Planning
 Commission generally expressed strong support for the project.

 Public comment at the meeting focused mainly on the potentially negative impacts the
 Front Street connection will have on Little Italy with respect to traffic and parking. Staff
 believes the Front Street connection will be a benefit to the City as a whole, and the
 specific design elements included in the street will limit impacts on Little Italy. Staff will

 continue to work with the applicant to minimize impacts from the street for final PUD
 submittal. Staff also recommends a neighborhood plan for the Little Italy neighborhood
 be advanced to identify any necessary public improvements within the Little Italy
 neighborhood as the revitalization District redevelops.

 RECOMMENDATION:
 Staff recommends approval of the requested zoning change, preliminary plat,
 preliminary PUD, and LMC modifications for the development called Coal Creek Station.
 The proposal will allow for the development of a mixed use project in the Highway 42
 Revitalization Area with the following waivers:

        Decreased residential density in the MU-R district
        Decreased minimum lot coverage in the MU-R district
        Increased maximum front setback in the MU-R district
        Decreased minimum front lot line coverage in the MU-R district
        Decreased minimum lot size, lot area per unit, and lot width in the RM district
        Decreased minimum setbacks in the RM district
        Increased maximum lot coverage in the RM district
        Decreased minimum lot coverage for Building D in the MU-CC district
        Increased maximum setbacks for Building D in the MU-CC district
        Decreased minimum height and story requirements in both MU-R and MU-CC
        districts

 Staff has determined the waivers are appropriate under LMC Section 17.14.090 to allow
 for an effective development given the location and surrounding land uses. The
 applicant is also requesting and staff is recommending two changes to Chapter 17.14 of
 the LMC:

        Adjustments to the "Exhibit A" Land Use Plan to allow for a more connected street
        network and better sited land uses
        Removal of the prohibition on duplexes in the MU-R district north of Little Italy only

 Staff recommends the following conditions of approval:

    1. Widen the multi-use path along South Boulder Road to eight feet.
    2. The maintenance of the southernmost alley will be determined before final
       approval of the plat and PUD.
    3. Access on the west end of the southernmost alley will be acquired before final
       approval of the plat and PUD.
    4. The applicant will provide radii and turning templates at all street corners to show

Letter of Request for the Redevelopment of Coal Creek Station - PUD

Revised 5/17/13, Additional waiver request

PROJECT DIRECTION AND GOALS
It is the intent of this project to become a viable part of the City's commercial and
residential community. The project includes the redevelopment of Coal Creek Station,
Filing 1, 2, & 3, and the balance of the vacant site. The goal is to redevelop the existing
commercial along So. Boulder Rd. and State Hwy 42. The success of the commercial
development is enhanced by shifting Cannon Dr. to the South along SH 42 and creating
a controlled intersection. By doing so, we need to request an adjustment to Section
17.14.030, Exhibit A, for the street layout and zoning designation. The goal of the
residential portion of the site is to extend the existing residential neighborhood to the
South onto our site. To allow the new residential neighborhood to be developed with a
more compatible density and character, we need to request a density reduction for the
MU-R zoning, Section 17.14.060, Table 3, from 12 units to 6.5 units/ac. We also need
to change the use table, Section 17.14.050, Table 1 to allow duplexes in the MU-R zone
district. This property is an infill site which will add to the existing fabric of the
surrounding successful business and residential community. Because this development is
located on an "Infill Site", it will be able to provide financial support for the existing
services already in place, such as roadways, utilities, and police and fire protection,
without adding to the cost of these supporting systems.

SITE CIRCULATION
This development will cater to auto-oriented along with pedestrian and bike users
throughout the site. Bike parking is located at each commercial location. The extension
of Front St. and re-establishing Frost St. from the original "Caledonia Place" subdivision,
helps extend the existing residential circulation onto the site. The development is
organized to keep higher activity users closest to the major roadways, and less active
users in the residential area. The development has used a pedestrian/bikeway to buffer
the residential activity from the commercial users. The landscaped pedestrian/bikeway
will connect Main St. with a controlled pedestrian/ bikeway crossing at Cannon Cir. and
SH 42 onto the City's open space.

BUILDING CHARACTER
The commercial buildings on the site shall be in keeping with the surrounding building
character with a 1 to 1 1/2 story height. The goal of the single story spaces will be to
cater to neighborhood retail users.

The goal of the residential elements of the development will be to extend the existing



                                           95
residential neighborhood feel onto our site. We have re-establish Frost Street from the
original "Caledonia Place" subdivision located on this site. In addition, the "Energy Star"
standards of construction will be a key to our approach to the quality of the end product.
The character study provided indicates a reference to the desired roof forms and front
porch design approach. We are asking for a reduced density for the residential portion of
the site from 12 units/ac to 6.5 units/ ac. We have also requested to allow "Duplexes" in
the MU-R zone, Section 17.14.050, Table 1. This allows a more compatible residential
character for the existing neighborhood to the South.

LANDSCAPE AND SITE PARKING
The landscape plan has incorporated the existing healthy mature trees on the site, the
majority of which are on the NW corner. This allows for a great starting point for the park
like pedestrian/bikeway that moves across the site from West to East, providing a visual
buffer from the residential neighborhood to the commercial/retail area.

The parking plan provides more parking than required for the residential and commercial
areas of the development. In addition, we have provided bike parking areas within the
commercial parking lots to encourage the connection to the bikeway user.

                          1.0      Introduction
                                   Eastpark Associates is proposing to redevelop the southwest corner
                                   of SH 42 / South Boulder Road in Louisville (see Figure 1). The site
                                   has some existing businesses, some of which will remain. The new
                                   development will include additional retail and residential uses. This
                                   study has been prepared in conformance with Colorado Department
                                   of Transportation requirements for traffic studies1.
                                   Questions posed by the City that are answered in the study include:
                                   x      Should the alley bordering the south side of the site be closed or
                                          made one-way? If it is made one-way, which direction should the
                                          traffic flow? (see Section 2.2)
                                   x      What are the 95th percentile queues for the left turn bays? (see
                                          Sections 4.3, 6.5, and 7.3)
                                   x      How much development traffic will use Front Street and Griffith
                                          Street? (see Section 5.2)
                                   x      Is an eastbound right turn lane necessary at SH 42 / South
                                          Boulder Road? (see Section 7.4)
                                   x      How will signal progression on SH 42 be impacted by the new
                                          signal in the short term and long term? (see Section 8.0)

                                   auxiliary lanes south of the development site. The speed limit is 45
                                   MPH in the vicinity of the site.
                                   South Boulder Road a four lane east / west major arterial street with
                                   auxiliary lanes at intersections. It is owned and operated by the City.
                                   The signalized intersection at SH 42 is owned by CDOT and
                                   maintained by the City. The speed limit is 35 MPH in the vicinity of
                                   the site.
                                   Several accesses are proposed to the site including:
                                   x      Full movement access to South Boulder Road, SH 42, and Front
                                          Street are proposed. The intersection on SH 42 will warrant
                                          signalization at the completion of the development.
                                   x      Right-in / right-out access is proposed on South Boulder Road and
                                          SH 42.
                                   Recommendation. Right turn deceleration and acceleration lanes
                                   are not necessary at the South Boulder Road accesses because
                                   turning volumes are not expected to be high enough to warrant them.
                                   On SH 42, it is not feasible to construct right turn acceleration and
                                   deceleration lanes because of the existing land uses on the west side
                                   of the corridor and the Boulder County Open Space on the east side.
                                   Left turn deceleration lanes are necessary at the full movement
                                   intersections.
                                   An alley exists north of Harper Street and south of the Coal Creek
                                   Station development. The new signalized intersection that will provide
                                   access to the development will be less than 50' from the alley. The
                                   alley provides access to 12 properties which all have access to
                                   Harper Street. Volumes in the alley from the properties are extremely
                                   low. There are four options for access to the alley from SH 42
                                   including:
                                   x      Close the Alley at SH 42. If the alley is closed at SH 42, the only
                                          access would be at Front Street and Cannon Circle (as shown in
                                          the site plan). Closing the alley would eliminate the possibility that
                                          it would be used as a cut through to avoid the signalized
                                          intersection.
                                   x      Right-in / Right-out at SH 42. Limiting the alley to right-in / right-
                                          out at SH 42 could result in cut through traffic to avoid the new

Louisville, Colorado                                                                                May 17, 2013

                                          signalized intersection. This option would result in the highest
                                          number of conflicts with traffic on SH 42.
                                   x      One-Way Eastbound. Making the alley one-way eastbound at
                                          SH 42 would result in traffic from the alley entering SH 42.
                                          Motorists would be restricted to the eastbound to southbound right
                                          turn movement which would limit the number of conflicts with
                                          traffic on SH 42. Cut through traffic is a possibility to avoid the
                                          signalized intersection.
                                   x      One-Way Westbound. Making the alley one-way westbound at
                                          SH 42 would result in traffic turning from SH 42 into the alley. In
                                          this situation, turning movements would be restricted to the
                                          southbound to westbound right turn. Cut through traffic is a
                                          possibility, but not as likely as it would be if the alley is limited to
                                          westbound traffic.
                                   Recommendation. Given these options, STS recommends that the
                                   alley be closed at SH 42 to minimize conflicts with traffic on this high
                                   speed major arterial. Access to the alley would be at Front Street and
                                   Cannon Circle as shown in the site plan.
                          2.3      Study Assumptions
                                   The following assumptions were utilized for this study.
                                   x      Short Term Horizon. The study assumes that the development
                                          will be completed in one phase by 2015.
                                   x      Long Term Horizon. The long term horizon is assumed to be
                                          2035 to coincide with the current DRCOG planning model.
                                   x      Peak Hour to Daily Ratio. The current peak-hour-to-daily ratio at
                                          SH 42 / South Boulder Road ranges from 4% to 7% depending on
                                          the leg and peak hour. These ratios were assumed for the Year
                                          2015 and Year 2035 horizons. A low peak hour to daily ratio (4%)
                                          says that traffic volumes are similar, by approach, throughout the
                                          day. That's not uncommon on busy corridors that have regional
                                          significance.
                                   x      Saturation Flow Rate. The saturation flow rate was assumed to
                                          be 1,900 passenger vehicles / hour / lane which is the default
                                          value in Synchro.
                                   x      Peak Hour Factor. The peak hour factor for the existing traffic
                                          was used for the analysis of the existing and Year 2015 traffic. A
                                          peak hour factor of 0.92 was assumed for the Year 2035 analysis.
                                   x      Truck Percentage. The percentage of trucks was assumed to be
                                          5%.
                          3.0      Corridor Access
                                   Sustainable Traffic Solutions, Inc. (STS) performed a traffic study for

                                   signalized access on SH 42 is feasible based on the existing access
                                   control plan and the CDOT access code requirements. A summary of
                                   the access on the corridor is contained in Figure 3 and the letter
                                   report is contained in Appendix A.
                          4.0      Existing Conditions
                          4.1      Existing Traffic Volumes
                                   Traffic count, classification, and speed data were collected by Navjoy
                                   Consulting Services on Thursday December 2, 2010. In anticipation
                                   of future turn restrictions at SH 42 / Harper Street and SH 42 / Griffith
                                   Street, morning and evening peak hour counts were collected at these
                                   intersections in November 2012. A summary of the data is contained
                                   in Figure 4 and the raw data are contained in Appendix B.
                          4.2      Level of Service Analysis
                                   To evaluate the performance of the intersections within the study
                                   area, the Level of Service (LOS) was calculated using Synchro
                                   software. This software package utilizes criteria described in the
                                   Highway Capacity Manual3. LOS is a measure used to describe
                                   operational conditions at an intersection. LOS categories ranging
                                   from A to F are assigned based on the predicted delay in seconds per
                                   vehicle for the intersection as a whole, as well as for individual turning
                                   movements. LOS A indicates very good operations, and LOS F
                                   indicates poor, congested operations. Acceptable intersection
                                   operation in urban areas is typically considered LOS D or better.
                                   Analysis Results. The analysis shows that the intersection of SH 42
                                   / South Boulder Road operates at LOS C during the morning and
                                   evening peak hours. Appendix C contains the LOS analysis
                                   worksheets.
                          4.3      Existing Queue Lengths
                                   The queue lengths for the existing peak hours were estimated based
                                   on analysis performed using SimTraffic and are summarized in the
                                   following table. SimTraffic output is contained in Appendix C.
                                   Analysis Results. The analysis shows that there is sufficient
                                   capacity to accommodate the existing traffic volumes.

                          5.2      Trip Distribution and Assignment
                                   The trip distribution for the development area was assumed based on
                                   the existing traffic patterns. Figure 5 contains the distribution for the
                                   development and the assignment is contained in Figure 6.
                                   The amount of traffic from the development that will use Front Street
                                   and Griffith Street south of the development is expected to be
                                   minimal. This assumption is based on the fact that the development
                                   is bounded by two major arterials and has a signalized access to one
                                   of them. In addition, there are very few destinations in downtown
                                   Louisville as compared with the many destinations along South
                                   Boulder Road and SH 42.

                          6.1      Background and Total Volumes
                                   The projected daily volumes at the completion of the project were
                                   developed assuming a straight line increase from Year 2010 volumes
                                   to Year 2035 volumes. Year 2035 daily volumes were provided by
                                   DRCOG and are contained in Appendix B. Background daily and
                                   peak hour volumes assuming no development on the site are
                                   contained in Figure 7 and total volumes assuming the development of
                                   the site are contained in Figure 8.
                          6.2      Traffic Signal Warrant at SH 42 / Cannon Circle
                                   A signal warrant study was conducted at SH 42 / Cannon Circle
                                   based on the requirements contained in the MUTCD5. The data
                                   available only allowed STS to evaluate the peak hour warrant. The
                                   criteria used to evaluate the warrant included the following:
                                   x      Intersection Geometry. SH 42 was evaluated assuming one
                                          lane in each direction. While there are two through lanes on the
                                          southbound approach to the intersection, the curbside lane
                                          transitions into a right turn lane at Harper Street making the
                                          effective laneage on the approach one through lane and one right
                                          turn lane. On the side street, only the left turns were included in
                                          the warrant study.
                                   x      Main Street Speeds. The 85th percentile speeds collected on SH
                                          42 are above 40 MPH requiring the use of Figure 4C-4 for the
                                          evaluation.
                                   Analysis Results. Figure 9 contains the evaluation of the warrant
                                   showing that a signal will be warranted during the evening peak hour
                                   at the completion of the development.
                          6.3      Need for a Southbound Right Turn Lane at Cannon Circle
                                   The CDOT access code requires that a southbound right turn lane be
                                   constructed at Cannon Circle, however, the existing development on

                                   A Synchro analysis was used to determine the benefit of an
                                   eastbound right turn lane at SH 42 / South Boulder Road. The
                                   analysis shows that the addition of an eastbound right turn lane would
                                   provide very little benefit to the intersection or any of the approaches.
                                   Analysis Results. An eastbound right turn lane should not be
                                   constructed at the intersection.

                                   assumed for the Year 2015 analysis, and the signals shown in Figure

                                   expected to operate at LOS C during all peak hours analyzed.
                                   The progression study was conducted to verify that CDOT criteria can
                                   be met for this NR-A roadway. The CDOT access code requires 35%
                                   bandwidth efficiency on an NR-A roadway when signals are not
                                   spaced at ½ mile intervals. The access code also requires that the
                                   side street splits are long enough to accommodate pedestrians
                                   crossing the main street. Appropriate pedestrian clearance time was
                                   assumed for all signals.
                                   Analysis Results. The following table demonstrates that the required
                                   minimum 35% bandwidth efficiency can be obtained in 2015 and 2035
                                   with the signal at the Coal Creek Station access. Time-space

                                   STS has drawn the following conclusions based on the analysis
                                   performed and documented in this report.
                                   x      Acceleration and Deceleration Lanes at Site Accesses. Right
                                          turn deceleration or acceleration lanes are not necessary at the
                                          South Boulder Road accesses because turning volumes are not
                                          expected to be high enough to warrant them. On SH 42, it is not
                                          feasible to construct right turn acceleration and deceleration lanes
                                          because of the existing land use on the west side of the corridor
                                          and the Boulder County Open Space on the east side. Left turn
                                          deceleration lanes are necessary at the full movement
                                          intersections.
                                   x      Signalization of SH 42 / Cannon Circle. This intersection will
                                          warrant signalization as a result of this development.

                                   x      Intersection Operation. All of the intersections are expected to
                                          operate at LOS D or better when the development is complete.

                                   x      Turn Bay Lengths. The existing turn bay lengths at SH 42 /
                                          South Boulder Road are expected to be long enough to
                                          accommodate the Year 2035 total traffic volumes.

RE: Signalized Access to the Property on the Southwest Corner of SH 42 / South Boulder Road and
Modification of the SH 42 Access Control Plan


Dear Bonnie:

Based on your request, Sustainable Traffic Solutions has evaluated the potential to create a signalized
access on SH 42 for the southwest corner of SH 42 / South Boulder Road. This corner is partially
developed with space for more development. The existing development functionally has full movement
access; however, the volume of traffic on the corridors limits this access to right-in / right-out during the
peak hours.

The signalized access would serve an area that is bounded by South Boulder road on the north, an alley
north of Harper Street on the south, SH 42 on the east, and the railroad on the west. The existing
businesses on this corner could utilize the new signalized access and abandon their current accesses on
SH 42.

An access control plan (ACP) for the corridor exists in an IGA between the City of Louisville, Boulder
                   1
County, and CDOT . The accesses in the ACP that are proposed to be modified by this study are
summarized in the following table (see Figure 1).

             Intersection                        Current ACP                          Proposed Access
    Cannon Circle (west side,
    public street 400 feet south     Right-in / Right-out                    Access to be eliminated
    of South Boulder Road
    Commercial Access (west
    side 440' to 540' south of       Access does not exist                   Signalized
    South Boulder Road)
    Griffith Street                  Signalized                              ¾-Turn

    Short Street ­ west side         Right-in / Right-out                    Signalized

The City recently contracted with Carter-Burgess to study the corridor2. The resulting study
recommended a ¾-turn access at Cannon Circle; however, the City has determined that the ¾-turn
access is making the property difficult to develop with businesses that generate significant sales tax
revenue. A signalized intersection on SH 42 will be much more attractive to potential developers.
Therefore, this study was performed to determine if it is possible to signalize a site access on SH 42.

Based on discussions with Gloria Hice-Idler, CDOT Region 4 Access Coordinator, the study will need to
demonstrate that the potential development will warrant a traffic signal on SH 42 and that corridor
progression can be maintained to 35% efficiency as required for an NR-A roadway under the current
CDOT access code3.

Study Assumptions
The following assumptions were utilized for this study.
    x    Peak Hour to Daily Ratio. The peak hour to daily ratio was assumed to be 8% for the Year 2030
         morning and evening peak hours.
    x    Saturation Flow Rate. The saturation flow rate was assumed to be 1,900 passenger vehicles /
         hour / lane which is the default value in Synchro.
    x    Peak Hour Factor. The peak hour factor was assumed to be 0.92 for all movements.
    x    Truck Percentage. The percentage of trucks was assumed to be 2%.
    x    Left Turn Phasing on SH 42. The signal phasing was assumed to be protected / permitted for
         single left turns that are leading. Protected left turn phasing was assumed for dual left turns and
         lagging left turns.

Trip Generation for the Corner
A trip generation estimate was prepared for the southwest corner of the intersection and is contained in
the table below. The components of the mixed use commercial development have not been defined, so
the trip generation rate for a shopping center was assumed since it contains a mix of commercial and
retail uses.

Year 2030 Volumes, Signal Warrant, Intersection Operation, and Corridor
Progression
The projected peak hour volumes for SH 42 / South Boulder Road were developed based on procedures
contained in NCHRP 2554 (see Figure 2). The peak hour volumes for this intersection and the projected
side street and main street turning volumes along the corridor contained in the Carter-Burgess study were
used to develop volume scenarios for the corridor. These volume scenarios were analyzed to estimate
the intersection operation and corridor progression.

Figure 1 also contains the assignment for the development on the southwest corner. The assignment
shows that a signal will be warranted based on the MUTCD during the evening peak hour of an average
weekday5.

The expected peak hour intersection operation in Year 2030 was estimated using Synchro software and
is summarized in the table below. This software package utilizes criteria described in the Highway
Capacity Manual6. Level of service (LOS) is a measure used to describe operational conditions at an
intersection. LOS categories ranging from A to F are assigned based on the predicted delay in seconds
per vehicle for the intersection as a whole, as well as for individual turning movements. LOS A indicates
very good operations, and LOS F indicates poor, congested operations. Acceptable intersection
operation in urban areas is typically considered LOS D or better. The analysis summary for each
intersection is attached.

The progression during the Year 2030 weekday peak hours was also estimated using Synchro software.
SH 42 is classified by CDOT an NR-A roadway. The CDOT access code requires 35% bandwidth
efficiency on an NR-A roadway when signals are not spaced at ½ mile intervals. Time-space diagrams
are attached for both peak hours to demonstrate the bandwidth efficiency. The following table
demonstrates that the bandwidth efficiency can be obtained with the proposed signal locations.

Conclusion
Sustainable Traffic Solutions, Inc. has studied the SH 42 corridor to determine if the 1991 access control
plan can be amended to include signalized intersections at a new commercial access 440' to 540' south
of South Boulder Road and at Short Street. Based on the analysis presented in this report:
    x A traffic signal is expected to be warranted at the new commercial access.
    x All of the signalized intersections are expected to operate at LOS D or better in Year 2030.
    x A minimum progression efficiency of 35% is expected to be obtained in Year 2030 with the
        proposed signal locations.

Therefore, the proposed signalized intersection locations should be acceptable to CDOT allowing the
ACP to be modified.

Dear Mr. Henderson:

Per your request, below are the existing and future forecasted traffic volumes at South Boulder Road
and SH-42 (96th Street):




Sustainable Traffic Solutions provided the existing traffic volumes and the future estimated volumes
were from the adopted 2035 RTP fiscally constrained model travel network. The National Cooperative
Highway Research Report Procedure, Report #255 was used as a guide in preparing the 2035
forecast on the requested links. The average weekday traffic excludes holidays, special events, and
weekend traffic.

A fee of $112.50 is charged for processing this data. An invoice is attached. Contact me should you
have any questions.

Thanks,

Lawrence N. Tilong
Transportation Planner

rather if the city received adequate public land dedication when it was platted. (see #4 of 16.16.060. I just read

A.
Whoever divides or participates in the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land into two or more lots, sites or
other divisions of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, whether
residential, industrial, office, business or other use, who desires to build a structure upon any tract of land which
has not been previously platted, shall make the transaction subject to the provisions of this title and a plat
therefor must be submitted to and accepted by the city according to the terms set forth in this title. The terms of
this title shall also include and refer to any division of land previously subdivided or platted.

       Is this proposed subdivision subject to the public land dedications per Chapter 16? I may have
       missed it but did not see it addressed in the plan set.

       Thanks,
       Peter

Re:   Public Land Dedication
      Agenda item Coal Creek Station Preliminary Plat and PUD


In the June 13th staff report provided to the Planning Commission regarding public land
dedication staff states that because the land was previously platted in 1890 "the public land
dedication requirement of LMC Section 16.16.060 does not apply". This is not accurate as
chapter 16 clearly requires this dedication (or cash in lieu) regardless of whether the property
in question had been previously patted/ subdivided or not. The only qualification is per
16.16.060 B (4) that allows Council to waive the requirement if it is demonstrated that
adequate public land dedications had been "made and approved by the city council at the time
of annexation or previous subdivision of the same property."

When I asked staff about this issue I was told that because there is a parks and open space
impact fee, which is charged at the time of building permit issuance, the public land dedication
requirement does not apply. However, this belief or viewpoint is not supported by our code.

The intent and application of our public land dedication not only affects this project but all
other current and future so called infill projects. Yet, broader concerns arise because it appears
staff has made a judgment based on their opinion of what city policy should be rather than
referring or providing an analysis and recommendation to the Planning Commission, City
Council (and the public) for debate discussion and final determination by City Council.
Therefore, I request Council consider the legislative intent of the public land dedication
requirement and impact fees. (I have understood that public land dedication is intended for
acquisition and the impact fees are for management and maintenance of those lands). If after
public debate and discussion Council agrees with staff's opinion then LMC 16.16.060 should be
amended to reflect the judgment of Council rather than simply ignoring this clearly stated code
requirement.

Thank you for considering this issue and concern.

For your convenience I have pasted in below the referenced sections of the LMC and I have
highlighted substantive sections for emphasis:

 Sec. 16.04.040. General regulations.

   A. Whoever divides or participates in the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land into two or more
       lots, sites or other divisions of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or
       building development, whether residential, industrial, office, business or other use, who desires to
       build a structure upon any tract of land which has not been previously platted, shall make the

                                                   275
       transaction subject to the provisions of this title and a plat therefor must be submitted to and
       accepted by the city according to the terms set forth in this title. The terms of this title shall also
       include and refer to any division of land previously subdivided or platted.
Sec. 16.16.060. Public sites and dedications.
   A. Dedications of rights-of-way for public streets, drainage easements, utility easements or other
       public purposes shall be required and shall be made by the subdivider on the plat unless
       otherwise directed by the city council.
   B. Public use dedications shall be as follows:
   1. A minimum of 12 percent for nonresidential subdivisions and a minimum of 15 percent for
       residential subdivisions of the total land area of the tract being subdivided shall be dedicated,
       exclusive of subsection A of this section, for park, school, or other public purposes as determined
       by the city council and shall be delineated on the final plat. Land dedicated for public use must be
       suitable, as determined by the planning commission, for the type of development and/or the use
       for which it is intended.
   2. If the city council so determines, the subdivider shall pay to the city in cash an amount equal to
       the applicable percentage established in subsection B.1 of this section of the total appraised
       value of the land to be subdivided in lieu of the dedication of land required in this section. Any
       appraisal required to establish the value of land in this section shall be done at the expense of the
       subdivider.
   3. In determining which of the above policies to implement, the planning commission and the city
       council will consider the size of the development and its adequacy for accommodating a suitable
       public use site; the community facility aspects of the comprehensive development plan and the
       school district's master plan; existing parks and other public uses in the area; the topography,
       geology, and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; the needs of the people
       in the area; and any other appropriate factors. If land is dedicated to the city, it shall be free of all
       liens and encumbrances.
   4. The requirements of the section shall not apply in cases where satisfactory dedication
       arrangements were made and approved by the city council at the time of annexation or previous
       subdivision of the same property.
   5. The increase in the dedication for residential subdivisions from 12 to 15 percent, as provided in
       subsection B.1 of this section, shall take effect on April 3, 1993, and shall apply to each
       subdivision, the final plat of which is not approved by the city council as of such date. Any
       subdivider with a subdivision application pending on April 3, 1993, who believes that application
       of the increase to such subdivision would be legally invalid may file with the city council a request
       for an exception from the increase provided in this section. The request shall fully set forth the
       reasons why the exception should be granted. The city council may grant the exception if it finds
       that application of such increase would be legally invalid under the facts presented.
   6. The size of dedication set forth in this section is designed and intended to reasonably relate to the
       needs created or contributed to by subdivision development within the city.

SUMMARY:
The applicant, Jim Loftus of Loftus Development Inc., has applied for a final planned
unit development (PUD), final plat, and special review use (SRU), to redevelop Tract I of
the Louisville North Subdivision located at 707 East South Boulder Road. The subject
property is located on the northwest corner of South Boulder Road and Centennial Drive
on the eastern half of the Village Square shopping center and is approximately 5.03
acres (219,258 SF) in size. The applicant proposes to remove the existing vacant
building and redevelop the site with two (2) buildings consisting of 36,000 square feet of
retail space including a community room, and three (3) buildings consisting of 111
apartment units over a 156 space underground parking structure. The applicant intends
to occupy the larger retail building with a 27,800 square foot Alfalfa's grocery store
which will include a 1,000 square foot community room.

The applicant also proposes to replat the property and dedicate new easements to the
City which will provide access to the gathering spaces and the planned utilities on the
site. The easements serving existing utilities are proposed to be vacated. The formal

SUBJECT:    SAFEWAY REDEVELOPMENT (ALFALFAS)

DATE:       JULY 2, 2013                                                     PAGE 2 OF 13

 vacation of these easements requires two readings of an ordinance by City Council.
 Ordinance No. 1635, Series 2013 is the first reading of this ordinance. If Council
 approves moving forward, the second reading of the ordinance would occur during the
 July 16, 2013 City Council meeting.

 The subject property is zoned Community
 Commercial (CC). The Louisville Municipal
 Code (LMC) establishes a wide range of
 commercial and retail uses that are
 permitted as a use by right and other
 residential uses that are permitted under
 special review in the CC zone district. The
 two proposed commercial buildings,
 totaling 36,000 SF, are permitted by right
 and the requested 111 multi-family
 residential units may be permitted under
 special review. Special Review Uses
 (SRU) are allowed uses which require
 special examination to ensure the project's
 compatibility with its surrounding physical and economic environment.

 The site currently contains a vacant 54,000 SF building which was the former location of
 the Safeway Grocery store. Safeway closed in the spring of 2010 and the building at
 707 East South Boulder Road has remained vacant. The property to the west contains a
 strip retail shopping center including Walgreens, a bank and other commercial tenants,
 Ralphie's, and other retail tenants (The western portion of the shopping center is not a
 part of the application). The Portal Apartments, a three story apartment complex
 consisting of three buildings, is located to the west of the strip retail center.

 The Village Condominiums, a six building multi-family complex is located immediately to
 the north of the subject property. The Louisville North Subdivision containing single
 family homes is located further to the North. The Scenic Heights single family
 residential subdivision sits to the south of the property across South Boulder Road.
 Three commercial buildings including a bank, a medical office building, and a school, all
 of which are also zoned CC, are located across Centennial Drive to the east of the
 property.

 PRELIMINARY REVIEW:
 On November 20, 2012 City Council reviewed a request for a Preliminary PUD and
 Special Review Use permit for the subject site. The preliminary review process
 examined big picture site planning issues such as building location, drainage, and the
 specific impacts of the residential use. The City Council approved the preliminary
 submittal and the residential special review use, pending the final design components of
 the PUD. The approval had three conditions:

    1) The applicant provides the City an updated shared parking agreement for the
       shopping center with all affected parties
    2) The applicant creates a shared parking management program that will ensure
       the residential portion of the parking can achieve a 2 spaces per unit ratio
       between the hours of 8 pm and 8 am
    3) The applicant resolves shadowing concerns with existing surrounding structures.

 The applicant satisfied the first condition by providing an amended parking agreement
 for the center that allows visitors to the proposed development to park anywhere in the
 Village Square Shopping Center. Similarly, anyone visiting the businesses on the site
 would be able to use the surface parking planned as part of the proposed development.
 Details demonstrating compliance with the second and third condition are included in
 the remainder of this report.

 The final planned unit development and final plat process focuses on architectural
 details, landscaping specifics, drainage detailing, and internal roadway design. The
 review that follows focuses on these final design elements of the project. If approved by
 City Council, the applicant may proceed to the building permit process to begin
 construction of the project.

 PROPOSAL:
 Overview
 As noted above, the applicant proposes to redevelop the vacant former Safeway site
 with five (5) new structures containing 111 apartment units and a total of 36,000 square
 feet of retail space including a 1,000 square foot community room. The former Safeway
 grocery store would be removed. The plan includes a total of 146,100 square feet of
 development on the approximately 219,000 square foot site. The following table
 summarizes key aspects of the proposed development.

 If approved, the proposal would locate the 111 residential units on the back (northern)
 half of the property in three buildings (Buildings C, D, and E) above a shared 156 space
 underground parking garage. The buildings would be grouped together around a
 central courtyard and buildings D and E would be connected by a three story primarily
 glass walkway. Each of the buildings would be three stories and 40 feet tall as
 measured to the top of parapet wall. There would be an entry element on building C
 that is 45 feet tall, a pop out on building D that is 41 feet 6 inches tall, and a cupola on
 building E which would extend to 48 feet tall. The average floor plate of these buildings
 would be 13,000 square feet.

 Buildings A and B would contain 36,000 square feet of retail development and a
 community room and be located on the front (southern) half of the property. Building A
 would include 27,800 square feet of retail space including the 1,000 square foot
 community room. The structure would be located on the southeast corner of the
 property adjacent to the South Boulder Road and Centennial Drive intersection. This
 building would be the location of a proposed Alfalfas grocery store. Building B would
 contain 8,200 square feet of retail space separated into four tenant spaces. The two
 retail buildings would be situated around a public plaza and outdoor dining and event
 area and would be served by a surface parking lot on the interior of the site.
                                          Site Layout




 Access and Circulation
 The applicant proposes to use two access points to serve the site. The first of these
 access points is located on South Boulder Road (Across from Jefferson Avenue) and
 would serve as the "entry drive" to the site. After entering the site, the entry drive would
 continue to the north where it intersects another east/west access drive. The entry drive
 would provide access to 115 new retail surface parking spaces and the existing surface
 parking lot located to the west of the property. A third lane would be added at the entry
 drive access point to provide an exclusive southbound right-turn lane exiting the site.

DATE:         JULY 2, 2013                                                      PAGE 5 OF 13

 Although the traffic study demonstrated the current roadways can functionally
 accommodate the proposed development, there is potential that future development on
 the adjacent property may warrant a west bound right turn deceleration lane on South
 Boulder Road. To address this concern, the applicant proposes to dedicate to the City
 the Right-of-Way along South Boulder Road to accommodate the deceleration lane
 should future conditions warrant its construction. This Right-of-Way is shown as "Outlot
 A" on the final plat.

 The second access point to the site would be from Centennial Drive and is proposed to
 be a two lane drive. The Centennial Drive access point would lead to an "East-West
 Drive" that provides access to the main surface parking lot and eighteen (18) on-street
 diagonal parking spaces in front of the residential structures.

 The existing service drive on the north end of the property would be removed from its
 current location. Although the area north of the residential structures would be closed to
 vehicles, it is designed in a manner that would enable fire trucks to access the north
 side of the buildings in a fire or emergency situation. The proposed design of this area
 includes two four foot wide concrete strips separate by ornamental grasses. These
 concrete strips would be used as sidewalks, but in the event of an emergency they
 could be used by a fire truck to gain access to the rear of the buildings. The landscape
 plan for this area also includes an area for a fire truck to set up its outriggers to fight a
 fire, and introduces new trees to provide a buffer from the residences to the north.

 The service drive would be relocated to the western side of the residential buildings,
 and provide access to the parking structure beneath the residential building. The
 relocated service drive would also connect to the service area behind the existing
 Walgreens and the rest of the shopping center to the west. The service drive would
 have seven (7) on street parking spaces.

 Traffic Impacts
 Fox Tuttle Transportation Group completed a study to assess the impacts to traffic from
 the proposed development. The study demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Louisville
 Public Works Department, the existing roadways and intersections surrounding the
 proposed development have sufficient capacity to function effectively if the development
 is approved.

 Parking
 The proposal includes 296 new on-site parking spaces. 156 of these spaces would be
 located in the parking structure beneath buildings C, D, and E and would be for the
 exclusive use of the apartment building residents. 140 surface parking spaces would be
 located on the interior of the site. Of these 140 spaces, 25 would be used by the
 residents, and 115 are proposed for the retail uses. The following table summarizes the
 proposed on-site parking.

 The proposal includes 17 on-street parallel parking spaces on the west side of
 Centennial Drive. Although these parking spaces would not be credited as on-site
 parking by the LMC, they would help address the parking needs of the project.

 The existing shopping center (including Safeway, Walgreens, the bank, and strip retail
 center) currently operates under a shared parking agreement. Visitors to and
 employees of any of the existing businesses can park on any of the surface parking in
 the shopping center. The proposed development would continue to use a shared
 parking arrangement for the entire center. Visitors to any of the new retail space
 proposed would be able to park anywhere in the shopping center. Similarly, anyone
 visiting the businesses currently operating on the site would be able to use the planned
 surface parking. Parking for the new residences would be accommodated in the garage
 or in designated spaces adjacent to the residential buildings. The following table
 summarizes the shared parking scenario proposed for the entire shopping center.

SUBJECT:    SAFEWAY REDEVELOPMENT (ALFALFAS)

DATE:       JULY 2, 2013                                                     PAGE 7 OF 13


 The totals in this table do not include the 17 on-street parking spaces on Centennial
 Drive. When the shared parking agreement is considered, the retail parking provided
 would exceed the required amount by 28 spaces. The 181 residential parking spaces
 proposed would be 41 spaces less than the 222 spaces required by the LMC. At
 preliminary review, this deficiency was addressed by conditioning approval on the
 applicant creating a shared parking management program that ensures the residential
 portion of the parking could achieve a ratio of 2 spaces per unit between the hours of 8
 pm and 8 am. This condition was based on the premise that the peak hours of
 operation for a grocery store are between 8 am and 8 pm. During these hours, the
 grocery store would need the majority of the parking lot. After 8 pm, retail usage of the
 parking lot would decline, and the residents could use the vacant spaces.

 The PUD includes a note indicating 41 of the retail spaces must be labeled with signage
 permitting overnight residential parking from 8pm to 8am. If these 41 spaces are
 included in the residential total (181 full time spaces plus 41 spaces between 8 pm and
 8am = 222 spaces), there would be 2 spaces for every residential unit between 8 pm
 and 8 am (222 spaces/111 units = 2 spaces/unit). Staff believes this solution satisfies
 the condition of approval.

 Pedestrian and Bicycle Enhancements
 The proposal includes adding an eight-foot detached multi-use path o the north side of
 South Boulder Road that is designed to incorporate bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This
 multi-use path would be separated from the roadway by an eight-foot tree lawn. The
 existing mature deciduous trees would be maintained within this tree lawn.

 A detached five-foot sidewalk would be added adjacent to the property on Centennial
 Drive. This sidewalk would replace the existing four foot sidewalk and be separated
 from Centennial Drive by a landscaped tree lawn. Designated on-street parallel parking
 on Centennial Drive would provide an additional buffer between pedestrians and traffic.

 The interior of the site would incorporate a six-foot sidewalk on the south side of the
 residential buildings and a plaza area in front of and between the two retail buildings.
 The intersections would include crossings with accented paving and bulb out sidewalks
 to identify pedestrian crossings, make pedestrians more visible to motorists, and reduce
 street crossing distances. The plaza planned between the two retail buildings would
 provide direct pedestrian access to the interior of the site from the South Boulder Road
 multi-use path, and would be covered with an access easement, to enable public
 access to the area.

 The site plan includes 18 bicycle parking spaces. Six are located on the west side of
 building A, six on the north side of building B, and six on the west side of building D.

 Building Massing and Architecture
 Building A
 The proposal indicates Building A would be located on the southeast corner of the site
 at the South Boulder Road and Centennial Drive intersection. Building A would be
 27,800 square feet in total and would be the home of the Alfalfas grocery store and a
 1,000 square foot community room located in the building on a second story mezzanine.
 The entrance to Building A would be on the west side of the structure adjacent to the
 surface parking lot and be covered by a bowstring truss. The bowstring feature would
 be repeated on the eastern façade of the building in the form of an arched masonry
 element.

 Loading, deliveries, and storage would occur on the north end of the building. To
 conceal loading and warehousing activities, the northern half of the eastern façade of
 the building would not have windows. Recessed art panels consisting of different
 materials and colors, along with lighting, would be used to activate this space at the
 pedestrian level. Building A would be constructed of brick, glass, and steel and range
 in height from 23 feet to just over 35 feet tall. The southeast corner of the building would
 include a 35 foot glass tower element enclosing a staircase and elevator to the
 mezzanine level of the building.

 Building B
 Building B would be located to the west of Building A adjacent to South Boulder Road
 and just to the south of the surface parking lot. This building would be one story and
 include 8,200 square feet of space expected to contain four retail tenants. The main
 portion of the building would be 24 feet tall with chimney elements extending to 28 feet
 tall. The building would be constructed of wood with metal roofed dormers and have
 decorative brick on the chimneys. The eaves of the building would be supported by
 wood columns, and overhang outdoor seating areas on the east and west sides of the
 building. These outdoor seating areas would be accessible from the multi-use path on
 South Boulder road.

 Buildings C, D, & E
 Buildings C, D, & E would be located on the (back) northern half of the property and be
 constructed on top of a 156 space underground parking structure. The three buildings
 would include a total of 111 residential units. The three building concept was devised
 by the applicant to help break up the massing of the site and design structures of a
 scale that would be more compatible with those found in the surrounding neighborhood.
 The residential buildings would be organized around a central 10,000 square foot
 courtyard space and have an average floor plate of 13,000 square feet. Building C

 would be constructed of brick with masonry base and concrete trim. Buildings D and E
 would be constructed with wood composite siding and stucco trim.

 The front (southern) side of Building C would face the interior surface parking lot and
 the east end of the building would be adjacent to Centennial Drive. Building C would
 total 38,100 square feet and contain 37 residential units. The southern elevation of the
 building adjacent to the parking lot would be 184 feet wide and the eastern elevation
 would be 84 feet wide. The majority of Building C would be 40 feet tall while certain
 elements of the building would extend to 43 feet tall. The eastern end of Building C
 would be setback a minimum of 20 feet and a maximum of 70 feet from the eastern
 property line. Building C would have a 13,500 square foot floor plate

 Building D would be located on the northwest corner of the site adjacent to the relocated
 service drive and the existing Walgreens. The three story building would have a total of
 43,500 square feet and include 44 residential units. The entrance to the parking
 structure would be on the western side of the building. Building D would be between
 40 and 42 feet tall, and have a 15,000 square foot floor plate.

 Building E would be connected to Building D by way of a three story bridge constructed
 mainly of glass. Building E would be the smallest of the three residential structures,
 containing 30 units in a 28,500 square foot structure. The majority of Building E would
 be between 40 and 42 feet tall. There would also be a 48 foot tall cupola on the
 northeast corner of the building. Building E would have a 10,500 square foot floor plate.

 Drainage
 The proposal indicates drainage for the site would be accommodated in two detention
 facilities. One detention pond would be located on the southeast corner of the site at
 the corner of South Boulder Road and Centennial drive. The other detention pond
 would be located on the eastside of Building C on the northeast corner of the site.

 Shadows
 The third condition of approval from the preliminary review required the applicant to
 resolve shadowing concerns with existing surrounding structures. At preliminary review,
 the proposed setback for Building E was 25 feet from the rear property line. To address
 the condition, the proposed setback for Building E is 30 feet from the rear property line.

 The applicant also completed a detailed shadow analysis to better understand
 shadowing impacts on the surrounding properties (see attachment 3). The shadow
 exhibit demonstrates that on the darkest day of the year, building E would cast a 14 foot
 tall shadow on the residential building to the north. The LMC permits a residential
 building to be 35 feet tall in the location where building E is proposed. Attachment 3
 also demonstrates the shadow impacts of a 35 foot tall building in the same location that
 Building E is proposed. The shadow cast by the proposed building E is seven feet taller

 than the seven foot shadow that would be cast by a 35 foot tall building in the same
 location where building E is proposed.

 Although the exhibit shows the impacts of the proposed Building E as compared to a 35
 foot tall structure located where building E is proposed (30 feet from the rear property
 line), it is important to note the Commercial Development Design Standards and
 Guidelines would permit a 42 foot tall commercial structure to be located within 10 feet
 of the rear property line in this location. The shadowing impacts of a commercial
 structure of this size located 10 feet from the rear property line would be far greater than
 those shown in the exhibit.

 Signs
 The applicant proposes a mix of wall, monument, and banner signs on the site. The
 following is an overview of the different sign types in the development.

 Wall signs
 The Commercial Development Design Standards and Guidelines (CDDSG) permits one
 wall sign per frontage, not to exceed three signs per tenant. Building A has three
 frontages (South Boulder Rd., Centennial Dr., and the parking area to the west), and
 therefore is permitted a total of three wall signs. The CDDSG also permits one square
 foot of wall sign per linear foot of building frontage. The linear footage of the three
 frontages totals 505 feet, and therefore the building is entitled to 505 square feet of
 signs. The applicant proposes a total of three "Alfalfas" wall signs located on the east,
 west, and south elevations that are each 63 square feet with two foot tall letters.
 Building B, with four tenants, would have four wall signs on the north elevation and four
 on the south elevation. These signs are 28 square feet and meet the requirements on
 the CDDSG.

 Banners
 The LMC also permits a property to have 40 square feet of banner signs which are
 allowed to be in place for no more than two 30 day periods in any one calendar year.
 The proposed sign plan in the PUD modifies this requirement by permitting the excess
 square footage not used for wall signs on Building A to be used for banners on the
 building. The PUD would allow three banners to advertise private events for no more
 60 total days in one year, and enable longer periods of time to be approved by the City
 for City sponsored events. There are two banners shown on the western elevation of
 Building A which total 303 square feet. As proposed, these banners could advertise
 private events for a total of 60 days per year, and also could be used for longer periods
 of time to announce City sponsored events.

 Monument signs
 Three monument signs are proposed on the site plan. One would be located at the
 South Boulder Road entrance, one located on the corner of South Boulder Road and
 Centennial Drive, and one at the Centennial Drive entrance. As proposed, these
 monument signs would meet the requirements of the CDDSG.


 FISCAL IMPACT:
 The applicant's analysis, which they submitted during preliminary review and which is
 based on the City's fiscal model, suggests the overall fiscal impact of the proposed
 development would likely be positive. This fiscal analysis concludes that initial City
 expenditures associated with providing City services to the proposed development
 would exceed the initial revenue to the City created by the development, resulting in a
 onetime negative fiscal impact to the City of approximately $460,000. However, the
 analysis also indicates that the annual revenue to the City from the proposed
 development would exceed annual expenditures by approximately $111,000. The
 analysis also indicates the project would contribute $134,000 annually to the Historic
 Preservation and Open Space and Parks Funds. If the project generates these
 revenues, it would take two years of operation to offset the initial onetime negative fiscal
 impact.

 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:
 The Planning Commission held a public hearing on June 13, 2013 to consider the
 applicant's proposal, and unanimously (6-0) passed a resolution recommending
 approval of the Final PUD. The Planning Commission Resolution includes five
 conditions of approval. The applicant was to address each of these conditions prior to
 the City Council hearing, and staff finds the applicant has addressed each of them
 satisfactorily. The following is a list of the Planning Commission's conditions and staff's
 analysis of each item:

            1. Prior to City Council, the change panel sign shown on the western façade of
               the building be removed from the sign plan and the following text will be
               added: Total square footage of wall and banner signs allowed is 505 SF".

           Staff Analysis: The applicant has revised their sign plan removing the
           change panel sign and replacing it with a temporary banner. The size of
           the wall signs have been reduced, resulting in a sign plan that meets the
           requirements of the CDDSG, and the specification listed on the PUD.
           Staff finds the applicant has complied with Planning Commission's
           condition of approval.
        2. Prior to City Council review, the Parking note on the cover will be amended to
           read as follows;

              spaces/unit available in the parking structure and surface
              spaces. In the retail parking lot, 41 spaces shall be labeled
              with signage permitting overnight residential parking from
              8:00 PM to 8:00 AM (Off-hours for retail building). This
              overnight residential parking ratio of 2.0 spaces/unit is a
              requirement of this PUD and may not be eliminated,
              reduced, or otherwise changed without first obtaining City
              approval of a PUD amendment."

           Staff Analysis: The note on the cover sheet has been
           amended to meet this condition.
        3. Prior to City Council review, the phrase "the owners interests are
           vacated by this document" will be removed from the 8 foot wide utility
           easement and the access easement agreement on sheet 3 of the final
           plat, and replaced with the phrase "to be vacated by separate
           instrument". Prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant will
           provide copies of the documents vacating these easements.

           Staff Analysis: The phrase "the owners interests are vacated by this
           document" has been removed from the 8 foot wide utility easement
           and the access easement agreement on sheet 3 of the final plat, and
           has been replaced with the phrase "to be vacated by separate
           instrument". Prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant will
           have to provide copies of the documents vacating these easements.
           This condition has been carried forward in staff's recommended motion
           for council.

        4. Prior to City Council review, the building heights for buildings B and C on the
           cover sheet will be changed to match those shown on sheets A2.2 and A2.3

           Staff Analysis: The heights of buildings B and C listed on the cover sheet
           have been changed to match building heights shown on sheets A2.2 and
           A2.3.

       2. Prior to City Council review, the Parking note on the cover will be amended to
          read as follows;
              "The base ratio of residential parking spaces is 1.65 spaces/unit
              available in the parking structure and surface spaces. In the retail
              parking lot, 41 spaces shall be labeled with signage permitting
              overnight residential parking from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM (Off-hours
              for retail building). This overnight residential parking ratio of 2.0
              spaces/unit is a requirement of this PUD and may not be
              eliminated, reduced, or otherwise changed without first obtaining
              City approval of a PUD amendment."

       3. Prior to City Council review, the phrase "the owners interests are
          vacated by this document" will be removed from the 8 foot wide utility
          easement and the access easement agreement on sheet 3 of the final
          plat, and replaced with the phrase "to be vacated by separate
          instrument". Prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant will
          provide copies of the documents vacating these easements.
       4. Prior to City Council review, the building heights for buildings B and C on the
          cover sheet will be changed to match those shown on sheets A2.2 and A2.3
       5. Prior to City Council review, the applicant will revise the parking ratio
          and the floor area ratio on the cover sheet to reflect 36,000 square feet
          of retail development instead of 33,700 square feet.
       PASSED AND ADOPTED this 13th day of June, 2013.

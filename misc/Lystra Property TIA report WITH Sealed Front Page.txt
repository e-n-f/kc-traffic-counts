1.0    Executive Summary


The proposed Lystra Gardens Subdivision is located along the southern side of Lystra
Road approximately 1 mile east of US 15-501, southeast of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
Currently only 69 residential single-family units are currently being proposed. One access
point is proposed onto Lystra Road. Build out of the development is expected in 2009.

This study was performed to determine the future traffic impacts of the proposed
development on the surrounding street network. Analyses were conducted during a.m.
and p.m. peak hours as well as the afternoon school peak. Projected traffic volumes for
intersections within the study area were analyzed under three scenarios: Existing, Future
No Build, and Future Build.

This analysis includes several large approved development projects including: Williams
Corner, Booth Mountain and Briar Chapel. While there will definitely be interaction of
trips (trip capture) between these approved developments, no such adjustment was
applied in the analysis. In addition to the growth related to specific approved
development projects, existing traffic volumes were grown at a 3% annual rate.
Applying both an annual growth rate and approved development traffic growth will likely
result in a double counting of background traffic growth. As a result, future traffic
projects are likely to be overestimated, thereby resulting in a conservative analysis.

First, by specifically including several large approved developments without accounting
for interaction between any of these land uses, cumulative traffic impacts are
overestimated. Second, in similar cases where traffic from several large approved
projects are specifically included in the analysis, projected traffic increases resulting from
additional "background" growth are often reduced or eliminated. This is based on the
assumption that the approved projects adequately reflect historical background growth
through the proposed build-out date. However, no such reductions were applied in this
analysis. As a result, the analysis likely overestimates traffic impacts in both the Future
Build and Future No-Build scenarios.

Based on the analysis, and assuming approved development traffic and their committed
improvements, no additional roadway improvements are necessary to accommodate
projected site traffic demands. Site traffic has a minimal impact on the adjacent roadway
and nearby intersections.

2.0    Project Background

The proposed Lystra Gardens Subdivision is located along the southern side of Lystra
Road approximately 1 mile east of US 15-501, southeast of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
Currently only 69 residential single-family units are currently being proposed. One access
point is proposed onto Lystra Road. Build out of the development is expected in 2009.

The John R. McAdams Company, Inc. was retained to determine potential traffic impacts
of this proposed project. This report presents trip generation, trip distribution, analysis
and recommendations for improvements to meet anticipated traffic demands.

This analysis was performed using Synchro Professional Software Version 5.0.

3.1    Study Area
The study area for this traffic impact analysis has been determined based on preliminary
discussions with Town staff. The following intersections are included in the study area.

       ·   US 15-501 ­ Lystra Road
       ·   Lystra Road ­ Site Drive
       ·   Lystra Road ­ Jack Bennett Road

3.2     Existing Conditions
Streets within the study area include US 15-501, Lystra Road, and Jack Bennett Road.
Existing traffic volumes along the street network are relatively low during peak hours,
but are projected to increase substantially in the future due to multiple approved
developments. Current roadway laneage is shown on Figure 2.

Located west of the site, US 15-501 is a five-lane, north/south arterial with posted speed
limits of 45 mph in the vicinity of the site, and a 2003 average daily traffic (ADT) of
20,000 vehicles per day (vpd). US 15-501 was recently widened to a multi-lane facility
from a point north of Pittsboro to Chapel Hill.

Lystra Road is generally a two-lane east/west minor thoroughfare with a posted 45 mph
speed limit and a 2005 ADT of 3,000 vpd in the site vicinity. Lystra Road forms a
signalized T-intersection with US 15-501 and an unsignalized T-intersection with Jack
Bennett Road. The subject development proposes one full-movement site drive onto
Lystra Road.

Jack Bennett Road is generally a two-lane east/west minor thoroughfare with a posted 45
mph speed limit and an estimated 2007 ADT of 4,000 vpd near the intersection with
Lystra Road.

4.0     Trip Generation

The gross estimated traffic generation for the proposed development was calculated
based on the proposed site plan, and using the methodology, rates and equations in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) - Trip Generation, 7th Edition, 2003.

Table 1 summarizes the proposed site trip generation during the AM and PM peak hours.
                                       Table 1

The ITE Trip Generation Manual does not provide data regarding the generation of
residential site traffic during a "School Peak Hour". Based on conversations with North
Chatham School staff regarding hours of operation, the typical AM peak hour also
captures the AM School Peak Hour. To determine the site traffic generation during the
PM School Peak, 12-hour turning movement counts for other residential projects were
analyzed to determine the proportion of traffic entering and leaving the project during the
hours of 2:00 ­ 4:00 PM compared to the total 12-hour count. This proportion (7.9%)
was applied to the ITE daily trip generation for single-family dwelling units to determine
a trip generation rate per unit. Because the School Peak Hour volumes were compared to
the 12-hour volume total as opposed to a 24-hour volume total, the estimated trip
generation is likely higher than will actually be experienced, thereby presenting a
conservative analysis. Details regarding this methodology are included in the Appendix.

Table 2 summarizes the proposed site trip generation during the PM school peak hour.

4.1     Approved Development Trip Generation
Based on conversations with Town staff, the approved, yet un-built, developments in the
site vicinity include Williams Corner, Booth Mountain and Briar Chapel. These projects
are assumed as approved developments and are discussed further in Section 6.3. Gross
trip generation was calculated based on the methodology, rates and equations in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) - Trip Generation, 7th Edition, 2003.

Table 3 summarizes the total approved development gross trip generation. For general
purposes, no adjustments are shown for internal capture or passby trips.

5.0    Trip Distribution

The primary site traffic distribution was determined based on a review of site trip origins
and destinations, future approved developments and existing peak hour traffic volumes in
the site vicinity. Given the site location, a majority of site traffic is likely to access the
site via US 15-501 towards the Town of Chapel Hill. Therefore the site distribution is
weighted towards the north. Primary site traffic volumes were distributed as summarized
below:
                                                                                    Overall
To/From the north via US 15-501                                                       48%
To/From the south via US 15-501                                                       12%
To/From the south via Jack Bennett                                                    14%
To/From the east via Lystra Road                                                      26%
    Total                                                                             100%

A more detailed distribution of site traffic is reflected on Figure 3.

6.0    Projected Traffic Volumes

6.1     Existing Traffic
Traffic Survey Services, Inc. collected turning movement counts at the intersection of US
15-501 ­ Lystra Road and Jack Bennett Road ­ Lystra Road on April 17th, 2007. A
follow up traffic count was collected at the Jack Bennett ­ Lystra Road intersection on
April 19th, 2007 by the John R. McAdams Company, Incorporated. These counts are
included in the appendix. Figure 4 reflects these existing peak hour traffic volumes for
intersections within the study area.

6.2    Historical Growth Traffic
Historical growth (background growth) traffic is the increase in traffic volumes due to
non-specific growth throughout the area. Based on standard NCDOT practice, a 3.0%
annual growth rate was applied to existing traffic volumes through the build out year
2009.

6.3    Approved Development Traffic
Approved development traffic is the traffic that will be generated by currently approved
developments that are not yet constructed or occupied. Based on conversations with
Town staff, there are three such developments to be specifically included in this analysis:
Williams Corner, Booth Mountain and Briar Chapel.

The pending Williams Corner mixed-use development is located in the northeast
quadrant of the US 15-501 ­ Lystra Road intersection. This development proposes 40
townhomes, a day care center, a specialty supermarket, a pharmacy with drive-through
window, a drive-in bank, 50,500 square feet (s.f.) of specialty retail, 50,500 s.f. of office
spaces, 166,000 s.f. of medical office space, and 60,000 s.f. of flex space in the projected
2010 build out year. Williams Corner site traffic volumes were distributed onto the
network based on the traffic impact analysis prepared by Kimley-Horn and Associates,
Inc. dated May 2005. Per the traffic study, dual westbound left turn lanes at the US 15-
501 ­ Lystra Road intersection are recommended as part of this development and were
therefore included in the Future No-Build and Future Build scenarios as a committed
improvement. While this project has not yet been approved, staff asked that the traffic
impacts be specifically reflected in this analysis.

The Briar Chapel mixed-use development is located west of US 15-501 between Mann's
Chapel Road and Andrews Store Road in Chatham County, NC. The project proposes
approximately 1,880 single-family units, 515 multi-family units, 252,000 s.f. of retail,

                                             10
270,000 s.f. of office, two schools and a county park with a projected 2014 build out
year. This study assumes 60% of the Briar Chapel will be constructed by the year 2011.
Therefore, 60% of the trip generation potential of the development was assigned to the
intersections in the study area based on the Briar Chapel TIA prepared by Kimley-Horn
and Associates, Inc. in June 2004.

The Booth Mountain residential development will be located east of US 15-501, south of
south of Lystra Road and north of Jack Bennett Road. This development proposes 180
single-family units divided into three separate sections. Two sections, consisting of 39
and 53 units, will only have access onto Jack Bennett Road, while the third section, 88
units, will only have access onto Lystra Road. Build out of the development is expected
in 2011. Booth Mountain site traffic volumes were distributed on the network based on
the traffic impact analysis prepared by Ramey Kemp and Associates, Inc. dated August
2004.

Where necessary, approved development traffic volumes were distributed onto the
network based on existing and projected traffic volumes. Approved development traffic
volumes are indicated on Figure 6. As directed by staff, Future No-Build traffic volumes
were determined by adding both approved development traffic and historical growth
traffic to existing traffic volumes. For two reasons this approach is very conservative and
likely overestimates future traffic volumes. First, by specifically including several large
approved developments without accounting for interaction between any of these land
uses, cumulative traffic impacts are overestimated. Second, in similar cases where traffic
from several large approved projects are specifically included in the analysis, projected
traffic increases resulting from additional "background" growth are often reduced or
eliminated. This is based on the assumption that the approved projects adequately reflect
historical background growth through the proposed build-out date. However, no such
reductions were applied in this analysis. As a result, the analysis likely overestimates
traffic impacts in both the Future Build and Future No-Build scenarios. Also, due to a
lack of data, approved development traffic volumes during the Afternoon School Peak
were assumed to equal to those during the PM peak hour. These approved development
volumes will likely be significantly lower during the Afternoon School Peak. Therefore,
a more conservative analysis is presented.

These Future No-Build volumes are indicated on Figure 7. Roadway improvements
associated with the Williams Corner development are included in the Future No-Build
and Future Build scenarios.

7.0    Site Access and Traffic Assignment

The proposed site will operate with one full movement drive onto Lystra Road. Site
traffic was distributed and assigned onto the street network based on the distributions
described in Section 5.0. Site traffic volumes are indicated on Figure 5. Site generated
traffic volumes were added to Future No-Build volumes to obtain anticipated Future
Build volumes. Future Build traffic volumes are indicated on Figure 7.

8.0       Traffic Analysis

The Highway Capacity Manual 2000 describes capacity as "the maximum number of
vehicles that can pass a given point during a specific period under given roadway, traffic
and control conditions". Capacity is further defined at different levels of service to
qualitatively measure the operational characteristics of the traffic stream. The Highway
Capacity Manual defines six levels of service, LOS A through LOS F, with LOS A
indicating the shortest average delays and LOS F indicating the longest average delays.
The tables below relate average intersection control delay to level of service for both
signalized and unsignalized intersections.

Capacity analyses for a.m. and p.m. peak hours were conducted for each of the following
scenarios:

      ·   Existing (2007)
      ·   Future No Build (2009)
      ·   Future Build (2009)

8.1     US 15-501 ­ Lystra Road Intersection

This intersection has recently signalized as part of NCDOT's TIP Project R-942, which
improved US 15-501 to a four-land, median-divided facility. With these improvements,
this intersection currently operates at level of service (LOS) A during peak hours. Under
the Future No-Build scenario with the addition of background growth traffic, approved
development traffic and recommended westbound dual left turn lanes by the Williams
Corner development, the intersection is projected to operate at LOS C. This decline in
level of service is largely due to the amount of approved development traffic volumes in
the site vicinity. Under the Future Build scenario with site traffic volumes, LOS C
remains with minimal increase in overall intersection delay, as noted in the table below.
Therefore, no improvements are necessary to address site-generated traffic.

Table 4 summarizes the peak hour levels of service.

8.2      Lystra Road ­ Site Drive Intersection

In the Future Build scenario, the proposed Site Drive will form an unsignalized T-
intersection with Lystra Road. This intersection is expected to operate at LOS C during
the peak hour under future traffic demands. Therefore, no improvements are necessary to
address site-generated traffic.

Table 5 summarizes the peak hour levels of service.

8.3     Lystra Road ­ Jack Bennett Road Intersection

This existing unsignalized intersection currently functions with the side street approach
operating at level of service (LOS) D during the AM peak. Under the Future No-Build
scenario, with approved development and background growth traffic, LOS F is expected
on the Jack Bennett Road approach. In the Future Build scenario with build-out of Lystra
Gardens Subdivision, the side street LOS F remains with minor increases in queues and
delay. The Lystra Gardens Subdivision site traffic volumes are projected to constitute
only 2.4% of total intersecting volume during the AM peak hour. It should also be noted
that this intersection is located almost 1.5 miles from the site. As made evident by the
Future No-Build analysis, this poor side street level of service is created by projected
approved development impacts and is unrelated to the proposed Lystra Gardens
Subdivision. Therefore, no improvements are necessary to address site-generated traffic.
This intersection should continue to be monitored for future geometric improvements.
Based on the analysis there exist no rational nexus between site traffic impact and the
need for roadway improvements at this intersection.

Table 6 summarizes the peak hour levels of service.

9.0    Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations

Traffic generated by the proposed Lystra Gardens Subdivision will be quite low, creating
minimal increases in delay at intersections within the study area. Site traffic volumes
will not account for a significant portion of total intersection volumes, nor will they have
a substantial impact on future intersection operations. With the addition of Williams
Corner committed roadway improvements, no additional improvements are necessary at
the US 15-501 ­ Lystra Road intersection. Also, because of the limited site traffic impact
at the Lystra Road ­ Jack Bennett intersection and the fact that this intersection is located
greater than 2.5 miles from the site drive, no improvements are recommended to address
site traffic impact.

Therefore, based on the analysis, no improvements are recommended to accommodate
site-generated traffic.

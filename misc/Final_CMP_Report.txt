I.       INTRODUCTION

The St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization (TPO) is a countywide agency responsible for
transportation planning in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of St. Lucie County. The TPO has
retained Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. to update its Congestion Management Process (CMP) and to
identify and prioritize CMP projects for potential inclusion in the Florida Department of Transportation
(FDOT) Five-Year Work Program, the TPO's List of Priority Projects (LOPP), and the TPO's
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).


District Four of the Florida Department of Transportation anticipates that approximately $300,000 per
year of CMP Box Funds will be available for the St. Lucie TPO beginning in Fiscal Year 2014/2015.


WHAT IS A CMP?

A CMP uses a number of analytic tools to define and identify congestion
within a region, corridor, activity center, or project area.      A CMP
identifies where congestion exists, what can be done about it, and a
coordinated implementation plan for appropriate strategies to reduce
congestion or mitigate the impacts of congestion.


WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF A CMP?

Addressing traffic congestion through a comprehensive process such as the development of a CMP
document provides the St. Lucie TPO with a framework to respond to congestion and other operational
issues in a consistent and coordinated fashion. The CMP enables the TPO to pinpoint congestion
management strategies that will provide the greatest amount of benefit to the region. Furthermore,
reducing congestion on the region's roadways will likely result in a reduction of travel time delay for
motorists.     Reducing travel time delay has sustainability benefits such as improving air quality
conditions and helping to conserve fuel as motorists spend less time idling in congested conditions.




October 2011                                                                                           Page 1
St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization                               Congestion Management Process



PURPOSE

The overall purpose of the Congestion Management Process is to create a better quality of life for St.
Lucie residents and visitors through lowering travel delay, reducing harmful emissions, and improving
safety. This Congestion Management Process Update for the St. Lucie TPO shall identify potential
CMP projects and funding/implementation actions, and establish criteria to assess the performance of
completed CMP projects. In addition, strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), air pollutants,
and green house gas emissions will be examined.


GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

The goal of the St. Lucie TPO CMP Major Update is to identify, evaluate, and prioritize CMP projects
for potential inclusion in the FDOT Work Program, the TPO's List of Priority Projects (LOPP), and the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).


Objectives for the CMP Major Update include updating the traffic
analysis of roadway segments, revising CMP prioritization
criteria, prioritizing projects for the CMP Box Funds ($300,000
annually beginning in Fiscal Year 2014/15), and placing
significant focus on expanding the current CMP to enhance
environmental and sustainability components through multimodal
strategies.


FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION CMP GUIDEBOOK

A review of the Federal Highway Administration's `Congestion Management Process: A Guidebook'
(dated April 2011) was performed to identify best practices for the development of the CMP.




October 2011                                                                                         Page 2

ORGANIZATION OF REPORT

This report consists of eight (8) chapters. Chapter One introduces the objectives of the CMP update.
Chapter Two summarizes the public involvement plan.              Chapter Three establishes the project
prioritization criteria and performance measures. Chapter Four develops the CMP toolbox to define
potential congestion reduction and mobility strategies. Chapter Five presents the Tier I analysis and
results. The Tier I analysis consists of an evaluation of existing roadway segments to identify areas of
congestion and safety concerns on a system-wide basis. Chapter Six presents the Tier II analysis and
results. The Tier II analysis evaluates the areas of concern (identified in the Tier I analysis) using in-
depth performance evaluation measures.           Chapter Seven details the implementation plan for the
proposed CMP projects. Chapter Eight summarizes the development and conclusions of the CMP plan
for the St. Lucie TPO.

II.      PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT PLAN

One of the primary functions of transportation planning organizations (TPOs) is to provide the general
public with information regarding transportation planning processes and to allow public participation in
the transportation planning decision-making process. The TPO is governed by the TPO Board, which is
composed of elected officials from the municipalities and County, as well as representatives from the
School Board and Community Transit. A public involvement plan (PIP) was developed for the St. Lucie
TPO CMP update.


PURPOSE AND GOALS OF THE PIP

The purpose of this PIP is to outline strategies to provide the public opportunities for two-way
communication on information related to the CMP update. The goals of the PIP for the CMP update are
to effectively communicate the transportation issues precipitating the need for a CMP, to obtain
stakeholder input throughout the CMP update process, and to disseminate the results of the CMP update
in an effective and accessible manner.


ELEMENTS OF THE PIP

The St. Lucie TPO will obtain public and stakeholder input on the CMP through meetings with local
government officials, presentations to committees established by the TPO for coordination purposes, and
having CMP documents available for public review.


Local Government Outreach

A series of kickoff meetings were held with local government
officials to obtain initial input on congestion management issues
and concerns, discuss key intersections to consider for detailed
study, discuss funding of congestion management projects, and
receive any other feedback that local government staff may have
for the TPO related to congestion management. The following



October 2011                                                                                         Page 4
St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization                               Congestion Management Process



local government kickoff meetings were held at the offices of the individual local governments by TPO
and Kimley-Horn staff:

               St. Lucie County ­ Monday, December 13, 2010
               City of Fort Pierce ­ Monday, December 13, 2010
               City of Port St. Lucie ­ Monday, January 24, 2011

A summary of input gained from the individual meetings with local government staff can be found in
Table 9.

Public Meetings

Consistent with the TPO's organizational PIP, two (2) rounds of presentations were provided to the
following TPO committees:

               Technical Advisory Committee (TAC)
               Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)



The TPO advisory committees are public forums affording citizens an opportunity to participate in the
planning process. The TPO's TAC consists of technically qualified representatives of local and state
agencies responsible for all modes of transportation as well as a broad-based set of inter-related
disciplines such as land use and environmental protection within the TPO's metropolitan planning area.
The TPO's CAC consists entirely of citizens who facilitate a broad range of public involvement and
provide community reaction to planning proposals, provide comment with respect to the concerns of
various segments of the population, and recommend projects and funding allocations for consideration.
One presentation was also given to the Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Committee (BPAC). The TPO's
BPAC consists of technically qualified individuals including citizens who provide recommendations
regarding the bicycle and pedestrian planning and programming activities for the St. Lucie TPO.


In addition to the TAC and CAC presentations, the CMP update was presented twice to the TPO Board.
All TPO meetings are advertised on the TPO website, on local access television (SLCTV), and in the
local newspaper. Furthermore, all TPO Board meetings are televised on SLCTV.

Document Availability


The TPO has significantly updated its
website (www.stlucietpo.org) dedicated to
transportation planning activities.              The
website includes draft documents, agenda
packets, and video on demand for TPO
meetings. Information regarding the CMP
was disseminated via the TPO website for
public review including within agenda
packets and as standalone documents.
Furthermore, the TPO maintains a binder
of    all      public   involvement     materials
produced         including   agenda      packets,
advertisements, and public comments.
The TPO is housed in a separate office at
the St. Lucie County Administration Building (2300 Virginia Avenue, Fort Pierce, FL 34982), which
facilitates walk-ins from the public. The TPO telephone number is 772-462-1593 and the fax number is
772-462-2549.

III. PROJECT PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA AND PERFORMANCE
MEASURES

This chapter discusses the legislation that was enacted which created the requirement of a Congestion
Management Process (CMP). Additionally, the existing and recommended prioritization criteria and the
recommended performance measures are presented.


FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS

The most recent reauthorization of the nation's surface transportation program is known as "The Safe
Accountable Flexible Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users" or SAFETEA-LU. This
legislation enacted several changes to metropolitan and statewide transportation planning provisions.
Among the most significant changes was the updated requirement for a CMP in Transportation
Management Areas (metropolitan areas with a population over 200,000). The CMP is intended to
address congestion issues through a process that provides for effective management and operations
based on travel demand reduction and operational management strategies. Furthermore, SAFETEA-LU
states that the development of a CMP should result in multimodal system performance measures and
strategies that can be reflected in the metropolitan transportation plan and the Transportation
Improvement Program.


RECOMMENDED PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In order to prioritize projects that will help to relieve congestion, it was first necessary to develop
performance measures that identify where congestion exists.          In order to develop appropriate
performance measures, the following items were considered:

               Purpose of the CMP (to identify areas with congestion or safety issues and to prioritize
               projects which address these issues)
               Current St. Lucie TPO performance measures
               Availability of data sources
               Ease of application and maintenance



October 2011                                                                                          Page 7
St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization                                  Congestion Management Process




This CMP update proposes a two-tiered approach to define prioritization rankings. Tier I is geared
towards providing a system-wide screening evaluation that identifies corridors and/or intersections that
warrant additional (Tier II) analysis. The Tier II analysis evaluates the identified areas of concern using
in-depth performance evaluation measures. One key benefit to this approach is that the Tier I analysis
can easily be applied on a system-wide basis to help narrow the focus to high priority corridors and
intersections.


The proposed Tier I performance measures are shown below:

               Volume to Capacity (v/c) ratio
               Safety (spots vs. segments)
               Key Stakeholder Input


The proposed Tier II performance measures are shown below:

               Type of project (safety vs. operational)
               Benefit (significance level)
               Cost
               Potential issues




October 2011                                                                                            Page 8

RECOMMENDED PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA

The proposed prioritization criteria for Tier I and Tier II are described below.

Tier I Prioritization Criteria

As previously mentioned, the Tier I analysis and prioritization criteria is geared towards providing a
high-level system-wide screening evaluation that identifies roadway segments that warrant additional
(Tier II) analysis. Prioritization of roadway segments in the CMP network is accomplished by assigning
values or "points" to each of the three Tier I performance measures. The point system assigns more
points to roads with a higher measure or perception of congestion and/or safety issues. The Tier I
performance measures and associated point system are discussed below.

    1. Volume to Capacity (V/C) ratios are assigned between zero (0) and ten (10) points based upon
         the level of congestion suggested by the V/C ratio. The higher the V/C ratio (which indicates a
         greater level of congestion) the higher the number of points.
    2. Safety "spots" (generally intersections) are given three (3) points and safety "segments" (short
         sections of roadway) are given five (5) points. Locations with both spot and segment issues will
         receive points for both occurrences. This performance measure was evaluated based upon crash
         data provided by the Florida Department of Transportation. Note that this criterion was not
         weighted as heavily as the other two criteria (maximum of 8 points instead of 10 points) because
         safety data is not consistently available for the entire CMP roadway network.
    3. Key stakeholder identified locations are given ten (10) points.

The Tier I performance measures and scoring system are summarized in Table 1. Results of the Tier I
evaluation are presented in Chapter 5.

The TPO recently developed an online traffic count database which can provide users with current and
historical daily and peak hour traffic count data. This database can be viewed at www.stlucietpo.org.
Users will be able to utilize this new database to obtain traffic volumes for various roadway corridors in
St. Lucie County.

Tier II Prioritization Criteria

The Tier II performance measures and associated point system are discussed below. The point system
assigns more points to intersections/roads with a higher measure or perception of congestion and/or
safety issues, as summarized below:

    1. Type: A score was assigned to each project based on whether it will provide a multimodal,
         safety, or operational benefit.         A project that was considered to provide both safety and
         multimodal benefits was assigned a maximum score of eight (8) points. Furthermore, a project
         considered to provide safety benefits was assigned a score of five (5) points; a project considered
         to provide multimodal benefits was assigned a score of three (3) points; lastly, a project
         considered to provide operational benefits was assigned a score of two (2) points.
    2. Benefits: A score was assigned to each project based on its perceived benefits. A project with
         very high benefits was assigned a score of six (6); a project with high benefits assigned a score of
         four (4); and a project with moderate benefits was assigned a score of two (2). In order to define
         the level of benefit that each improvement would provide, the resulting level of service and
         reduction in overall vehicle delay were reviewed. If an improvement resulted in a level of
         service that was multiple `grades' better than the existing level of service, then it was defined as
         having a `very high' benefit level. Generally, if an improvement resulted in a level of service
         that was one `grade' better than the existing level of service and if the resulting intersection
         vehicle delay was reduced by 15 seconds or more, then it was defined as having a `high' benefit
         level. All other improvements were defined as having a `moderate' benefit level.
    3. Cost: A score was assigned to each project based on its estimated cost. A project costing less
         than $75,000 was assigned a score of six (6); a project costing between $75,000 and $150,000
         was assigned a score of four (4); and a project costing more than $150,000 was assigned a score
         of two (2).
    4. Issues: A score was assigned to each project based on issues that are likely to impact project
         implementation. A project for which no issues were identified was assigned a score of three (3);
         a project with drainage, signal/utilities, or landscaping issues was assigned a score of two (2); a
         project that will likely experience public opposition was assigned as score of one (1); and a
         project involving right-of-way purchases was assigned as score of zero (0).

ONGOING SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MONITORING FRAMEWORK

The use of performance measures to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the transportation network
and of operations has increased in recent years. Rather than using highly technical measures such as
level of service, measures such as speed, travel time, and person throughput are employed to describe
mobility and access at various levels such as for an entire corridor or for a particular intersection. Table
3 details generally accepted characteristics of good performance measures.

As the St. Lucie TPO implements a sustainable and ecologically conscious approach to transportation
planning, initiated by adopting the 2035 Long Range Transportation Plan, unique performance measures
are necessary in addition to collecting traffic count data. Typically, performance measures should be
derived from the vision, goals, and objectives established for the region during the metropolitan
transportation planning process. The vision established in the 2035 Martin ­ St. Lucie Long Range
Transportation Plan as well as in the TPO's Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP) incorporates
sustainability and multi-modalism.

Table 4 shows performance measures that this CMP Update recommends using in the future for ongoing
system performance monitoring as data collection techniques become more robust.

Collecting data to assess system performance is typically the most resource-intensive element of the
CMP process. According to federal guidelines, a CMP must include the establishment of a coordinated
program for data collection and system performance monitoring to define the extent and duration of
congestion, to contribute in determining the causes of congestion, and to evaluate the efficiency and
effectiveness of implemented actions. Minor updates to the CMP will continue the development and
establishment of the coordinated program for data collection and system performance monitoring.

IV.      CMP TOOLBOX

Federal guidelines state that a CMP shall include the identification and evaluation of the anticipated
performance and expected benefits of appropriate congestion management strategies that will contribute
to the more effective use and improved safety of existing and future transportation systems based on the
established performance measures. The following categories of strategies are some examples of what
may be considered:


               Demand management measures including growth management and congestion pricing
               Traffic operational improvements
               Public transportation improvements
               Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies
               Where necessary, additional system capacity


While the above-mentioned categories are offered as general examples for a CMP to consider, federal
guidelines also state that selected categories can be tailored to support congestion management
objectives that have been established by the particular region.         Accordingly, the following four
categories were developed in correlation with the examples noted by the federal guidelines and comprise
what is referred to as the CMP's toolbox:


               Multimodal
               Travel Demand Management
               Utilizing Existing Capacity More Efficiently
               Adding More Base Capacity




Each of these four categories can include several possible strategies. This chapter describes the different
strategies that the CMP can utilize.

MULTIMODAL

Encouraging the viability of multiple
modes of transportation can help to
reduce the demand placed on the
roadway network by the typical
single-occupancy        vehicle    (SOV).
Alternative travel modes to the SOV
include walking, bicycling, carpooling, vanpooling, or utilizing a public transit service such as a bus or
train.


Traffic congestion and limited travel choices can adversely affect community well-being.                     A
community's residents can experience a diminished quality of life when congestion impedes reliable and
timely access to employment, education, and recreational opportunities. In addition, traffic congestion
increases fossil fuel consumption and air pollution and increases travel costs.


Multimodal CMP strategies help support livable communities.                For example, offering more
transportation choices (such as transit, bicycling, and walking options) can benefit a community in the
following ways:



               Decreased household transportation costs
               Improved air quality
               Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
               Increased public health




Multimodal CMP strategies that can encourage a shift from the dependence on the SOV to an
increasingly multimodal transportation network are shown in Table 5.

TRAVEL DEMAND MANAGEMENT

Strategies and policies that are intended to reduce travel demand or redistribute the timing of the demand
are referred to as Travel Demand Management and can result in more people traveling in fewer vehicles
(shifting away from the typical single-occupancy vehicle) and fewer trips being made during the peak
travel times of the day. Managing travel demand can be a cost-effective alternative to increasing
capacity via roadway widening or intersection turn-lane improvements.


The term "Travel Demand Management" (TDM) has origins in the United States dating back to the
1970s and 1980s. It became evident at this time that single-occupancy commuter travel was prevailing
and that providing alternative transportation choices was necessary to save energy, improve air quality,
and reduce peak period congestion.               Despite this, single-occupancy commuter travel continued to
increase between the years of 1980 and 2000 because people chose to travel by car more often and for
greater distances and because cities were spreading outwardly onto low density, rural lands
(phenomenon known as "urban sprawl"). Urban sprawl increases the dependency on single-occupancy
vehicles as it creates a longer trip length between residential areas and employment/commercial centers.




Examples of Travel Demand Management strategies are shown in Table 6.

UTILIZING EXISTING CAPACITY MORE EFFICIENTLY

Another approach towards congestion management is to maximize the efficiency of the existing
infrastructure. Solutions within this category are less expensive than those in the "adding more base
capacity" category. Strategies within this approach are primarily operations-based and can be enhanced
by the use of advanced technologies such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Operational
analyses can be performed to determine if elements of the roadway network such as traffic control type
(stop-controlled, roundabout, or traffic signal) or access management connections can be improved via
slight modifications.




Strategies that fit within this category are shown in Table 7.

ADDING MORE BASE CAPACITY

Expanding the base capacity of a roadway network can be achieved by increasing the number of lanes
on its existing roadways or by the construction of new roadways. Although this approach is not always
feasible due to physical constraints (limited right-of-way) or fiscal constraints (lack of available
funding), it remains an important approach both by itself and in combination with other strategies.




Some strategies that fall within this category are shown in Table 8.

V.       TIER I EVALUATION

The Tier I analysis is geared towards providing a system-wide screening evaluation that identifies
corridors and/or intersections that warrant additional (Tier II) analysis. This evaluation was applied to
the majority of roadways within St. Lucie County. Roadways where no available traffic count data was
available were omitted from the analysis. The CMP roadway network within the jurisdiction of the St.
Lucie TPO is shown in Figure 1.


As discussed previously in Chapter 3, the Tier I performance measures include the following:

               Volume to Capacity (v/c) ratio
               Safety (spots vs. segments)
               Key Stakeholder Input


VOLUME TO CAPACITY (V/C) RATIO EVALUATION

The TPO collected 48-hour traffic count data at approximately 110 count stations within St. Lucie
County. In addition to the collected data at these count stations, traffic count data from the most current
version of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Traffic Information Database were
obtained. Raw daily traffic volumes were converted to Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes
using seasonal factors (as reported by FDOT). The AADT volumes and the peak-hour peak-direction
(PHPD) volumes at each count station were compared to the applicable daily and peak hour capacities.
Note that the daily and peak hour capacities for each roadway segment were obtained from the capacity
tables found within the 2009 FDOT Quality/Level of Service Handbook. This comparison of the volume
to the capacity yields the V/C ratio. The peak-hour peak-direction V/C ratios for the CMP roadway
network are detailed in Figure 2. Furthermore, data from roadway segments which are approaching or
exceeding their capacity standards (having a V/C ratio greater than or equal to 0.94) is presented in a
graphical format comparing 15-minute vehicular traffic volumes to their respective service capacities.
These graphs are shown as Figure 3. Note that 15-minute vehicular traffic volume data were not
available for all of the locations with a V/C ratio greater than or equal to 0.94.

SAFETY EVALUATION

Crash data were requested from the FDOT Traffic Operations Division, St. Lucie County, the City of
Fort Pierce, and the City of Port St. Lucie. The FDOT provided year 2009 high crash spot and high
crash segment data. FDOT's methodology for determining both high crash spots (intersections) and
high crash segments is based on statistical significance and is further described below.


FDOT generates a list of high crash spots (intersections) by applying a screening process that determines
all intersections that have eight or more crashes per year. Those intersections that have eight or more
crashes are then compared to other similar intersections around the state. Statistical analyses are then
performed to determine if the crash rate at the subject intersection is high in comparison to the statewide
average for comparable locations. In summary, intersections that have a minimum of 8 crashes per year
and are determined (through statistical analysis) to have a confidence level of 99% or higher are referred
to as high crash spots. Note that a confidence level represents the percent probability that the crash rate
of the subject intersection is high in comparison to the statewide average for comparable locations.


FDOT generates a list of high crash segments using a methodology similar to what it uses for
determining high crash spots. The primary difference between the two methodologies is the high crash
segment methodology uses a sliding scale defined by mileposts (down to the 0.1 mile level) to determine
the crash threshold. A minimum of eight crashes is also used as a minimum threshold to qualify a
segment for statistical analysis. A segment can be of any length depending on how far the occurrence of
the high crash rate extends. It should also be noted that there is a sliding scale of confidence levels that
apply and they are based on the area type (rural, suburban, or urban).

KEY STAKEHOLDER INPUT

As discussed in Chapter 2, meetings with St. Lucie County, the City of Port St. Lucie, and the City of
Fort Pierce were held to obtain input from the local governmental agencies/municipalities. Table 9
summarizes the key stakeholder concerns and Figure 4 illustrates the roadway segments and
intersections that were identified by the key stakeholders as requiring congestion management measures.


TIER I EVALUATION SCORING

All segments within the CMP roadway network were evaluated and scored using the point system
described previously in Chapter 3. The results of the Tier I evaluation are shown in Table 10 for all
roadway segments that received scores (the segments that scored zero points are not shown in this table).


The full Tier I evaluation analysis and accompanying details and calculations can be found in Appendix
A.

VI. TIER II EVALUATION

The Tier II analysis evaluates the selected locations identified in the Tier I evaluation using in-depth
performance evaluation measures.                 Based on the Tier I evaluation results, a consensus list of
intersections (as agreed upon by the St. Lucie TPO Board, the St. Lucie TPO Technical Advisory
Committee, and the St. Lucie TPO Citizens Advisory Committee) was developed for Tier II evaluation.
The following intersections were evaluated in the Tier II analysis:

               US Highway 1 @ Old Dixie Highway
               US Highway 1 @ Orange Avenue
               US Highway 1 @ Georgia Avenue / Sunrise Boulevard
               US Highway 1 @ Virginia Avenue
               US Highway 1 @ Edwards Road
               St. Lucie West Boulevard @ Peacock Boulevard
               St. Lucie West Boulevard @ Cashmere Boulevard
               Prima Vista Boulevard @ Bayshore Boulevard
               Port St. Lucie Boulevard @ Gatlin Boulevard
               Floresta Drive / Oakridge Drive @ Southbend Boulevard / Oaklyn Street
               Selvitz Road @ Bayshore Boulevard
               Selvitz Road @ Glades Cut-Off Road
               Midway Road @ Selvitz Road / Torino Parkway


WHAT IS LEVEL OF SERVICE?

Turning movement count data collection was performed during the AM and PM peak hours at the
above-mentioned intersections during March of 2011. Raw turning movement count data can be found
in Appendix B. These raw traffic volumes were converted to peak season volumes using seasonal
factors published by FDOT. Peak season traffic volume calculations are detailed in Appendix C. AM
and PM peak hour level of service (LOS) analyses were then performed for each intersection using
Highway Capacity Software Version 5.4. Intersection levels of service range from LOS A through LOS
F. Descriptions for each LOS category are described below:



October 2011                                                                                               Page 39

               Level of service A
                  o Free flow and little or no delay at signalized intersections.
               Level of service B
                  o Stable flow and slight interference from other vehicles
                  o Minimal delays at signalized intersections
               Level of service C
                  o Stable flow but lower vehicle speeds
                  o Delays at most signalized intersections (vehicles typically forced to stop at red light
                      but are able to get through the intersection on the first green indication)
                  o Traffic queues at signalized intersections begin to form
               Level of service D
                  o Approaching unstable flow
                  o Operating speeds are slow (although tolerable)
                  o Noticeable delays at intersections (vehicles are not delayed more than two signal
                      cycles)
               Level of service E
                  o Unstable flow where a roadway's capacity is reached
                  o Low/variable operating speeds
                  o Substantial delays at intersections (vehicles are sometimes delayed for more than
                      two signal cycles)
               Level of service F
                  o Unstable flow
                  o Major delays at all critical signalized intersections
                  o Low speeds that may drop to zero for short time periods

INTERSECTION ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS

The following are descriptions summarizing the level of service analyses for each of the analyzed
intersections. Note that the existing signal timing plans were applied to each signalized intersection
analysis, with the exception of the US Highway 1 @ Orange Avenue intersection where a new phase is
proposed to better accommodate future pedestrian demand patterns. Appendix E presents descriptive
diagrams for each intersection describing the recommended improvements.

US Highway 1 @ Old Dixie Highway

The westbound approach of this intersection is controlled by a stop sign and is currently operating at a
deficient level of service during the PM peak hour. The majority of vehicles that are using this
westbound approach are making a left-turn to travel south on US Highway 1. One option to eliminate
this level of service deficiency is to prohibit this `westbound to southbound' left-turn movement.
Disallowing this movement would result in re-routing these `westbound to southbound' left-turning
vehicles up to the intersection of US Highway 1 @ SR A1A / North Causeway.


The intersection of US Highway 1 @ SR A1A / North Causeway was also evaluated to confirm its
ability to handle the additional re-routed traffic. In order to perform this evaluation, AM and PM peak
hour turning movement count data was collected at this intersection in May of 2011. The raw traffic
volumes were converted to peak season volumes using seasonal factors published by FDOT.
Furthermore, the additional westbound left-turning volumes (re-routed from the intersection of US
Highway 1 @ Old Dixie Highway) were added. It was determined that this intersection continues to
operate acceptably even with the additional westbound left-turning vehicles.

US Highway 1 @ Orange Avenue

This signalized intersection is currently operating acceptably during AM and PM peak hour conditions.
However, members of the St. Lucie TPO Technical Advisory Committee and City of Fort Pierce staff
have expressed concerns about the safety of this intersection upon the opening of the new Federal
courthouse at the southwest quadrant. Their primary safety concern is associated with the increasing
number of pedestrians that will have to cross the intersection after the courthouse opens as courthouse
staff and visitors will park at the parking garage that is located generally at the northeast quadrant of the


October 2011                                                                                            Page 42

intersection and have to cross the intersection to get to the courthouse. In order to accommodate
additional pedestrians, an all-pedestrian signal phase can be implemented which allows pedestrians to
cross the intersection any way they desire, even diagonally. This type of treatment is sometimes called a
`pedestrian scramble' phase. Advantages of accommodating diagonal crosswalks and all-pedestrian
phases at signalized intersections include the following:


                                                 Example Diagonal Crosswalk Intersection
               Pedestrians can cross
               without       experiencing
               vehicle conflicts as all
               vehicular      approaches
               see a red indication
               Pedestrians can cross an
               intersection diagonally
               and avoid two separate
               crossings
               Improved      safety    for
               pedestrians

According to PEDSAFE: Pedestrian Safety Guide and Countermeasure Selection System (FHWA-SA-
04-003), diagonal crosswalks and all-pedestrian phases are appropriate when pedestrian volumes are
high across all legs of the intersection, or when there is a high demand for a diagonal pedestrian crossing
pattern, or when there are high levels of conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Exclusive
pedestrian timing has been shown to reduce pedestrian crashes by 50 percent in some downtown
locations with heavy pedestrian volumes and low vehicle speeds. The Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD) includes example crosswalk markings for all-pedestrian phases and diagonal
crossings.      It should be noted that accommodating an `all-pedestrian' signal phase will increase
vehicular delay, as it decreases the proportion of green time that each intersection approach occupies
during the signal cycle. However, the cycle length can be held constant if the side street green phase
allocations are shortened.

The westbound approach of this intersection currently consists of one shared left-turn/through/right-turn
lane. In addition to this travel lane, there are four on-street parking spaces adjacent to this westbound
lane. One option to improve operations at this intersection is to convert these on-street parking spaces to

create an additional westbound approach travel lane. The improved westbound approach could consist
of one exclusive westbound left-turn lane and one shared through/right-turn lane. This lane conversion
would require the construction of a modified curb radius and the removal and relocation of an existing
palm tree. In addition, the signal pole on the northeast quadrant may need to be moved in order to
accommodate the modified curb radius.

Fort Pierce is collecting funds from other sources (such as impact fees) for the construction of a
southbound right-turn lane. A portion of the necessary right of way to accommodate this turn lane has
been acquired. The City is currently in the process of acquiring the remaining necessary right of way.
This improvement would improve operations by removing right-turning vehicles from the southbound
through lane, thus creating additional capacity at the intersection.

US Highway 1 @ Edwards Road

This signalized intersection is operating acceptably from a capacity perspective during existing AM and
PM peak hour conditions. It should be noted that FDOT is currently considering safety improvements at
this intersection. Therefore, no additional improvements are recommended in the CMP Update at this
time.

and level of service E during PM peak hour conditions.            The two particular movements at this
intersection that experience the most amount of delay per vehicle are the eastbound left-turn movement
and the southbound right-turn movement. Two improvement options were evaluated and are detailed
below:

               Option 1 includes the following intersection improvements:
                   o Minor signal timing adjustments to favor the adverse movements
                   o Extend the southbound innermost left-turn lane
               Option 2 includes the following intersection improvements:
                   o Minor signal timing adjustments to favor the adverse movements
                   o Extend the southbound innermost left-turn lane
                   o Construct an additional eastbound left-turn lane

The intersection is anticipated to operate at level of service D with the improvements in both option 1
and option 2. The recommended extension of the southbound innermost left-turn lane in both options
would accommodate additional left-turning vehicles and help to avoid queue spillback into the
southbound through lanes.


October 2011                                                                                         Page 46

The only difference between option 1 and option 2 is that option 2 includes the construction of an
additional eastbound left-turn lane. Dual left-turn lanes are generally considered when left-turn volumes
exceed 300 vehicles per hour. Based on traffic count data collected during the year 2011 peak season,
there are approximately 460 eastbound left-turning vehicles during the AM peak hour and 370
eastbound left-turning vehicles during the PM peak hour.          Therefore, this movement is a strong
candidate for dual left-turn lanes. Construction of an additional eastbound left-turn lane will require the
removal of some existing landscaping within the median on the west leg of this intersection.

St. Lucie West Boulevard @ Cashmere Boulevard

This signalized intersection is operating acceptably during existing AM and PM peak hour conditions.
Therefore, no improvements are recommended at this time.

Prima Vista Boulevard @ Bayshore Boulevard

This signalized intersection is currently operating at level of service F during AM and PM peak hour
conditions. The following intersection movements exceed their capacity during AM and PM peak hour
conditions:

               AM Peak Hour:
                   o Eastbound left-turn movement
                   o Southbound right-turn movement
               PM Peak Hour:
                   o Eastbound left-turn movement
                   o Westbound left-turn movement
                   o Westbound through movement
                   o Southbound right-turn movement

While there are several individual movements that exceed their capacity, the following improvements
were found to achieve level of service E during AM and PM peak hour conditions:

               Implement a southbound right-turn overlap signal phase
               Extend the southbound right-turn lane towards the north (up to Macedo Boulevard)


October 2011                                                                                           Page 47
St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization                                   Congestion Management Process




At the conclusion of this CMP Major Update, the City of Port St. Lucie incorporated the improvement
of the southbound right-turn lane at this location into its adopted Capital Improvements Plan (CIP).
Therefore, this improvement was not included in the CMP Implementation Plan because it is assumed
that the City is planning to construct it.

In addition to the above-mentioned intersection improvements, a sidewalk is recommended along
Bayshore Boulevard between Prima Vista Boulevard and Selvitz Road as it was identified as a key
stakeholder concern with regard to mobility and safety. Pedestrian quality of service depends on the
following factors:

               Existence of sidewalks
               Existence of crosswalks at convenient locations
               Lateral separation of vehicles and pedestrians (distance between travel lanes and sidewalks)

Constructing a sidewalk along this roadway segment would greatly improve the pedestrian quality of
service in this area, as it would provide pedestrian connectivity between the adjacent residential area and
the commercial destinations along Prima Vista Boulevard.

Port St. Lucie Boulevard @ Gatlin Boulevard

This signalized intersection is operating at level of service D during existing AM peak hour conditions
and level of service F during existing PM peak hour conditions. The following intersection movements
exceed their capacity during PM peak hour conditions:

               Northbound left-turn movement
               Northbound through movement
               Southbound through movement

Slight adjustments to the existing PM peak hour signal timing plan are projected to improve the
intersection's operation from level of service F to level of service E. These timing adjustments consist
of reallocating green time from the eastbound and westbound approaches to the northbound and
southbound approaches. Furthermore, removing the southbound overlap phase may be justified because
the southbound left-turn volume does not warrant additional protected green time.



October 2011                                                                                            Page 48
St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization                                     Congestion Management Process



In addition to the signal timing adjustments noted above, the City of Port St. Lucie has expressed
concern over the operation of this intersection's westbound approach. This approach consists of one
left-turn lane, one through lane, and one right-turn lane. The existing left-turn lane does not provide for
adequate queue storage length. Therefore, the recommended improvement is to extend the length of the
westbound left-turn lane to accommodate proper vehicular queue storage. Based on the intersection
analysis, the required queue storage length for the westbound left-turn lane is 175 feet (7 vehicles).
Extending this left-turn lane to encompass 175 feet of queue storage will require the removal of the
channelizing island (that currently serves the existing CVS Pharmacy driveway) as well as additional
pavement to provide space for vehicles that desire to make a westbound through movement or a
westbound right-turn movement at the intersection to travel around the westbound left-turning vehicle
queue. It is anticipated that this additional pavement will not infringe upon the adjacent intersection of
Tulip Boulevard & College Park Road.


Floresta Drive / Oakridge Drive @ Southbend Boulevard / Oaklyn Street

This signalized intersection is currently operating at level of service E during AM and PM peak hour
conditions. The signal timing plan at this intersection is split phased, whereby the eastbound and
westbound approaches are given separate green indications. This type of timing plan is implemented
because of the limited lane geometry on these approaches (both the eastbound and westbound
approaches consist of one shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane).


The improvement that was examined as part of this analysis was converting this signalized intersection
into a one-lane roundabout.           Roundabouts, when compared to a standard four-legged signalized
intersection, reduce the number of conflict points from 32 to 8. In addition, roundabouts can reduce the
severity of crashes as traffic typically enters the roundabout at slower speeds.

The existing AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes were analyzed under a roundabout condition
using SIDRA Version 5.1. This analysis showed that a roundabout at this intersection would operate
acceptably (level of service A) during existing AM and PM peak hour conditions.

Selvitz Road @ Bayshore Boulevard

The stop-controlled northbound and southbound approaches at this intersection are each operating at
level of service D during AM peak hour conditions. During PM peak hour conditions, the stop-
controlled northbound and southbound approaches are operating at level of service C and level of
service E, respectively.




October 2011                                                                                          Page 50

Two improvement options were evaluated and are detailed below:

               Option 1:
                   o Construct a southbound right-turn lane
               Option 2:
                   o Convert the intersection into a roundabout

If option 1 is selected, the southbound approach will benefit from the exclusive right-turn lane, as
removing the right-turns from the through movements and left-turning movements will increase the
capacity of this approach. The southbound approach for this option improves to level of service C
during existing AM and PM peak hour conditions.


For option 2, the existing AM and PM peak hour intersection volumes were analyzed under a
roundabout condition using SIDRA Version 5.1. Based on this analysis, if option 2 is selected and the
intersection is converted into a roundabout, the intersection will operate acceptably (level of service B)
during existing AM and PM peak hour conditions. Constructing a roundabout at this intersection will
likely require right-of-way purchases.

Selvitz Road @ Glades Cut-Off Road

The eastbound approach of this intersection is controlled by a stop sign and is currently operating
acceptably (level of service C) during AM and PM peak hour conditions. Therefore, no improvements
are recommended at this time.

Selvitz Road @ Midway Road

This intersection is currently under design as part of the Midway Road widening project from Selvitz
Road to South 25th Street according to St. Lucie County staff. This widening project includes capacity
enhancements at the Midway Road and Selvitz Road intersection including turn lanes on the approaches.
As of May 2011, these design plans were at the 60 percent completion level. No additional analyses
were performed for this intersection because of the capacity improvements that are currently being
designed.

Notes:
      (1) Levels of service shown for unsignalized intersections represent the level of service for each approach that has a delay element. Levels of service shown for signalized intersections and roundabouts
         represent the overall intersection level of service.
      (2) Closing the 'westbound to southbound' left-turn movement at this intersection will remove the only approach that experiences delay. Therefore, no level of service is applicable.
      (3) Closing the 'westbound to southbound' left-turn movement at this intersection requires rerouting the trips that used this segment to make westbound left-turns at the intersection of US Highway 1 & SR-A1A/North Causeway.
         Therefore, the intersection of US Highway 1 & SR-A1A/North Causeway was analyzed during AM & PM peak hours (see intersection # 13 above).
      (4) The City of Port St. Lucie incorporated this improvement into its adopted CIP.

VII. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Understanding where congestion occurs and identifying strategies or improvements that can reduce or
mitigate the impacts of congestion are critical steps in the development of a CMP. However, these two
steps are followed by what is considered as the most integral step, which is the implementation of the
CMP strategies. Implementing the identified strategies typically requires the following steps:


               Step 1 ­ Determine funding sources
               Step 2 ­ Prioritizing strategies
               Step 3 ­ Allocating funding in the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)


In terms of step 1 (determining funding sources) for implementing CMP strategies, District Four of the
Florida Department of Transportation anticipates that approximately $300,000 per year will be available
for the St. Lucie TPO for the implementation of CMP strategies beginning in Fiscal Year 2014/2015.


Step 2, the prioritization of strategies, was described previously in Chapter 6 of this report. The CMP
strategies and their associated rankings are detailed in Table 15.


In order to allocate the necessary funding within the TIP (step 3), the estimated costs for each of the
identified improvements were developed. It should be noted that the costs that were developed are
estimated based on current generalized construction costs and the actual costs at the time of construction
may differ. Table 16 details the estimated costs for each of the Tier II recommended improvements.

         (2)   At the conclusion of this CMP Major Update, the City of Port St. Lucie incorporated the construction of a southbound right-turn lane at this location into its
               adopted Capital Improvements Plan (CIP). Therefore, this improvement was not included in the CMP Implementation Plan.
         (3)   Right-of-Way purchases will likely be required. This reported cost accounts for an estimated $100,000 in right-of-way costs.
         (4)   The City of Fort Pierce has collected partial funding and acquired a portion of the necessary right of way to accommodate this turn lane and is currently in
               the process of acquiring the remaining necessary right of way.

Based on the costs shown in Table 16, an implementation schedule of improvements was developed.
Table 17 details this implementation plan, which was developed in a format similar to a typical TIP
table.     It was assumed that the aforementioned $300,000 per year will be available for CMP
improvements beginning in Fiscal Year 2014/2015. Year 1, which is referenced in Table 17, refers to
Fiscal Year 2014/2015.


Note that any changes in the availability of funds will impact the implementation plan. While the St.
Lucie TPO will be the lead agency responsible for programming the CMP improvements, coordination
with other public agencies (such as the City of Port St. Lucie, the City of Fort Pierce, and St. Lucie
County) will be necessary to execute the process effectively.

         (2)   At the conclusion of this CMP Major Update, the City of Port St. Lucie incorporated the construction of a southbound right-turn lane at this location into its adopted Capital Improvements Plan (CIP). Therefore, this
               improvement was not included in the CMP Implementation Plan.
         (3)   Right-of-Way purchases will likely be required. This reported cost accounts for an estimated $100,000 in right-of-way costs.
         (4)   The City of Fort Pierce has collected partial funding and acquired a portion of the necessary right of way to accommodate this turn lane and is currently in the process of acquiring the remaining necessary right of way.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The St. Lucie TPO retained Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. to update its Congestion Management
Process (CMP) and identify and prioritize potential CMP projects for the FDOT Five-Year Work
Program, the TPO's List of Priority Projects (LOPP) and the TPO's Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP). District Four of the FDOT anticipates that approximately $300,000 per year will be
available for the St. Lucie TPO for CMP projects beginning in Fiscal Year 2014/2015. The TPO plans
to use the updated CMP to identify and prioritize CMP projects for funding.


A review of the Federal Highway Administration's `Congestion Management Process: A Guidebook'
(dated April 2011) was performed to identify best practices for the development of the CMP. This CMP
update utilized a two-tiered approach to define roadways and/or intersections that require improvements.
Tier I was geared towards providing a system-wide screening evaluation that identified corridors and/or
intersections that warrant additional (Tier II) analysis. The Tier II analysis then evaluated the identified
areas of concern using in-depth performance evaluation measures. One key benefit to this approach was
that the Tier I analysis was applied on a system-wide basis to help narrow the focus to high priority
corridors and intersections.


A public involvement plan was developed for the St. Lucie TPO CMP update which included the
provision of public opportunities for two-way communication on information related to the CMP. In
addition, meetings were held with local government officials from the City of Port St. Lucie, the City of
Fort Pierce, and St. Lucie County to obtain initial input on congestion management issues and concerns,
discuss key intersections to consider for detailed study, discuss funding of congestion management
projects, and receive any other feedback that local government staff may have related to congestion
management. The results of the Tier I analysis and the Tier II analysis were presented to the TPO Board
and the TPO's TAC, CAC, and BPAC. Input from each of these groups was incorporated during the
development of the recommended improvements within this CMP.

Thirteen (13) intersections were identified for Tier II evaluation. The Tier II evaluation resulted in the
recommendation of improvements at nine (9) locations.            The recommended improvements are
summarized and ranked in Table 15. Furthermore, an implementation plan was developed for the
recommended improvements and is detailed in Table 17.

              Notes:
               (1) Count data collected in 2010 was provided by the St. Lucie Transportation Planning Organization (TPO).
               (1) Count data collected in 2009 was obtained from the 2009 Florida Department of Transportation Florida Traffic Information database.
               (1) Count data for segments showing a "-" in the date column was obtained from the 2009 Florida Department of Transportation Florida Traffic Information database. Note that the PHPD volume shown was calculated by applying standard K (0.097) & D (0.55) factors to the reported AADT due to the lack of hourly data.
               (1) Count data collected prior to 2009 was either obtained from the 2008 Florida Department of Transportation Florida Traffic Information database or the previous CMP Update due to lack of more recent data.

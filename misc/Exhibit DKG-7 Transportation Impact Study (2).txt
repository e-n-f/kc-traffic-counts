1.0    Project Description

   This Traffic Impact Study examines the effects of the construction of a new
   intersection with US 85/87 in the vicinity of the existing Duckwood Road. The
   analysis includes impacts for the projected build-out Year 2010 and long-
   range planning Year 2030.

   The proposed intersection would include an extension of the existing C&S
   Road west to US 85/87. The existing eastbound Duckwood Road approach
   to US 85/87 is anticipated to be relocated approximately 250-feet to the
   south and aligned with the new intersection. The existing railroad crossing
   and intersection of South Mesa Road and US 85/87 is anticipated to be
   closed in conjunction with this project.

2.0    Existing Conditions

   The roadways within the vicinity of the project are detailed below:

   US 85/87: In the vicinity of the proposed intersection, US 85/87 is a two-lane
   north/south roadway. It is classified by the Colorado Department of
   Transportation (CDOT) as a Non-Rural Principal Highway (NR-A) It currently
   has a posted 50 mph speed limit in the project vicinity.

   South Mesa Road: South Mesa Road is a two-lane east/west roadway
   classified by the City as a Community Arterial. The existing one-way stop-
   controlled intersection and railroad crossing with US 85/87 is anticipated to
   be closed as a result of the construction of the Duckwood/C&S Road
   intersection. The posted speed limit on South Mesa Road is 35 mph.

   Duckwood Road: Duckwood Road is a local east/west roadway that
   currently provides an eastbound stop-controlled access to US 85/87 for
   Fountain Creek Regional Park and adjacent commercial/industrial
   development on the west side of the highway. This roadway, when
   realigned, is anticipated to function as the west leg of the proposed
   intersection.

   C&S Road:      C&S Road is a two-lane east/west roadway currently
   classified by the City as a Community Collector. C&S Road currently
   terminates at Monterrey Way, approximately one-half mile to the east of US
   85/87. This roadway is anticipated to function as the east leg of the
   proposed intersection. The posted speed limit on C&S Road to the east of
   Monterrey Way is 30 mph.

   Comanche Village Drive: Comanche Village Drive is a two-lane, east/west
   roadway classified by the City as a Community Collector. The intersection of
   Comanche Village Drive/US85/87 currently functions as a one-way,
   westbound stop-controlled intersection. The creation of a new access to US
   85/87 north of Comanche Village Drive would be anticipated to draw some
   existing traffic away from this intersection. The posted speed limit on
   Comanche Village Drive in the vicinity of US 85/87 is 30 mph.

   Mesa Ridge Parkway:          Mesa Ridge Parkway is a 2-4 lane roadway that
   connects Interstate 25 with the existing southern end of Powers Boulevard. To
   the west of US 85/87, Mesa Ridge Parkway is also known as State Highway 16,
   and is classified by CDOT as a an Expressway (EX). East of the interchange
   with US 85/87, this roadway becomes a City street and is classified as a
   Regional Arterial. The posted speed limit on Mesa Ridge Parkway near US
   85/87 is 45 mph.

   2.1         Existing Traffic Volumes

   Existing traffic volume turning movement counts were conducted at the
   following intersections for the morning peak (7am-9am) and evening peak
   (4pm-6pm) periods:

         US 85/87 / Mesa Ridge Parkway Eastbound Ramps
         US 85/87 / Mesa Ridge Parkway Westbound Ramps
         US 85/87 / South Mesa Road
         US 85/87 / Duckwood Road
         US 85/87 / Comanche Village Drive

   Traffic counts were conducted by All Traffic Data Services, Inc. on Tuesday
   August 5, 2008, the results of which are illustrated in Figure 2. Complete
   printouts of all traffic counts can be found in the Appendix of this report.

   Council of Governments (PPACG) was used to determine appropriate rates
   of growth for the area surrounding the proposed Duckwood intersection. This
   output can be seen in the Appendix.

   The model provided by PPACG does not account for the addition of the
   proposed Duckwood/C&S roadway, therefore, the model predictions for
   both South Mesa Road and Comanche Village Drive were examined to
   determine potential growth at the proposed intersection. Combined, the
   east legs of the two intersections are anticipated to experience a 3.4%
   growth rate. This rate was then used to determine the anticipated traffic
   growth for the proposed intersection.

   The CDOT historical growth along US 85/87 is approximately 2.6%. This
   approximates the anticipated growth as predicted by the PPACG model.
   This growth rate was applied to the through movements of US 85/87. The
   CDOT historical data can be seen in the Appendix.

   3.2         Effects of System Changes

   The addition of the proposed Duckwood intersection, combined with the
   removal of the existing South Mesa Road intersection, is anticipated to
   change the distribution of vehicles compared to what is currently observed.
   It was assumed that a portion of the vehicles currently using the South Mesa
   Road access would shift to the new intersection. The majority of those
   vehicles not accommodated by the new intersection would be absorbed by
   either Mesa Ridge Parkway or Syracuse Street.

   As it would likely be more convenient for some drivers, a portion of vehicles
   observed using the Comanche Village / US 85/87 intersection would also shift
   to the proposed Duckwood/C&S roadway facilities.

   The following table illustrates the anticipated percentage of traffic from each
   of these two intersections that are expected to use the Duckwood
   intersection.

   3.3          Additional Background Traffic

   The City requests that the anticipated additional background traffic resulting
   from the development of three projects in the vicinity be added to the
   analysis. The first project accounted for is the Crescent Canyon subdivision
   to be located to the south of South Mesa Road and east of the existing
   railroad tracks. The second is the proposed Parkview commercial/industrial
   development anticipated adjacent to the intersection of US 85/87 and Rice
   Lane. The final study is the Independence Place development at the
   intersection of US 85/87 and Cattail Marsh Road.

   The Crescent Canyon study is a proposed 650 dwelling unit subdivision with
   primary access to South Mesa Road. The impact study for the Crescent
   Canyon Subdivision assumed the restriction of the US 85/87 / South Mesa
   Road intersection to the right-in, right-out movements. As part of this study it
   was assumed that the intersection will be removed. This development is
   expected to generate approximately 425 new trips during the morning peak
   hour and 560 trips during the evening peak hour. Traffic was routed through
   the intersection in question following the basic distribution patterns
   anticipated as part of the related impact study.


Duckwood Intersection Transportation Impact Study, C7928                            Page 9
H:\C7928\Reports\Traffic\C7928 TIS.doc       August 2008
   The impact study for the Parkview Subdivision was performed in 2002 by LSC
   Transportation Consultants assumed that all traffic added as a result of
   project-generated traffic would use US 85/87, with a 50/50 north/south split.
   This project was assumed to generate an additional 250 trips during the
   morning peak hour and 450 trips during the evening peak hour. No project-
   generated traffic was assigned to South Mesa Road within this report. For the
   purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that 10% of project-generated traffic
   would come from or go to the east leg of the proposed Duckwood
   intersection.

   While the land to the south and west of the existing Duckwood Road is
   largely part of the Fountain Creek Regional Park, There is currently light
   industrial development occupying the land to the north of Duckwood Road.
   In addition, a 300 unit multi-family residential development called
   "Independence Place" (LSC Inc., 2007) is anticipated to be located at the
   current terminus of Cattail Marsh Road.

   Per conversations with the City, it is anticipated that this subdivision will gain
   its primary access via Cattail Marsh Road, which was anticipated by its Traffic
   Impact Analysis to be signalized prior to Year 2030.              Between the
   Independence Place Development and Duckwood Road, there is
   approximately 10.2 acres of developable land to the north of Duckwood
   Road.      This land, when it is redeveloped, is expected to take its primary
   access via the Duckwood Road intersection. Using similar land use and
   densities as the Independence Place development, this would equate to
   approximately 165 apartment units. Per ITE trip generation rates, this
   development would be expected to generate a total of 85 morning and 105
   evening peak hour trips. These trips are accounted for at the Duckwood
   intersection during the Year 2030 analysis.

   Projected background traffic volumes for Years 2010 and 2030 are illustrated
   in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

4.0       Projected Intersection Capacity
   4.1         Anticipated Traffic Control

   After determining the anticipated traffic volumes at the proposed
   Duckwood intersection, the applicable traffic control measures should be
   evaluated. The following section explores the two likely options for traffic
   control, two-way stop-control on the east/westbound legs of the intersection
   and the addition of a traffic signal.

   The following exhibit gives definitions of Level of Service for both signalized
   and unsignalized intersections per criteria specified in the Highway Capacity
   Manual, 2000.


   SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION
   Level of                                                                                              Control Delay

   A           Progress is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during                               <=10
               the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle
               lengths may contribute to low delay.
      B        Good progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles                             >10 and <=20
               vehicles stop than with LOS A.
      C        Fair progression, short cycle lengths or both. The number of                              >20 and <=35
               vehicles stopping at the intersection is significant at this level,
               although many pass through the intersection without stopping.
      D        Longer delays result from some combination of unfavorable                                 >35 and <=55
               progression, long cycle length, or high v/c ratios. Many
               stop.
      E        High delay values generally indicate poor progression, long                               >55 and <=80
               cycle length, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are
               frequent occurrences.
      F        This level often occurs with over saturation when arrival flow                                 >80
               rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. Poor progression
               and long cycle lengths may be major contributing factors to
               such delay levels.


   STOP-CONTROLLED INTERSECTION
   LOS         Expected Delay to Minor Street Traffic                                      Average Control Delay (s/veh)

      A        Little or no delay.                                                                           0-10
      B        Short traffic delays.                                                                        >10-15
      C        Average traffic delays.                                                                      >15-25
      D        Long traffic delays.                                                                         >25-35
      E        Very long traffic delays.                                                                    >35-50
      F        When volume exceeds the capacity of the lane, extreme delays will be encountered with           >50
               queuing that may cause severe congestion affecting other traffic movements in the intersection.
               This condition usually warrants improving the intersection.

   are detailed below and in Table 2. Supporting Synchro analysis, including
   capacity, delay, and queuing analyses can be found in the Appendix of this
   report.

   Year 2010 Unsignalized Intersection:
   This intersection was modeled as a two-way east-westbound stop-controlled
   intersection under the anticipated Year 2010 peak hour conditions. The
   following table illustrates the delay expected if this intersection were to be
   stop-controlled.

                                                Table 1

   While high delay is often experienced along the minor legs of satisfactorily
   operating intersections, the very high delay anticipated on the westbound
   approach indicates that stop-control would most likely not be an
   acceptable alternative for traffic control at this location.

   While this intersection is not anticipated to operate satisfactorily under two-
   way stop-control, this intersection is required to meet at least one of the
   Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2003, (MUTCD) traffic signal
   warrants if signal control can be considered at this location.

   Four Hour Vehicular Volume Warrant:
   As only peak hour volumes were projected for this intersection, a direct
   analysis of the four volumes cannot be completed.

   As shown on the following page, when the existing South Mesa Road
   intersection's four hour turning movement counts are examined this
   intersection currently warrants a signal given the volumes experienced at this
   location.

               Four Hour Vehicular Warrant - South Mesa Road

                      7:00-9:00 am 4:00-6:00 pm Combined Hourly average
     Major Approaches          1415         2481     3896            974
      Minor Approach            379          228      607            152


   Given an major approach hourly average vehicles per hour in excess of 900,
   the four hour volume needed to trigger the 70% criteria warrant (85th
   percentile speeds on US 85 are expected to be greater than 40 mph) is 60
   vph at the existing location.

   The projected minor approach peak hour volumes at the proposed
   Duckwood intersection are higher than those at the existing South Mesa
   intersection. It can be assumed that the four hour warrant will be met
   following completion of the proposed Duckwood intersection, even using the
   more stringent requirements of two-lane approaches in both the major and
   minor directions.

   Peak Hour Vehicular Volume Warrant:
   Using the estimated volumes, a peak hour volume warrant can also be
   performed to assess the necessity of a traffic signal at this location. The
   following exhibit shows the anticipated Year 2010 peak hour volumes for both
   major approaches and the higher minor approach.

                   Projected Peak Hour Warrant - Duckwood Road

                                 Morning Peak Evening Peak

            Minor Approach                 395          260



   Utilizing the 70% criteria and a major approach volume greater than 1000
   vph, the peak hour volume warrant is satisfied when the higher volume minor
   approach exceeds 150 vph, assuming two or more lanes of traffic on every
   approach. The peak hour volume warrant is projected to be satisfied during
   both the morning and evening peak hours following construction.

   4.2             Intersection Level of Service

   The following analysis assumes a fully-actuated, uncoordinated traffic signal
   with a 90 second cycle length and the lane geometries used in Figure 1. The
   southbound left movement is anticipated to have protected/permitted
   phasing.

   The follow table shows the anticipated Level of Service given the stated
   conditions for both the Year 2010 and 2030 projected volumes at the
   Duckwood Road / US 85/87 intersection.

   Each approach is anticipated to operate acceptably through the long-term
   planning horizon, however, analysis indicates that the southbound left
   movement may average 76 seconds (LOS E) in the Year 2030 analysis. Care
   should be taken to ensure that delay and queuing issues at this movement
   do not interfere with long-term signal operation.

   The City of Fountain Transportation Master Plan, 2002, indicates that the
   addition of a second through lane in each direction of US 85/87 is desirable
   within the long-term planning horizon. The following table shows what the
   Year 2030 delay would be anticipated to be at this intersection if additional
   through lanes are added to US 85/87.

   With the addition of a second through lane on US 85/87, this intersection,
   including the southbound left movement, is anticipated to operate
   acceptably through Year 2030.


   4.3         Storage Length

   The following analysis describes the expected storage queue lengths for
   each of the proposed approaches for the Duckwood Road intersection.

   Southbound Approach:
   This approach is currently anticipated to contain a right turn deceleration
   lane and a single left turn bay.

   The right turn deceleration lane should be designed to conform to the State
   Highway Access Code, 2002. Per Access Code criteria for a State highway
   with a posted speed limit of 50 mph and a NR-A classification, the right turn
   deceleration lane should be 500 feet, which includes a 180-foot taper.

   The left turn lane length is the same as that for the right turn lane, with the
   addition of a storage length component. Per access code criteria, the
   southbound left turning storage component should be 300 feet, as greater
   than 300 vph would be expected to use this movement. This yields a total
   length of 800 feet, including a 180-foot taper.

   Northbound Approach:
   This approach is currently anticipated to contain a right turn deceleration
   lane and a single left turn bay.

   As with the southbound approach, the right turn deceleration lane should be
   a total of 500 feet, including a 180-foot taper length.

Duckwood Intersection Transportation Impact Study, C7928                              Page 17
H:\C7928\Reports\Traffic\C7928 TIS.doc       August 2008
   The design of the northbound left turn lane depends on the development
   scenario anticipated for the private land to the north of the existing
   Duckwood Road. Given the anticipated land use, the northbound left
   turning movement is expected to remain below 30 vph, requiring only 25 feet
   of additional storage beyond the 500 feet needed for the taper and
   deceleration lane.

   Eastbound Approach:
   This approach is currently anticipated to contain a right turn bay with a
   southbound acceleration lane and a single left turn bay.

   Given the existing and projected future development to the west of US 85/87,
   the 95th percentile queue lengths on this approach are anticipated to remain
   at 60 feet or less, therefore the 75 feet of planned storage should be
   satisfactory.

   The right turn movement is currently anticipated to have an acceleration
   lane going in the southbound direction of US 85/87. Following Access Code
   criteria, this lane should be 760 feet long. This includes a 180-foot taper
   length.

   Westbound Approach:
   This approach is currently anticipated to contain a right turn bay with an
   acceleration lane in the northbound direction of US 85/87. The left turning
   movement is anticipated to be accomplished by making the proposed
   inside through lane of C&S Road a left turn only lane at US 85/87.

   No turn lane is anticipated to have a 95th percentile queue longer than 150
   feet through the long-term planning horizon. The two anticipated approach
   lanes of westbound C&S Road are expected to have sufficient storage to
   handle this traffic.

   As with the eastbound movement, the northbound acceleration lane should
   be 760 feet per Access Code requirements. This includes the taper length of
   180 feet.

   4.4         Adjacent At-Grade Crossing

   The proposed intersection has a special concern not typically encountered
   at most signalized locations. The joint UP/BNSF railroad tracks run parallel to
   US 85/87, and have the potential to add additional delay to movements
   associated with the east leg of the intersection.

   This railroad line experiences heavy coal train activity, and assuming a train
   length of 6,000 feet (Approximately 110 car train length) and a speed of 20
   mph, this area is expected to see blockages of approximately 3.5 minutes in
   length. The southbound left, northbound right, as well as both the east and
   westbound approaches are expected to be affected by this blockage.

   Southbound Left Movement:
   This movement is anticipated to see as many as 510 vph during the Year 2030
   evening peak hour. Using a Peak Hour Factor (PHF) of 0.92, the peak fifteen
   minutes would see an hourly flow rate of 555 vph. Over the course of a 3.5
   minute blockage, queues of (555/60)*3.5 = 33 vehicles could be anticipated.
   Using an average vehicle length of 25 feet, this equates to a queue of 825
   feet.

   It is mostly likely impractical to design this lane to accommodate a storage
   length of this distance. Approximately 75% of the potentially queued
   vehicles can be accommodated by the full-width portion of the
   deceleration lane as anticipated. It would be desirable to shorten the taper
   of this lane to maximize the storage capacity of this lane. Other intersections,
   such as Comanche Village Drive and Ohio Avenue would also be available
   to accommodate traffic not serviced by this intersection.

   Northbound Right Movement:
   This movement is anticipated to see as many as 310 vph during the Year 2030
   evening peak hour. Using a PHF of 0.92, the peak fifteen minutes would see
   an hourly flow rate of 337 vph. Over the course of a 3.5 minute blockage,
   queues of (337/60)*3.5 = 20 vehicles could be anticipated. Using an average
   vehicle length of 25 feet, this equates to a queue of 500 feet. Assuming that
   there would be approximately 100 feet of storage between the US 85/87
   intersection and the stop line of the railroad tracks and 500 feet of
   deceleration lane, this queue should be accommodated by the proposed
   roadway, if the taper is neglected. It may be desirable to shorten the taper
   on this deceleration lane to 100 feet, providing an additional 80 feet of
   storage for this movement. This would provide the calculated 500 feet of
   potential storage



Duckwood Intersection Transportation Impact Study, C7928              Page 19
H:\C7928\Reports\Traffic\C7928 TIS.doc       August 2008
   Westbound Approach:
   The total number of vehicles expected to approach the tracks from the east
   during the Year 2030 morning peak hour is 610 vph. Using a PHF of 0.92, this
   equates to a peak hour flow rate of 665 vph. Over 3.5 minutes, 39 vehicles
   could be expected to approach the train tracks. Assuming 60% of traffic
   uses the outside approach lane, this would yield a queue of 585 feet during a
   3.5 minute period. This should be accommodated by the proposed
   roadway. However, care should be taken to ensure that any future Syracuse
   Street intersection would not be blocked by a queue of this length.


   Eastbound Approach:
   Under existing development conditions, the traffic on this approach should
   not increase significantly. Using existing conditions queues lengths should not
   exceed 2-3 vehicles during a 3.5 minute period of blockage. Given the
   anticipated future land use, queues in any lane of this approach are not
   projected to exceed 60 feet.


5.0      Recommendations

   5.1         Traffic Signal

   The proposed Duckwood Road intersection is anticipated to meet at least
   two MUTCD traffic signal warrants upon completion. A traffic signal is
   recommended at this location upon completion of the project.

   5.2         Intersection Lane Geometry

   The conceptual lane geometry in Figure 1 appears to be appropriate to
   handle projected traffic, especially if an additional through lane is added to
   each direction of US 85/87 prior to Year 2030. However, the length of the
   auxiliary acceleration and deceleration lanes on US 85/87 should be
   designed to comply with State Highway Access Code criteria. This is
   especially important for the southbound left and northbound right
   movements, as they would be expected to accommodate long queues
   when the eastern leg of the intersection is blocked by train traffic.

6.0    Conclusions

   If the recommendations of this report are followed, the proposed intersection
   of Duckwood Road and US 85/87 should be able to accommodate area
   traffic growth through Year 2030.

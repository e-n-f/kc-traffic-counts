                                                      The August 2008 Amended Site Plan Approval issued to Oracle USA, Inc. (Oracle)
                                                      allows the construction of a three-phase office development, totaling 420,000± square
                                                      feet (sf), on Van de Graaff Drive in Burlington, Massachusetts. To date, two
                                                      buildings, totaling 319,000± sf, have been constructed in Phases I and II. The Phase I
                                                      building is 170,000± sf and is located at 10 Van de Graaff Drive. The Phase II building
                                                      is 149,000± sf and is located at 8 Van de Graaff Drive. The remaining 101,000± sf of
                                                      approved office space can be constructed by-right at 6 Van de Graaff Drive as part of
                                                      Phase III development of the Oracle campus. In addition to fully occupying the two
                                                      existing buildings at 8 and 10 Van de Graaff Drive, Oracle has recently acquired an
                                                      existing 93,000± sf office building located at 4 Van de Graaff Drive.

                                                      Oracle employees currently work in that building and its traffic operational
                                                      characteristics are similar to those of the other two buildings at 8 and 10 Van de
                                                      Graaff Drive. Therefore, for traffic analysis purposes, the full build-out of the Oracle
                                                      campus, as currently approved, is assumed to comprise of four buildings, including the
                                                      three existing, fully occupied buildings totaling 412,000± sf (170,000± sf + 149,000± sf
                                                      + 93,000± sf), which leaves 101,000± sf of approved office space to be constructed in
                                                      the fourth building.

                                                      Since the construction of Phase II, hiring at Oracle has experienced significant growth
                                                      trends, which partly led to the acquisition and addition of 4 Van de Graaff Drive to
                                                      the campus. Further, in order to satisfy their continued growth needs, Oracle has
                                                      determined that a 125,000 sf building will be needed at 6 Van de Graaff Drive. This
                                                      represents an additional 24,000 sf over the remaining 101,000± sf of previously
                                                      approved Phase III office space.

                                                      Additionally, in order to accommodate Oracle's unique operational model wherein
                                                      seasonal increases in parking demand are experienced during specific times of the
                                                      year (for example, a few weeks at the end of each fiscal quarter) while noticeably less
                                                      activity is experienced during other times, it is proposed that the previously
                                                      approved parking ratio for Phases I, II and III be increased from 3.6 to approximately
                                                      4.0. Oracle plans to construct a parking garage at 6 Van de Graaff Drive to support
                                                      the additional parking demand, and to replace some of the existing as well as the
                                                      previously approved but not yet constructed surface parking spaces that will be
                                                      displaced by the Phase III office building and the enhanced green/open space that is
                                                      shown in the Site Plans.

                                                      traffic impact assessment. It covers the following specific items that are relevant to
                                                      the current development plan and the campus' prior permitting history.

                                                            It satisfies Condition 9 of the August 4, 2008 Amended Site Plan Approval
                                                            granted by the Burlington Planning Board which requires that prior to the

                                                            existing Oracle buildings on Van de Graaff Drive.

                                                            It quantifies estimated traffic impacts associated with the construction of the final
                                                            office building at 6 Van de Graaff Drive, currently proposed to be 125,000± sf.

                                                            It presents estimates of seasonal traffic volume increases associated with the
                                                            increase in parking ratio from 3.6 to 4.0.

                                                            Consistent with the discussion in Condition 12.b of the May 11, 2000 Site Plan
                                                            Approval, it presents an analysis of the traffic operational impacts associated
                                                            with a secondary driveway access from the Oracle campus onto Blanchard Road.

                                                      Guidance provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation
                                                      Manual,1 formed the general basis and the starting point in the development of the
                                                      Phase III trip projections in the TIAS. However, in order to correctly reflect Oracle-
                                                      specific operational data such as employee counts during seasonal peak/typical
                                                      conditions, employee work schedules that are tied to Oracle's formal and informal
                                                      "Flex Program," residential zip code data, driveway monitoring counts, etc. were
                                                      used to supplement and further refine the ITE based calculations.

                                                      During typical Oracle operations (i.e., during non-seasonal peak times), Phase III
                                                      would generate approximately 170 new trips (enter + exit) during the weekday
                                                      morning peak hour and 150 new trips (enter + exit) during the weekday evening peak
                                                      hour. This represents a nominal increase of only 30 to 35 peak hour trips when
                                                      compared to the previously approved Phase III office space.

                                                      During Oracle's seasonal peak times at various times of the year, use of the proposed
                                                      additional parking spaces on the campus would generate approximately 110 new trips
                                                      (enter + exit) during the weekday morning peak hour and 115 new trips (enter + exit)
                                                      during the weekday evening peak hour. The overall campus will have minimal
                                                      Saturday and Sunday operations, consistent with typical office uses, which would
                                                      benefit traffic operations on certain major roadways in the area such as Middlesex
                                                      Turnpike and Burlington Mall Road that are characterized by weekend retail shopping
                                                      related activity.

                                                      As shown on the Phase III Site Plans, Oracle proposes to relocate the the currently

                                                      and operate it as a full-access driveway on a permanent basis, subject to the Planning
                                                      Board's approval. This study includes a review of two potential configurations for
                                                      the Blanchard Road driveway for consideration by the Town; a full access driveway,
                                                      consistent with the references in the 2000 Site Plan Approval, and an exit only
                                                      driveway, consistent with the January 2012 Board of Selectmen's approval. Detailed
                                                      analyses presented in this report demonstrates that neither the two-way driveway
                                                      nor the one-way driveway configuration has the potential to negatively impact traffic
                                                      operations on Blanchard Road. The analysis also shows that since traffic operations
                                                      on Blanchard Road are not much different with either a one-way or a two-way
                                                      driveway, it would be beneficial from a regional traffic flow perspective, to allow
                                                      two-way operations at the driveway and help reduce the congestion at some of the
                                                      study area signalized intersections and to provide employees the option to enter and
                                                      exit the Oracle campus via two different routes.

                                                      The TIAS evaluates traffic operations and safety conditions of existing roadways,
                                                      analyzes the impact of background traffic growth and projects the impacts of the
                                                      Phase III development during typical and seasonal peak conditions, with and without
                                                      traffic improvement measures in place. Capacity analyses show that deficiencies exist
                                                      currently within the study area independent of the Project.

                                                      The 2000 Site Plan Approval required Oracle to implement a series of traffic
                                                      improvement and trip reduction measures that would offset the impacts of the entire
                                                      Oracle campus. Improvements of significant scope and magnitude called out in the
                                                      2000 Approval include widening of Van de Graff Drive and South Bedford Street,
                                                      signalization of the intersection of Van de Graff Drive/South Bedford Street,
                                                      monetary contribution towards improving the intersection of South Bedford
                                                      Street/Blanchard Road, sidewalk improvements on South Bedford Street,
                                                      construction of a multi-use path on the Oracle campus, and a series of Transportation
                                                      Demand Management (TDM) strategies to reduce peak hour travel.

                                                      It should be noted that even though the improvements listed above were developed
                                                      to support the entire Oracle master Plan, Oracle implemented all of the measures
                                                      prior to the construction of Phase II of the campus. While the currently proposed
                                                      Phase III development does not represent a significant increase in traffic impacts
                                                      when compared to the originally contemplated Phase III, and it is expected to only
                                                      result in a nominal increase in traffic volume during most of the year, Oracle is
                                                      committed to funding the design and construction of additional potential
                                                      improvement measures identified in this study. The improvements include the
                                                      following measures:

                                                            Constructing a driveway onto Blanchard Road to serve as a secondary means of
                                                            access/ egress to help relieve congestion for traffic heading to Route 128 and
                                                            Route 3.

                                                            Potentially modifying the lane configuration of Wayside Road westbound to
                                                            allow through traffic to travel in both lanes instead of a single lane.

                                                      implemented by Oracle to date. They will be designed to further offset the impacts of
                                                      the Project as well as improve some of the existing deficiencies.

                                            Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. (VHB), on behalf of Oracle USA, Inc. (Oracle), has
                                            prepared a traffic impact and access study in support of the Phase III expansion of
                                            the Oracle campus on Van de Graff Drive in Burlington, Massachusetts (the
                                            "Project"). This study quantifies existing and projected future traffic conditions with
                                            the Project. In addition, it recommends potential capacity and safety improvements
                                            for the study area intersections and roadways to ensure safe access to the Site and to
                                            mitigate any existing deficiencies.



Project Description
                                            The location of the Oracle campus is shown in Figure 1. A copy of the Site Layout
                                            Plan is included in the Appendix for reference.

                                            Oracle proposes to construct a 125,000 sf office building and additional parking as
                                            part of Phase III development plan. 101,000 sf of the proposed office space and a
                                            parking ratio of 3.6 have already been approved by the Town of Burlington. Thus,
                                            the currently proposed Phase III represents an increase of 24,000 sf in office space
                                            and an increase in parking ratio from 3.6 to 4.0 when compared to the previously
                                            approved totals.



Study Methodology
                                            This study was conducted in three stages. The first stage involved an assessment of
                                            existing traffic conditions in the study area and included an inventory of roadway
                                            geometry, observations of traffic flow, collection of daily and peak period traffic
                                            counts and a review of safety data.

                                            In the second stage, future traffic conditions without the Project were projected and
                                            analyzed for a five-year time horizon. Not all Oracle employees are on the campus
                                            every day, between the typical office hours of 8 AM to 5 PM. Data provided by
                                            Oracle suggests that:

                                                Only 50% of Oracle employees are on the campus more than 70% of the time;
                                                30% of the employees are on the campus 20-70% of the time; and,
                                                20% of the employees are on the campus less than 20% of the time.

                                            To account for this wide range of employee level fluctuations on the campus, two
                                            separate analyses scenarios were reviewed in the second stage of the study. The first
                                            analysis scenario, presented in the main body of the TIAS, represents "typical"
                                            Oracle operations (i.e., non-seasonal peak times). A second scenario, representing
                                            Oracle's seasonal peak times that occur at various times of the year, is presented in
                                            the Appendix.

                                            The third stage of the study evaluates measures to address traffic operational and
                                            safety issues identified in the second stage of the study. Oracle's current
                                            Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures that contribute to a
                                            noticeable reduction in trip generation during most of the year is also summarized in
                                            this stage.

                                            Evaluation of the transportation impacts associated with the Project requires a
                                            thorough understanding of the existing transportation conditions in the Project study
                                            area including, roadway geometry, traffic controls, daily and peak hour traffic flow,
                                            and traffic safety data. Each of these elements is described in detail below.



Study Area
                                            Based on a review of previous traffic studies conducted for the Oracle campus, an
                                            understanding of the area roadway network, and the expected traffic characteristics
                                            of the Project, a study area was defined to encompass roadway segments that would
                                            be used the most by Project traffic. This includes locations along Van de Graaff Drive,
                                            Wayside Road, Cambridge Street, Blanchard Road/Wheeler Road and along
                                            Middlesex Turnpike. Specifically, the following locations and their approaches were
                                            analyzed in the study. Figure 1 shows the study locations on the locus map.

                                                Van de Graff Drive/Wayside Road at South Bedford Street
                                                Wayside Road/Wall Street at Cambridge Street
                                                Blanchard Road at South Bedford Street
                                                Blanchard Road/Wheeler Road at Muller Road
                                                Middlesex Turnpike at Wheeler Road (east)
                                                Middlesex Turnpike at I-95 Northbound ramps/Wheeler Road (west)
                                                Middlesex Turnpike at I-95 Southbound ramps

                                            The existing conditions analysis consisted of an inventory of the traffic control,
                                            roadway, driveway and intersection geometry in the study area, the collection of
                                            daily and peak hour traffic volumes, and a review of recent crash history.

Roadway


Van de Graaff Drive/ Wayside Road

                                            Van de Graaff Drive is the dead-end local street that currently serves as the only
                                            access road to travel to the Oracle campus. It runs in an east-west direction between
                                            South Bedford Street and the Oracle campus. Several other office tenants and a hotel
                                            are also served by the roadway. Approximately 700 feet of the roadway, west of
                                            South Bedford Street, has a four-lane cross-section. The remaining length of the
                                            roadway, towards the Oracle campus, has a three-lane cross-section. There are no
                                            marked shoulders on the roadway. A concrete sidewalk is located on a majority of
                                            the north side of the roadway. A multi-use trail runs along the length of the
                                            southerly side of the roadway, connecting to the off-road trail located behind the
                                            Oracle campus. There are no visible posted speed limit signs on Van de Graaff Drive
                                            within the study area.

                                            Van de Graaff Drive, east of South Bedford Street becomes Wayside Road. Wayside
                                            Road runs in an east-west direction and connects South Bedford Street and
                                            Cambridge Street. It is a four lane roadway with narrow shoulders and is under local
                                            jurisdiction. There are sidewalks on both sides of the road. Wayside Road provides
                                            access to the Wayside Commons shopping center and several office buildings.



South Bedford Street

                                            South Bedford Street is a three lane roadway between Blanchard Road and Van de
                                            Graaff Drive. It widens to a four-lane roadway north of Van de Graaff Drive and
                                            narrows to two-lane road south of Blanchard Road. It runs in a general north-south
                                            direction and is under local jurisdiction. Paved shoulders of varying widths are
                                            located on both sides of the roadway. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the
                                            roadway, north of Van de Graaff Drive and only on the west side between Van de
                                            Graaff Drive and Blanchard Road. There are not sidewalks on the roadway south of
                                            Blanchard Road. There are no visible posted speed limit signs within the study area.
                                            South Bedford Street provides access to office buildings, the Wayside Commons
                                            shopping center, some residential land uses and a satellite campus for Northeastern
                                            University.



Blanchard Road/ Wheeler Road (east)

                                            Blanchard Road/Wheeler Road (east) is a windy, two-lane roadway that connects
                                            South Bedford Street and Middlesex Turnpike. Blanchard Road, west of Muller Road,
                                            becomes Wheeler Road (east). It runs in an east-west direction and abuts the
                                            southern boundary of the Oracle campus. This roadway is under local jurisdiction

                                            and the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour (mph). There are no shoulders or
                                            sidewalks along the road. Mary Cummings Park is located to the south of Blanchard
                                            Road. Other land uses in the vicinity mainly include commercial and residential uses.



Middlesex Turnpike

                                            Middlesex Turnpike is a north-south, suburban arterial roadway that is under local
                                            jurisdiction except for a short section between the Route 128 northbound and
                                            southbound ramps, which is owned and maintained by MassDOT. Between the
                                            Route 128 ramps and Wheeler Road(east), Middlesex Turnpike is a four- to six-lane,
                                            median-divided roadway, with a posted speed limit of 35 mph in each direction.
                                            Sidewalks are provided on the westerly side of Middlesex Turnpike, north of the
                                            Route 128 southbound ramps and on the easterly side, south of Wheeler Road(east).
                                            Middlesex Turnpike provides access to Route 128, the Burlington Mall, a movie
                                            theater, office buildings, and other commercial and retail land uses.

Traffic Volumes
                                            Traffic volume counts for the study area roadways and intersections were compiled
                                            using traffic counts conducted in April 2012, September 2012, and May 2013. In
                                            addition, weekday evening peak hour data for the three study intersections on
                                            Middlesex Turnpike that were collected in September 2011 as part of other studies
                                            were used in the analysis.

                                            In general, all weekday peak hour turning movement counts (TMCs) were collected on
                                            typical weekdays from 7:00 to 9:00 AM and 4:00 to 6:00 PM at the study area
                                            intersections. In addition to TMC data, the traffic data collection also included
                                            automatic traffic recorder (ATR) counts along Van De Graaff Drive near the Oracle
                                            campus and on Blanchard Road. The Van De Graaff Drive ATR data was used in trip
                                            generation calculations as discussed later in this report. A summary of the ATR traffic
                                            and speed data for Blanchard Road are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

                                            morning and between 4:45 PM and 5:45 PM on a typical weekday evening. The
                                            network peak hour for the three intersections on Middlesex Turnpike was also
                                            determined to be generally between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM on a typical weekday
                                            morning and between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM on a typical weekday evening.



Seasonal Adjustment
                                            The traffic data collected for this Project was obtained during the months of May and
                                            September. To quantify the seasonal variation of traffic volumes in the area, historic
                                            traffic data available from MassDOT were reviewed. According to published MassDOT
                                            weekday seasonal factors, May and September traffic counts are higher than average
                                            month conditions. To present a conservative analysis, the traffic volumes were not
                                            reduced to reflect average month conditions.

                                            Where appropriate, traffic volumes were balanced between the intersections to account
                                            for differences that resulted from collecting data on different dates. Where appropriate, a
                                            one percent growth rate was applied to the 2012 data to reflect 2013 traffic conditions.
                                            The resulting 2013 Existing traffic volume networks for the weekday morning and
                                            weekday evening peak hours are presented in Figures 3 and 4.



Crash History
                                            To identify potential vehicle crash trends in the study area, crash data were obtained
                                            for the study area intersections from MassDOT for the five most recent year period
                                            (2006 through 2010). A summary of the data is presented in Table 3.

                                            According to MassDOT District 4 (the MassDOT district for Burlington), the average
                                            crash rate for signalized intersections is 0.77 and for unsignalized intersections is
                                            0.58. This implies that on an average, there were 0.77 motor vehicle crashes at
                                            signalized intersections and 0.58 motor vehicle crashes at unsignalized intersections
                                            for every million vehicles that pass through intersections in the District.

                                            Due to limitations in the MassDOT database the location of some crashes at the
                                            Route 128/Middlesex Turnpike interchange could not be precisely determined from
                                            the database. Therefore, crashes at the interchange were separated into three
                                            categories:

                                            1.   Crashes occurring at the I-95 northbound ramps;
                                            2.   Crashes occurring at the I-95 southbound ramps; and
                                            3.   Crashes occurring at either one of these two locations (Unassigned I-95 ramps).

                                            As shown in Table 3, of the 272 total reported crashes at the study locations, 51
                                            occurred at the Route 128 southbound ramps and 30 at the northbound ramps. As
                                            discussed later in this report, improvements are planned by others at the intersection
                                            of Middlesex Turnpike at the Route 128 Northbound ramps/Wheeler Road (West).

                                            The intersection of Middlesex Turnpike at Wheeler Road (East) experienced a crash
                                            rate of 1.06, which is above the MassDOT District 4 average of 0.77. Approximately
                                            half of the crashes at this intersection were angle-type collisions. These types of
                                            collisions could indicate geometric deficiencies or inadequate traffic signal timing at
                                            the intersection. One prominent feature at the intersection that may contribute to the
                                            higher rate of collision is the two-way left-turn lane along the Middlesex Turnpike
                                            northbound approach. Various development projects in the area have identified
                                            improvements along the Middlesex Turnpike corridor to address safety and
                                            operational deficiencies.

                                            There were no reported crashes between 2006 and 2010 at the study area intersection
                                            of Blanchard Road/Wheeler Road at Muller Road. The remainder of the study area
                                            intersections experienced a crash rate lower than the MassDOT District 4 averages.

                                            Traffic volumes in the study area were projected to the year 2018, which reflects a
                                            five-year traffic-planning horizon. Independent of the Project, volumes on the
                                            roadway network under year 2018 No-Build conditions were assumed to include
                                            existing traffic and new traffic resulting from background traffic growth. As noted in
                                            Chapter 2, Oracle currently occupies approximately 412,000 sf of office space in three
                                            buildings. Under the Build condition, traffic that would be generated by the
                                            proposed 125,000 sf office building were added to reflect the year 2018 Build
                                            conditions. In addition, as noted in Chapter 1, an additional analysis scenario,
                                            representing Oracle's seasonal peak times that occur at various times of the year and
                                            the resulting effect of the higher parking ratio, is presented in the Appendix.



Background Traffic Growth
                                            Traffic growth on area roadways is a function of the expected land development,
                                            economic activity, and changes in demographics. Several methods can be used to
                                            estimate this growth. A procedure frequently employed is to estimate an annual
                                            percentage increase and apply that increase to study area traffic volumes. An
                                            alternative procedure is to identify estimated traffic generated by planned new major
                                            developments that would be expected to impact the project study area roadways. For
                                            the purpose of this assessment, both methods were utilized.


Historic Traffic Growth
                                            To be consistent with recent traffic studies prepared for other projects in the area, a
                                            one-percent annual growth rate was applied to existing traffic volumes. This annual
                                            growth rate accounts for some possibility of the area's vacant office buildings re-
                                            occupancy in the near future as well as the possibility of traffic growth resulting from
                                            other, unknown, developments likely to occur in the next five years.

Site-specific Growth
                                             In addition to accounting for background growth, the traffic associated with other
                                             planned and/or approved developments in the area were considered. A number of
                                             background developments were identified based on a review of studies prepared by
                                             VHB and others for other projects in the area. Table 4 identifies the location,
                                             proposed use, and approximate sizes of the background development projects
                                             included in the study.

                                             The 2018 No-Build conditions traffic volume networks were developed by applying
                                             the one-percent annual growth rate to the 2013 Existing traffic volume networks and
                                             adding the traffic generated by the background projects identified above. It should be
                                             noted that Keurig plans to relocate its corporate headquarters to the approved
                                             Burlington Research Center site at 43/63 South Avenue and their development is
                                             currently under construction. Instead of the approved development totals

                                            summarized in Table 4 for 43/63 South Avenue, the plans for the site now involve
                                            the construction of an initial 150,000 square foot development phase, followed by up
                                            to an additional 275,000 sf of building space. Regardless, to provide for a
                                            conservative evaluation, VHB used the trip assignment projections associated with
                                            the larger originally approved development scenario for that site instead of the
                                            current development plan.

                                            A summary of the peak period traffic volumes associated with the background
                                            developments is provided in the Appendix of this report. The 2018 No-Build
                                            conditions traffic volume networks for the weekday morning and evening peak
                                            hours are shown in Figures 5 and 6.


Adjustment for Use of Oracle's Unused Parking Supply
                                            Oracle offers a very robust Flex Program to its employees which has a noticeable
                                            positive effect on its trip generation on a daily basis. For example, a number of their
                                            employees, even though officially assigned to one of the buildings on Van de Graaff
                                            Drive, work from home, travel on a regular basis, or otherwise operate on a schedule
                                            that is not typical of office employees (such as arriving on the campus after 5 PM and
                                            staying past midnight). As such, fewer number of employees contribute to entering
                                            and exiting peak hour trips on a regular basis when compared to the total employee
                                            count assigned to the Oracle buildings on Van de Graaff Drive.

                                            An approximate parking accumulation study using the ATR traffic counts conducted
                                            in the first week of May 2013 indicates that approximately 100 parking spaces
                                            remain unoccupied even during the peak parking times of the day. These additional
                                            parking spaces are used by employees who visit the campus during the seasonal
                                            peak times. For analysis purposes, trip generation associated with the unused
                                            parking spaces have been included in the No-Build condition to account for the full
                                            utilization of the existing parking supply on the campus. As discussed later in this
                                            chapter, separating trip generation associated with unused parking spaces from the
                                            Build conditions analysis provides a more accurate representation of the trip
                                            generation for the proposed 125,000 sf Phase III office building as well as the
                                            increased parking ratio that are generally needed to support seasonal parking needs.

                                            Trip calculations associated with the unused parking spaces on the campus are in
                                            included in the Appendix of this study.



Planned Transportation Improvements in the Area
                                            Roadway and intersection improvements have been proposed by several of the
                                            proponents of the projects listed in Table 5. Specifically within the study area,
                                            improvements have been proposed at Middlesex Turnpike's intersections with both
                                            the Route 128 northbound ramps and Wheeler Road (east) as part of the Northwest

                                            the resulting roadways improvements will include the following. These
                                            improvements were included in the No-Build analysis included in this report.

                                                 a shared through-/right-turn lane;

                                                 The Route 128 northbound off-ramp will consist of an exclusive left-turn lane, a
                                                 shared left/through lane, and a channelized right-turn lane under Yield control;
                                                 and,

                                                 An optimal traffic signal timing plan for the intersection of Middlesex Turnpike
                                                 at Wheeler Road (east) to support the future traffic volume conditions.

                                            While additional improvements may occur at the intersection of Middlesex
                                            Turnpike/Route 128 northbound ramps and potentially at other locations in the
                                            corridor, the exact timeframe and nature of that work has not yet been finalized. For
                                            example additional changes at the intersection that were discussed include
                                            modifying the Route 128 northbound off-ramps' approach to provide dual right-turn
                                            lanes under signalized control. Such improvements were assumed to not occur
                                            within the five-year analysis horizon considered in this report.



Project-generated Traffic Volumes
                                            Design year 2018 Build traffic volumes for study area roadways were determined by
                                            estimating Project-generated traffic volumes and distributing these volumes over the
                                            study area roadways. The estimated Project-generated volumes were added to the
                                            2018 No-Build traffic volumes to develop the year 2018 Build traffic volume
                                            networks. The following sections describe the methodology used for developing the
                                            project-generated traffic volumes.


Validation of Existing Trip Generation
                                            The original trip generation analysis associated with the Oracle Master Plan dates
                                            back to 1999/2000. Analyses prepared as part of the Master Plan included trip
                                            generation estimates for the then proposed three Oracle buildings (6, 8 and 10 Van de
                                            Graaff Drive) totaling 420,000± sf. Before developing new trip generation estimates
                                            for the currently proposed 125,000 sf Phase III development as part of this study,
                                            prior trip estimates were first compared to actual traffic counts. The calculations

                                            part of the original Master Plan.

                                            2013 and trip estimates for 412,000 sf of occupied office space using the methodology

                                            4    Vehicles per hour


                                            A review of the comparison in Table 5 leads to the following findings.

                                                  Actual peak hour counts in the peak direction (entering traffic in the morning
                                                  and exiting traffic in the afternoon) are within a reasonable margin of error (-4%
                                                  to +7%) of the estimates.

                                                  Actual daily count is 490 trips less (or approximately 10% less) than the
                                                  estimated daily trip generation.

                                                  When compared to typical office uses, Oracle generates higher volume of
                                                  entering traffic during the afternoon peak hour (indicative of the Flex Program
                                                  usage by employees).

                                                  First week of May 2013 (when the traffic counts were completed) was identified
                                                  by Oracle as a time period when their seasonal traffic is potentially ramping up,
                                                  leading towards the end of a fiscal quarter. The fact that counts during that
                                                  period compare relatively well with estimated values suggests that traffic
                                                  volumes would have been lower in the weeks and months prior to the count
                                                  period (which are representative of Oracle's typical conditions). Alternately, if
                                                  counts were done towards the end of May (one of Oracle's seasonal peaks), the
                                                  counts would have been higher.

Future Trip Generation ­ Typical Conditions
                                            The currently proposed Phase III development will include the construction of a
                                            new 125,000 sf office building at 6 Van de Graaff Drive that will be occupied by
                                            Oracle employees. As identified in the prior section, under "typical" conditions (i.e.,
                                            non-seasonal peak times), the additional office space would likely generate less
                                            traffic than typical office uses. However, for analysis purposes, ITE's Trip Generation,
                                            9th Edition was used to estimate the traffic impacts of the new building under typical
                                            conditions. Specifically, ITE trip generation data for land use code (LUC) 750 (Office
                                            Park) was used in the calculations.

                                            Table 6 shows the average weekday trip generation summary for the proposed
                                            125,000 sf office building. For comparison, trip generation for the previously
                                            approved 101,000 sf Phase III office building is also shown in Table 6.

                                            As shown in Table 6, under typical, non-seasonal peak conditions, the Phase III office
                                            building is expected to generate approximately 1,300 new trips (enter + exit) on an
                                            average weekday, with 170 new trips (150 entering/20 exiting) during the weekday
                                            morning peak hour and 150 additional trips (20 entering/130 exiting) during the
                                            weekday evening peak hour. However, a majority of these additional trips have been
                                            approved as part of the overall Oracle Master Plan. As shown in the last column of
                                            Table 6, the additional 24,000 sf Phase III office space that has not yet been approved
                                            is expected to generate a nominal increase in traffic volumes under typical
                                            conditions.

Future Trip Generation ­ Seasonal Peak
                                            Oracle has indicated that during the end of fiscal quarters and at various discrete
                                            times during the year, their campus experiences a peak in employee counts. During
                                            such peak times, all available existing parking spaces are fully utilized. Oracle
                                            expects that this operational character of the campus will continue to remain in the
                                            future, after the Phase III office building is constructed. To accommodate this
                                            seasonal peak conditions, Oracle proposes to increase the previously approved
                                            parking ratio for Phases I, II and III from 3.6 to approximately 4.0.

                                            Trip generation during the seasonal peak was calculated using ITE estimates based on
                                            employee count (which in turn was developed using the future parking supply on the
                                            campus), as the independent variable. The calculation methodology is includes in the
                                            Appendix to this study. Table 7 summarizes the estimated seasonal trip generation for
                                            the campus.

                                            As shown in Table 7, during the seasonal peak conditions, the added parking supply
                                            is expected to generate approximately 110 to 115 new trips during the weekday
                                            morning and evening peak hours. As noted earlier, the seasonal capacity impacts of
                                            the added parking supply is discussed in the Appendix of this study.



Trip Distribution
                                            The directional distribution of traffic approaching and departing the Site is primarily
                                            a function of the future employees' places of residence. The trip distribution pattern
                                            for the employees of the Project was developed using employee residence zip code
                                            data provided by Oracle for the three existing office buildings located at 4, 8 and
                                            10 Van de Graaff Drive. It can be expected that the trip distribution patterns for the

                                            Phase III development will also generally follow the current trip patterns associated
                                            with current Oracle employees.

                                            The trip distribution patterns are summarized in Table 8 and shown in Figure 7. Data

                                            As shown in Table 8, approximately two-thirds of Oracle traffic is oriented to the
                                            highways. The trip distribution analysis was based on the assumption that a higher
                                            proportion of employees oriented to/from communities to the south may prefer
                                            using Middlesex Turnpike and Cambridge Street over Route 128 during commuter
                                            peak times. While this assumption may provide a more conservative (worst case)
                                            assessment of traffic impacts on local roadways, it should be noted that during off-
                                            peak conditions, employees will be more readily inclined to use the highways, which
                                            in turn will results in percentages as high as 80 percent for Route 128 and Route 3.

                                            To develop the 2018 Build conditions peak hour traffic volume, Phase III "typical
                                            condition" peak hour traffic volumes were added to the No-Build conditions. The
                                            resulting 2018 Build conditions traffic volume networks are shown in Figures 8 and
                                            9. Traffic volume networks for the seasonal peak condition is included in the

                                            Measuring existing traffic volumes and projecting future traffic volumes quantifies
                                            traffic flow within the study area. To assess quality of flow, roadway capacity
                                            analyses were conducted with respect to Existing and projected No-Build and Build
                                            traffic volumes for both typical and seasonal peak conditions. Capacity analyses
                                            provide an indication of how well the roadway facilities serve the traffic demands
                                            placed upon them. Roadway operating conditions are classified by calculated levels
                                            of service.



Level-of-service Criteria
                                            Level of service (LOS) is the term used to denote the different operating conditions
                                            which occur on a given roadway segment under various traffic volume loads. It is a
                                            qualitative measure of a number of factors including roadway geometrics, speed,
                                            travel delay and freedom to maneuver. Level of service provides an index to the
                                            operational qualities of a roadway segment or an intersection. Level-of-service
                                            designations range from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating
                                            conditions and LOS F representing the worst operating conditions.

                                            Level-of-service designation is reported differently for signalized and unsignalized
                                            intersections. For signalized intersections, the analysis considers the operation of
                                            each lane or lane group entering the intersection and the LOS designation is for
                                            overall conditions at the intersection. For unsignalized intersections, the analysis
                                            assumes that traffic on the mainline is not affected by traffic on side streets. The LOS
                                            is only determined for left-turns from the main street and all movements from the
                                            minor street. The evaluation criteria used to analyze intersections is based on the
                                            Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).2

Signalized Intersection Capacity Analysis
                                            Capacity analyses conducted for the signalized intersections are summarized in
                                            Table 9 for a typical conditions' capacity analysis. The seasonal peak capacity
                                            analyses is provided in Table A-2 in the Appendix. The capacity analyses were
                                            conducted for 2013 Existing, 2018 No-Build and 2018 Build conditions.


                                            South Bedford Street at Van De Graaff Drive/Wayside Road

                                            As shown in Table 9, the intersection of South Bedford Street at Van De Graaff Drive/
                                            Wayside Road currently operates at a LOS C during the weekday morning peak hour,
                                            and operates poorly, with notable congestion and delay during the weekday evening
                                            peak hour. Under the 2018 No Build conditions, the intersection operations drop to
                                            LOS E during the weekday morning peak hour and continues to operate at LOS F
                                            during the weekday evening peak hours. Under the 2018 Build conditions, without the
                                            implementation of any improvements, the intersection is expected to continue to
                                            operate poorly in the weekday morning and evening peak hours. Specific
                                            improvements have been identified in Chapter 5 ­ Proposed Mitigation Measures that are
                                            aimed at improving traffic operations and capacity at the intersection.


                                            Cambridge Street at Wayside Road/Wall Street

                                            The intersection of Cambridge Street at Wayside Road/Wall Street currently operates
                                            at LOS D during the weekday morning peak hour and LOS E during the weekday
                                            evening peak hour. With the expected future traffic growth from background project
                                            traffic, this intersection is expected to continue to operate at LOS D during the
                                            weekday morning peak hour and degrade to LOS F during the weekday evening peak
                                            hour under 2018 No Build conditions. Under 2018 Build conditions, the intersection is
                                            projected to continue to operate at levels comparable to the No-Build conditions. Some
                                            of the improvement measures aimed at improving South Bedford Street at Van De
                                            Graaff Drive/Wayside Road intersection will also benefit this intersection.


                                            Middlesex Turnpike at Wheeler Road (East)

                                            The intersection of Middlesex Turnpike at Wheeler Road (East) currently operates at
                                            LOS B during the weekday morning peak hour and LOS C during the weekday evening
                                            peak hour. Under 2018 No-Build conditions, the intersection is expected to operate at
                                            LOS D during the weekday morning peak hour and LOS D during the weekday evening
                                            peak hour. Under 2018 Build conditions, without the implementation of any
                                            improvements, the intersection is projected to continue to operate at LOS D during the
                                            weekday morning peak hour, while the evening peak hour delay just crosses over the
                                            LOS E threshold. Specifically, the increase in average delay at the intersection during the
                                            evening peak hour is approximately seven seconds per vehicle.

Unsignalized Intersection Capacity Analysis
                                             Typical conditions' capacity analyses that were conducted for the unsignalized study
                                             intersections are summarized in Table 10. The capacity analyses were conducted for
                                             2013 Existing, 2018 No-Build and 2018 Build conditions.

                                             The capacity analysis summary in Table 10 indicates that the shared left/right turns
                                             on the Blanchard Road eastbound approach, at its intersection with South Bedford
                                             Street, experiences congestion during peak hours. However, a review of the traffic
                                             volume networks indicate that the eastbound approach is minimally affected by
                                             Project traffic. Seasonal peak capacity analysis is provided in Table A-3 in the
                                             Appendix of this study.

                                             It should be noted that as part of the original Master Plan approval, Oracle has
                                             already made a monetary contribution to the Town of Burlington towards potential
                                             long term capacity and traffic operational improvements at the intersection of

                                                   Potential Traffic Improvements


                                            The 2000 Site Plan Approval required Oracle to implement a series of traffic
                                            improvement and trip reduction measures that would offset the impacts of the entire
                                            Oracle campus. Improvements of significant scope and magnitude called out in the
                                            2000 Approval include widening of Van de Graff Drive and South Bedford Street,
                                            signalization of the intersection of Van de Graff Drive/South Bedford Street,
                                            monetary contribution towards improving the intersection of South Bedford
                                            Street/Blanchard Road, sidewalk improvements on South Bedford Street,
                                            construction of a multi-use path on the Oracle campus, and a series of Transportation
                                            Demand Management (TDM) strategies to reduce peak hour travel.

                                            Even though the improvements outlined above were developed to support the entire
                                            Oracle master Plan, Oracle implemented all of the measures prior to the construction
                                            of Phase II of the campus. While the currently proposed Phase III development does
                                            not represent a significant increase in traffic impacts when compared to the originally
                                            contemplated Phase III, and it is expected to only result in a nominal increase in traffic
                                            volume during most of the year, Oracle is committed to funding the design and
                                            construction of additional potential improvement measures identified in this chapter.
                                            These potential traffic improvement measures that have been identified to address
                                            some of the existing deficiencies in addition to minimizing the traffic impacts of the
                                            Project. Non-capacity related strategies, such as Oracle's current TDM program that
                                            contributes to a noticeable reduction in trip generation during most of the year is also
                                            summarized in this chapter.



Potential Capacity Improvements
                                            The following is a summary of potential traffic improvement measures studied as part
                                            of this evaluation.


Secondary Driveway on Blanchard Road
                                            The original Oracle campus approvals allowed the construction of a gated driveway
                                            on Blanchard Road for emergency vehicle use. In addition, Condition 12.b of the

                                            May 11, 2000 Site Plan Approval allows, under certain traffic conditions associated
                                            with the occupancy of Phase III, "...the construction of a direct driveway access from
                                            the site parking lot onto Blanchard Road, at the discretion of the Planning Board."
                                            Further, in January 2012, the Burlington Board of Selectmen approved the opening of
                                            the emergency gate and use of the driveway for all exiting traffic between the hours
                                            of 4:00 to 7:00 PM. The time-restricted exit-only gate has been opened recently on a
                                            temporary basis. Since the driveway is not controlled by a key card or any other

                                            could use the driveway by cutting through the Oracle parking lots.

                                            As shown on the Phase III Site Plans, Oracle proposes to relocate the driveway
                                            farther to the east, and potentially operate it as a full-access driveway on a
                                            permanent basis, subject to the Planning Board's approval.

                                            This section reviews two potential configurations for the Blanchard Road driveway
                                            for consideration by the Town; a full access driveway, consistent with the references
                                            in the 2000 Site Plan Approval and an exit only driveway, consistent with the January
                                            2012 Board of Selectmen's approval.



Sight Distance Analysis ­ Current Exit-Only Driveway

                                            Sight distance analyses, in conformance with guidelines of the American Association
                                            of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO),3 were performed at the
                                            existing driveway on Blanchard Road. As noted in Table 2, recorded 85th percentile
                                            speed on Blanchard Road in the vicinity of the driveway is 37 mph in the westbound
                                            direction and 33 mph in the eastbound direction. These speeds were used to
                                            calculate the required stopping sight distance (SSD) for Blanchard Road traffic
                                            approaching the proposed curb-cut and intersection sight distance (ISD) for traffic
                                            that would exit Oracle and turn left or right onto Blanchard Road.

                                            SSD is the distance required for a vehicle approaching an intersection from either
                                            direction to perceive, react and come to a complete stop before colliding with the
                                            exiting vehicle from a driveway. In this respect, SSD can be considered as the
                                            minimum visibility criterion for the safe operation of an unsignalized intersection.

                                            ISD is based on the time required for perception, reaction and completion of the
                                            desired critical exiting maneuver (typically, a left turn) once the driver on a minor
                                            street approach (or a driveway) decides to execute the maneuver. Calculation for the
                                            critical ISD include the time to (1) turn left, and to clear the near half of the
                                            intersection without conflicting with the vehicles approaching from the left; and
                                            (2) upon turning left, to accelerate to the operating speed on the roadway without
                                            causing approaching vehicles on the main road to unduly reduce their speed. In this
                                            context, ISD can be considered as a desirable visibility criterion for the safe operation

                                            Table 11 indicates that adequate stopping sight distance SSD is currently available for
                                            traffic traveling in either direction on Blanchard Road. Available ISD for vehicles
                                            looking to the left (east) also exceeds AASHTO calculated values. Due to the existing
                                            sight line constraints for driveway traffic looking to the right, as shown in Table 11,
                                            Oracle is currently utilizing the exit-only driveway with a "right turn only" restriction.

                                            The proposed improvements contemplated as part of the Phase III development
                                            affords Oracle the opportunity to improve the sight lines at the Blanchard Road
                                            driveway by relocating it farther to the east, by approximately 250 feet. The driveway
                                            will continue to remain unsignalized, with the southbound driveway approach
                                            placed under stop-sign control.

                                            As noted earlier, two potential configurations for the Blanchard Road driveway are
                                            presented in this section for consideration by the Town; one for a full access driveway,
                                            with both entering and exiting vehicles using Blanchard Road, and one for an exit-only
                                            driveway, with just evening peak exiting vehicles diverted to the new driveway.



Capacity Analysis with Blanchard Road Driveway

                                            Design year 2018 Build traffic volumes for study area roadways after the construction
                                            of a driveway on Blanchard Road were determined by estimating the volume of traffic
                                            that will be diverted to the driveway under the two-way and one-way configurations.
                                            Peak hour travel times to the regional highway system, proximity of parking spaces
                                            and buildings to the new driveway and relative ease of accessing the highway via the
                                            new driveway vs. Van de Graff Drive were taken into consideration when developing
                                            the redistributed traffic volumes for the occupied and proposed office space at Oracle.

                                            Figures 10 and 11 show the 2018 Build with Mitigation volumes for two-directional
                                            traffic on the driveway, while Figures 12 and 13 show the corresponding volumes for
                                            an exit-only driveway. Capacity analysis results at the study locations as a result of
                                            the traffic volume diversions are summarized in Tables 12 and 13.

                                            As shown in Table 12, the Blanchard Road driveway relieves some of the existing
                                            congestion at the two signalized ends of Wayside Road, thereby improving traffic
                                            operations at those locations. On the contrary, use of the Blanchard Road driveway by
                                            traffic heading to the regional highway system has the potential to add some limited
                                            additional congestion to the Middlesex Turnpike corridor during the afternoon peak
                                            hour. However, unlike other office and retail users in the area who may have to rely on
                                            only a single route to access the highway system, Oracle employees would have two
                                            potential routes to use. For example, should they find that highway access via Blanchard
                                            Road is difficult on certain days due to congestion on Middlesex Turnpike, they can
                                            continue to use Van de Graff Drive to access the highway via Cambridge Street.

                                            More importantly, the analysis with the traffic volume diversions demonstrates that
                                            neither the two-way driveway nor the one-way driveway configuration has the
                                            potential to negatively impact traffic operations on Blanchard Road. The analysis also
                                            shows that since traffic operations on Blanchard Road are not much different with
                                            either a one-way or a two-way driveway, it would be beneficial, from a regional
                                            traffic flow perspective, to allow two-way operations at the driveway and help
                                            reduce the congestion at some of the signalized intersections and provide employees
                                            the option to enter and exit the Oracle campus via two different routes.



South Bedford Street at Van De Graaff Drive/ Wayside Road
                                            As shown in the traffic operations analysis summary in the previous chapter, the
                                            westbound Wayside Road left/through movement operates at LOS F under both the
                                            weekday morning and evening peak hours, while the westbound right-turn lane
                                            operates at LOS B during the weekday morning peak hour and LOS C during the
                                            weekday evening peak hour. The Wayside Road westbound approach has two lanes
                                            that extend all the way to the adjacent intersection of Cambridge Street at Wayside
                                            Road/Wall Street; however, with the existing lane configuration, only one of these
                                            lanes is designated for left and through moving vehicles.

                                            As shown in Table 12, modifying the lane configuration from an exclusive westbound right
                                            turn lane to a shared through/right turn lane, along with the diversion of some of the
                                            exiting traffic to the Blanchard Road driveway will allow for improved traffic operations at
                                            the South Bedford Street at Van De Graaff Drive/Wayside Road intersection.



Traffic Signal Timing Enhancements
                                            To facilitate optimal traffic operations under the future conditions, traffic signal
                                            timing changes may need to be pursued at the study area intersections, as necessary.

                                            Capacity analyses conducted for the Build with Mitigation condition are summarized in
                                            Table 12 for signalized intersections and Table 14 for unsignalized intersections. The
                                            peak season capacity analyses are provided in Tables A-2 and A-3 in the Appendix.

Transportation Demand Management Program
                                            The goal of the Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan is to reduce the
                                            Project's overall traffic impact through the implementation of measures that are
                                            aimed at affecting the demand side of the transportation equation, rather than the
                                            supply side. By their very nature, TDM programs attempt to change people's
                                            behavior, and to be successful, they must rely on incentives or disincentives to make
                                            these shifts in behavior attractive to the commuter.4 TDM programs are designed to
                                            maximize the people-moving capability of the existing transportation infrastructure
                                            by increasing the number of persons in a vehicle, providing alternate modes of
                                            travel, or influencing the time of, or need to, travel.

                                            In addition to the roadway improvements discussed in the previous section, and as
                                            discussed earlier in this study, Oracle already had an extensive TDM plan in place for their
                                            employees. The TDM plan is aimed at minimizing the use of single-occupant vehicles and
                                            reducing peak hour vehicular demands. The program includes the following components:

                                                  Staggered and Flexible Work Hours
                                                  MBTA bus Route 350 stops on Van De Graaff Drive
                                                  Bicycle Measures
                                                  Showers and Lockers
                                                  Cafeteria on Site
                                                  Gym on Site



Staggered and Flexible Work Hours
                                            Allowing some flexibility in work times often promotes travel during off-peak hours,
                                            use of a carpool or vanpool, or working from home on days the employees do not
                                            need to be physically on the campus. It also enables employees to use transit
                                            services. These are common strategies used by commuters to avoid traffic and has a
                                            positive impact on peak hour conditions.

                                            Many of the employees at Oracle are already eligible for, and frequently use,
                                            staggered and flexible work hours when practical and applicable. As a result, not all
                                            employees are on the campus every day, between the typical office hours of 8 AM to
                                            5 PM. Data provided by Oracle suggests that:

                                                  Only 50% of Oracle employees are on the campus more than 70% of the time;
                                                  30% of the employees are on the campus 20-70% of the time; and
                                                  20% of the employees are on the campus less than 20% of the time.

MBTA Bus Routes
                                            As discussed earlier, public transportation in the study area is provided by the
                                            Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Burlington "B" bus
                                            lines. There are currently two MBTA bus routes in the vicinity of Van de Graaff
                                            Drive. These routes in turn provide connections to additional MBTA bus routes and
                                            the rapid transit system. MBTA bus routes 354 and 350 serve the Oracle campus and
                                            other employees and retail customers in the area.



Bicycle Measures
                                            Bicycling to the Site could be attractive to some employees. As part of the original
                                            Master Plan approval, Oracle constructed a multi-use trail on their campus that
                                            connects to a multi-use path on Van de Graaff Drive. Additionally, secure bicycle
                                            storage racks currently exist at convenient locations on the campus.



On-Site Employee Convenience Services
                                            An important element in the reduction of vehicle trips from any site is the provision
                                            of on-site services such as an showers, lockers, cafeteria, and a gym. The availability
                                            of these services on the Oracle campus reduces the number of off-site vehicle trips,
                                            which need to be made by the employees, while also providing a convenience to the
                                            employees.

                                            Prior approvals secured by Oracle allows the construction of an additional 101,000± sf
                                            office space at their Van de Graaff campus as part of the Phase III development. The current
                                            proposal for Phase III involves the addition of 24,000 sf of office space to the previously
                                            approved space, for a total of 125,000± sf. In addition, to accommodate seasonal parking
                                            demand, Oracle proposes to increase the previously approved parking ratio for Phases I, II
                                            and III from 3.6 to approximately 4.0. This study has evaluated the traffic operations and
                                            safety conditions of existing roadways, analyzed the impact of background traffic growth
                                            and projected the impacts of the Project with and without traffic mitigation measures in
                                            place.

                                            During typical Oracle operations (i.e., during non-seasonal peak times), the Phase III
                                            development would generate approximately 170 new trips (enter + exit) during the
                                            weekday morning peak hour and 150 new trips (enter + exit) during the weekday
                                            evening peak hour. This represents a nominal increase of only 30 to 35 peak hour
                                            trips when compared to the previously approved Phase III office space.

                                            During Oracle's seasonal peak times at various times of the year, reliance on the
                                            higher parking ratio would generate approximately 110 new trips (enter + exit)
                                            during the weekday morning peak hour and 115 new trips (enter + exit) during the
                                            weekday evening peak hour.

                                            Oracle proposes to relocate the existing time-restricted exit-only Blanchard Road
                                            driveway farther to the east of its current location, and operate it as a full-access
                                            driveway on a permanent basis, subject to the Planning Board's approval. Analysis of
                                            the one-way and two-way options of the driveway demonstrates that neither
                                            configuration has the potential to negatively impact traffic operations on Blanchard
                                            Road. In fact, the analysis shows that a two-way driveway configuration would be
                                            beneficial from a regional traffic flow perspective, as it helps reduce the congestion at
                                            some of the are signalized intersections and provides Oracle employees the option to
                                            enter and exit the campus via two different routes.

                                            Overall, detailed analyses indicates that the limited additional traffic that will be added
                                            by the Phase III development to the study area will result in relatively small impacts at
                                            the various study intersections. However, it is acknowledged that deficiencies

                                            currently exist at certain locations within the study area and they can be expected to
                                            persist in the future with anticipated growth in traffic, independent of the Project.

                                            The 2000 Site Plan Approval required Oracle to implement a series of traffic
                                            improvement and trip reduction measures that would offset the impacts of the entire
                                            Oracle campus. Even though the improvement measures were developed to support
                                            the entire Oracle master Plan, Oracle implemented all of the measures prior to the
                                            construction of Phase II of the campus. Oracle proposes to implement additional
                                            measures that will complement the infrastructure improvements that have already
                                            been implemented to date. The improvements include the following measures.

                                                 Constructing a driveway onto Blanchard Road to serve as a secondary means of
                                                 access/ egress to help relieve congestion for traffic heading to Route 128 and
                                                 Route 3.

                                                 Potentially modifying the lane configuration of Wayside Road westbound to
                                                 allow through traffic to travel in both lanes instead of a single lane.

                                                 Retiming select signals, if necessary. after occupancy to better support the future
                                                 traffic volumes and travel patterns.

                                            The improvements will be designed to further offset the impacts of the Project as well
                                            as improve some of the existing deficiencies. The comprehensive TDM program that
                                            is already in place on the campus to reduce the peak hour and daily traffic demands
                                            of the Project will also cover the Phase III development.

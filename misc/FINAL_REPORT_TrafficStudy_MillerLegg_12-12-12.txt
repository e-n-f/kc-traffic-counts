Introduction


Miller Legg was retained by Florida International University (FIU) to perform a traffic
analysis related to the proposed construction of the new Parking Garage no. 6 (PG6)
located at the Modesto A. Maidique Campus (MMC). PGAL is the architect responsible
for the design of PG6.


Under Section 1013.30(11)(d)(e) of the 2012 Florida Statutes, a traffic study done for a
University campus master plan and campus development agreement, "Must, for each of
the facilities and services listed..... identify the level-of-service standard established by
the applicable local government...." Furthermore it "Must, for each of the facilities and
services listed....., determine the impact of existing and proposed campus development
reasonably expected over the term of the campus development agreement on each
service or facility and any deficiencies in such service or facility which the proposed
campus development will create or to which it will contribute." Section 1013.30(13)(a)(b)
of the Florida Statutes requires that "All improvements to facilities or services which are
necessary to eliminate the deficiencies identified in paragraph (11)(e) must be
specifically listed in the campus development agreement" and "The university board of
trustees' fair share of the cost of the measures identified in paragraph (13) (a)......"


This analysis focuses on the on-site and off-site traffic circulation related to the
proposed facility (PG6) and existing parking garage (aka red parking garage/Parking
Garage 4, PG4). Growth in traffic volumes from the FIU 5 year master plan was
included as it relates to access management decisions for PG6. A comprehensive
traffic concurrency study, per the requirements of the above Florida Statutes can be
provided at the request of the University.

                                                                                           Parking Garage No. 6

Executive Summary
The proposed PG6 will include 2,100 parking spaces, with potential 35,000 square feet
of Classroom/Office/Retail space. The garage will be located on the southeast corner of
the signalized intersection located at SW 8th Street and SW 112th Avenue (just west of
PG4), as shown in Figure 1 and on the Site Plan in Appendix A. PG6 will replace the
existing surface parking lot #1 which currently has a capacity of 225 parking spaces. It
is anticipated that PG6 will alleviate parking demands imposed on the existing parking
garages and surface parking lots, adjacent to it. The utilization of the PG6 spaces will
most likely be a re-distribution of the existing on campus parking traffic and will create a
minimal number of new campus parking trips. This is taken into account for both the
Trip Generation and Trip Distribution computations. Traffic data during the PM peak
(turning movement counts (TMC)) were collected for the traffic impact areas on the
Campus and the street network, immediately adjacent to PG6.                                 TMC data were
collected at the following intersections: SW 8th Street and SW 112th Avenue.; SW 8th
Street and SW 109th Avenue; SW 112th Avenue and University Drive; University Drive
and Engineering & Computer Science (ECS) building / SW 110 Avenue; SW 109th
Avenue and University Drive; SW 109th Avenue and PG4 North access; SW 109th
Avenue and PG4/PG5 Central access/exit; and SW 109th Avenue and PG4 South exit.
Only PM peak TMC's were collected to match the peak demand traffic of the adjacent
street network. Traffic data collected for each of the intersections are included in
Appendix C. The Peak Season Correction Factor for data collected is 1.04 (refer to
Appendix E for 2011 Peak Season Factor Category Report).


Trip generation and trip distribution for the proposed PG6 were calculated based on the
ITE Trip Generation Manual (8th Edition). The trips generated by the PG6 facility are
summarized in Table 1 below:

(8th Edition) and is shown in Table 2 below. The proposed PG6 will also include the

    redistribution of internal trips from existing Parking Lot 9. Hence, the total shown in
    Table 2 constitutes PM peak hour trips generated by PG6 and redistribution from
    Parking Lot 9.

    The intersections adjacent to PG6 were analyzed for the existing 2012 PM peak-hour
    conditions using the TMC data that was collected. Capacity analysis was conducted
    using the Highway Capacity Software (HCS 2010) which is based on the 2010
    Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity Manual. The capacity analysis also
    includes two Scenarios (S-1 and S-2) showing alternative traffic circulation patterns to
    access PG6. Projected trip distributions for each of the scenarios are shown in
    Appendix I. The results of the capacity analysis are illustrated in Table 3. Levels of
    service (LOS) thresholds indicate the operation of an intersection. LOS "A" through "D"
    is acceptable. LOS "E" indicates constrained or at capacity conditions. LOS "F"
    indicates failure. Two of the intersections exhibit failure and the other two intersections
    are operating at an acceptable LOS. HCS 2010 capacity analysis results are attached
    in Appendix J through Appendix M.

                                                                         Parking Garage No. 6

Based on the LOS results, no improvements are required at the intersections of SW 8th
Street & SW 112th Avenue (operates at LOS "D"), and at University Drive & SW 109th
Avenue (operates at LOS "A"). However, we anticipate that the LOS for SW 8th Street &
SW 112th Avenue would most likely fail with growing traffic volumes from the campus
and would require capacity improvements to improve its performance. At SW 8th Street
& SW 109th Avenue, the existing LOS is at capacity for the existing 2012 PM peak
TMC's (operates at LOS "E") prior to the addition of PG6 traffic. The intersection LOS
will be deficient (operating at LOS "F") with the addition of PG6 traffic. The critical
movements are the eastbound (through + right), westbound (left + through + right), and
northbound (left) approaches. We do not propose any capacity improvements, unless
requested. At SW 112 Avenue & University Drive (two way stop controlled intersection),
for the 2012 PM peak hour analysis, the critical traffic movements causing failure are
the free flowing eastbound lefts (EBL) with a heavy movement at 341 veh/hr and the
free flowing westbound right (WBR) at 277 veh/hr. They are inducing the eastbound
approach to fail (LOS "F"=228 secs/veh delay). Both the eastbound and westbound
approaches have one outbound lane servicing the outbound movements. For the 2013
PM peak hour TMC's (includes PG6 traffic), the eastbound approach worsens with a
LOS "F" (421.8 secs/veh delay). To mitigate the impacts to this intersection, the five (5)
possible alternatives are as follows:
      Do nothing. Retain as an unsignalized intersection (with two way stop control)
      should budgetary constraints be imposed. The 2012 Peak hour capacity analysis
      (see Appendix M) shows that the three approaches (WB, NB & SB) are operating
      at acceptable LOS. The critical movement (EBL) is operating at LOS "F" (228
      secs/veh delay). For the 2013 peak hour capacity analysis (see Appendix M), the
      three approaches (EB, NB & SB) are operating at acceptable LOS. The critical
      movement (EBL) is operating at LOS "F" (421.8 secs/veh delay). The EBL would
      definitely benefit from a new dedicated left turn lane. In addition, this location
      needs to be field monitored for queue backups resulting from left turn movements
      during the PM peak hour
      All Way Stop Control with existing geometry. Propose two additional stop
      signs at the eastbound and westbound approaches. The 2012 Peak hour

   capacity analysis (see Appendix M) shows that the three approaches (WB, NB &
   SB) are operating at acceptable LOS. The critical movement (EBL) is operating
   at LOS "E" (44.27 secs/veh delay). The overall LOS "D" (28.91 secs/veh delay) is
   acceptable. For the 2013 peak hour capacity analysis (see Appendix M), two
   approaches (NB & SB) are operating at acceptable LOS. The critical movement
   (EBL) is operating at LOS "E" (41.58 secs/veh delay) and WB approach is
   operating at LOS "F"(74.78 secs/veh delay). The overall intersection LOS "E"
   (48.95 secs/veh delay) is at capacity and would benefit from dedicated EBL and
   WBR lanes
   All Way Stop Control with future geometry. Propose two additional stop signs
   at the eastbound and westbound approaches and add a dedicated EBL and
   WBR lanes. The 2013 peak hour capacity analysis (see Appendix M) shows that
   all approaches are operating at acceptable LOS. The overall intersection
   improves to LOS "C" (16.14 secs/veh delay) and is acceptable
   Single-lane roundabout. Capacity analysis (see Appendix N) indicates that an
   overall LOS "B" (14.28 secs/veh delay) is obtained with 2012 PM peak TMCs
   with existing lane geometry. Capacity analysis indicates that an overall LOS "C"
   (24.67 secs/veh delay) is obtained with 2013 PM peak hour TMCs with existing
   lane geometry. The critical approach is westbound operating at LOS "E" (46.03
   secs/veh delay). No lane capacity improvements are necessary based on the
   overall LOS result. This roundabout scenario reduces the intersection delay and
   improves the overall LOS, when compared to the unsignalized intersection
   analysis. For capacity analysis results, refer to Appendix N
   Two-lane roundabout. Capacity analysis (see Appendix N) indicates that an
   overall LOS "A" (8.07 secs/veh delay) is obtained with 2012 PM peak TMCs with
   the addition of dedicated eastbound left turn lane (EBL) and dedicated
   westbound right turn lane (WBR). For the 2013 PM peak TMCs (including PG6
   traffic), we obtain an overall LOS "A" (9.98 secs/veh delay). Capacity
   improvements are necessary and will require widening of University Drive to
   accommodate a dedicated EBL and WBR turn lanes to improve the LOS. The EB
   approach will operate at LOS "A" and WB approach will operate at LOS "B". The

   estimated cost of these improvements will be $1.25 million.            An additional
   $300,000 will be required for the widening of SW 10 Street from SW 112 Avenue
   to the entrance of existing PG6 surface lot. For capacity analysis results, refer to
   Appendix N
   In conclusion, the two viable alternatives at this location based on acceptable
   LOS operation are All Way Stop Control with future geometry and Two-lane
   roundabout. Per direction from FIU we will implement Two-lane roundabout
   alternative at this location

Parking Garage No. 6 will include 2,100 parking spaces, with 35,000 square feet of
Classroom/Office/Retail space. The garage will be located on the southeast corner of
the signalized intersection located at SW 8th Street and SW 112th Avenue (just west of
PG4). The project location is shown in Figure 1. A site plan is included under Appendix
A.

PG6 will replace the existing surface parking lot #1 which currently has a capacity of
225 parking spaces. It is anticipated that PG6 will alleviate parking demands imposed
on the existing parking garages and surface parking lots, adjacent to it. The utilization
of the PG6 spaces will most likely be a re-distribution of the existing on campus parking
traffic and will create a minimal number of new campus parking trips added to the
surrounding street network on the campus. Our study area (or impact area) includes the
following segments:

The segment of SW 8th Street (U.S.41) is currently a seven-lane east-west arterial
roadway. The segment along SW 8th Street (from SW 112th Avenue to SW 109th
Avenue) is adjacent to the FIU campus to the south, and has a canal along the north
side. Our study area includes the following intersections:
     SW 8th Street at SW 112th Avenue (Signalized)
     SW 8th Street at SW 109th Avenue (Signalized)
     SW 109th Avenue at the main entrance to Parking Garage No. 5 (PG5) and PG4

Within the study area, sidewalks exist along the south side of SW 8th Street, and along
the east side of SW 109th Avenue. Sidewalks also exist along the north side of
University Drive. (east of the parking lot #1 entry driveway). Pedestrian crosswalks exist
at all intersections except at University Drive and SW 112th Avenue. The study area
does not contain any bicycle lanes.


Vehicles travelling eastbound along SW 8th Street, enter the campus at SW 112th
Avenue (signalized intersection) using a single right turn lane. Vehicles entering this
intersection from westbound SW 8th Street use a single left turn lane. SW 112th Avenue
is a four lane divided roadway providing access to the campus.


Vehicles also enter the campus at the SW 8th Street and SW 109th Avenue signalized
intersection. SW 109th Avenue is a four lane divided roadway between SW 8th Street
and University Drive. From westbound SW 8th Street, vehicles use a single left turn lane
to access the campus from SW 109th Avenue. Vehicles enter from eastbound SW 8th
Street turn from the rightmost through lane. SW 109th Avenue provides access to the

road).


The existing PG4 has three (3) access driveways along SW 109th Avenue. Driveway 1
is restricted to SBRT only (entry). The center Driveway 2 is a right in-right out with direct
access within the garage to the scissor ramps. Driveway 2 is restricted to EBRT only
(exit). Driveway 3 is a restricted eastbound right exit from PG4. The existing PG5 has
three (3) Driveways along SW 109th Avenue as well. Only the center Driveway 2 can be
accessed by vehicles travelling southbound along 109th Avenue. Vehicles can only
utilize driveways 1 and 3 to enter/exit PG5 while travelling northbound along SW 109th
Avenue.


University Drive (between SW 112th Avenue and SW 109th Avenue) is a two lane
roadway providing access to various campus buildings and provides entry/exit to
existing surface parking lot #1 and the PG4.

  Trip Generation & Distribution


  Trip generation for the proposed Parking Garage No. 6 (PG6) was calculated based on
  the ITE Trip Generation Manual (8th Edition). The trips generated by PG6 facility are
  summarized in Table 1 below:

         *PG6 trips include Retail space only.
         **Square footage revised to account for new trips.


  Parking Garage No. 6 (PG6)
  Although PG6 will have 2,100 spaces, trips must be calculated based on the land uses
  associated with the parking structure. According to the project program, the proposed
  classroom and office space is completely internal to the campus and will not generate
  new external trips. Therefore the only trips generated by the garage will be from
  potential future retail component (estimated at 50% of the 35,000 square ft total space
  allocated for PG 6 classrooms/offices/retail), which will generate new external trips.

  Redistribution of Trips from Existing Lot 9
  The existing Parking Lot 9 (located west of SW 112 Avenue & University Drive) has 556
  spaces which currently serves students, faculty and visitors accessing the northwest
  quadrant of the Campus, PG6 will be located less than a quarter mile away from
  Parking Lot 9, making it a convenient alternative for students and faculty who currently

use this surface parking lot. In addition, based on the 2010-2020 draft Master Plan,
Parking Lot 9 will be replaced with additional educational facilities adjacent to the
College of Business Complex and Ziff education building. This will result in the
redistribution of internal trips from the existing Parking Lot 9 to PG6 and will also affect
the traffic flow at the intersection of University Drive and SW 112th Avenue. Despite the
closure of Parking Lot 9, the Panther Parking Garage (aka PG3, with 1,448 spaces) and
Parking Lot 10 (218 spaces) will continue to function as planned.

                                          is used to calculate the total trips to PG6 due to
                                          internal rerouting, which specifies that during
                                          the PM Peak Hour there are:
                                          30% Entering (54 from above), 70% Exiting

The arrival/departure distribution for the PG6 facility was based on the ITE Trip
Generation Manual (8th Edition) and is shown in Table 2 below. The directional
distribution was based on the planned access routes for PG6 and the redistribution of
internal trips from Parking Lot 9. The projected distributions of trips for 2013 PM peak
hour is shown in Appendix I.

Traffic Analysis
The intersections adjacent to PG6 were analyzed for the existing 2012 PM peak-hour
conditions using the TMC data that was collected. Capacity analysis was conducted
using the Highway Capacity Software (HCS 2010) which is based on the 2010
Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity Manual. The existing 2012 PM peak
TMC was adjusted to obtain the 2013 PM projected TMC. The 2013 PM projected TMC
includes: a) annual growth based on the FDOT 2011 Historical AADT Report (Appendix
E); b) the Peak Season Correction Factor for data collected is 1.04 (refer to Appendix E
for 2011 Peak Season Factor Category Report); c) addition of project trips for PG6. The
data is included in Appendix F. HCS 2010 evaluates the intersection capacity and also
has the ability to optimize both the signal phasing and timings. The analysis includes
PM Peak Hour analysis for the following scenarios (refer to Appendix I for projected trip
distributions for each Scenario):


       2012 PM peak hour capacity analysis (with existing traffic + existing geometry)
       Scenario 1 (S-1): 2013 PM peak hour capacity analysis (with existing geometry)
       for all intersections. Traffic circulation includes right in access to PG6 through
       the existing Red Parking Garage (PG4) (Driveway 1), and restricted access
       along University Drive (right-out (exit) & left-in (entry) only) to access PG6 from
       University Drive No capacity analysis conducted for this circulation since TMC's
       are low.
       Scenario 2 (S-2): Same as Scenario 1, except that an additional second
       restricted access (right-in only) is proposed along University Drive to access both
       PG6 and PG4 (located just west of SW 109th Avenue & University Drive

           intersection). No capacity analysis conducted for this circulation since TMC's are
           low. However, capacity analysis was conducted for the SW 109th Avenue &
           University Drive intersection since the projected TMC is impacted by this
           circulation.


    Results
    The results of the capacity analysis are illustrated in Table 3. Levels of service (LOS)
    thresholds indicate the operation of an intersection. LOS "A" through "D" are acceptable.
    LOS "E" indicates constrained or at capacity conditions. LOS "F" indicates failure. Two
    of the intersections exhibit failure and the other two intersections are operating at an
    acceptable LOS. HCS 2010 outputs are attached in Appendix J through Appendix M.

    Recommendations
    Based on the LOS results, no improvements are required at the intersections of SW 8th
    Street & SW 112th Avenue (operates at LOS "D"), and at University Drive & SW 109th
    Avenue (operates at LOS "A"). However, we anticipate that the LOS for SW 8th Street &
    SW 112th Avenue would most likely fail with growing traffic volumes from the campus
    and would require capacity improvements to improve its performance. At SW 8th Street
    & SW 109th Avenue, the existing LOS is at capacity for the existing 2012 PM peak
    TMC's (operates at LOS "E") prior to the addition of PG6 traffic. The intersection LOS
    will be deficient (operating at LOS "F") with the addition of PG6 traffic. The critical

                                                                         Parking Garage No. 6

movements are the eastbound (through + right), westbound (left + through + right), and
northbound (left) approaches. We do not propose any capacity improvements, unless
requested. At SW 112 Avenue & University Drive (two way stop controlled intersection),
for the 2012 PM peak hour analysis, the critical traffic movements causing failure are
the free flowing eastbound lefts (EBL) with a heavy movement at 341 veh/hr and the
free flowing westbound right (WBR) at 277 veh/hr. They are inducing the eastbound
approach to fail (LOS "F"=228 secs/veh delay). Both the eastbound and westbound
approaches have one outbound lane servicing the outbound movements. For the 2013
PM peak hour TMC's (includes PG6 traffic), the eastbound approach worsens with a
LOS "F" (421.8 secs/veh delay). To mitigate the impacts to this intersection, the five (5)
possible alternatives are as follows:
      Do nothing. Retain as an unsignalized intersection (with two way stop control)
      should budgetary constraints be imposed. The 2012 Peak hour capacity analysis
      (see Appendix M) shows that the three approaches (WB, NB & SB) are operating
      at acceptable LOS. The critical movement (EBL) is operating at LOS "F" (228
      secs/veh delay). For the 2013 peak hour capacity analysis (see Appendix M), the
      three approaches (EB, NB & SB) are operating at acceptable LOS. The critical
      movement (EBL) is operating at LOS "F" (421.8 secs/veh delay). The EBL would
      definitely benefit from a new dedicated left turn lane. In addition, this location
      needs to be field monitored for queue backups resulting from left turn movements
      during the PM peak hour
      All Way Stop Control with existing geometry. Propose two additional stop
      signs at the eastbound and westbound approaches.             The 2012 Peak hour
      capacity analysis (see Appendix M) shows that the three approaches (WB, NB &
      SB) are operating at acceptable LOS. The critical movement (EBL) is operating
      at LOS "E" (44.27 secs/veh delay). The overall LOS "D" (28.91 secs/veh delay) is
      acceptable. For the 2013 peak hour capacity analysis (see Appendix M), two
      approaches (NB & SB) are operating at acceptable LOS. The critical movement
      (EBL) is operating at LOS "E" (41.58 secs/veh delay) and WB approach is
      operating at LOS "F" (74.78 secs/veh delay).         The overall LOS "E" (48.95

   movements
   All Way Stop Control with future geometry. Propose two additional stop signs
   at the eastbound and westbound approaches and add dedicated EBL and WBR
   lanes. The 2013 peak hour capacity analysis (see Appendix M) shows that all
   approaches are operating at acceptable LOS. The overall intersection improves
   to LOS "C" (16.14 secs/veh delay) and is acceptable
   Single-lane roundabout. Capacity analysis (see Appendix N) indicates that an
   overall LOS "B" (14.28 secs/veh delay) is obtained with 2012 PM peak TMCs
   with existing lane geometry. Capacity analysis indicates that an overall LOS "C"
   (24.67 secs/veh delay) is obtained with 2013 PM peak hour TMCs with existing
   lane geometry. The critical approach is westbound operating at LOS "E" (46.03
   secs/veh delay). No lane capacity improvements are necessary based on the
   overall LOS result. This roundabout scenario reduces the intersection delay and
   improves the overall LOS, when compared to the unsignalized intersection
   analysis. For capacity analysis results, refer to Appendix N
   Two-lane roundabout. Capacity analysis (see Appendix N) indicates that an
   overall LOS "A" (8.07 secs/veh delay) is obtained with 2012 PM peak TMCs with
   the addition of dedicated eastbound left turn lane (EBL) and dedicated
   westbound right turn lane (WBR). For the 2013 PM peak TMCs (including PG6
   traffic), we obtain an overall LOS "A" (9.98 secs/veh delay). Capacity
   improvements are necessary and will require widening of University Drive to
   accommodate a dedicated EBL and WBR turn lanes to improve the LOS. The EB
   approach will operate at LOS "A" and WB approach will operate at LOS "B". The
   estimated cost of these improvements will be $1.25 million.            An additional
   $300,000 will be required for the widening of SW 10 Street from SW 112 Avenue
   to the entrance of existing PG6 surface lot. For capacity analysis results, refer to
   Appendix N
   In conclusion, the two viable alternatives at this location based on acceptable
   LOS operation are All Way Stop Control with future geometry and Two-lane

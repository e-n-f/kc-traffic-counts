CHAPTER 1 - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.1. Introduction

This transportation project proposes to provide appropriate traffic control along Croton Point Avenue
improve existing infrastructure, and provide pedestrian facilities and bicycle accommodations to better
balance the needs of all users. Project objectives will focus on sidewalks and bicycle facility
improvements along Croton Point Avenue in the Village of Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester County, New
York.

This report presents design alternatives and documents the improvements that will result from completion
of the project and the potential consequences and impacts associated with the proposed work. The intent
of this report is to provide information to all interested parties and serve as a decision making tool and a
means of documenting decisions, ultimately leading to Design Approval of a proposed improvement.

The project is assumed to be classified as a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Class II action
(CE/CE with documentation) in accordance with 23 CFR 771. The actual determination will come after
state and federal agencies have had an opportunity to comment. The project is also classified as an
Unlisted Action in accordance with the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA). The Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) is the Lead Agency for NEPA, while the Village of Croton-on-Hudson is
the Lead Agency for SEQRA.

This report was prepared in accordance with the New           York State Department of Transportation
(NYSDOT) Project Development Manual (PDM), 6 NYCRR            (New York Codes, Rules and Regulations)
Part 617, and 23 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 771.        Transportation needs have been identified
(section 1.2.2), objectives established (1.2.3) to address    the needs, and cost-effective alternatives
developed (1.3). This project is federally funded.

    (8)   From RM NA To RM NA
    (9)   Any other description information which is pertinent: The project begins at the intersection of
          Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza and continues easterly for approximately 1,240 feet to
          the intersection of Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue. From this intersection, the
          project proceeds northerly on S. Riverside Avenue for approximately 500 feet to the intersection
          of S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard. The project includes the US Route 9
          southbound on/off ramps and the US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps.

See Project Location Map (Figure 1) and Site Location Map (Figure 2) in Appendix A.

1.2.2. Why is the Project Needed?

Croton Point Avenue provides access to the Croton-Harmon train station located at the westerly end of
the project limits, via Veterans Plaza. Vehicular volumes are high and very directional with approximately
75% of the traffic traveling to the train station during the AM peak period and 75% traveling from the train
station during the PM peak period. Croton Point Avenue is free-flowing since there are no traffic signals
or stop control for the vehicles between S. Riverside Avenue and Veterans Plaza. Given the highly
directional vehicular flows and few gaps in Croton Point Avenue free flowing traffic, there are few
opportunities for pedestrians or bicyclists to cross Croton Point Avenue and for side street traffic from the
US Route 9 southbound and the US Route 9 northbound off ramps to access Croton Point Avenue. With
limited gaps to access Croton Point Avenue, queues extend along the US Route 9 southbound off ramp
potentially impacting US Route 9 mainline traffic. Lengthy US Route 9 southbound off ramp queues
exacerbate the situation, as there is a constant stream of traffic wishing to exit US Route 9.

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson provides personnel at Veterans Plaza during 1 hour of both the AM and
PM peak periods and at the US Route 9 southbound ramp for 1-hour during the AM peak period to help
facilitate pedestrian and bicyclist crossings. The use of personnel at these intersections during the peak
periods is a measure implemented by the Village to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle crossings,
while also attempting to facilitate vehicular flow on these side streets to reduce the long delays, queues
(including traffic backups to the US Route 9 mainline) and poor levels of service that would otherwise
exist without active traffic control.

While this method is effective during the peak hour, it does not accommodate the conditions during non-
peak periods and the shoulder hours of the peak period where vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle volumes
are high. In addition, this manual control requires a significant local cost and allocation of resources to
manage operations at Veterans Plaza and the state highway ramps and poses an inherent safety risk to
the personnel providing manual control.

Therefore, this project is necessary to provide safer accommodations that better balance the needs of all
users (vehicular, bicyclists and pedestrians) and provide effective vehicular mobility through the corridor
during all periods of the day with appropriate traffic control measures.

1.2.3. What are the Objectives/Purposes of the Project?

The project objectives are to:

    (1) Improve intersection operations and traffic flow by upgrading key intersections and providing
        appropriate traffic control that will facilitate bicycle and pedestrian crossings and effectively
        accommodate mobility through the corridor.
    (2) Improve and upgrade pedestrian accommodations and amenities to be American with Disabilities
        Act (ADA) compliant.
    (3) Provide bicycling facilities along Croton Point Avenue that are conducive for all types and skill
        levels of bicyclists.
    (4) Improve drainage deficiencies along Croton Point Avenue.
    (5) Improve pavement conditions on Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue.

1.3. What Alternative(s) Are Being Considered?

One Build alternative in addition to the No-Build (null) alternative has been developed and evaluated
based upon the project objectives. The alternatives that are considered are listed below.




                                                    1-2

Alternative 1: No-Build (Null) Alternative

The No-Build (Null) Alternative will provide for the continued maintenance of the existing roadway by the
Village of Croton-on-Hudson maintenance forces with no capital funds being expended. The Null
Alternative does not address existing deficiencies associated with bicycle and pedestrian
accommodations and intersection geometrics and operations.

Alternative 2: Bike Lane Alternative

The Bike Lane Alternative will provide continuous pedestrian and bicycle accommodations along both the
north and south sides of Croton Point Avenue from Veterans Plaza to S. Riverside Avenue. This
alternative consists of 5 ft. wide designated bike lanes between the travel lane and the sidewalk. It also
consists of 4 ft. and 5 ft. wide concrete sidewalks on both sides of Croton Point Avenue. Roadway
improvements include the realigning of the US Route 9 northbound on-ramp to eliminate the eastbound
channelized free-flow right turn movement from Croton Point Avenue, widening the US Route 9
southbound off-ramp to provide an exclusive right turn lane, traffic signal installations at Veterans Plaza,
the US Route 9 southbound on/off ramps and the US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps, widening of
approximately 100 ft. of Veterans Plaza to accommodate four-lanes for reversible traffic flow operations,
pavement and drainage improvements. Roadway resurfacing is proposed on Croton Point Avenue and
S. Riverside Avenue within the project limits.

For a more in-depth discussion of the design criteria and nonstandard features see Section 3.2.3. Design
Criteria for Feasible Alternative.

1.4 How will the Alternative(s) Affect the Environment?

CHAPTER 2 - PROJECT CONTEXT: HISTORY, TRANSPORTATION
PLANS, CONDITIONS AND NEEDS
This chapter addresses the history and existing context of the project site, including the existing
conditions, deficiencies, and needs for Croton Point Avenue from Veterans Plaza to S. Riverside Avenue
and S. Riverside Avenue from Croton Point Avenue to Benedict Boulevard.

2.1. Project History

In 2008, the Village of Croton-on-Hudson commissioned a study of the Croton Point Avenue and S.
Riverside Avenue corridors between Veterans Plaza and Benedict Boulevard. The purpose of the study
was to provide a vision for the corridor and to propose improvements for vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle
access to the Croton-Harmon Train Station. It is listed on the Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) as
Transportation Enhancement Project (TEP) ID No. 8704.

2.2. Transportation Plans and Land Use

2.2.1. Local Plans for the Project Area

2.2.1.1. Local Comprehensive Plans ("Master Plan") -

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson adopted the "Village of Croton-on-Hudson Comprehensive Plan", in
January 2003. Goals of the plan include enhancing the pedestrian connections within the Village by
providing new and / or improved sidewalks, crosswalks, and connections to trails, and improve traffic flow
and parking while maintaining access and safety of pedestrians.

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson adopted the "Bicycle / Pedestrian Master Plan" in April 2009. The plan
recommends an emphasis on pedestrian and cyclist opportunities while streamlining vehicle corridors to
make the town center a destination rather than a travel corridor.

This project is consistent with the local comprehensive and master plans.

2.2.1.2. Local Private Development Plans ­

There are no approved developments planned within the project area that will impact traffic operations.


2.2.2. Transportation Corridor

2.2.2.1. Importance of the Project Route Segment ­

Croton Point Avenue is a vital link in the transportation corridor that provides access from US Route 9
and S. Riverside Avenue to the Croton-Harmon Train Station, located on Veterans Plaza, south of
Croton Point Avenue and west of US Route 9. Due to its close proximity to New York City, the station
is a commuter hub, as well as a major transfer point between local and express trains and the
Westchester County Bee-Line Bus Service.

2.2.2.2. Alternate Routes ­

There are no alternative routes that would be suitable as a permanent detour.




                                                   2-1
July 2013                               Draft Design Report                                        PIN 8780.41



2.2.2.3. Corridor Deficiencies and Needs ­

The primary deficiencies for the project corridor are the lack of safe and adequate bicycle and pedestrian
facilities and appropriate traffic control to facilitate vehicular and non-vehicular traffic. There are currently
no bicycle facilities on Croton Point Avenue and the existing pedestrian facilities are discontinuous and do
not meet current Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines.

Croton Point Avenue provides access to the Croton-Harmon train station located at the westerly end of
the project limits. Vehicular volumes are high and very directional with approximately 75% of the traffic
traveling to the train station during the AM peak period and 75% from the train station during the PM peak
period. Croton Point Avenue is free-flowing since there are no traffic signals or stop control for the
vehicles between S. Riverside Avenue and Veterans Plaza. Given the highly directional vehicular flows
and few gaps in Croton Point Avenue free flowing traffic, there are few opportunities for pedestrians or
bicyclists to cross Croton Point Avenue and for side street traffic from the US Route 9 northbound and the
US Route 9 southbound off ramps to access Croton Point Avenue. With limited gaps to access Croton
Point Avenue, queues extend along the US Route 9 southbound off ramp potentially impacting US Route
9 traffic. Lengthy US Route 9 southbound off ramp queues exacerbate the situation, as there is a
constant stream of traffic wishing to exit US Route 9.

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson provides personnel at Veterans Plaza during 1 hour of both the AM and
PM peak periods and at the US Route 9 southbound ramp for 1-hour during the AM peak period to help
facilitate pedestrian and bicyclist crossings. The use of personnel at these intersections during the peak
periods is a measure implemented by the Village to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle crossings,
while also attempting to facilitate vehicular flow on these side streets to reduce the long delays, queues
(including traffic backups to the US Route 9 mainline) and poor levels of service that would otherwise
exist without manual traffic control.

While this method helps facilitate operations during 1 hour of the peak periods, it does not accommodate
the conditions during non-peak periods and the shoulder hours of the peak period where vehicular,
pedestrian and bicycle volumes are high. In addition, this manual control requires a significant local cost
and allocation of resources to manage operations at Veterans Plaza and the state highway ramps and
poses an inherent safety risk to the personnel providing manual control.

Therefore, this project is necessary to provide safer accommodations that better balance the needs of all
users (vehicular, bicyclists and pedestrians) and provide effective vehicular mobility through the corridor
during all periods of the day with appropriate traffic control measures.

2.2.2.4. Transportation Plans -

This project is on the approved Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) as Transportation
Enhancement Project (TEP) ID 8704.

2.2.2.5. Abutting Highway Segments and Future Plans for Abutting Highway Segments -

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson has confirmed that there are no plans to reconstruct or widen these
highway segments, or the adjoining segments, within the next 20 years.

Croton Point Avenue continues westerly of the project limits as an overpass to the Metro North/Amtrak rail
lines. It consists of a two-lane section, with lane widths of approximately 12 ft. with curbing and a 5 ft.
wide sidewalk on both sides of Croton Point Avenue.

South Riverside Avenue continues northerly and southerly of the project limits and is generally consistent
with the abutting sections.

2.3.1.2. Control of Access ­

There is control of access along Croton Point Avenue at the intersection of the US Route 9 southbound
ramps and the US Route 9 northbound ramps. There is no control of access on S. Riverside Avenue.

2.3.1.3. Traffic Control Devices ­

Traffic control devices within the project limits include pavement markings, traffic signs, and traffic signals.
The existing pavement markings and traffic signs are generally in fair condition. The pavement markings
and traffic signs in the corridor generally appear to comply with the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD), except for Veterans Plaza, as noted below.

Veterans Plaza is a three lane roadway with one lane in the northbound direction, one lane in the
southbound direction and a reversible center lane that is used as an inbound (southbound direction) lane
during the AM peak period and an outbound lane (northbound direction) during the PM peak period. The
pavement markings and signage do not currently conform to the MUTCD.

The project limits include two existing signalized intersections and three unsignalized intersections. The
two existing signalized intersections within the project limits are:

    ·   Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue
    ·   S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard

Both of these signalized intersections are actuated. The Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue
intersection is controlled by a multi-phase, actuated traffic signal. All movements operate by permitted
phasing with the exception of the S. Riverside Avenue southbound right turn movement, which operates
as a permitted phase and also overlaps with the Croton Point Avenue eastbound approach. Pedestrian
pushbuttons and signals are provided to cross the south leg of S. Riverside Avenue and the west leg of
Croton Point Avenue. Some of the existing pedestrian signal buttons and signs, and their placement do
not meet current MUTCD standards.

At the S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard intersection, all movements have permitted
operation, which is when a circular green signal indication is displayed and both left and right turns are
permitted to be made after yielding to pedestrians, if any, and/or opposing traffic, unless otherwise
prohibited by another traffic control device. Pedestrian pushbuttons and signals are provided to cross the
north leg of S. Riverside Avenue and the west leg of Benedict Boulevard, although there is no marked
crosswalk across this west leg of the intersection. There is a marked crosswalk to cross the south leg of
S. Riverside Avenue but no pedestrian pushbutton or signal to accommodate the crossing. The existing
pedestrian signals at this location do not appear to meet current MUTCD standards. Some of the existing
pedestrian signal buttons and signs, and their placement do not meet current MUTCD standards.

There are 3 major existing unsignalized intersections within the project limits:

    ·   Croton Point Avenue with Veterans Plaza
    ·   Croton Point Avenue with the US Route 9 southbound on / off ramps
    ·   Croton Point Avenue with the US Route 9 northbound on / off ramps

Stop control exists on the US Route 9 northbound off ramp, the US Route 9 southbound off ramp,
Veterans Plaza, and the southbound access drive and eastbound approach to the Croton Point Avenue
and Veterans Plaza intersection. The Croton Point Avenue westbound approach is the only uncontrolled
approach, making the Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza a non-typical controlled intersection as
most unsignalized intersections are either two-way or all-way stopped controlled intersections. This 3-
way stop control is used to accommodate the high traffic volumes to the station during the AM peak
periods.

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson currently assigns personnel to the Croton Point Avenue and Veterans
Plaza intersection during 1 hour of the AM and PM peak period and personnel at the Croton Point Avenue
and US Route 9 southbound on / off ramps during 1 hour of the AM peak period to facilitate pedestrian
and bicycle crossings at these locations. In addition, they monitor the traffic along the southbound off
ramp, and help facilitate traffic flow at Veterans Plaza to manage queuing along the ramp and onto the
US Route 9 mainline.

2.3.1.4. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ­

There are no ITS systems in operation or planned for the project area

2.3.1.5. Speeds and Delay ­

The posted speed limit on Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue within the project limits is 30
mph. Speed data was not collected to record actual vehicle operating speeds as this is not a major
capacity improvement project. However, vehicles were observed as part of traffic data collection and
speeds appeared to be low and appropriate for the context and design of the roadways.

2.3.1.6. Traffic Volumes ­

Refer to Appendix C of this report for traffic flow diagrams.

2.3.1.6. (1) Existing traffic volumes ­

The existing volumes are a culmination of turning movement counts obtained by CHA in July 2011 and
April 2008 turning movement counts and volumes included in the RBA study entitled, Croton Harmon
Parking Facility Vehicular Pedestrian and Bicycle Study, dated July 2008.

This data was used as the basis for the intersection capacity analysis and the signal warrant analyses for
the study intersections.

(LOS) for the 2011 (existing), 2013 (ETC) and 2023 (ETC+10) No-Build design year conditions.

Level of service is presented as a letter from A to F with A representing free flowing, unimpeded traffic
with little or no delay and F representing highly congested traffic flow with long delays.

The standard design objective for urban street systems is to achieve a minimum LOS D on all intersection
approaches during peak hours (NYSDOT HDM, Chapter 5.9.2). However, it is recognized that there are
many competing objectives and considerations, especially in urban areas, that may affect the desirability

and feasibility of achieving this goal for peak hours. In these cases, peak-hour LOS E or F may be
acceptable.

    U= unsignalized, S = signalized
  NA = Delay excessive or not reportable / Level of Service not reportable

  As shown in these analyses, the three unsignalized intersections are expected to experience LOS F on
  one or more intersection approaches with overall intersection operations at LOS E or worse during the
  studied peak hours.

  LOS E and F conditions at the unsignalized intersections are primarily associated with delay on the minor
  street approaches due to the current Stop intersection control and the inability for the side street traffic to
  enter the Croton Point Avenue free flowing through traffic.

  2.3.1.8. Safety Considerations, Accident History and Analysis ­

  An accident analysis was performed in accordance with the Highway Design Manual Chapter 5 using
  police accident reports compiled from the Village of Croton-on-Hudson Police Department for the three-
  year period of June 2008 to June 2011. These accident records documented 55 accidents occurring
  within the project limits.

  Of the 55 documented accidents in the study area, approximately 13% of the accidents were personal
  injury accidents, and the remaining 87% were property damage only accidents. There were no fatalities.

  The predominant crash type within the project limits are rear end accidents (31%). Following those are
  overtaking (16%) and left turn (13%) accidents, which account for 29% of the total crashes. There were
  six reported crashes (11%) involving pedestrians or bicyclists, of which 2 of these types of accidents
  occurred at each of the three intersections of Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza, Croton Point
  Avenue and US Route 9 southbound ramps and at Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue.

    The accident rates for intersections are expressed as accidents per million entering vehicles (ACC/MEV).
    For intersections on the State facilities (US Route 9 ramps), the statewide average accident rate for
    similar facilities is provided for comparison purposes. Accident rates for the project area intersections are
    summarized in Exhibit 2.3.1.8-3.

Only the intersections on State routes are applicable to be compared to the Statewide Average Accident
Rates published by NYSDOT. This would include the intersections of Croton Point Avenue with the US
Route 9 southbound ramps and the US Route 9 northbound ramps; each of which exceed the statewide
average rate.

A review of the accident types at Croton Point Avenue and the US Route 9 southbound ramps shows that
there is a pattern of rear end accidents on the US Route 9 southbound off ramp. This pattern may be
attributed to the queues on the ramp and the congestion at the intersection. The 2 pedestrian/bicyclist
accidents could be attributed to the fact that at two-way stop controlled intersections, right-turning
motorists often look only to the left in order to check for vehicular conflicts, endangering or
inconveniencing pedestrians crossing from the right or on the right. This situation is exacerbated by the
fact that many of these drivers do not come to a complete stop if they do not perceive any conflicts.

A review of the accident types at Croton Point Avenue and the US Route 9 northbound ramps shows that
there were a few angle (3), turn (2) and overtaking (2) accidents. There was not a pattern to these
accidents. However, contributing factors included driver inattention/distraction, failure to yield right-of-way
and turning improperly.

The accident data showed that 35% of the total accidents (19) in the project area occurred at the
Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue intersection for the three year period. The accident rate
was not compared to the statewide average rate, since it is not on the State highway system.
Predominate accident types were rear-end (5) and left-turn (5) accidents. Wet pavement / snow
contributed to four of the nineteen accidents. Of the remaining nineteen accidents, five had contributing
factors of failing to yield right-of-way, traffic control disregarded and turning improperly and six had
contributing factors of driver inattention and following too closely.

Section 3.3.1.8 discusses how the alternatives make improvements in this area.

A detailed accident analysis including an accident summary, collision diagrams, and recommendations for
improvements are included in Appendix C.

2.3.1.9. Existing Police, Fire Protection and Ambulance Access -

There are no police or fire departments located within the project limits. The Harmon Firehouse is located
on Benedict Boulevard, approximately 200 feet west of the S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard
intersection. Emergency vehicles routinely use Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue.
Emergency access will be maintained throughout construction.

2.3.2. Multimodal

2.3.2.1. Pedestrians ­

Existing pedestrian facilities exist within the project area. The concrete sidewalks vary in width from ± 4.0
ft. to 5.0 ft. and are generally in fair to poor condition. The concrete sidewalks within the project limits are
located as follows:

      ·   Veterans Plaza along the east side.
      ·   Croton Point Avenue along the south side beginning at the US Route 9 southbound on ramp and
          extending west beyond Veterans Plaza.
      ·   Croton Point Avenue along the north side between S. Riverside Avenue and extending west of
          Veterans Plaza.
      ·   S. Riverside Avenue along both the east and west sides beginning north of Benedict Boulevard
          and extending south to Croton Point Avenue.

There are marked crosswalks at the following intersection locations:

      ·   Croton Point Avenue & Veterans Plaza ­ north, south, and west legs.
      ·   Croton Point Avenue & US Route 9 southbound on / off ramps - north and west legs.
      ·   Croton Point Avenue & US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps ­ south legs.
      ·   Croton Point Avenue & S. Riverside Avenue - south and west legs.
      ·   S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard ­ north and south legs.

Pedestrians are prohibited on Interstate Highways by State law.

Many of the sidewalks, ramps, and crosswalks do not fully comply with current Americans with Disabilities
Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) requirements with respect to ramp slopes, detectable warnings,
and sidewalk surface conditions. In areas where there are no sidewalks, pedestrians use the paved
shoulder.

A pedestrian generator checklist is included in Appendix C.

2.3.2.2. Bicyclists ­

There are no separate provisions for bicyclists. Bicyclists currently share the roadway along S. Riverside
Avenue. Bicyclists may legally use the paved shoulder.

There is an existing designated bike route called Riverwalk that runs along the west of the US Route 9
southbound on ramp / southbound US Route 9 and along Croton Point Avenue west of Veterans Plaza.
This section of Riverwalk is part of a planned 51.5 mile pathway paralleling the Hudson River in
Westchester County. The Village of Croton-on-Hudson Bicycle / Pedestrian Master Plan, 2009
recommends the following roadways in the project area be designated as bike routes:

      ·   Croton Point Avenue to existing Riverwalk bike route.
      ·   S. Riverside Avenue.
      ·   Benedict Boulevard to the east of S. Riverside Avenue.

A bicycle survey was conducted in September 2011 at the Croton-Harmon Train Station. Concerns
raised by survey participants include lack of bike lanes and connections to Croton Point Park and
Riverwalk, and vehicles on the US Route 9 southbound ramp not stopping for bicyclists.

Of the 9 people surveyed, sixty-seven percent (6) preferred a bike lane while thirty-three percent (3)
preferred a separate path. All 9 surveyed commute within 5 miles of the station.

2.3.2.3. Transit ­

The Westchester County Bee-Line operates bus service along the project corridor. There are 3 stops
along the project corridor; one on Croton Point Avenue on the north side in the westbound direction
located under the US Route 9 overpass, one on the US Route 9 northbound off ramp, and one on S.
Riverside Avenue on the east side of the road in the northbound direction, just north of Croton Point
Avenue.

2.3.2.4. Airports, Railroad Stations, and Ports ­

There are no airports or port entrances within or in the vicinity of the project limits.

The Croton-Harmon railroad station is located on Veterans Plaza, south of Croton Point Avenue and west
of US Route 9. Due to its close proximity to New York City, the station is a commuter hub, with both
Metro-North and Amtrak utilizing the station. It is also a major transfer point between local and express
trains and Westchester County Bee-Line Bus Service.

2.3.2.5. Access to Recreation Areas (Parks, Trails, Waterways, State Lands) ­

Croton Point Avenue provides access to Croton Point Park and the Croton Point Nature Center, located
approximately 0.75 miles west of the project area, along the Hudson River. A section of the Riverwalk
Pathway is also located in this area.


2.3.3. Infrastructure

2.3.3.1. Existing Highway Section ­

Croton Point Avenue typically consists of a four lane section with two 11.5 - 12 ft. wide eastbound travel
lanes and two 11 - 13 ft. wide westbound travel lanes. The existing pavement is a portland cement
concrete pavement. Concrete curbs abut both sides of the roadway. The condition of the existing
concrete curb ranges from good to severely deteriorated, with many areas exhibiting inadequate curb
reveal. The remaining uncurbed section of roadway has a paved shoulder that varies in width from 0 to 8
ft. and functions as a gutter in many locations.

The existing horizontal alignment of Croton Point Avenue within the project limits is generally straight and
consists of long tangent sections connected by flat horizontal curves. The existing vertical alignment
within the project limits is generally flat, with grades varying between 1% and 5%.

A few commercial driveways are located along the northern side of Croton Point Avenue. These
driveways vary in type and width. Many of these driveways do not conform to the NYSDOT Policy and
Standards for Entrances to State Highways in width and cross slope of the sidewalk through the
driveway.

S. Riverside Avenue typically consists of a four lane section with two 10 ft. wide northbound travel lanes
and two 10 ft. wide southbound travel lanes. The existing pavement is a portland cement concrete
pavement. Non-mountable concrete curbs abut both sides of the roadway. Maintenance strips of varying


                                                      2-12

widths exist between the curb and sidewalks. Sidewalks of varying width exist along both sides of the
roadway within the project limits.

The existing horizontal alignment is generally straight and the existing vertical alignment exhibits grades
between 0.58% and 7.3%. Commercial driveways exist within the project limits.

Parking is restricted on Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue within the project limits.

The existing Right-Of-Way (ROW) on Croton Point Avenue varies from 65 ft. to >200 ft. and varies from
50 ft. to 60 ft. in width on S. Riverside Avenue.

Veterans Plaza consists of a three lane section with one 10 ft. wide northbound travel lane, one 10 ft.
wide southbound travel lane and a 10 ft. wide center lane, used as a reversible travel lane. During the
AM peak hours, it is used as an inbound lane (southbound direction) and during the PM peak hours, it is
used as an outbound lane (northbound direction). The existing pavement is an asphalt concrete surface.
Non-mountable concrete curbs abut both sides of the roadway. A 9 ft. wide asphalt path exists on the
west side and provides pedestrian and bicycle access to the Croton-Harmon Train Station. A 5 ft. wide
concrete sidewalk exists along the east side of the roadway within the project limits. The existing
horizontal alignment is generally straight and the existing vertical alignment exhibits grades between 8%
and 12%.

The US Route 9 southbound and northbound off ramps consist of a single 13 ft. wide travel lane and a 4
ft. wide shoulder along the west side and a 10 ft. wide shoulder along the east side. The existing
pavement surface has an asphalt concrete surface. There are no curbs along the off ramps.

The US Route 9 southbound on ramp consists of a single 15 ft. wide travel lane, an 8 ft. wide shoulder
along the west side, a 4 ft. wide shoulder along the east side, and the 10 ft. wide Riverwalk bicycle path,
which is separated from vehicular traffic via concrete jersey barrier. The existing pavement surface has
an asphalt concrete surface. There are no curbs along the on ramp. The existing horizontal alignment is
generally straight and the existing vertical alignment within the project area is generally flat, with grades
between 2% and 9%.

The US Route 9 northbound on ramp consists of a single 15 ft. wide travel lane, a 6 ft. wide shoulder
along the west side and a 4 ft. wide shoulder along the east side. West of the northbound ramp, access
from Croton Point Avenue is provided via a channelized right turn lane which merges with the Croton
Point Avenue eastbound traffic approximately 60 feet south of the Croton Point Avenue and northbound
on ramp intersection. The existing pavement surface has an asphalt concrete surface. There are no
curbs along the on ramp. The existing horizontal alignment is generally straight and the existing vertical
alignment within the project area is generally flat, with grades between 1% and 2%.

See Plans and Typical Sections in Appendix A.


2.3.3.2. Geometric Design Elements Not Meeting Minimum Standards ­
2.3.3.2.(1) Critical Design Elements ­

Pedestrian Accommodations:
The existing pedestrian facilities on Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue consist of 4.0 to 4.5 ft.
wide sidewalks which do not meet the minimum design standard of 5 ft., or 4 ft. wide for 200 ft. with a 5 ft.
by 5 ft. landing on either side of the sidewalk.

Travel Lane / Turn Lane width:
The existing travel lanes / turn lanes on S. Riverside Avenue consist of two 10 ft. wide lanes. This does
not meet the minimum design standard of 11 ft. travel lanes.

Grade
The existing grade on Veterans Plaza is approximately 12% which exceeds the maximum design
standard grade of 8%.

US Route 9 ramps
The existing superelevation on the US Route 9 northbound on-ramp is 6.0% which exceeds the maximum
superelevation of 4.0%. The existing stopping sight distance on the US Route 9 northbound on-ramp is
240 ft. which is below the minimum stopping sight distance of 305 ft.

2.3.3.2.(2) Other Design Parameters ­

There are no existing nonconforming features.

2.3.3.3. Pavement and Shoulder ­

The pavement surface, based on field visits, is in fair condition with some visible cracking on both Croton
Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue. Minor longitudinal and block cracking are also visible on the
shoulders due to lack of back-up material.

2.3.3.4. Drainage Systems ­

The existing drainage system on Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue within the project limits
generally consists of a closed system of catch basins along the curb lines interconnected with drainage
pipes. The existing drainage system appears to generally be operating as intended.

2.3.3.5. Geotechnical ­

There are no special geotechnical concerns with the soils or rock slopes within the project area.

2.3.3.6. Structure ­

BIN 1004989 carries US Route 9 over Croton Point Avenue within the project limits. Westerly of the
project, Croton Point Avenue continues over the Metro North / Amtrak rail lines. No work is proposed on
either of the bridges.

2.3.3.7. Hydraulics of Bridges and Culverts ­

There are no bridges or culverts over waterways within the project limits.

2.3.3.8. Guide Railing, Median Barriers and Impact Attenuators ­

There is existing guide railing in 7 locations within the project corridor. The type, location, and condition
of this existing guide rail are shown in Exhibit 2.3.3.8. There are no median barriers or impact attenuators
within the project limits.

2.3.3.10. Railroad Facilities ­

The Croton-Harmon Train Station is located on Veterans Plaza south of Croton Point Avenue and west of
US Route 9. This station serves both Metro-North and Amtrak passengers and due to its proximity to
New York City, is a commuter hub as well as a major transfer point between local and express trains and
the Westchester County Bee-Line Bus Service. Access to the train station is via the unsignalized
intersection of Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza.

The Metro-North / Amtrak Railroad line runs under and perpendicular to Croton Point Avenue,
approximately 250 feet west of the project's westerly limit of Croton Point Avenue with Veterans Plaza.
The existing railroad is outside of the project. There are no at-grade crossings within 0.62 miles that
could impact traffic conditions.

The predominate viewer groups are motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians commuting to and from,
Veterans Plaza or Croton Point Park. Since the buildings within the project area are for commercial
purposes, and not for residential use, there will be no impacts to the residential viewer group.

The project area is visually bisected by the US Highway 9 (Route 9) overpass and it's related on and off
ramps running in a north/south direction.

The overall existing visual quality is moderate with no significant or dominant views. There are numerous
utility poles, light poles and highway signage, which in some cases is erected over the existing sidewalk,
which impair the visual quality. Generally, the area is lacking in any substantive landscaping other than
indigenous vegetation which has grown on both sides of the Route 9 access ramps. Several of the office
buildings have small planting areas in the front yard and the retail area, at the southwest corner of Croton
Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue has an embankment sloping down from Croton Point Avenue with
25'-30' high evergreens planted as a buffer. The gas station at the northwest corner of Croton Point
Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue has extensive flower beds along both street fronts and a specimen
London Plane tree, which provides visual relief in the form of color, texture and shade.

S. Riverside Avenue is a four lane road section with sidewalks on both sides, with a paved utility strip
between the walk and curb on the east side and a grass utility strip on the west side. The east side is
primarily a small scale commercial area with buildings set close to the street, and parking areas and curb

cuts between each building offering no visual relief from the existing hardscape. The west side has a gas
station on each corner and a vacant lot in between.

CHAPTER 3 ­ ALTERNATIVES
This chapter discusses the alternatives considered and examines the engineering aspects for all feasible
alternatives to address project objectives in Chapter 1 of this report.

3.1. Alternatives Considered and Eliminated from Further Study

Project alternatives were developed to meet the project objectives. The alternatives were developed
using the engineering design criteria in Section 3.2.3 of this report. All reasonable alternatives were
considered.

The following alternatives were considered and dismissed from further study:

Alternative 1 ­ Null or No-Build (no-action)

The No-Build (Null) Alternative provides for the continued maintenance of the existing roadway by the
Village of Croton-on-Hudson maintenance forces with no capital funds being expended. The Null
Alternative does not address the need for pedestrian and bicycle facilities or vehicular mobility through
the corridor during all periods of the day with appropriate traffic control measures. Because this
alternative does not attain any of the project objectives, it will not be considered for further discussion.
This alternative will, however, be used as a baseline for comparison of feasible alternatives and the
relative project benefits.

Alternative 3: Shared Use Path Alternative

This alternative provides a 10 ft. wide one-way shared use path on both the north and south side of
Croton Point Avenue from the US Route 9 southbound ramps to S. Riverside Avenue. Between Veterans
Plaza and the US Route 9 southbound ramps, 5 ft. sidewalks will be provided on both sides of the
roadway, and bicyclists will be accommodated in the travel lane.

The roadway improvements for Alternative 3 include the realignment of the US Route 9 northbound on-
ramp to eliminate the eastbound channelized free-flow right turn movement, widening of the US Route 9
southbound off-ramp to provide an exclusive right turn lane, traffic signal installations at Veterans Plaza,
the US Route 9 southbound on/off ramps and the US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps, widening of
approximately 100 ft. of Veterans Plaza to accommodate four-lanes, pavement and drainage
improvements. Roadway resurfacing on Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue are proposed
within the project limits.

Alternative 4 - Hybrid Alternative

This alternative provides for a 5 ft. wide bike lane and a 5 ft. wide sidewalk on the south side of Croton
Point Avenue, and a 10 ft. wide one-way shared use path on the north side of Croton Point Avenue. This
alternative provides inconsistent accommodations for bicyclists and may result in riders travelling in the
wrong direction on the shared use path. Therefore, this alternative will not be considered further.

Alternative 5 - Shared Use Path on One-Side of Croton Point Avenue

This alternative provides for one 10 ft. wide shared use path and a 5 ft. wide buffer zone on the south side
of Croton Point Avenue, from Veterans Plaza to S. Riverside Avenue. This alternative would require
significant ROW acquisitions and would require widening of the US Route 9 overpass. Therefore, given
the extensive environmental impacts and costs associated with this alternative, it will not be considered
further.

Alternative 6 ­ Shared Roadway

This alternative provides for an 11 ft. wide inner lane, a 14 ft. wide outer lane and a 5 ft. wide sidewalk on
both sides of Croton Point Avenue, from Veterans Plaza to S. Riverside Avenue. Bicyclists would utilize
the outer lane and share the roadway with vehicular traffic. While this alternative would meet several of
the project objectives, it would not meet all of the objectives of this project as this alternative is not
conducive for all types and skill levels of bicyclists. Therefore, since this alternative does not meet all of
the project objectives, it will not be considered further.


3.2. Feasible Build Alternatives

3.2.1. Description of Feasible Alternatives

Alternative 2 ­ Bike Lane Alternative

This alternative consists of minor roadway widening of Croton Point Avenue to accommodate 5 ft. bike
lanes and 4 to 5 ft. sidewalks on both sides of Croton Point Avenue. It includes widening the US Route 9
southbound off ramp to accommodate an exclusive right turn lane, realignment of the Route 9 northbound
on ramp at Croton Point Avenue, and widening Veterans Plaza to accommodate reversible lane
operations. An overlay is proposed on both Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue, with drainage
improvements and three new traffic signals on Croton Point Avenue. Key elements of this alternative
include:

Geometry                  ·   Box widening on Croton Point Avenue between Veterans Plaza and S.
                              Riverside Avenue to accommodate 5 ft. bike lanes and 4 to 5 ft. sidewalks
                              on both sides of the roadway.
                          ·   Reducing the existing travel lanes on Croton Point Avenue from 12 ft. to 11
                              ft. through re-striping to minimize ROW impacts.
                          ·   Widening approximately 100 ft. of Veterans Plaza to accommodate two
                              northbound and two southbound lanes that transition to the existing three
                              lane section.
                          ·   Constructing an exclusive right turn lane on the US Route 9 southbound off
                              ramp.
                          ·   Realigning the US Route 9 northbound on ramp at Croton Point Avenue to
                              eliminate the eastbound channelized right turn movement.

Operational               ·   Signalizing three intersections along Croton Point Avenue at Veterans Plaza,
                              US Route 9 southbound ramps and US Route 9 northbound ramps, which
                              will eliminate the use of the existing manual control during 1 hour of the peak
                              periods at Veterans Plaza and the US Route 9 southbound ramps.
                          ·   Changing the Croton Point Avenue shared through/ right turn lane on the
                              westbound approach to Veterans Plaza to a shared left /through /right turn
                              movement to permit double left turns.
                          ·   Split phasing for the Croton Point Avenue eastbound and westbound
                              approaches at Veterans Plaza is proposed to accommodate the eastbound
                              double left turn movements.

Control of Access         ·   Control of access for this alternative will meet the Highway Design Manual
                              criteria.
Right of Way              ·   This alternative will require one ROW strip acquisition totaling 0.02 acre and
                              one temporary ROW easement of 0.01 acre.

3.3.1.3. Traffic Control Devices -

3.3.1.3. (1) Traffic Signals ­

Three new traffic signals are proposed at the following intersections:

    ·        Croton Point Avenue with Veterans Plaza
    ·        Croton Point Avenue with the US Route 9 southbound on / off ramps
    ·        Croton Point Avenue with the US Route 9 northbound on / off ramps

Signal modifications to the existing traffic signals at the two signalized intersections of Croton Point
Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard are proposed to allow
these existing signals to be coordinated with the new signals. New pedestrian signals will be installed at
these two existing intersections. Complete replacement of these existing traffic signals is not proposed.

Overhead lane signals will be added to Veterans Plaza for the reversible lane operations.

3.3.1.3. (2) Signs ­

Existing signs will be replaced and updated as necessary. New signs will be added where required in
accordance with the MUTCD.

No ITS measures are proposed.

3.3.1.5. Speeds and Delay -

3.3.1.5. (1) Proposed Speed Limit ­

The existing posted speed limit of 30 mph will be retained upon completion of the project.

3.3.1.5. (2) Travel Time Estimates ­

Travel time estimates are not included as the feasible alternatives will not change the capacity.

3.3.1.6. Traffic Volumes ­

There are no anticipated changes in traffic volumes. Refer to Exhibits 2.3.1.6-1 and 2.3.1.6-2 for a
summary of the traffic data and Appendix C for traffic flow diagrams.

3.3.1.7. Level of Service and Mobility ­

3.3.1.7 (1) At Project Completion & Design Year ­

Traffic Control / operational improvements are necessary to accommodate the high directional traffic flow
and pedestrian and bicycle crossings, and minimize queues to the US Route 9 mainline without the need
for continued manual traffic control operations during the peak periods.

A traffic signal warrant analysis was performed for the three Croton Point Avenue intersections (at
Veterans Plaza, US Route 9 southbound ramps and US Route 9 northbound ramps) and it was
determined that the volumes met the warranting criteria of Warrant 3 (the peak hour warrant) for all three
intersections as well as Warrants 1 and 2 for the intersections of Croton Point Avenue with the US Route
9 southbound ramps and the US Route 9 northbound ramps, as outlined in Chapter 4C of Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), 2009.

As noted above, traffic control improvements are necessary and given that the volumes meet the warrant
criteria, a traffic signal is proposed to be installed at these intersections. In addition, the southbound off
ramp will be widened to provide an exclusive right-turn lane and there will be narrowing of the Croton
Point Avenue and US Route 9 northbound on ramp intersection such that the eastbound free-flowing
channelized right-turn on Croton Point Avenue would be eliminated and right-turns would be made from
the signalized intersection proper would improve the pedestrian and bicycle crossings.

The capacity analyses, with the proposed improvements, indicate that an overall intersection LOS C or
better may be achieved for all the intersections through the ETC+10 design horizon.

Exhibit 3.3.1.7-1 provides a summary of operations, expressed as level of service, for this intersection
with the improvements described above.

 3.3.1.7 (2) ­ Work Zone Safety & Mobility ­

 A. Work Zone Traffic Control Plan -

 Traffic will be maintained throughout the project area during construction operations through the use of
 staged construction methods established in accordance with the MUTCD.

 Two-way traffic will be maintained at all times via lane shifts and short duration lane closures. No off site
 detours will be required. Routes for emergency vehicles will be maintained and open during construction.
 Access to the commercial establishments will be maintained at all times during construction. The details
 for the work zone traffic control will be prepared and evaluated during final design.

 B. Special Provisions ­

 The use of time related provisions will be evaluated during final design. The work zone traffic control will
 be coordinated with local officials, emergency response agencies and business owners during the final
 design stages.

 C. Significant Projects (per 23 CFR 630.1010) -

 The proposed project is not considered to be significant per 23 CFR 630.1010, nor are there any known
 significant projects in the project vicinity.

3.3.1.8. Safety Considerations, Accident History and Analysis ­

The preferred Build Alternative includes the addition of three traffic signals on Croton Point Avenue at
Veterans Plaza, the US Route 9 southbound on /off ramps, and the US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps.
In addition, the preferred Build Alternative includes construction of a southbound right turn lane on the US
Route 9 southbound off ramp and realigning the US Route 9 northbound on ramp that will be controlled
by the signal.

Signal control provides vehicles exiting the minor street approaches (Veterans Plaza, the southbound off
ramp and the northbound off ramp) with an exclusive phase to enter Croton Point Avenue and provides
phasing for pedestrians and bicyclists to cross each of the roadways. Signalization also eliminates the
need for manual control and the inherent safety risk to the personnel associated with this control.

Constructing an exclusive southbound right turn lane provides both operational and safety benefits by
providing an additional lane for right turning vehicles to move through the intersection during the minor
street phase, which can reduce the queue of traffic along the ramp and reduce the potential for rear-end
crashes. In addition, advance detection is proposed for the off ramps so that queues do not extend to the
US Route 9 mainline.

In addition, realigning the US Route 9 northbound on ramp at Croton Point Avenue will improve the
overall navigation of the road, which can reduce the potential for accidents from the east to northbound
channelized right turn and the west to northbound left turn movements. Narrowing of the Croton Point
Avenue and US Route 9 northbound on ramp intersection such that the eastbound free-flowing
channelized right-turn on Croton Point Avenue would be eliminated and right-turns would be made from
the signalized intersection proper would improve the pedestrian crossing.

The proposed improvements can reduce the likelihood of some vehicle conflicts that involved failure to
yield right of way and turning improperly.

3.3.1.9. Impacts on Police, Fire Protection and Ambulance Access ­

Access for emergency vehicles will be maintained and open during construction.

3.3.1.10. Parking Regulations and Parking Related Issues ­

No changes are proposed.

3.3.1.11. Lighting ­

The existing street lighting within the project limits will be maintained and relocated if necessary. No
additional lighting changes are proposed.

3.3.1.12. Ownership and Maintenance Jurisdiction ­

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson will continue ownership and maintenance responsibilities for Croton
Point Avenue, S. Riverside Avenue and Veterans Plaza, including the new traffic signal at Croton Point
Avenue and Veterans Plaza.

NYSDOT will continue ownership and maintenance responsibilities for the US Route 9 southbound ramps
and the US Route 9 northbound ramps as well as the new traffic signals at these intersections with
Croton Point Avenue.

3.3.1.13. Constructability Review ­

A formal constructability review will not be completed for this project.

3.3.2. Multimodal

3.3.2.1. Pedestrians ­

Four-foot wide concrete sidewalks, for less than 200 ft., will be constructed on both sides of Croton Point
Avenue between Veterans Plaza and the US Route 9 southbound ramps and along the east side of
Veterans Plaza to minimize ROW impacts to adjacent properties. In accordance with current ADAAG
requirements, 4 ft. wide sidewalks may be constructed provided a 5 ft. by 5 ft. wide pad is provided every
200 ft.

Five-foot wide concrete sidewalks will be constructed on both sides of Croton Point Avenue between the
US Route 9 southbound ramps and S. Riverside Avenue. Pedestrian facilities will be accessible and
usable by people with disabilities in accordance with current ADAAG requirements.

Pedestrians can continue to use the existing concrete sidewalks on both sides of S. Riverside Avenue
from Croton Point Avenue to Benedict Boulevard.

A Pedestrian Generator Checklist is included in Appendix C.

Pedestrians are prohibited on Interstate Highways by State law.

Crosswalks will be delineated with new pavement markings and pedestrian facilities, including
pushbuttons and countdown timers provided at each of the new traffic signals on Croton Point Avenue.

3.3.2.2. Bicyclists ­

Bicyclists will be accommodated through the use of 5 ft. wide bike lanes along both sides of Croton Point
Avenue from Veterans Plaza to S. Riverside Avenue. On S. Riverside Avenue, between Croton Point
Avenue and Benedict Boulevard, bicyclists can continue to utilize the existing travel lanes. Since
bicyclists will be riding adjacent to the curb line, all surface collection inlet structures will use bicycle safe
grates.

Bicyclists are prohibited on Interstate Highways by State law.

3.3.2.3. Transit ­

No changes are proposed.

3.3.2.4. Airports, Railroad Stations, and Ports ­

No changes are proposed; no conflicts are expected.

3.3.2.5. Access to Recreation Areas (Parks, Trails, Waterways, and State Lands) ­

No changes are proposed.

3.3.3. Infrastructure

3.3.3.1. Proposed Highway Section ­

The proposed project includes box widening on Croton Point Avenue between Veterans Plaza and S.
Riverside Avenue and restriping Croton Point Avenue to provide two 11 ft. lanes, a 5 ft. bicycle lane in
each direction and 4 ft. to 5 ft. sidewalks on both sides of the roadway. The existing pavement will remain
an asphalt concrete surface. No changes to the horizontal or vertical alignment are proposed as part of
the project.

The project includes an asphalt overlay on S. Riverside Avenue between Croton Point Avenue and
Benedict Boulevard to provide two 10 ft. travel lanes in both directions.       Existing curbs,
maintenance/utility strips and sidewalks will be retained.

The US Route 9 southbound off ramp and Veterans Plaza will be widened. A 12 ft. wide exclusive right
turn lane and 6 ft. shoulder will be constructed on the US Route 9 southbound off ramp. Veterans Plaza
will be box widened to accommodate four 10 ft. wide travel lanes (two for the northbound and two for the
southbound direction) with a 4 ft. wide sidewalk on the east side and an 8 ft. wide shared path on the
west side that will transition back to the three 10 ft. lane section.

Refer to Appendix A for plans and typical sections.

3.3.3.1. (1) Right of Way -ROW

Strip acquisitions will be required to accommodate the bicycle and pedestrian accommodations, the traffic
signal and driveway grading. One permanent easement area on the north side of Croton Point Avenue
between Veterans Plaza and the US southbound ramps of approximately 750 sf. (0.0171 acres), and one
temporary easement on the north side of Croton Point Avenue, just west of the northbound ramps of
approximately 280 sf. (0.0065 acres) are anticipated.

3.3.3.1. (2) Curb ­

Six inch vertical faced concrete curb will be provided on both sides of Croton Point Avenue and Veterans
Plaza within the project limits. The existing concrete curbs on S. Riverside Avenue will be retained. No
concrete curbs are proposed on the US Route 9 northbound ramps or the US Route 9 southbound ramps.

3.3.3.1. (3) Grades ­

The proposed work will not revise the existing vertical alignment of the roadways in the project area.

3.3.3.1. (4) Intersection Geometry and Conditions ­

Veterans Plaza is being widened to accommodate two inbound (southbound) and two outbound
(northbound) travel lanes. Double left turn movements from the westbound approach will be
accommodated inbound by the exclusive left turn lane and the shared left/through / right turn lane
approach. The outbound lanes will consist of a shared left/through / right turn lane and an exclusive right
turn lane.

An exclusive right turn lane will be constructed on the US Route 9 southbound ramp; the existing shared
left/through/ right turn lane will be retained, such that double right turns will be accommodated from the
southbound off ramp.

The eastbound channelized right turn lane to the northbound on ramp will be removed such that right
turns will go through the intersection proper.

The existing intersection geometry will be retained at S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard.

3.3.3.1. (5) Roadside Elements:
    (a) Snow Storage, Sidewalks, Utility Strips, Bikeways, Bus Stops ­ Four-foot and five-foot wide
         sidewalks are proposed on both sides of Croton Point Avenue from Veterans Plaza to S.
         Riverside Avenue. Four foot wide sidewalks are proposed on the west side of Veterans Plaza.
         Existing sidewalks will be retained on S. Riverside Avenue.

        A 1.5 ft. maintenance strip is proposed on the north side of Croton Point Avenue between the US
        Route 9 southbound ramps and S. Riverside Avenue. The existing maintenance strips on S.
        Riverside Avenue will be retained.

        Five foot bike lanes are proposed on both sides of Croton Point Avenue from Veterans Plaza to
        S. Riverside Avenue.

        There are three existing bus stop locations within the project limits that will be retained.

    (b) Driveways - The driveways will be modified to comply with the current NYSDOT "Policy and
        Standards for Design of Entrances to State Highways."
    (c) Clear Zone - The clear zone will be approximately 3.0 ft. wide in accordance with Section 10.2.7 of
        the NYSDOT HDM and will be refined during final design to adjust for slopes, roadway curvature,
        etc.

3.3.3.2. Special Geometric Design Elements ­

3.3.3.2. (1) Non-Standard Features ­

US Route 9 northbound ramps
The proposed project will retain the nonstandard stopping sight distance of 240 ft. and the nonstandard
superelevation of 6% on the US Route 9 northbound on ramp. Modifications to the roadway to correct the
nonstandard feature would be beyond the scope of this project.

Veterans Plaza
The proposed project will retain the nonstandard grade of 12% which exceeds the maximum grade of 8%.
Modifications to the roadway profile to correct the grade to meet the standard would result in significant
impacts to the adjacent properties and require right-of-way which would be beyond the scope of this
project. Therefore, the existing non-standard grade will be retained.

S. Riverside Ave
The proposed project will retain the travel lane and turn lane widths of 10 ft. on S. Riverside Avenue. The
minimum standard width is 11 ft. This feature has been retained because widening of the roadway and
reconstruction of the roadway is not within the scope of this bicycle and pedestrian improvement project.
No safety concerns associated with the non-standard lane width have been identified. Widening of the
existing travel lanes would involve significant cost to box widen the pavement, replace the existing curb,
and replace the existing drainage infrastructure which would also impact the right-of-way. Therefore, it is
proposed that the existing non-standard travel lane width be retained.

The proposed project will also retain the existing 4 ft. wide sidewalks along both sides of S. Riverside
Avenue. The minimum standard is 5 ft. This feature is being retained Widening the sidewalk would
require right-of-way and would involve a significant cost that is beyond the scope of this project.
Therefore, it is proposed that the existing non-standard sidewalk width be retained.

A copy of the non-standard feature justification forms are in Appendix D.

3.3.3.2. (2) Non-Conforming Features ­

There will be no non-conforming features within the project limits.

3.3.3.3. Pavement and Shoulder ­

No pavement evaluation has or will be completed for this project. Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside
Avenue consist of concrete pavement while Veterans Plaza, the US Route 9 southbound and northbound
on and off ramps and Benedict Boulevard consist of asphalt pavement.

Cold milling with an asphalt concrete inlay is proposed along Croton Point Avenue, S. Riverside Avenue,
Veterans Plaza and the US Route 9 northbound and southbound on and off ramps within the project
limits, with the exception of the box widening and the construction of the southbound off ramp turn lane.

The proposed pavement section will be composed of 1.5-inch thick asphalt top course, 2-inch asphalt
binder course, 5-inch asphalt base course and 12-inch subbase on the US Route 9 southbound off ramp.

Croton Point Avenue will include (2) 11-ft. travel lanes, a 5 ft. bike lane and a concrete curb in both the
eastbound and westbound directions. No shoulders along Croton Point Avenue, within the project limits
are proposed. S. Riverside Avenue will consist of (2) 10-ft travel lanes with curbing along both sides of
the roadway. Shoulders on both sides of S. Riverside Avenue will be retained. Veterans Plaza will
consist of (2) 10-ft. travel lanes and concrete curbing in both the northbound and southbound directions
which transitions to a 3-lane section with 10-ft wide travel lanes. No shoulders are proposed along
Veterans Plaza. Refer to Appendix A for typical sections for the proposed pavement section.

3.3.3.4. Drainage Systems ­

The existing storm water is controlled via a combination of open and closed drainage systems along the
project corridor. The existing drainage system is adequate and functioning properly.

In general the existing drainage systems will be cleaned and maintained, with the following exceptions:

    ·   New closed drainage systems will be required at locations where an existing open-drainage
        system is replaced by a proposed curb section (see Section 3.3.3.1, for proposed curb locations).
    ·   Existing frame and grate elevations will need to be modified to match proposed elevations.
    ·   The need for additional drainage structures and/or modifications to the existing systems will be
        evaluated in final design.

3.3.3.5. Geotechnical ­

No special techniques or considerations are needed.

3.3.3.6. Structures ­

There are no proposed bridges within the project limits and no improvements to the existing overpass of
US Route 9 over Croton Point Avenue.

3.3.3.7. Hydraulics of Bridges and Culverts ­

There are no bridges of culverts over waterways included in the project.

3.3.3.8. Guide Railing, Median Barriers and Impact Attenuators ­

It is anticipated that approximately 100 ft. of box beam guiderail will be required along the west side of
Veterans Plaza and tie into the existing guide rail for the existing path to the train station and at the
parking lot. In addition, all existing guiderail within the project limits will be evaluated during final design
for conformance to design standards and replaced or repaired, if necessary.

3.3.3.9. Utilities ­

The utility providers within the project limits are summarized below. The proposed project will require
relocation of overhead electric, telephone, and cable facilities. There will be minor modifications to
underground utilities, including raising frames and covers and/or valve adjustments due to change in
roadway elevation or grading. As the design progresses and the extent of the utility conflicts are
determined, there will be correspondence and coordination with utility owners regarding this work.

3.3.3.10. Railroad Facilities ­

The Croton-Harmon Train Station is located on Veterans Plaza south of Croton Point Avenue and
immediately west of US Route 9. This station serves both Metro-North and Amtrak passengers and due
to its proximity to New York City, is a commuter hub as well as a major transfer point between local and
express trains and the Westchester County Bee-Line Bus Service.

The proposed widening of Veterans Plaza to provide two northbound and two southbound travel lanes,
which permits double left turn movements from Croton Point Avenue, as well as double right turns exiting
Veterans Plaza and the installation of the traffic signal control with pedestrian accommodations will
improve access to the train station.

The Metro-North / Amtrak Railroad line runs under and perpendicular to Croton Point Avenue,
approximately 250 feet west of the project's westerly limit of Croton Point Avenue with Veterans Plaza.
The existing railroad is outside of the project. The preferred alternative will not impact any at-grade
crossings.

4.2.1 Land Use

4.2.1.1 Demographics and Affected Population -

The project is not within an Environmental Justice Area. The project area is suburban and lightly
developed; with a few commercial businesses along the north side of Croton Point Avenue and along
both sides of S. Riverside Avenue.

This project is compatible with the Town and county comprehensive plans.

4.2.1.2 Comprehensive Plans and Zoning -

The project will not change the zoning or land use within the corridor.

The project objectives are consistent with the Village of Croton-on-Hudson Comprehensive Plan and their
Bicycle / Pedestrian Master Plan. Several of the recommendations in these Plans have been
incorporated into the proposed project including the new sidewalks and crosswalks, addition of bicycle
accommodations in the corridor and improving capacity. These proposed improvements will improve the
mobility of all users within the project area. All of the proposed improvements will be designed to
minimize impacts to the existing environment.


4.2.2 Neighborhoods and Community Cohesion

4.2.2.1 Community Cohesion -

The project will not divide neighborhoods, isolate part of a neighborhood, generate new development or
otherwise affect community cohesion. The age and ethnic background of the affected population is of a
similar composition as the rest of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson. Community cohesion is likely to
benefit from the proposed improvements to pedestrian and bicyclist facilities. These facilities will provide
an improved link for pedestrians and bicyclists between residences, neighborhoods, subdivisions, and the
Croton-Harmon Train Station on Croton Point Avenue.

4.2.2.2 Home and Business Relocations -

Since this project involves construction of bicyclist facilities, expanding and improving pedestrian
accommodations and an overlay of the existing roadway on predominately the existing alignment, and
does not require the acquisition of occupied dwellings/businesses, it will not cause adverse impacts upon
neighborhood character and stability. The proposed alternative will not result in displacement of
residences or businesses and there will be no relocation impacts. Overall, the effects of this project will
not cause adverse impacts upon neighborhood character and stability.


4.2.3 Social Groups Benefited or Harmed

4.2.3.1 Elderly and/or Disabled Persons or Groups -

A review of US Census data for Westchester County indicates that there is no significant concentration of
elderly or disabled persons in the project area.   The existing highway is deficient in infrastructure
accommodations for handicapped and elderly, due to the lack of existing sidewalks and crosswalks. This
project proposes new sidewalks and crosswalks and will improve accessibility accommodations for these
user groups.

4.2.3.2 Transit Dependent, Pedestrians, and Bicyclists -

There are three existing Westchester Bee-Line bus stops along the project corridor. There are no
proposed transit improvements within the project limits. The inclusion of pedestrian and bicycle
accommodations will improve circulation and access to Croton-Harmon Train Station for transit
dependent pedestrians and bicyclists.

Four-foot wide concrete sidewalks, for less than 200 ft., will be constructed on both sides of Croton Point
Avenue between Veterans Plaza and the US Route 9 southbound ramps and along the east side of
Veterans Plaza to minimize ROW impacts to adjacent properties, in accordance with ADAAG
requirements. Five-foot wide sidewalks will be constructed along both sides of Croton Point Avenue from
the US Route 9 southbound ramps to S. Riverside Avenue which will be accessible and usable by people
with disabilities in accordance with ADAAG requirements. Crosswalks will be delineated and pedestrian
facilities installed at the three proposed signalized intersections to facilitate pedestrian crossings.

Bicyclists will be accommodated through the use of 5 ft. wide striped bike lanes on both the north and
south sides of Croton Point Avenue from Veterans Plaza to S. Riverside Avenue. On S. Riverside
Avenue between Benedict Boulevard and Croton Point Avenue, bicyclists will continue to share the road
with vehicular traffic.

The inclusion of pedestrian and bicycle accommodations in the project corridor will be a benefit to transit
dependent, pedestrians and bicyclists.

4.2.3.3 Low Income, Minority and Ethnic Groups (Environmental Justice) ­

The project is not located in or near an environmental justice area. Consistent with Executive Order
12898 and FHWA Guidance on Environmental Justice, the project has not directly or indirectly used
criteria, methods or practices that discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin or income level.


4.2.4 School Districts, Recreational Areas, and Places of Worship

4.2.4.1 School Districts-

The proposed project is within the Croton-Harmon School District. There are no schools or school
properties within or near the project corridor.

4.2.4.2 Recreational Areas -

Croton Point Avenue provides access to Croton Point Park and the Croton Point Nature Center, located
approximately 0.75 miles west of the project area, along the Hudson River. A section of the Riverwalk
Pathway is also located in this area. A basketball court is located on Benedict Boulevard approximately
200 ft. east of the intersection of Benedict Boulevard and S. Riverside Avenue. It is not expected that
there will be any long term adverse impacts to the recreational areas. During construction there may be
delays for some motorists traveling through the corridor, and temporary on-site sidewalk detours will be
used during construction. These would be a temporary and relatively minor impact. In the long-term,
effects will be positive with improved road conditions, traffic flow, new sidewalks and bike lanes.

4.2.4.3 Places of Worship ­

There are no places of worship within the project limits. There is the Chapel of the Good Shepherd at
intersection of Benedict Boulevard and Young Avenue. The proposed project is not expected to have any
direct negative impacts to places of worship.

4.3 Economic

The purpose of this section is to evaluate and analyze the economic effects of design alternatives as well
as construction activities. The proposed project is not expected to have any negative economic impacts
on the project area or the surrounding community. There are no detours associated with construction for
this project; therefore, traffic patterns will remain the same but traffic flow may decrease at times during
construction. The project area is commercial and access to such businesses will be maintained during
construction activities.

4.3.1 Regional and Local Economies

The proposed project will not require the acquisition or relocation of any business. A strip ROW taking
will be required for construction of the bike lane and sidewalk. Acquisition of this land will not result in the
loss of available parking for the business with frontage along Croton Point Avenue. Consequently, no
long-term negative impacts will occur to the local development, tax revenues, public expenditures,
employment opportunities, retail sales, or property values of the project area.

The proposed project will not have any other impacts on the local development, tax revenues,
expenditures, employment opportunities, retail sales or property values of the project area.

4.3.2 Business Districts

4.3.2.1 Established Business Districts -

There are no established business districts within the project limits or surrounding area.

4.3.2.2 Effects on Business Districts -

Correspondence with local officials has indicated that no established business districts exist in the project
area.

4.3.3 Specific Business Impacts

4.3.3.1 Established Businesses -

As described in Section 3.3.3.1 in Chapter 3, the preferred alternative will not require the displacement of
any existing businesses. The existing businesses are predominately small retail businesses which are
located along each side of S. Riverside Avenue and Croton Point Avenue.

4.3.3.2 Effects Assessment -

Access to all businesses will be maintained during the construction phase of the project. Other than
these minor inconveniences, the business climate along Croton Point Avenue should not have any
appreciable changes.

The USFWS website was reviewed for federally listed threatened and endangered species for
Westchester County (See Appendix B). The species identified for Westchester County are:

    ·   Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) - Proposed
    ·   Bald eagle ­ Delisted
    ·   Bog Turtle (Clemmys muhlenbergii) - Threatened
    ·   Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) ­ Endangered
    ·   New England Cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) ­ Candidate
    ·   Shortnose sturgeon ­ Endangered

A field investigation to identify the habitats of the project corridor was completed on June 22, 2011. This
information was used to determine if the habitats for the above listed species occur within the project
corridor. The project impacts include modifications or improvements to already developed, paved, or
maintained surfaces. Therefore the project will not displace vegetative communities, impact water quality
or create new wildlife hazards. Therefore, none of the listed species, ecological communities, or wildlife
congregation areas will be impacted by the proposed project.

A threatened and endangered species impact assessment report was prepared and submitted to the
NYSDEC and USFWS on November 25, 2011. This report concludes that "Based on results of literature
reviews and the site visit, suitable habitat is not present in the Project Area for any of the eight listed
species, and therefore it is considered unlikely for these species to occur in the Project Area. No sensitive
species or sensitive natural communities were observed during the site visit. Based on this
environmental review, it is unlikely that any State or federally-listed endangered, threatened or candidate
plant or animal species or sensitive natural communities would occur in the Project Area." The USFWS
was contacted during the week of March 25, 2013, and the weeks of April 1, April 22, and April 30, 2013.
Correspondence is included in Appendix B.

4.4.9.4 Invasive Species -

A review of the existing corridor indicates that there are several invasive species including the Tree-of-
Heaven, Garlic Mustard, Mugwort, Oriental Bittersweet, Spotted Knapweed, Japanese Knotweed, Non-
native Common Reed, Black Locust and Multiflora Rose that are located within the right-of-way.

Removal or other treatments will be considered for these species. Precautions will be taken to prevent
the introduction of additional invasive species during project design and construction.

4.4.9.5 Roadside Vegetation Management -

The project corridor consists primarily of existing roadway with sidewalk on the north side of Croton Point
Avenue and on both sides of S. Riverside Avenue. Roadside vegetation is limited. Efforts will be made
to replace wildlife-supporting vegetation that is removed in the course of construction.


4.4.10 Critical Environmental Areas

4.4.10.1 State Critical Environmental Areas -

Program funds have been applied.


4.4.13 Visual Resources

4.4.13.1 Introduction -

The project corridor consists primarily of an Urban Minor Arterial and an Urban Collector. Croton Point
Avenue is a vital link in the transportation corridor and is the primary commuter route that provides access
from US Route 9 and S. Riverside Avenue to the Croton-Harmon Train Station, located on Veterans
Plaza, south of Croton Point Avenue and west of US Route 9. There are a few commercial buildings
within the project area. However, as a commuter route, the primary viewer groups are motorists,
pedestrians, and bicyclists. The general appearance and character of the roadway corridor will be
maintained.

The overall existing visual quality is moderate with no significant or dominant views. There are numerous
utility poles, light poles and highway signage, which in some cases is erected over the existing sidewalk,
which impair the visual quality. Generally, the area is lacking in any substantive landscaping other than
indigenous vegetation which has grown on both sides of the Route 9 access ramps.

4.4.13.2 Effects Assessment ­

The area will continue to have strong visual elements created by manmade structures such as utility
poles, utility lines, highway signage and the Route 9 overpass. Impacts to the visual environment include
the designated bike lanes, new sidewalks with accessible curb ramps, the realignment of the US Route 9
northbound on ramp and the inclusion of the traffic signals on Croton Point Avenue at Veterans Plaza, US
Route 9 southbound ramps and US route 9 northbound ramps. The project includes an overlay with new
pavement markings and signage, as needed, which will provide enhanced delineation and guidance
through the corridor.

These improvements will provide a significant positive visual experience from what presently exists.

4.4.14 Farmlands

4.4.14.1 State Farmland and Agricultural Districts -

Based on a review of the NYS Agricultural District Maps for Westchester County, the proposed project is
not located in or adjacent to an Agricultural District.

4.4.14.2 Federal Prime and Unique Farmland -

The proposed project activities will not convert any prime or unique farmland, or farmland of state or local
importance, as defined by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, to a nonagricultural use.


4.4.15 Air Quality

4.4.15.1 Regulatory Framework ­

To assess air quality impacts related to traffic generation, procedures outlined in the NYSDOT
Environmental Procedures Manual (EPM) were used. The procedures address the CAA and guidance
from the U.S. EPA. The NYSDOT EPM procedures involve a screening of traffic volume and level of
service to determine the need for a detailed microscale air quality analysis.

4.4.15.2 Transportation Conformity ­

The project site is located in Westchester County, which is considered a marginal non-attainment area for
the 2008 8-hr Ozone NAAQS and a non-attainment area for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The project is
designated as an exempt project on the Transportation Plan and the 2011-2015 Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) for the Mid-Hudson South Planning Area. This TIP has been found to
conform by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) and Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), approved by amendment to the May 1999 TIP on September 6, 2000, by NYMTC
and adopted on August 4, 2011. The project's design scope and concept have not changed since the TIP
amendment determination was made.

4.4.15.3 Carbon Monoxide (CO) Microscale Analysis ­

The NYSDOT EPM outlines a three-step screening process to determine if a microscale air quality
analysis is necessary. The process is as follows: if the first screening threshold is exceeded, the second
screening is performed; if any one of the second screening thresholds is exceeded, the third screening is
performed; if the third screening threshold is exceeded, a detailed microscale analysis is warranted. If the
thresholds are satisfied for any step, the screening process is stopped and no further analysis is
necessary.

Level of Service Screening, Capture Screening and Volume Screening were performed on the proposed
project. The project would not exceed the volume threshold in any build scenario. Level of Service
Screening, Capture Screening and Volume Screening were performed on the proposed project. An air
quality analysis for CO is not required since this project will not increase traffic volumes, reduce source-
receptor distances by 10% or more, or change other existing conditions to such a degree as to jeopardize
attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The project does not require a project-level
conformity determination. See Appendix B ­ Air Quality Screening, for additional information.

4.4.15.4 Mesoscale Analysis -

The proposed project would not increase traffic volumes in the immediate and surrounding areas, nor
would it affect vehicle mix. A Mesoscale Analysis is not required for this project since it does not
significantly affect air quality conditions over a large area and is not a regionally significant project.

4.4.15.5 Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSATs) Analysis -

For any alternative, the amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to the vehicle miles traveled, or
VMT, assuming that other variables such as fleet mix are the same for each alternative. As noted, the
proposed project would not increase traffic volumes, and would not significantly alter the alignment of the
existing roadways. Therefore, the VMT would not increase and no MSAT impacts would be projected.

4.4.15.6 Particulate Matter (PM) Analysis -

The proposed project would not affect vehicle mix, nor does it currently experience significant levels of
diesel traffic, and would not increase traffic volumes. Per the criteria provided above, the project is not
projected to be of local air quality concern. As such, the project actions do not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on PM emissions. It can therefore be concluded that the project will have no
significant adverse impact on ambient PM levels.

4.4.15.7 Greenhouse Gas Analysis ­

The project is not expected to affect GHG production since no additional traffic volume will result from the
construction of the proposed project.


4.4.16 Energy

The proposed project is classified as a categorical exclusion and will not require an energy analysis since,
by definition; it will not significantly impact energy utilization.


4.4.17 Noise

The project will not significantly change either the horizontal or vertical alignment, or increase the number
of through-traffic lanes. Therefore, this project is not a Type I project and does not require a traffic noise
analysis as per 23 CFR 772.


4.4.18 Asbestos

4.4.18.1 Screening -

An asbestos screening has been performed for this project and it has been determined that there are five
areas suspect asbestos-containing materials associated with the surface features on the sidewalks and
roadway. These following suspect asbestos-containing materials were identified:

    ·   Pre-molded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on Croton Point Avenue.
    ·   Tar/sealant applied over the pre-molded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on Croton
        Point Avenue.
    ·   Grey Sidewalk Edge Sealant.
                                                    4-14
July 2013                              Draft Design Report                                      PIN 8780.41



    ·   Pre-molded bituminous joint filler at sidewalk joints.
    ·   Vertical pre-molded bituminous joint filler at jersey barrier lining the southbound entrance to
        Route 9.

In addition, there were no suspect asbestos-containing materials identified in the sub-grade based on the
review of the record drawings.

4.4.18.2 Assessment and Quantification -

On April 11, 2013, CHA staff visited the site to sample the above mentioned materials for suspect
asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). During this visit, CHA observed the following additional suspect
ACMs:
   · Pre-molded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on South Riverside Avenue.
   · Tar/sealant applied over the pre-molded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on South
       Riverside Avenue.
   · Black Sidewalk Edge Sealant at the intersection of South Riverside Avenue and Benedict
       Avenue.

A total of seven materials were quantified and the bulk samples were transmitted under chain of custody
to EMSL Laboratories of New York, a New York State Department of Health Environmental Laboratory
Approval Program (ELAP) accredited laboratory for asbestos analysis. See Appendix B for the Asbestos
Assessment report. Based on the laboratory analysis, less than 1% chrysotile was detected in the black
sidewalk edge sealant, however, based on the fact that an ACM is defined as any material containing
greater than 1% of asbestos, the black sidewalk edge sealant is not considered an ACM. The remaining
materials sampled were found to have no asbestos detected.

As a result, the joint filler and sealants on the sidewalks and roadway were found to be non-asbestos.

4.4.18.3 Mitigation Summary -

No asbestos abatement will be necessary, based on the fact that the suspect materials sampled were
found to be non-asbestos.



4.4.19 Hazardous Waste and Contaminated Materials

4.4.19.1 Screening and Site Assessment -

A Hazardous Waste/Contaminated Materials Site Screening has been conducted in accordance with
NYSDOT Environmental Procedures Manual, Chapter 5, in order to document the likely presence or
absence of hazardous/contaminated environmental conditions. A hazardous/contaminated environmental
condition is the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products
(including products currently in compliance with applicable regulations) on a property under conditions
that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous
substances or petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground, ground water, or
surface water of the property.

The Hazardous Waste/Contaminated Materials Site Screening included a review of NYSDEC regulatory
data files and a site `walkover' on March 6, 2012.

The Hazardous Waste/Contaminated Materials Site Screening identified a Hazardous
Waste/Contaminated Materials Site adjacent to the project corridor, at the northwest corner of Croton
Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue. The regulatory review indicates that this Hazardous

Waste/Contaminated Materials Site involves the presence of underground storage tanks (USTs), records
indicating that facilities are listed as non-generators of ignitable hazardous waste (including benzene)
(which indicates that the facilities may transport, store, treat and/or dispose of hazardous waste), records
indicating the presence of leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs), and spills of petroleum products.

No other hazardous waste/contaminated materials were identified during the course of the Hazardous
Waste/Contaminated Materials Site Screening. The potential risk for involvement with documented or
undocumented inactive hazardous waste materials is low.

4.4.19.2 Mitigation Summary -

NYSDOT Special Specifications for petroleum identification and potential disposal will be included in the
contract documents. A copy of the Hazardous Materials Screening Form is included in Appendix B.


4.5   Construction Effects

4.5.1 Construction Impacts

The potential construction impacts from the proposed project include minor visual, noise, air, and traffic
disruptions during construction operations. Provisions will be included in the final contract documents to
maintain vehicular and pedestrian access to all adjacent properties during construction. There are no
long-term negative impacts to the project area anticipated as a result of the proposed construction
operations.

4.5.2 Mitigation Measures

The details for the work zone traffic control measures will be developed during final design. Two-way
traffic will maintained during AM and PM peak hours through the duration of construction. Nighttime work
will be restricted from this project as a means to abate potential noise disturbances to the surrounding
residences. Erosion control measures will be developed during final design.


4.6   Indirect and Secondary Effects

4.6.1 Indirect Socioeconomic Effects

The proposed project will not change the existing land use or community character within or adjacent to
the project area. In addition, the project will not change the highway classifications of Croton Point
Avenue or S. Riverside Avenue. No significant secondary impacts are anticipated.

4.6.2 Social Consequences

There are no social consequences anticipated with this project.

4.6.3 Economic Consequences

There are no negative economic consequences anticipated with the proposed project.


4.7 Cumulative Effects
Cumulative impacts occur when the effects of an individual project or action are added to or interact with
other effects within a given time and place. A cumulative impact analysis considers the compounding

Project Description: Croton-on-Hudson Parking Facility and Bicycle Enhancements Project

Answer the following questions by checking YES or NO.

I. THRESHOLD QUESTION

        1.       Does the project involve unusual circumstances
                 as described in 23 CFR '771.117(b)?                                         YES        NO

        If YES, the project does not qualify as a Categorical Exclusion and an EA or EIS is required.
      You may STOP COMPLETING THE CHECKLIST.
- OR- ____________________________________________________________________

             If NO, continue...

II.     AUTOMATIC CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION

        2.       Is the project an action listed as an Automatic
                 Categorical Exclusion in 23 CFR '771.117(c)
                 (C List) and/or is the project an element-specific
                 project classified by FHWA as a Categorical
                 Exclusion on July 22, 1996?                                                 YES        NO

            If YES to question 2, the project qualifies for a C List Categorical Exclusion, "Automatic
        Categorical Exclusion". You may STOP COMPLETING THE CHECKLIST. The checklist should
        be included in the appendix of the Final Design Report (or Project Scoping Report/Final Design
        Report). The CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION DETERMINATION memo is to be sent to the
        appropriate Main Office Design liaison unit with a copy of the Final Design Report (or Project
        Scoping Report/Final Design Report). A copy of the CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION
        DETERMINATION memo must also be sent to the Office of Budget and Finance, Project and
        Letting Management, and others (see sample DETERMINATION memo attached).

        (Note - Even if YES to question 2, there may be specific environmental issues that still require an action such as an EO
        11990 Wetland Finding or a determination of effect on cultural resources. The project is still an Automatic Categorical
        Exclusion but the necessary action must be taken, such as obtaining FHWA's signature on the wetland finding. Refer to the
        appropriate section of the Environmental Procedures Manual for guidance.)
-OR-     ____________________________________________________________________

             If NO to question 2 above, continue below...

                          Clarification:



         If questions 3-20 are NO, 21 is YES and 22 (i-v) are YES, the project qualifies for a
     Programmatic Categorical Exclusion. You may STOP COMPLETING THE CHECKLIST. The
     checklist should be included in the appendix of the Final Design Report (or Scope Summary
     Memorandum/Final Design Report). The CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION DETERMINATION
     memo should be sent to the appropriate Main Office Design liaison unit with a copy of the Final
     Design Report (or Scope Summary Memorandum/Final Design Report.) A copy of the
     CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION DETERMINATION memo must also be sent to the Office of

-OR- ____________________________________________________________________

           If questions 3-20 are NO or effect is clarified, 21 is YES and any part of 22 is NO, go on to
        question 23.

        23.      Is the project section listed in 23 CFR
                 §771.117(d) (D List) or is the project
                 an action similar to those listed in
                 23 CFR §771.117(d)?                                                    YES        NO

For those questions which precluded a Programmatic Categorical Exclusion, documentation should be
provided for any YES response to questions 3-20 or for a NO response to any part of questions 22 (i-v).
This documentation, as well as the checklist, should be included in the Design Approval Document, i.e.,
Final Design Report, etc., to be submitted to the Main Office/FHWA Design liaison unit for submission to
the FHWA Division for classification of the project as a D List Categorical Exclusion, "Categorical
Exclusion with Documentation".

Documentation

16.      A Hazardous Waste/Contaminated Materials Site Screening, which included a review of NYSDEC regulatory
data files and a site walkover, was conducted on March 6, 2012

The Hazardous Waste/Contaminated Materials Site Screening identified four facilities with the potential to impact the
Site; three of which are along S. Riverside Avenue where only a cold mill inlay is proposed and one on Croton Point
Avenue at the northwest corner of Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue.

At the northwest corner of Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue (67 Croton Point Avenue) is the Croton-on-
Hudson Gulf. The regulatory review indicates that this Hazardous Waste/Contaminated Materials Site involves the
presence of underground storage tanks (USTs), records indicating that facilities are listed as non-generators of ignitable
hazardous waste (including benzene) (which indicates that the facilities may transport, store, treat and/or dispose of
hazardous waste), records indicating the presence of leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs), and spills of petroleum
products.

No other hazardous waste/contaminated materials were identified during the course of the Hazardous
Waste/Contaminated Materials Site Screening. The potential risk for involvement with documented or undocumented
inactive hazardous waste materials is low.

It is recommended that NYSDOT Special Specifications for petroleum identification and potential disposal be included
in the contract documents to address this.

                      FULL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FORM
PURPOSE: The full EAF is designed to help applicants and agencies determine, in an orderly manner, whether a
project or action may be significant. The question of whether an action may be significant is not always easy to
answer. Frequently, there are aspects of a project that are subjective or unmeasurable. It is also understood that those
who determine significance may have little or no formal knowledge of the environment or may not be technically
expert in environmental analysis. In addition, many who have knowledge in one particular area may not be aware of
the broader concerns affecting the question of significance. The full EAF is intended to provide a method whereby
applicants and agencies can be assured that the determination process has been orderly, comprehensive in nature, yet
flexible enough to allow introduction of information to fit a project or action.

FULL EAF COMPONENTS: The full EAF is comprised of three parts:

        Part 1: Provides objective data and information about a given project and its site. By identifying basic
                project data, it assists a reviewer in the analysis that takes place in Part 2 and 3.

        Part 2: Focuses on identifying the range of possible impacts that may occur from a project or action. It
                provides guidance as to whether an impact is likely to be considered small to moderate or whether it
                is a potentially-large impact. The form also identified whether an impact can be mitigated or
                reduced.

        Part 3: If any impact in Part 2 is identified as potentially-large, than Part 3 is used to evaluate whether or not
                the impact is actually important.

                    DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANCE ­ Type 1 and Unlisted Actions

 Identify the Portions of EAF completed for this project:        Part 1        Part 2        Part 3

 Upon review of the information recorded on this EAF (Parts 1, 2 and 3 if appropriate), and any other supporting
 information, and considering both the magnitude and importance of each impact, it is reasonably determined by
 the lead agency that:

              A. The project will not result in any large and important impact(s) and, therefore, is one which will
                 not have a significant impact on the environment, therefore, a negative declaration will be
                 prepared.

              B. Although the project could have a significant effect on the environment, there will not be a
                 significant effect for this Unlisted Action because the mitigation measures described in PART 3
                 have been required, therefore, a CONDITIONED negative declaration will be prepared.*.

              C. The project may result in one or more large and important impacts that may have a significant
                 impact on the environment, therefore, a positive declaration will be prepared.

                  *A Conditioned Negative Declaration is only valid for Unlisted actions.

                           PART 2 ­ PROJECT IMPACTS AND THEIR MAGNITUDE
                                      RESPONSIBILITY OF LEAD AGENCY


GENERAL INFORMATION (Read Carefully)

    In completing the form, the reviewer should be guided by the question: Have my responses and determinations
    been reasonable? The reviewer is not expected to be an expert environmental analyst.

    The examples provided are to assist the reviewer by showing types of impacts and, wherever possible, the
    threshold of magnitude that would trigger a response in column 2. The examples are generally applicable
    throughout the State and for most situations. But, for any specific project or site other examples and/or lower
    thresholds may be appropriate for a Potential large Impact response, thus requiring evaluation in Part 3.

    The impacts of each project, on each site, in each locality, will vary. Therefore, the examples are illustrative and
    have been offered as guidance. They do not constitute an exhaustive list of impacts and thresholds to answer
    each question.

    The number of examples per question does not indicate the importance of each question.

    In identifying impacts, consider long term, short term and cumulative effects .

 INSTRUCTIONS (Read Carefully)
 a. Answer each of the 20 questions in PART 2. Answer Yes if there will be any impact.
 b. Maybe answers should be considered as Yes answers.
 c. If answering Yes to a question, check the appropriate box (column 1 or 2) to indicate the potential size of the
     impact. If impact threshold equals or exceeds any example provided, check column 2. If impact will occur, but
     threshold is lower than example, check column 1.
 d. Identifying that an impact will be potentially large (column 2) does not mean that it is also necessarily significant.
     Any large impact must be evaluated in PART 3 to determine significance. Identifying an impact in column 2
     simply asks that it be looked at further.
 e. If reviewer has doubt about size of the impact, then consider the impact as potentially large and proceed to PART 3.
 f. If a potentially large impact checked in column 2 can be mitigated by change(s) in the project to a small to moderate
     impact, also check the Yes box in column 3. A No response indicates that such a reduction is not possible. This
     must be explained in Part 3.

                                 COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM


D. REMARKS OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Consistency with the Village of Croton-on-Hudson's Local Waterfront Revitalization Program.

The proposed project is located within an area that has an approved Local Waterfront Revitalization
Program (LWRP). As such, the project must be consistent with the LWRP. The following local policies
apply to the proposed project, and consistency with these policies is discussed below.

Section C.4.p)

Policy 37 ­ Best management practices will be utilized to minimize the non-point discharge of
excess nutrients, organics and eroded soils into coastal waters.

Policy 37A ­ Standards and specifications for the control of non-point source discharge as set
forth in Westchester County's Best Management Practice Manual or other recognized reference
shall be utilized during development of any site.

Policy 37B - Control of the development of hilltops, and steep slopes should be exerted in order to
prevent erosion and minimize the runoff and flooding from new construction.

Best management practices include both structural and non-structural methods of preventing or mitigating
pollution caused by the discharge of stormwater runoff. No permanent measures are proposed.

This project will disturb less than one acre and will not require a SPDES permit. Currently, Croton Point
Avenue, S. Riverside Avenue and Veterans plaza have a closed drainage system with the exception of
the south side of Croton Point Avenue from the US Route 9 Bridge to S. Riverside Avenue where
stormwater sheet flows off the pavement. The proposed curbing and sidewalk will incorporate the south
side of Croton Point Avenue from the US Route 9 ramp into the current closed drainage system. The
remainder of the drainage system will function much as it does today.

The project will employ effective temporary erosion and sediment control practices during construction, as
set forth in NYSDOT's statewide stormwater and erosion and sedimentation control specifications,
standard construction details, and design and construction guidance procedures.

Subject:        Croton-on-Hudson Parking Facility Pedestrian and Bicycle Enhancements
                PIN 8780.41 - Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester County, New York.

Dear Mr. Castiglione:

CHA Consulting, Inc. (CHA), has been contracted by the Village of Croton-on-Hudson to provide
engineering services in planning and designing roadway, pedestrian and bicycle enhancements along
Croton Point Avenue and South Riverside Avenue in the Village of Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester
County, New York.. This project is a locally administered federally-funded project with the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson as the project sponsor. Pinyon Environmental, Inc. (Pinyon), has been retained by
CHA to provide a cultural resource assessment, in accordance with FHWA and NYS DOT design
requirements, to determine if there will be any impacts through the development of this project.

The site is located in an urban area of Westchester County, along Croton Point Avenue from Veterans
Plaza (Croton train station) to South Riverside Avenue and north on South Riverside Avenue to its
intersection with Benedict Boulevard and includes the north- and south-bound entrance ramps onto Route
9. The project includes the construction of pedestrian and bicycle enhancements, drainage improvements,
traffic signal installation, capacity improvements at the Route 9 ramps and other miscellaneous work.

The project appears to be located in the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area and, as such, we
are contacting your agency as the management entity for the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area.

Included is a site location map, a photo location map and photos of the project area for your reference.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 518.369.3988 or e-mail simmonds@pinyon-env.com.

Sincerely,
PINYON ENVIRONMENTAL, INC.

Christine,

I just spoke with Mark Castiglione on the phone regarding the letter sent in October of 2011. The letter itself is a
notification and isn't asking for written concurrence or an opinion. He said that the agency doesn't typically respond in
writing to these types of notifications for projects like the Croton-on-Hudson project. He verbally stated that the agency
has no comment or objection to this project.

Thank you,

4.4.18 Asbestos

4.4.18.1 Screening
An asbestos screening has been performed for this project and it has been determined that there are 
five suspect asbestoscontaining materials associated with the surface features on the sidewalks and 
roadway.  These following suspect asbestoscontaining materials were identified: 
 
      Premolded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on Croton Point Avenue. 
      Tar/sealant applied over the premolded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on Croton 
         Point Avenue. 
      Grey Sidewalk Edge Sealant. 
      Vertical premolded bituminous joint filler at jersey barrier lining the southbound entrance to 
         Route 9. 
 
In addition, there were no suspect asbestoscontaining materials identified in the subgrade based on 
the review of the record drawings. 
 
4.4.18.2 Assessment and Quantification -
 
On April 11, 2013, CHA staff visited the site to sample the above mentioned materials for suspect 
asbestoscontaining materials (ACMs).  During this visit, CHA observed the following additional suspect 
ACMs: 
 
      Premolded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on South Riverside Avenue. 
      Tar/sealant applied over the premolded bituminous joint filler at the concrete joints on South 
         Riverside Avenue. 
      Black Sidewalk Edge Sealant at the intersection of South Riverside Avenue and Benedict Avenue. 
 
A total of seven materials were quantified and the bulk samples were transmitted under chain of 
custody to EMSL Laboratories of New York, a New York State Department of Health Environmental 
Laboratory Approval Program (ELAP) accredited laboratory for asbestos analysis.  Table 1 summarizes 
the samples collected during the site visit and the corresponding analytical results.

ND = No asbestos detected.
 
Based on the laboratory analysis, less than 1% chrysotile was detected in the black sidewalk edge 
sealant, however, based on the fact that an ACM is defined as any material containing greater than 1% 
of asbestos, the black sidewalk edge sealant is not considered an ACM.  The remaining materials 
sampled were found to have no asbestos detected. 
 
As a result, the joint filler and sealants on the sidewalks and roadway were found to be nonasbestos.  
Analytical reports for the bulk asbestos sample analysis are included as Attachment A and personal and 
Laboratory certifications are included as Attachment C. 
 
4.4.18.3 Mitigation Summary -
Based on the fact that the suspect materials sampled were found to be nonasbestos, no asbestos 
abatement will be necessary.

Subject:       Limited Hazardous Materials Assessment for Croton-on-Hudson Parking Facility
               Pedestrian and Bicycle Enhancements; PIN 8780.41 Croton-on-Hudson,
               Westchester County, New York

Dear Ms. Lilholt:

CHA Consulting, Inc. (CHA), has been contracted by the Village of Croton-on-Hudson to
provide engineering services in planning and designing roadway, pedestrian and bicycle
enhancements ("Project") along Croton Point Boulevard located in the Village of Croton-on-
Hudson in Westchester County, New York ("Site", depicted in Figure 1). This is a locally-
administered and federally-funded project, and therefore must follow design procedures outlined
in the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Procedures for Locally
Administered Federal-Aid Projects Manual (PLAFAP) and the Environmental Manual (EM).
Pinyon Environmental, Inc. (Pinyon), has been retained by CHA to assess hazardous waste and
contaminated materials on and in the vicinity of the Site, prior to the proposed activities.

INTRODUCTION AND PROJECT BACKGROUND

The Site is comprised of an approximately 1,000-foot stretch of Croton Point Avenue roadway,
located to the east of Veterans Plaza and the west of South Riverside Avenue (see Figure 1). The
Site is adjoined to the west, northwest, and southwest by the Croton-Harmon Metro North Rail
Station, associated parking facilities, and undeveloped land. The western-central portion of the
Site is intersected by Route 9, which extends over Croton Point Avenue in a north/south
orientation via an overpass. In addition, associated on and off ramps extend from Croton Point
Avenue to Route 9. The central and eastern portions of the Site are adjoined to the north by
commercial properties, including a gasoline station on the northwestern corner of the Croton
Point Avenue and South Riverside Avenue intersection. A large commercial shopping plaza
adjoins the eastern portion to the south. The surrounding area is generally comprised of the
Metro North Rail Station facility and Croton Point Park to the west; residential properties to the
north (east of Route 9); and mixed commercial and residential properties along South Riverside
Avenue.

The proposed Project includes plans to replace existing sidewalk and roadside infrastructure in
order to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traffic. In addition, the proposed Project will
upgrade signage and signals to increase safety for travelers in the vicinity of the Site. Figure 1,
depicting the proposed development and Project schematics, is included as an attachment.

METHODS

The purpose of this Limited Hazardous Materials Assessment (LHA) was to evaluate the
potential presence of hazardous and/or toxic materials which may impact the Site. This
assessment was conducted in accordance with generally accepted standards, practices and
procedures (expressed or implied), including the New York State Department of Transportation
(NYSDOT), Hazardous Waste and Contaminated Materials, Project Environmental Guidelines
(dated June 1999). A copy of the NYSDOT Hazardous Waste and Contaminated Materials Site
Inspection Checklist is included as an attachment.

The scope of services for the project included the following:

   1. A reconnaissance survey of the Site and surrounding area to evaluate present conditions
      on March 6, 2012, by Rosie Wilson.

   2. Evaluation of the Site's history through the analysis of available historic maps, historic
      aerial photographs, and local governmental and/or Tribal records.

   3. A review of the compliance history of the Site, and any adjacent/nearby sites, as
      identified by an environmental regulatory database search (Environmental Data
      Resources Inc. (EDR)). The compliance history was conducted in accordance with ASTM
      Phase I Environmental Site Assessment search standards.

   4. A review of reasonably available records from appropriate federal, state, and local
      regulatory agencies for documented soil and/or ground-water contamination
      investigations conducted at the Site and the vicinity, as identified by the EDR database
      search.

Site History

Historic Sanborn Maps

A review of historic Sanborn maps (several years dated between 1935 and 1965) indicates that
Croton Point Avenue was present in 1935. At that time, Benedict Boulevard intersected Croton
Point Avenue along the western portion of the Site (in the approximate location of western Site
boundary). An auto repair garage with two associated gasoline tanks was depicted on the
northeast intersection of Benedict Boulevard and Croton Point Avenue (presumably located on
Site). An additional auto repair garage, associated gasoline tank (located in the roadway), and
parking facilities were present to the west (presumably off-site). With the exception of scattered
residential and/or small commercial structures to the north, the area was generally undeveloped.

In 1950, the previously mentioned structure on the northeast intersection of Benedict Boulevard
and Croton Point Avenue remained present; however, the gasoline tanks were no longer depicted.
In addition, the previously mentioned structure and gasoline tank to the west were no longer
depicted. The Site, adjoining, and surrounding properties remained relatively unchanged. The
1965 Sanborn map depicts Route 9, the overpass, and associated on- and off-ramps along the
western portion of the Site. The previously mentioned Benedict Boulevard and Croton Point
Avenue intersection and auto repair garage were no longer present. The adjoining properties to
the north and southeast of Croton Point Avenue (east of Route 9) were more developed with
residential and/or small commercial structures; however, the properties at the northwestern
intersection of Croton Point Avenue and South Riverside Avenue remained vacant.

An auto repair facility and associated gasoline tanks were reportedly present on the western
portion of the Site from at least 1935 until 1950. No information regarding the removal of these
tanks was provided in the agency database listings; therefore, the potential presence of tanks
represents a recognized environmental condition.

Historic Aerial Photographs

A review of aerial photographs (various years dated 1953 to 2006) confirms that Croton Point
Avenue was present in 1953. The adjoining properties and surrounding areas along the eastern
portion were generally undeveloped in 1953, with some apparent small commercial and/or
residential properties. A railroad and parking facilities were present to the west. The area
appeared more developed in 1964, with the apparent construction of Route 9 in progress. In
addition, commercial structures were present adjoining the eastern portion of Croton Point
Avenue. The 1973 aerial photographs depicted a completed Route 9 and associated on- and off-
ramps, with an overpass extending over Croton Point Avenue. The adjoining and surrounding
properties were more developed and remain relatively unchanged through the early 1980s.

In 1984, a large commercial plaza and other commercial structures consistent with current
developed uses were present along the eastern portion of the Site. A small structure was visible
on the northwestern corner of the Croton Point Avenue and South Riverside intersection;
however, specific details were not distinguishable. An apparent gasoline station was present on
the northwest corner of the Croton Point Avenue and South Riverside intersection in 1994,
consistent in the size and location to the current adjoining gasoline station. The Site, adjoining,
and surrounding properties remained relatively unchanged through 2006.

The presence of a gasoline station adjoining the eastern portion of the Site (located on the
northwestern corner of the Croton Point Avenue and South Riverside intersection) is considered
to be a recognized environmental condition (note: more detailed information regarding this
facility is discussed in the Agency Database Listings section, below).

Agency Database Listings

The agency database identified 155 listings within applicable radii of the Site and approximately
20 facilities with poor or inadequate addresses (unmappable, orphan sites) that are assumed to be
within the general vicinity of the Site. Pinyon reviewed adjoining and nearby properties in close
proximity to the Site boundaries, with specific emphasis on facilities that have the potential to
impact the Site. Based on the location of the facilities relative to the Site, the topographic
gradient and presumed groundwater flow direction (west/southwest), and current/historic
property uses, the following facilities were identified with the potential to impact the Site.

Croton-on-Hudson Gulf, 67 Croton Point Avenue ­ According to a review of available records,
this adjoining property (located on the northwest intersection of Croton Point Avenue and South
Riverside Avenue) is an active petroleum bulk storage facility, which has been in service since at
least 1966. Records indicate the presence of several underground storage tanks (USTs),
including: three USTs ranging with capacities of 550 gallons to 6,000-gallons reportedly
installed in 1966 and subsequently removed (date unknown); five USTs ranging in capacities of
1,000-gallons to 12,000-gallons reportedly installed in 1988 and subsequently removed in 1994;
and, three, 10,000-gallon gasoline USTs reportedly installed in 2009. In addition, available
records indicate that this facility is listed as a non-generator of ignitable hazardous waste
(including benzene), which indicates that this facility may transport, store, treat and/or dispose of
hazardous waste. No known spills are reported for this facility and no other information was
provided in available records. Given the proposed development, location of this facility relative
to the Site, and the presumed groundwater flow direction, this facility is considered to be a
recognized environmental condition.

Riverside Gulf, 379 South Riverside Avenue ­ According to a review of available records, this
nearby property (located upgradient approximately 450 feet northeast of the Site) is the location
of a leaking underground storage tank (LUST) event. The spill was reported on November 19,
1990, as the result of a tank test failure on a gasoline UST. Records indicate that groundwater
was affected; however, the spill was closed in 1995. No other information regarding the spill or
subsequent remedial actions was provided in available records. The facility address was also
recognized as the Nappy Auto Collision, Inc., facility, below.

Nappy Auto Collision, Inc., 379 South Riverside Avenue ­ According to a review of available
records, this nearby property is a historic registered UST facility (note: the facility status is now
unregulated). Records indicate the presence of several storage tanks, including: four, 3,000-
gallon gasoline and diesel USTs which were reportedly closed-in-place in 1992; and, three, 550-
gallon kerosene/other USTs which were removed in 1998. In addition, a 275-gallon
aboveground storage tank (AST) was removed from the property in 1992. No other information
regarding the historic presence of storage tanks was provided in available records. Given the
reported spill at this facility (above), the proximity to the Site, and the presumed direction of
groundwater flow, this facility is considered to be a recognized environmental condition.

Oil City, 380 South Riverside Avenue ­ According to a review of available records, this nearby
property (located upgradient approximately 450 feet north of the Site) is an active petroleum
bulk storage facility and the location of two LUST events. The spills were reported on October
12 and October 28, 1988, as the result of a tank test failure and subsequent discovery of
contaminated soil, respectively. Records indicate that four tanks were discovered to be leaking
and were removed; contaminated soil was excavated and groundwater was reportedly not
impacted. The spill was closed in circa 1990 following the installation of five currently active
tanks, including: two, 8,000-gallon gasoline USTs; one, 8,000-gallon diesel UST; one, 500-
gallon fuel oil UST; and, one, 300-gallon waste oil UST. No other information regarding the
spill or subsequent remedial actions was provided in available records. In addition, available
records indicate that this facility is listed as a non-generator of ignitable hazardous waste
(including benzene), which indicates that this facility may transport, store, treat and/or dispose of
hazardous waste. Given the reported spill at this facility (above), the proximity to the Site, and
the presumed direction of groundwater flow, this facility is considered to be a recognized
environmental condition.

CONCLUSIONS:

Based on a review of available information, several facilities were identified in the Site vicinity
which have the potential to impact soil and groundwater sources. Given the potential for
petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soil and groundwater to be present from historic and current
Site and nearby property activities, it is recommended that construction activities be evaluated
with respect to the depth of construction. Should the depth of excavation activities approach the
depth of groundwater, a Materials Management Plan should be developed. During times when
excavation is completed in the vicinity of the facilities identified as a risk, a Monitoring
Technician should be on-site in order to document any encountered conditions of concern
(including petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soil and groundwater).

If a Materials Management Plan is required, it is recommended that further review of New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation and Westchester County environmental files be
reviewed in order to completely evaluate the status of the adjoining Croton-on-Hudson Gulf
gasoline station and the extent of remediation activities at nearby former LUST event facilities.

The project, known as the Croton Harmon Parking Facility and Bicycle Enhancements seeks to construct
pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure on both sides of Croton Point Avenue between Veterans Plaza and
S. Riverside Avenue. The proposed project is located in Westchester County, New York. The Build
condition includes the following improvements:
   · Signalization at the intersections of Croton Point Avenue with Veterans Plaza, US Route 9
        southbound ramps, and at US Route 9 northbound ramps.
   · Retains the reversible lane concept on Veterans Plaza but adds a 10-foot lane for approximately
        100-feet to always permit two (2) entering and two (2) exiting lanes; they do also include
        transition back to the existing 3-lanesection.
   · Construction of a southbound right turn-lane on the US Route 9 southbound off-ramp
   · Narrowing of the US Route 9 eastbound channelized right turn-lane to go through the intersection
        proper.

The proposed project is not expected to increase traffic volumes above the no-build alternative in the ETC
(2013), ETC+10 (2023) or ETC+20 (2033) years.

4.4.15.1 Regulatory Framework
The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments and guidelines, issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), set forth guidelines to be followed by agencies responsible for attainment of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The CAA section 176(c) requires that Federal transportation
projects are consistent with state air quality goals, found in the State Implementation Plan (SIP),
developed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). The process
to ensure this consistency is called Transportation Conformity. Conformity to the SIP means that
transportation activities will not cause new violations of the NAAQS, worsen existing violations of the
standards, or delay timely attainment of the relevant standard. In complying with these guidelines, the
following screening will demonstrate air quality conformity

To assess air quality impacts related to traffic generation, procedures outlined in the NYSDOT
Environmental Procedures Manual (EPM) were used. The procedures address the CAA and guidance
from the U.S. EPA. The NYSDOT EPM procedures involve a screening of traffic volume and level of
service to determine the need for a detailed microscale air quality analysis.

4.4.15.2 Transportation Conformity
The project site is located in Westchester County, which is considered a marginal non-attainment area for
the 2008 8-hr Ozone NAAQS and a non-attainment area for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The project is
designated as an exempt project on the Transportation Plan and the 2011-2015 Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) for the Mid-Hudson South Planning Area. This TIP has been found to
conform by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) and Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), approved by amendment to the May 1999 TIP on September 6, 2000, by NYMTC
and adopted on August 4, 2011. The project's design scope and concept have not changed since the TIP
amendment determination was made.

CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND THEIR EFFECTS
Pollutants that have established national standards are referred to as criteria pollutants. The sources of
these pollutants, their effects on human health and the nation's welfare and their final deposition in the
atmosphere vary considerably. Of the six EPA criteria pollutants, GDOT is primarily concerned with only
four: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Mobile Source Air Toxics
(MSATs). Brief descriptions of the criteria pollutants follow.

Ozone (O3)
Ozone (O3), a colorless toxic gas, is a major component of smog. Ozone can cause acute respiratory
problems, aggravate asthma, cause significant temporary decreases in lung capacity of 15 to over 20
percent in some healthy adults; and cause inflammation of lung tissue. Ozone also damages vegetation

                                                    1
by inhibiting its growth. Although ozone is not directly emitted, it forms in the atmosphere through a
chemical reaction between volatile organic compounds VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are
emitted from industrial sources and automobiles. Substantial O3 formations generally require a stable
atmosphere with strong sunlight.

Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless and odorless gas, interferes with the transfer of oxygen to the brain.
CO is emitted almost exclusively from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Prolonged exposure to
high levels of CO can cause headaches, drowsiness, loss of equilibrium, heart disease, and in severe
cases, CO inhalation can result in death. CO concentrations can vary greatly over relatively short
distances. Relatively high concentrations are typically found near congested intersections, along heavily
used roadways carrying slow-moving traffic and in areas where atmospheric dispersion is inhibited by
urban "street canyon" conditions. To accurately assess air quality conditions, CO concentrations must be
predicted on a localized (micro-scale) basis.

Particulate Matter (PM)
Particulate matter pollution is composed of solid particles or liquid droplets small enough to remain
suspended in the air. This can include dust, soot, smoke, salts, acids and metals, which can be irritating,
but are usually non-poisonous. Particulate matter pollution can also include bits of solid or liquid
substances that can be highly toxic. The main health effect of airborne particulate matter relates to the
respiratory system. Federal and State health officials have identified health concerns specific to fine
particulate matter (PM2.5), which are particles smaller than or equal to 2.5 microns (m) in size. PM2.5 can
penetrate the human respiratory system's natural defenses and damage the respiratory tract when
inhaled, and fine particulate matter penetrates deeper into the lungs and damages lung tissues more than
larger, coarser particulate matter. PM2.5 results from fuel combustion (from motor vehicles, power
generation and industrial facilities), residential fireplaces and wood stoves. PM2.5 can also be formed in
the atmosphere from gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), NOx and VOCs.

Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSATs)
In addition to the criteria air pollutants for which there are NAAQS, the EPA also regulates air toxics. Most
air toxics originate from human-made sources, including on-road mobile sources, non-road mobile
sources (e.g., airplanes), area sources (e.g., dry cleaners) and stationary sources (e.g., factories or
refineries).

Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSATs) are a subset of the 188 air toxics defined by the CAA. MSATs are
compounds emitted from highway vehicles and non-road equipment. Some toxic compounds are present
in fuel and are emitted to the air when the fuel evaporates or passes through the engine unburned. Other
toxins are emitted from the incomplete combustion of fuels or as secondary combustion products. Metal
air toxins result from engine wear or from impurities in oil or gasoline.


4.4.15.3 Carbon Monoxide (CO) Microscale Analysis
The NYSDOT EPM outlines a three-step screening process to determine if a microscale air quality
analysis is necessary. The process is as follows: if the first screening threshold is exceeded, the second
screening is performed; if any one of the second screening thresholds is exceeded, the third screening is
performed; if the third screening threshold is exceeded, a detailed microscale analysis is warranted. If the
thresholds are satisfied for any step, the screening process is stopped and no further analysis is
necessary.

The first step of the screening is to analyze the level of service for the signalized intersections. A level of
service of C or better indicates a detailed microscale air quality analysis is not required. A level of service
of D or worse indicates the threshold is exceeded, and it is necessary to perform the second screening.

The second step of the screening, for intersections operating at level of service D or worse, is to analyze
five project-related and traffic related thresholds. These five thresholds are a 10% or more reduction in
the source-receptor distance; a 10% or more increase in traffic volume on the affected roadways; a 10%

                                                      2
or more increase in vehicle emissions; any increase in the number of queued lanes; and a 20% reduction
in speed, when the build estimated average speed is at 30 mph or less. If none of these thresholds are
exceeded a detailed microscale air quality analysis is not necessary. If any one of these thresholds is
exceeded, then it is necessary to perform the third screening.

The third step of the screening requires analyzing the volume threshold of the project. The volume
threshold screening involves analyzing the project specific emission factors compared to the EPM's
vehicle threshold tables. A project that has a peak hour traffic volume equal to or less than the EPM's
tabulated value indicates the threshold is not exceeded and the project does not need a microscale air
quality analysis. If the volume threshold is exceeded, a detailed microscale air quality analysis is
warranted.

LOS Screening
Intersections impacted by a project with a build ETC, ETC+10, and ETC+20 level of service (LOS) of only
A, B, or C, are generally excluded from microscale air quality analysis. Any intersections with LOS D or
worse would then proceed to Capture Screening. Intersections within the project area exhibiting ETC,
ETC +10 or ETC+20 build LOS D or worse are limited to the intersection of Croton Point Avenue and the
Route 9 southbound on/off-ramps in the ETC+20 alternative.

Capture Criteria Screening
The next step of the CO screening examines only those intersections with LOS of D or greater. The
criteria for the Capture Criteria Screening are as follows:

    a)   10% or more source-receptor distance reduction
    b)   10% or more traffic volume increase
    c)   10%or more vehicle emission increase
    d)   Any number of queued lane increase
    e)   20% or more speed decrease for speeds at 30 mph or less

If any one of the above criteria are realized, for the given intersection, the assessment would proceed to
the Volume Threshold Criteria. One additional lane would be installed along the Route 9 southbound off
ramp at the intersection with Croton Point Avenue; therefore the volume threshold analysis is required.

Volume Threshold Screening
The vehicle threshold tables (EPM Table 3a, Table 3b, and Table 3c) tie the volume threshold with
emission factors. The advantage of this approach is that emission factors determined by project area
specific vehicle speed, thermal states, and emission control strategies are used in the determination of
vehicle thresholds. A wind speed of 1 m/s and an atmospheric stability of E are assumed in the
development of the tables. The thresholds establish traffic volumes below which a violation of the NAAQS
for carbon monoxide is extremely unlikely. Therefore, projects whose ETC, ETC+10, and ETC+20 peak
hour volume, or if unavailable, design hour volumes (see discussion in Section 10.C.iii.) are equal to or
less than the applicable threshold do not need a microscale air quality analysis.

The emissions factors are based on primarily on vehicle mix and vehicle speed, as well as other factors
such as temperature, cold start percentage and fuel mix. However vehicle mix and speed are the only
variable inputs required for the volume threshold criteria test. Emission rates were calculated for free flow
speeds and vehicle idle. See table 1 below for emission rate calculations.

As presented in Table 2, the Volume threshold is not exceeded for the studied intersection. No CO
impacts are projected and no Microscale CO study is required.

In summary, an air quality analysis is not necessary since the project will not increase traffic volumes,
reduce source-receptor distances, or change other existing conditions to such a degree as to jeopardize
attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

4.4.15.4 Mesoscale Analysis

If the project would significantly affect traffic conditions over a large area, it is also appropriate to consider
regional air quality effects of the project by way of a mesoscale analysis. A Mesoscale Analysis is not
required for this project since the project would not increase traffic volumes in the immediate or
surrounding area, would not significantly affect air quality conditions over a large area and is not a
regionally significant project.

4.4.15.5 Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSATs) Analysis -

Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) assessments are required statewide for most federal transportation
projects. Based on the example projects defined in the FHWA guidance "Interim Guidance Update on
Mobile Source Air Toxic Analysis in NEPA Documents" dated December 6, 2012, the project would be
classified as a project with low potential MSAT effects. In addition to the criteria air pollutants that must
meet the NAAQS, EPA also regulates air toxics. Most air toxics originate from human-made sources,
including on-road mobile sources, non-road mobile sources (e.g., airplanes), area sources (e.g., dry
cleaners) and stationary sources (e.g., factories or refineries).

Background
Controlling air toxic emissions became a national priority with the passage of the Clean Air Act
Amendments (CAAA) of 1990, whereby Congress mandated that the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) regulate 188 air toxics, also known as hazardous air pollutants. The EPA has assessed
this expansive list in their latest rule on the Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants from Mobile Sources
(Federal Register, Vol. 72, No. 37, page 8430, February 26, 2007), and identified a group of 93
compounds emitted from mobile sources that are listed in their Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)
( http://www.epa.gov/iris/). In addition, EPA identified seven compounds with significant contributions from
                                                        5
mobile sources that are among the national and regional-scale cancer risk drivers from their 1999
National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata1999/). These are acrolein,
benzene, 1,3-butidiene, diesel particulate matter plus diesel exhaust organic gases (diesel PM),
formaldehyde, naphthalene, and polycyclic organic matter. While FHWA considers these the priority
mobile source air toxics, the list is subject to change and may be adjusted in consideration of future EPA
rules. The 2007 EPA rule mentioned above requires controls that will dramatically decrease MSAT
emissions through cleaner fuels and cleaner engines.

Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES)
According to EPA, MOVES improves upon the previous MOBILE model in several key aspects: MOVES
is based on a vast amount of in-use vehicle data collected and analyzed since the latest release of
MOBILE, including millions of emissions measurements from light-duty vehicles. Analysis of this data
enhanced EPA's understanding of how mobile sources contribute to emissions inventories and the
relative effectiveness of various control strategies. In addition, MOVES accounts for the significant effects
that vehicle speed and temperature have on PM emissions estimates, whereas MOBILE did not.
MOVES2010b includes all air toxic pollutants in NATA that are emitted by mobile sources. EPA has
incorporated more recent data into MOVES2010b to update and enhance the quality of MSAT emission
estimates. These data reflect advanced emission control technology and modern fuels, plus additional
data for older technology vehicles.

Based on an FHWA analysis using EPA's MOVES2010b model, as shown in Figure 1, even if vehicle-
miles travelled (VMT) increases by 102 percent as assumed from 2010 to 2050, a combined reduction of
83 percent in the total annual emissions for the priority MSAT is projected for the same time period.
The implications of MOVES on MSAT emissions estimates compared to MOBILE are: lower estimates of
total MSAT emissions; significantly lower benzene emissions; significantly higher diesel PM emissions,
especially for lower speeds. Consequently, diesel PM is projected to be the dominant component of the
emissions total.

Air toxics analysis is a continuing area of research. While much work has been done to assess the overall
health risk of air toxics, many questions remain unanswered. In particular, the tools and techniques for
assessing project-specific health outcomes as a result of lifetime MSAT exposure remain limited. These
limitations impede the ability to evaluate how potential public health risks posed by MSAT exposure
should be factored into project-level decision-making within the context of NEPA.
Nonetheless, air toxics concerns continue to be raised on highway projects during the NEPA process.
Even as the science emerges, we are duly expected by the public and other agencies to address MSAT
impacts in our environmental documents. The FHWA, EPA, the Health Effects Institute, and others have
funded and conducted research studies to try to more clearly define potential risks from MSAT emissions
associated with highway projects. The FHWA will continue to monitor the developing research in this field.

Qualitative MSAT Assessment
For any alternative, the amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to the vehicle miles traveled, or
VMT, assuming that other variables such as fleet mix are the same for each alternative. As noted, the
proposed project would not increase traffic volumes, and would not significantly alter the alignment of the
existing roadways. Therefore, the VMT would not increase and no MSAT impacts would be projected.

Incomplete or Unavailable Information for Project-Specific MSAT Health Impacts Analysis
In FHWA's view, information is incomplete or unavailable to credibly predict the project-specific health
impacts due to changes in MSAT emissions associated with a proposed set of highway alternatives. The
outcome of such an assessment, adverse or not, would be influenced more by the uncertainty introduced
                                                     7
into the process through assumption and speculation rather than any genuine insight into the actual
health impacts directly attributable to MSAT exposure associated with a proposed action.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for protecting the public health and
welfare from any known or anticipated effect of an air pollutant. They are the lead authority for
administering the Clean Air Act and its amendments and have specific statutory obligations with respect
to hazardous air pollutants and MSAT. The EPA is in the continual process of assessing human health
effects, exposures, and risks posed by air pollutants. They maintain the Integrated Risk Information
System (IRIS), which is "a compilation of electronic reports on specific substances found in the
environment and their potential to cause human health effects" (EPA, http://www.epa.gov/iris/). Each
report contains assessments of non-cancerous and cancerous effects for individual compounds and
quantitative estimates of risk levels from lifetime oral and inhalation exposures with uncertainty spanning
perhaps an order of magnitude.
Other organizations are also active in the research and analyses of the human health effects of MSAT,
including the Health Effects Institute (HEI). Two HEI studies are summarized in Appendix D of FHWA's
Interim Guidance Update on Mobile source Air Toxic Analysis in NEPA Documents. Among the adverse
health effects linked to MSAT compounds at high exposures are; cancer in humans in occupational
settings; cancer in animals; and irritation to the respiratory tract, including the exacerbation of asthma.
Less obvious is the adverse human health effects of MSAT compounds at current environmental
concentrations (HEI, http://pubs.healtheffects.org/view.php?id=282) or in the future as vehicle emissions
substantially decrease (HEI, http://pubs.healtheffects.org/view.php?id=306).
The methodologies for forecasting health impacts include emissions modeling; dispersion modeling;
exposure modeling; and then final determination of health impacts - each step in the process building on
the model predictions obtained in the previous step. All are encumbered by technical shortcomings or
uncertain science that prevents a more complete differentiation of the MSAT health impacts among a set
of project alternatives. These difficulties are magnified for lifetime (i.e., 70 year) assessments, particularly
because unsupportable assumptions would have to be made regarding changes in travel patterns and
vehicle technology (which affects emissions rates) over that time frame, since such information is
unavailable.
It is particularly difficult to reliably forecast 70-year lifetime MSAT concentrations and exposure near
roadways; to determine the portion of time that people are actually exposed at a specific location; and to
establish the extent attributable to a proposed action, especially given that some of the information
needed is unavailable.
There are considerable uncertainties associated with the existing estimates of toxicity of the various
MSAT, because of factors such as low-dose extrapolation and translation of occupational exposure data
to the general population, a concern expressed by HEI (http://pubs.healtheffects.org/view.php?id=282).
As a result, there is no national consensus on air dose-response values assumed to protect the public
health and welfare for MSAT compounds, and in particular for diesel PM. The EPA
(http://www.epa.gov/risk/basicinformation.htm#g)              and                the               HEI
(http://pubs.healtheffects.org/getfile.php?u=395) have not established a basis for quantitative risk
assessment of diesel PM in ambient settings.
There is also the lack of a national consensus on an acceptable level of risk. The current context is the
process used by the EPA as provided by the Clean Air Act to determine whether more stringent controls
are required in order to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent an
adverse environmental effect for industrial sources subject to the maximum achievable control technology
standards, such as benzene emissions from refineries. The decision framework is a two-step process.
The first step requires EPA to determine an "acceptable" level of risk due to emissions from a source,
which is generally no greater than approximately 100 in a million. Additional factors are considered in the
second step, the goal of which is to maximize the number of people with risks less than 1 in a million due
to emissions from a source. The results of this statutory two-step process do not guarantee that cancer
risks from exposure to air toxics are less than 1 in a million; in some cases, the residual risk determination
could result in maximum individual cancer risks that are as high as approximately 100 in a million. In a
June 2008 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld EPA's approach


                                                       8
to addressing risk in its two step decision framework. Information is incomplete or unavailable to establish
that even the largest of highway projects would result in levels of risk greater than deemed acceptable.
Because of the limitations in the methodologies for forecasting health impacts described, any predicted
difference in health impacts between alternatives is likely to be much smaller than the uncertainties
associated with predicting the impacts. Consequently, the results of such assessments would not be
useful to decision makers, who would need to weigh this information against project benefits, such as
reducing traffic congestion, accident rates, and fatalities plus improved access for emergency response,
that are better suited for quantitative analysis.

4.4.15.6 Particulate Matter (PM) Analysis -
The project is located in a non-attainment area for PM 2.5. Section 93.123(b)(1) of the conformity rule
defines the projects that require a PM2.5 or PM10 hot-spot analysis as:

  i.    New highway projects that have a significant number of diesel vehicles, and expanded highway
        projects that have a significant increase in the number of diesel vehicles;
  ii.   Projects affecting intersections that are at LOS D, E, or F with a significant number of diesel
        vehicles, or those that will change to LOS D, E, or F because of increased traffic volumes from a
        significant number of diesel vehicles related to the project;
 iii.   New bus and rail terminals and transfer points that have a significant number of diesel vehicles
        congregating at a single location;
 iv.    Expanded bus and rail terminals and transfer points that significantly increase the number of
        diesel vehicles congregating at a single location; and
  v.    Projects in or affecting locations, areas, or categories of sites which are identified in the PM2.5 or
        PM10 applicable implementation plan or implementation plan submission, as appropriate, as sites
        of violation or possible violation.

The proposed project would not affect vehicle mix, nor does it currently experience significant levels of
diesel traffic, and would not increase traffic volumes. Per the criteria provided above, the project is not
projected to be of local air quality concern. This project is determined to be a SEQR Type II Action and is
classified as a NEPA Class II Categorical Exclusion. As such, the project actions do not individually or
cumulatively have a significant effect on PM emissions. It can therefore be concluded that the project will
have no significant adverse impact on ambient PM levels.

4.4.15.7 Greenhouse Gas Analysis -
The issue of global climate change is an important national and global concern that is being addressed in
several ways by the Federal government. The Transportation section is the second largest source of total
greenhouse gases (GHG) in the U.S. and the largest source of CO2 emissions - the predominant GHG. In
2004, the transportation sector was responsible for 31% of all U.S. C02 emissions. The principal
anthropogenic (human-made) source of carbon emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels, which account
for approximately 80% of anthropogenic emissions of carbon worldwide. Almost all (98%) of the
transportation-sector emissions result from the consumption of petroleum products; such as motor
gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and residual fuel.

Recognizing this concern, FHWA is working with other modal administrations through the Department of
Transportation Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting to develop strategies to reduce
transportation's contribution to GHG - particularly CO2 emissions - and to assess the risks to
transportation systems and services from climate changes.

The project is not expected to affect GHG production since no additional traffic volume will result from the
construction of the proposed project.

       Title Of Proposed       Croton-on-Hudson Parking Facility and Bicycle Enhancements
       Project:
       Location of Project:    Village of Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester County, New York
       Brief Description:      The project is proposed to provide safer accommodations that
                               better balances the needs of all users (vehicular, bicyclists and
                               pedestrians) and provides effective vehicular mobility through the
                               corridor during all periods of the day with appropriate traffic
                               control measures. This objective will be accomplished through the
                               construction of new sidewalks, re-delineation of the existing
                               roadway to accommodate bike lanes, and installation of three new
                               traffic signals and geometric improvements to key intersections.

   A. Infrastructure:

of existing infrastructure)

   1. Does this project use, maintain, or improve existing infrastructure?
             Yes                    No             N/A

Explain: (use this space to expand on your answers above ­ the form has no limitations on the
length of your narrative)

The proposed project consists of re-striping the existing travel lanes on Croton Point Avenue and
minor box widening to accommodate 5 ft. bike lanes and 4 to 5 ft. wide sidewalks on essentially
the same horizontal and vertical alignments to minimize right of way impacts. Additional
improvements include widening the US Route 9 southbound off ramp to accommodate an
exclusive right turn lane, realignment of the Route 9 northbound on ramp at Croton Point
Avenue, and widening Veterans Plaza to accommodate reversible lane operations, also on
essentially the same horizontal and vertical alignments.

   B. Sustainability:

NYSDOT defines Sustainability as follows: A sustainable society manages resources in a way
that fulfills the community/social, economic and environmental needs of the present without
compromising the needs and opportunities of future generations. A transportation system that
supports a sustainable society is one that:

   §    Allows individual and societal transportation needs to be met in a manner consistent with
        human and ecosystem health and with equity within and between generations.
   §    Is safe, affordable, and accessible, operates efficiently, offers choice of transport mode,
        and supports a vibrant economy.
   §    Protects and preserves the environment by limiting transportation emissions and wastes,
        minimizes the consumption of resources and enhances the existing environment as
        practicable.

For more information on the Department's Sustainability strategy, refer to Appendix 1 of the
Guidance and the NYSDOT web site. www.dot.ny.gov/programs/greenlites/sustainability

(Addresses SG Law criterion j : to promote sustainability by strengthening existing and creating
new communities which reduce greenhouse gas emissions and do not compromise the needs of
future generations, by among other means encouraging broad based public involvement in
developing and implementing a community plan and ensuring the governance structure is
adequate to sustain and implement.)

   1.      Will this project promote sustainability by strengthening existing communities?
              Yes                    No                      N/A

   2.      Will the project reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
              Yes                    No                   N/A


Explain: (use this space to expand on your answers above)

The project consists of the construction of new continuous sidewalks along both sides of Croton
Point Avenue and the inclusion of bike lanes in both the east- and westbound directions along
Croton Point Avenue which tie into the existing Riverwalk Bike Route and the path that accesses
the Metro North Railroad. Existing Bee-Line Bus stations within the corridor will be retained as
part of the project. Providing and accommodating facilities for these various transportation
modes can reduce automobile dependence and thus potentially reduce transportation based air
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

The project is consistent with the Village of Croton-on-Hudson's Comprehensive Plan and their
Bicycle / Pedestrian Master Plan.

impacts to the aquifer. These measures are intended to minimize contamination from
highway runoff and construction activities. Project activities will comply with the
applicable standards in 6 NYCRR Part 703.

The project will not increase traffic volumes in the immediate and surrounding areas, nor
would it affect vehicle mix, thereby preserving and protecting the air quality. In addition,
providing alternate modes of transportation (transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities) has
the potential to reduce automobile use thereby further protecting, preserving and
enhancing air quality.

The project does not involve work in or adjacent to State- or Federal-designated scenic or
recreational rivers. There are no other recreational or open space areas within the project
limits. The proposed improvements on Croton Point Avenue will enhance mobility and
access to Croton Point Park.

The project does not involve federally owned, jurisdictional or controlled property that is
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and will not require project
activities within previously undisturbed areas that have the potential to contain
archeological resources.

                           DESCRIPTION: Croton-on-Hudson Parking Facility and Bicycle Enhancements
                           MUNICIPALITY/COUNTY: Village of Croton-on-Hudson / Westchester County
                                        PEDESTRIAN GENERATOR CHECKLIST
                                                     DATE: 4/23/13
Note: The term "generator" in this document refers to both pedestrian generators (where pedestrians originate) and destinations (where pedestrians
travel to). A check of yes indicates a potential need to accommodate pedestrians and coordination with the Regional Bicycle and Pedestrian
Coordinator is necessary during project scoping. Answers to the following questions should be checked with the local municipality to ensure accuracy.
1.    Is there an existing or planned sidewalk, trail, or pedestrian crossing facility?                                            YES       NO
      Comments: There are existing sidewalks along both the east and west sides of S. Riverside Ave. and primarily along
      the north side of Croton Point Ave. within the project limits. Sidewalks also exist along the south side of Croton Point
      Ave at various locations. Pedestrian facilities exist at several of the intersections. The proposed project will provide
      continuous sidewalks on both sides of the corridor that meet current ADA standards.
2.    Are there bus stops, transit stations or depots/terminals located in or within 800m of the project area?                     YES       NO
      Comments: The Westchester County Bee-line currently operates three bus stops within the project limits; one on S.
      Riverside Avenue (east side), one on Croton Point Avenue (north side) and one on the US Route 9 northbound off
      ramp. Croton Point Avenue provides access to the Croton Harmon Train Station via Veterans Plaza.
3.    Is there more than occasional pedestrian activity? Evidence of pedestrian activity may include a worn path.                   YES      NO
      Comments: There are existing sidewalks within the project limits and a worn path on the south side of Croton Point
      Avenue where no sidewalk exists. There is evidence of pedestrian activity within the project corridor based upon the
      existing traffic counts.
4.    Are there existing or approved plans for generators of pedestrian activity in or within 800m of the project that             YES       NO
      promote or have the potential to promote pedestrian traffic in the project area, such as schools, parks,
      playgrounds, places of employment, places of worship, post offices, municipal buildings, restaurants, shopping
      centers or other commercial areas, or shared-use paths?
      Comments: There are several generators of pedestrian activity within and around the proposed project area,
      including the Croton Point Park westerly of the project area as well as a few retail establishments that promote
      pedestrian activity.

5.    Are there existing or approved plans for seasonal generators of pedestrian activity in or within 800m of the                  YES      NO
      project that promote or have the potential to promote pedestrian traffic in the project area, such as ski resorts,
      state parks, camps, amusement parks?
      Comments: There are no existing or approved plans for seasonal generators of pedestrian activity.

6.    Is the project located in a residential area within 800m of existing or planned pedestrian generators such as those           YES      NO
      listed in #4?
      Comments:

7.    From record plans, were pedestrian facilities removed during a previous highway reconstruction project?                       YES      NO
      Comments: Pedestrian Facilities have not been removed during previous highway reconstruction projects.

8.    Did a study of secondary impacts indicate that the project promotes or is likely to promote commercial and/or                YES       NO
      residential development within the intended life cycle of the project?
      Comments:

9.    Does the community's comprehensive plan call for development of pedestrian facilities in the area?                           YES       NO
      Comments: The Village of Croton-on-Hudson comprehensive plan and pedestrian and bicycle plans recommend
      sidewalks within the project limits.
10.   Based on the ability of students to walk and bicycle to school, would the project benefit from engineering                   YES       NO
      measures under the Safe-Routes-To-School-Program? Eligible infrastructure-related improvements must be
      within a 3.2km radius of the project.
      Comments:
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
Include comment on exceptional circumstances from EI 04-011 if pedestrian accommodations are warranted but not provided.



Note: This checklist should be revisited due to a project delay or if site conditions or local planning changes during the project
development process.

                                         Traffic Analysis
The following discussion describes the traffic data used for this project and the methods used to analyze
existing and future conditions. The exhibits that are printed in the main body of the design report follow
the design report naming convention. Exhibits unique to this appendix begin with the letter "C".

Croton Point Avenue provides access to the Croton-Harmon train station located at the westerly end of
the project limits, via Veterans Plaza. Vehicular volumes are high and very directional with approximately
75% of the traffic traveling to the train station during the AM peak period and 75% from the train station
during the PM peak period. Croton Point Avenue is free-flowing since there are no traffic signals or stop
control for the vehicles between S. Riverside Avenue and Veterans Plaza. Given the highly directional
vehicular flows and few gaps in Croton Point Avenue free flowing traffic, there are few opportunities for
pedestrians or bicyclists to cross Croton Point Avenue and for side street traffic from Veterans Plaza, the
US Route 9 southbound and the US Route 9 northbound off ramps to access Croton Point Avenue. As a
result of the limited gaps to access Croton Point Avenue, vehicles experience long delays and queues
extending along each of these roadways. The lengthy queues along the US Route 9 southbound off
ramp potentially impact US Route 9 traffic. In addition, the lengthy US Route 9 southbound off ramp
queues exacerbate the situation, as there is a constant stream of traffic wishing to exit US Route 9.

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson provides personnel at Veterans Plaza during 1 hour of both the AM and
PM peak periods and at the US Route 9 southbound ramp for 1-hour during the AM peak period to help
facilitate pedestrian and bicyclist crossings. The use of personnel at these intersections is an interim
measure used during the peak periods implemented by the Village to accommodate pedestrian and
bicycle crossings, while also attempting to facilitate vehicular flow on these side streets to reduce the long
delays, queues (including traffic backups to the US Route 9 mainline) and poor levels of service that
would otherwise exist without active control.


1.0       DESIGN YEAR

The following design years are used in accordance with the NYSDOT Project Development Manual
Appendix 5:

      ·   Existing (2011)
      ·   Estimated time of completion (ETC) (2013)
      ·   ETC + 10 years (2023)
      ·   ETC + 20 years (2033) (traffic volumes for air screening only)


2.0       GROWTH RATES

The growth rate used to calculate No-Build condition background traffic growth for this project was 0.62%
per year as per information from the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC).


3.0       STUDY AREA

The traffic study area includes the project limits described in Section 1.2.1 of the design report which
begins at the intersection of Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza and proceeds easterly for
approximately 1,240 feet to the intersection of Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue. From this
intersection, the project proceeds northerly for approximately 500 feet to the intersection of S. Riverside
Avenue and Benedict Boulevard.




                                                 C-2
April 2013                              Draft Design Report ­ Appendix C                        PIN 8780.41



Croton Point Avenue is a four-lane undivided roadway consisting of two 11.5 - 12 ft. wide eastbound
travel lanes and two 11 - 13 ft. wide westbound travel lanes. S. Riverside Avenue also typically consists
of a four lane undivided section with two 10 ft. wide northbound travel lanes and two 10 ft. wide
southbound travel lanes.

Veterans Plaza consists of a three lane section with one 10 ft. wide northbound travel lane, one 10 ft.
wide southbound travel lane and a 10 ft. wide center lane, used as a reversible travel lane. During the
AM peak hours, it is used as an inbound lane (southbound direction) and during the PM peak hours, it is
used as an outbound lane (northbound direction) to accommodate the high directional traffic volumes.

The US Route 9 southbound and northbound off ramps intersect Croton Point Avenue and each consist
of a single 13 ft. wide travel lane.

The project limits include the following five study intersections:

Unsignalized Intersections:
   · Croton Point Avenue & Veterans Plaza
   · Croton Point Avenue & US Route 9 southbound on/off ramp
   · Croton Point Avenue & US Route 9 northbound on/off ramp

Signalized Intersections:
    · Croton Point Avenue & S. Riverside Avenue
    · S. Riverside Avenue & Benedict Boulevard

Both of these signalized intersections are actuated. The S. Riverside Avenue and Croton Point Avenue
intersection is controlled by a multi-phase, actuated traffic signal. All movements operate by permitted
phasing with the exception of the S. Riverside Avenue southbound right turn movement, which operates
as a permitted phase and also overlaps with the Croton Point Avenue eastbound approach. Pedestrian
pushbuttons and signals are provided to cross the south leg of S. Riverside Avenue and the west leg of
Croton Point Avenue.

At the S. Riverside Avenue and Benedict Boulevard intersection, all movements have permitted
operation. Pedestrian pushbuttons and signals are provided to cross the north leg of S. Riverside Avenue
and the west leg of Benedict Boulevard, although there is no marked crosswalk across this west leg of the
intersection. There is a marked crosswalk to cross the south leg of S. Riverside Avenue but no
pedestrian pushbutton or signal to accommodate the crossing.

For the unsignalized intersections, stop control exists on the minor street approaches. Stop control exists
on the US Route 9 southbound off ramp and the US Route 9 northbound off ramp. At the Croton Point
Avenue with Veterans Plaza intersection, three of the approaches (Veterans Plaza northbound,
southbound access drive and Croton Point Avenue eastbound) are all stop controlled. The Croton Point
Avenue westbound approach is the only uncontrolled approach, making this a non-typical controlled
intersection as most unsignalized intersections are either two-way or all-way stopped controlled
intersections.

The Village of Croton-on-Hudson currently assigns personnel to the Croton Point Avenue and Veterans
Plaza intersection during 1 hour of the AM and PM peak periods and personnel at the Croton Point
Avenue and US Route 9 southbound on / off ramps during 1 hour of the AM peak period to facilitate
pedestrian and bicycle crossings at these locations. In addition, they monitor the traffic along the
southbound off ramp, and help facilitate traffic flow at both intersections to manage queue along the
ramp.

4.0       TRAFFIC DATA

4.1       Traffic Speeds

The existing posted speed limit on Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue within the project limits
is 30 miles per hour. Speed data was not collected to record actual vehicle operating speeds. Vehicles
were observed during traffic data collection and speeds appeared to be low and appropriate for the
context and design of the roadways.

4.2       Travel Time & Delays

Travel time estimates were not computed since this is a pedestrian and bicycle enhancement project and
not a major capacity improvement project.

4.3       Traffic Volume Source

Traffic Volumes were collected for this traffic analysis from the following:

      ·   A study entitled, "Village of Croton-on-Hudson Croton Harmon Parking Facility, Pedestrian and
          Bicycle", performed by the RBA Group, dated July 2008 for the Village of Croton-on-Hudson was
          used as the basis for the turning movements at the five study area intersections. The manual
          turning movement counts for that study were obtained in April 2008 during the weekday AM (6:30
          to 8:45) and PM (5:15 to 7:30) commuter peak periods and were recorded in 15-minute
          increments by vehicle classification.

      ·   CHA collected turning movement counts from 12 am on Tuesday, July 19, 2011 through 12 am
          on July 22, 2011, recorded in 15-minute increments by vehicle classification for the following
          intersections:

          ·   Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 southbound on / off ramps
          ·   Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 northbound on / off ramps

      ·   CHA installed an automatic traffic recording (ATR) device on Veterans Plaza to collect hourly
          traffic volumes, speed data and vehicle classification data for a continuous 72-hour period during
          this same period.

The turning movement and ATR traffic count data obtained by CHA is provided in Attachment C-2 of this
Appendix.

The volumes obtained by CHA were used to verify the accuracy of the traffic data in the RBA study for
use in the intersection capacity analysis, to evaluate growth that has occurred over the 3-year period, and
for use in the Traffic Signal Warrant Study for the following intersections:

          ·   Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza
          ·   Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 southbound on / off ramps
          ·   Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 northbound on / off ramps

The design year traffic volumes include an increase of the existing volumes to account for background
growth.

4.4       Traffic Flow Diagrams

Traffic flow diagrams are presented for the AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes on Figures C.4.4.1
through C.4.4.4 in Attachment C-1 of this Appendix.

(2023)


5.0        TRAFFIC CHANGES DUE TO BUILD ALTERNATIVES

It is not anticipated that the Build Alternative would change the traffic patterns in the area. Therefore, the
Build Alternative traffic volumes are the same as the volumes for the No-Build Alternative.


6.0        TRUCK TRAFFIC

Heavy vehicle (truck) traffic for the study corridor intersections during the peak hours was calculated to be
between 1 and 5% in the AM and PM peak hours based on collected field data.


7.0        ANALYSIS

TrafficWare's Synchro/SimTraffic was used to analyze the intersections within the study corridor. The
delay times and level of service (LOS) were analyzed for each intersection approach and for the overall
intersection to identify the performance characteristics of the existing conditions and for the design
horizons. The delay times, approach LOS, and intersection LOS obtained from the Synchro models are
based on the methodologies and procedures of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), published by
the Transportation Research Board. SimTraffic was used to check queue lengths and the model's
accuracy in depicting future roadway layout and traffic controls.

8.0     CALIBRATION

The existing LOS results from Synchro/SimTraffic appear consistent with the observed queues and
delays during peak traffic periods.


9.0     LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA

LOS is presented as a letter from A to F with A representing free flowing, unimpeded traffic with little or no
delay and F representing highly congested traffic flow with long delays.

Standard design objectives for signalized intersections is to achieve a LOS D or better on each lane
group in urban areas during peak hours (NYSDOT Highway Design Manual, Chapter 5.9.2). For
unsignalized intersections, the LOS is only calculated for minor movements since the through movement
on the major street is not affected by intersection traffic control. However, it is recognized that there are
many competing objectives and considerations, especially in urban areas, that may affect the desirability
and feasibility of achieving this goal for peak hours. In these cases, peak-hour LOS E or F on individual
lane groups may be acceptable. Attachment C-3 of this appendix includes a detailed description of the
LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections from the HCM 2000.


10.0    LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRAVEL SPEEDS, DELAYS AND QUEUES

10.1    Existing and No-Build Level of Service
Summaries of the LOS for the existing and future year No-Build are presented in Exhibits 2.3.1.7-1 and
2.3.1.7-2. LOS worksheets for all of the capacity analyses are provided in Attachment C-4 of this
Appendix.

S. Riverside Avenue with Croton Point Avenue and with Benedict Boulevard were analyzed as signalized
intersections. Croton Point Avenue with Veterans Plaza, with the US Route 9 southbound on/off ramps
and with the US Route 9 northbound on/off ramp were analyzed as unsignalized Intersections, without the
use of manual control.

As shown in these analyses, the two signalized study area intersections currently operate satisfactorily
overall (LOS B or better) during the AM and PM peak hours and are projected to continue operating at the
same LOS at ETC and ETC+10 with all approaches operating at LOS C or better.

The Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza intersection shows an overall LOS E with both the north-
and southbound approaches operating at LOS F during the AM peak period. The overall LOS for the PM
peak period could not be determined. The southbound approach shows a LOS F with an undetermined
amount of delay. This intersection will continue to operate with unsatisfactory LOS and long delays
through the ETC+10 (2023) No-Build conditions.

The Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 southbound ramps show an overall LOS E during the AM peak
period with the southbound approach experiencing a LOS F. The overall and approach LOS is
acceptable during the PM peak period. Without improvements, this intersection will continue to have
unsatisfactory operations during the AM peak period through the ETC+10 (2023) No-Build condition.

The Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 northbound ramps show an overall LOS C with the northbound
approach operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak periods. This intersection will begin to
experience longer delays and unacceptable LOS for the northbound approach through the ETC+10
(2023) No-Build condition. In addition, the overall operations will deteriorate to LOS D and LOS E during
the AM and PM peak periods, respectively through 2023.

During the AM peak period, while the overall LOS for the Croton Point Avenue at the US Route 9
northbound ramps operate at LOS C, the northbound approach experiences long delays resulting in a

10.2       Level of Service for Build Alternatives

The use of personnel during 1 hour of the peak period hours does not accommodate the conditions
during non-peak periods and the shoulder hours of the peak period where vehicular, pedestrian and
bicycle volumes are high. In addition, this manual control requires a significant local cost and allocation
of resources to manage operations at Veterans Plaza and the state highway ramp and poses an inherent
safety risk to the personnel providing manual control.

Given the poor levels of service at unsignalized intersections, the long delay, queues and inherit safety
risk for personnel helping facilitate operations, improvements are necessary to provide acceptable levels
of service at these three intersections:

           ·      Croton Point Avenue at Veterans Plaza
           ·      Croton Point Avenue at Route 9 southbound ramps
           ·      Croton Point Avenue at Route 9 northbound ramps

A traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted to determine if the volumes meet the warranting criteria
for a traffic signal. A traffic signal could be the appropriate traffic control for these intersections, if it meets
one or more of the warrants, as a traffic signal produces gaps in traffic that can be used by minor street
traffic to enter the major street, and offers positive guidance to pedestrians by providing visual and
occasionally audible pedestrian signal indications. The traffic signal essentially offers the same benefits



                                                                C-8

as manual control with the exception that personnel are not at a safety risk, and the benefits can be
experienced throughout the entire day, as opposed to the 2-hours of the day currently provided by the
manual control.

The hourly volumes for each of the above noted intersections were compared against the volume warrant
criteria in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). The analysis performed shows that
the volumes met the warranting criteria of the four-hour and peak hour warrants for the Croton Point
Avenue with the US Route 9 southbound ramps and the northbound ramps, and the peak hour warrant
was met for the Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza intersection. See Section 12.0 for a complete
discussion of the signal warrant analysis.

Therefore, a traffic signal is proposed to be installed at the three above noted intersections, with full
vehicle detection and coordination with the two signalized intersections on S. Riverside Avenue at Croton
Point Avenue and Benedict Boulevard. In addition, the following improvements are proposed:

    ·    Exclusive right turn lane constructed on the US Route 9 southbound off ramp such that this
         approach will consist of an exclusive right turn lane and a shared left / through / right lane.
    ·    Veterans Plaza widened at Croton Point Avenue to accommodate two outbound lanes; an
         exclusive right turn lane and a shared left/ through /right turn lane, and two inbound lanes.

11.0     SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS, ACCIDENT HISTORY AND ANALYSIS

Accident analyses were conducted for the intersections within the project limits using police accident
reports compiled from the Village of Croton-on-Hudson Police Department for the three-year period of
June 2008 to June 2011. These accident records documented 55 accidents occurring on study area
roadways during this time period. Approximately 11% of the accidents were personal injury accidents,
and the remaining 89% were property damage only accidents. There were no fatalities. Summaries of
the accident severity for the project intersections are provided in Exhibit 2.3.1.8-1.

The predominant crash type within the project limits are rear end (17) accidents which account for
approximately 31% of the total crashes. Overtaking (9) and left turn (7) accidents were also predominate
types of accidents. These two crash types account for 29% of the total crashes.

There were six reported crashes involving pedestrians or bicyclists, of which 2 of these types of accidents
occurred at each of the following intersections: [1] Croton Point Avenue & Veterans Plaza [2] Croton
Point Avenue & US Route 9 southbound on/off ramps and [3] Croton Point Avenue & S. Riverside
Avenue. Exhibit 2.3.1.8-2 summarizes the accident types for the intersections within the project limits.

               Only the intersections on State routes are applicable to be compared to the Statewide Average Accident
               Rates published by NYSDOT. This would include the intersections of Croton Point Avenue with the US
               Route 9 southbound ramps and the US Route 9 northbound ramps; each of which exceed the statewide
               average rate.

               A review of the accident types at Croton Point Avenue and the US Route 9 southbound ramps shows that
               there is a pattern of rear end accidents on the US Route 9 southbound off ramp. This pattern may be
               attributed to the queues on the ramp and the congestion at the intersection as a result of the high
               directional flow of traffic to the Croton Harmon Station during the AM peak period.                   The 2
               pedestrian/bicyclist accidents could be attributed to the fact that at two-way stop controlled intersections,
               right-turning motorists often look only to the left in order to check for vehicular conflicts, endangering or




                                                                        C-11

inconveniencing pedestrians crossing from the right or on the right. This situation is exacerbated by the
fact that many of these drivers do not come to a complete stop if they do not perceive any conflicts.

A review of the accident types at Croton Point Avenue and the US Route 9 northbound ramps shows that
there were a few angle, turn and overtaking accidents. There was not a pattern to these accidents.
However, contributing factors included driver inattention/distraction, failure to yield right of way and
turning improperly.

Although not compared to the statewide average rate, since it is not on the State highway system, the
accident data showed that 35% of the total accidents (19) in the project area occurred at the
Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue intersection for the three year period. Predominate
accident types were rear-end (5) and left-turn (5) accidents. Wet pavement / snow contributed to four of
the nineteen accidents. Of the remaining nineteen accidents, five had contributing factors of failing to
yield right of way, traffic control disregarded and turning improperly and six had contributing factors of
driver inattention and following too closely.

The preferred Build Alternative includes the addition of three traffic signals on Croton Point Avenue at
Veterans Plaza, the US Route 9 southbound on /off ramps, and the US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps.
In addition, the preferred Build Alternative includes construction of a southbound right turn lane on the US
Route 9 southbound off ramp and realigning the US Route 9 northbound on ramp that will be controlled
by the signal.

Signal control provides vehicles exiting the minor street approaches (Veterans Plaza, the southbound off
ramp and the northbound off ramp) with an exclusive phase to enter Croton Point Avenue and provides
phasing for pedestrians and bicyclists to cross each of the roadways. Signalization also eliminates the
need for manual control and the inherit safety risk associated with this control.

Constructing an exclusive southbound right turn lane provides both operational and safety benefits by
providing an additional lane for right turning vehicles to move through the intersection during the minor
street phase, which can reduce the queue of traffic along the ramp and reduce the potential for rear-end
crashes. In addition, advance detection is proposed for the off ramps so that queues do not extend to the
US Route 9 mainline.

In addition, realigning the US Route 9 northbound on ramp at Croton Point Avenue will improve the
overall navigation of the road, which can reduce the potential for accidents from the east to northbound
channelized right turn and the west to northbound left turn movements. Narrowing of the Croton Point
Avenue and US Route 9 northbound on ramp intersection such that the eastbound free-flowing
channelized right-turn on Croton Point Avenue would be eliminated and right-turns would be made from
the signalized intersection proper would improve the pedestrian crossing.

The proposed improvements can reduce the likelihood of some vehicle conflicts that involved failure ot
yield right of way and turning improperly.

Collision diagrams are provided for these locations in Attachment C-5 to this Appendix.

12.0    SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS

A signal warrant analysis was conducted for the existing conditions at the following three intersections:

    ·   Croton Point Avenue & Veterans Plaza
    ·   Croton Point Avenue & US Route 9 southbound on/off ramps
    ·   Croton Point Avenue & US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps

The signal warrant analysis is based on methodologies described within Chapter 4C of Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices, (MUTCD) 2009. There are nine warrants that can be evaluated to
determine if traffic signal control would be warranted. The nine warrants are:

Warrant 1: Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 2: Four-Hour Vehicular Volume
Warrant 3: Peak Hour
Warrant 4: Pedestrian Volume
Warrant 5: School Crossing
Warrant 6: Coordinated Signal System
Warrant 7: Crash Experience
Warrant 8: Roadway Network
Warrant 9: Intersection Near a Grade Crossing

The warrants that are applicable to this project are Warrants 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7. Although Warrants 5, 6, 8,
and 9 are discussed below, they are not applicable to this project.

Warrant 1: This warrant is intended at locations where a large volume of intersecting traffic is the
principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal.

Warrant 2: This warrant is intended at locations where a large volume of intersecting traffic is the
principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal.

Warrant 3: This warrant is intended at locations where for one hour of an average day, the minor street
traffic suffers undue delay when entering or crossing the major street. This warrant is applied only in
unusual cases such as office complexes, manufacturing plants, industrial complexes, or high occupancy
vehicle facilities that attract or discharge large number of vehicles over a short time.

The Croton-Harmon train station is a facility that attracts and discharges a large number of vehicles over
a short time. Therefore, this warrant is applicable to this project.

Warrant 4: This warrant is intended for locations where the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy
that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street.

Warrant 5: This warrant is intended for locations that are established crossings for school age children.
This warrant is not applicable.

Warrant 6: This warrant is intended to maintain progression of traffic movement along a signalized
corridor. The intersection is not currently located within a coordinated signal system. Therefore, this
warrant does not apply.

Warrant 7: This warrant is intended where the severity and frequency of certain type accidents that could
be remedied by a signal are the principal reason for installing a traffic control signal.

Warrant 8: This warrant applies to intersections that are the junctions of two roadways that are part of the
principle roadway network for through traffic movements.

Warrant 9: This warrant is intended for locations where none of the conditions described in the other eight
traffic signal warrants are met, but the proximity to the intersection of a grade crossing on an intersection
approach controlled by a STOP or YIELD sign is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control
signal. This warrant is not applicable for the study intersection.

The existing vehicular and pedestrian volumes and accident history were compared to only these 5
(Warrants 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7) applicable warrants.

The existing hourly variation of directional weekday traffic volumes on Croton Point Avenue is illustrated
in Figure 1 below.

                                              Time of Day


As Figure 1 illustrates, volumes are very high on Croton Point Avenue and very directional with sharp
peaks in the westbound direction during the AM peak period and in the eastbound direction during the PM
peak period.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the hourly variations of the traffic at the three intersections included in this study.
Figure 2 shows that the hourly volumes on the US Route 9 northbound off ramp are fairly consistent
throughout the day, whereas the US Route 9 southbound off ramp has a sharp peak during the AM peak
period (Figure 3) and Veterans Plaza has a sharp peak during the PM peak period (Figure 4).

                The following is a summary of the Traffic Signal Warrant Analyses. See Attachment C-6.

                A. Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza

                Since Veterans Plaza operates with a reversible lane, two separate signal warrant analyses were
                performed. The signal warrant analysis was conducted for the AM peak and non-peak periods (hours
                from 6 am to 4 pm) assuming a single lane northbound approach (minor-street) and two lanes for the
                Croton Point Avenue eastbound and westbound approaches (major-street). The signal warrant
                analysis was conducted for the PM peak period (4 pm to 7 pm) assuming two lanes for the
                northbound approach (minor-street) and two lanes for the Croton Point Avenue eastbound and
                westbound approaches (major street).

                The traffic volumes on Croton Point Avenue and Veterans Plaza meet the minimum volume criteria
                for Warrant 3 (Peak Hour). The Peak Hour warrant is suitable for this location as the Croton-Harmon
                train station is a facility that attracts and discharges a large number of vehicles over a short time.

                Given the poor unacceptable LOS as an unsignalized intersection, the use of manual control during 1
                hour of the AM and PM peak hour to help facilitate pedestrian and bicycle crossings, and that the
                volumes meet the warranting criteria for a traffic signal, a traffic signal is recommended at this
                intersection.

                B. Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 southbound on/off ramps

                The traffic volumes on Croton Point Avenue and the US Route 9 southbound off ramp meet the
                minimum volume criteria for Warrant 2 (Four-Hour Vehicular Volume) and Warrant 3 (Peak Hour).

                Given the unacceptable LOS as an unsignalized intersection, the use of manual control during 1 hour
                of the AM peak period to help facilitate pedestrian and bicycle crossings, and that the volumes meet
                the warranting criteria for a traffic signal, a traffic signal is recommended at this intersection.

    C. Croton Point Avenue and US Route 9 northbound on/off ramps

    The traffic volumes on Croton Point Avenue and the US Route 9 northbound off ramp meet the
    minimum volume criteria for Warrant 2 (Four-Hour Vehicular Volume) and Warrant 3 (Peak Hour).

    Given the unacceptable LOS as an unsignalized intersection and that the volumes meet the
    warranting criteria for a traffic signal, a traffic signal is recommended at this intersection.

Signalized Intersections

                                          TABLE A
                               HCS SIGNALIZED LOS STANDARDS
                       LOS                Control Delay per Vehicle (s/veh)
                        A                             10 or less
                        B                              10 ­ 20
                        C                              20 - 35
                        D                              35 ­ 55
                        E                              55 - 80
                        F                          greater than 80
        * s/veh = seconds per vehicle

LOS A describes operations with low control delay, up to 10 s/veh. This LOS occurs when progression
is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all.
Short cycle lengths may tend to contribute to low delay values.

LOS B describes operations with control delay greater than 10 and up to 20 s/veh. This level generally
occurs with good progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing
higher levels of delay.

LOS C describes operations with control delay greater than 20 and up to 35 s/veh. These higher delays
may result from only fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle failures may begin
to appear at this level. Cycle failure occurs when a green phase does not serve queued vehicles, and
overflows occur. The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, though many still pass
through the intersection without stopping.

LOS D describes operations with control delay greater than 35 and up to 55 s/veh. At LOS D, the
influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of
unfavorable progression, long cycle lengths, or high volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratios. Many vehicles stop,
and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.

LOS E describes operations with control delay greater than 55 and up to 80 s/veh. These high delay
values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle
failures are frequent.

LOS F describes operations with delay in excess of 80.0 s/veh. This level, considered unacceptable to
most drivers, often occurs with over-saturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of lane
groups. It may also occur at high v/c ratios with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long
cycle lengths may also contribute significantly to high delay levels. Often, vehicles do not pass through
the intersection in one signal cycle.
Unsignalized Intersection Delay

The level of service criteria for an unsignalized intersection differs from that of a signalized intersection
because of the expectation that signalized intersections encounter more traffic and therefore greater
delays. The thresholds for the levels of service of unsignalized intersections are as follows:

                                        TABLE B
                             HCS UNSIGNALIZED LOS STANDARDS
                       LOS               Control Delay per Vehicle (s/veh)
                        A                            10 or less
                        B                             10 ­ 15
                        C                             15 - 25
                        D                             25 ­ 35
                        E                             35 - 50
                        F                         greater than 50
        * s/veh = seconds per vehicle


Levels-of-service A, B, and C are considered acceptable, LOS D is generally considered marginally
acceptable during peak periods and LOS E and F are considered unacceptable.

   The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is so
   heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street


   *The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant shall not be applied at locations where the distance to the
   nearest traffic control signal or STOP sign controlling the street that pedestrians desire to cross is less
   than 300 feet, unless the proposed traffic control signal will not restrict the progressive movement of traffic.



   CONDITION A

    If any four points lie above the appropriate line, then the warrant is satisfied.

   The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is so
   heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street


   *The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant shall not be applied at locations where the distance to the
   nearest traffic control signal or STOP sign controlling the street that pedestrians desire to cross is less
   than 300 feet, unless the proposed traffic control signal will not restrict the progressive movement of traffic.



   CONDITION A

    If any four points lie above the appropriate line, then the warrant is satisfied.

   The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is so
   heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street


   *The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant shall not be applied at locations where the distance to the
   nearest traffic control signal or STOP sign controlling the street that pedestrians desire to cross is less
   than 300 feet, unless the proposed traffic control signal will not restrict the progressive movement of traffic.



   CONDITION A

    If any four points lie above the appropriate line, then the warrant is satisfied.

   Speed on mainline is 35 mph or less & community larger than 10,000 - Use criteria for 100% Volume level

   The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is so
   heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street


   *The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant shall not be applied at locations where the distance to the
   nearest traffic control signal or STOP sign controlling the street that pedestrians desire to cross is less
   than 300 feet, unless the proposed traffic control signal will not restrict the progressive movement of traffic.



   CONDITION A

    If any four points lie above the appropriate line, then the warrant is satisfied.

   3. PRESENTATION:
      Mayor Wiegman advised that a presentation will be made this evening
      regarding the "Croton Point Avenue Traffic, Pedestrian and Bicycle
      Enhancement Project". Mayor Wiegman said that when Route 9 was built
      decades ago the State did not consult with the Village and we have been
      living with an ill-placed, high volume highway for many years. Mayor
      Wiegman said that the main goal of this project is to help make those
      intersections safer for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. Mayor Wiegman
      stated that this project has been under development over the last several
      years and the Village has obtained significant Federal Funding for this
      project.

      Village Manager Zambrano explained to the audience that after the
      presentation there will be a twenty minute question and answer period. Mr.
      Zambrano said that the Engineering firm of CHA will be available after the
question and answer period to continue the discussion with those who have
any additional questions. Mr. Zambrano said that written comments can be
sent to the Village and will be accepted until October 5st and will become part
of the record as required by the Grant. Mr. Zambrano introduced Joe Cimino,
Chris Lilholt, Jessica Sweeney and Scott Lewendon from the engineering firm
of CHA. Trustee Schmidt commented that unfortunately because of this
evening's weather a lot of people could not make it here tonight and it is
unfortunate that we are continuing with the presentation this evening.
Mayor Wiegman said that the meeting is available through web-streaming
and television. Trustee Schmidt said that personal contact and people
coming to the meeting are far more important.

Representatives from CHA presented the proposal as follows: the proposal
includes construction of traffic, pedestrian and bicycle enhancements along
Croton Point Avenue, at Veteran's Plaza, the Croton-Harmon Train Station to
S. Riverside Avenue and North on South Riverside Avenue to the intersection
with Benedict Blvd. The proposed work includes construction of a five foot
bike lane and five foot concrete sidewalks on both sides of Croton Point
Avenue; three new traffic signals to be installed along Croton Point Avenue at
Veteran's Plaza, Route 9 southbound on/off ramps and Route 9 northbound
on/off ramps; widening of a short section of Veterans Plaza at Croton Point
Avenue to four lanes; construction of a right turn lane on the Route 9
southbound off ramp; narrowing of the Route 9 northbound on-ramp
intersection with Croton Point Avenue, along with drainage improvements
and an overlay of Croton Point Avenue and S. Riverside Avenue.

John Perillo, owner of property at 43 Croton Point Avenue, asked what means
were used to measure vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Ms. Lilholt
stated they CHA collected some of their own data, they also used a study
prepared by RBA and traffic volume provided by DOT; CHA recorded three
days of traffic at the south and north on and off ramps; performed a cyclist
survey at the Croton Harmon Train Station and through observation collected
data with respect to pedestrian traffic. John Perillo said that he is concerned
about the curb cuts and the expense of the project; will he be assessed for
sidewalk improvements. Mr. Perillo said that he was able to video tape traffic
patterns and that his count of the number of cyclists over a ninety-day period
amounted to less than thirty. Mr. Perillo said that his main concern is that
the Village will be taking away critical parking and this will impede several
businesses. Mr. Perillo said that he is not clear of how many cyclists and
pedestrians use Croton Point Avenue and the necessity for sidewalks on the
north side. Mr. Perillo said that he is also concerned if the transfer station
comes back this could have an impact on the amount of traffic. Mr. Cimino
stated that sidewalk and curb improvement costs are part of the construction
project.

Mark Aarons, 18 Georgia Lane, Croton-on-Hudson, asked how many bicycle
accidents have taken place on Croton Point Avenue and is concerned that
there might be more accidents when the traffic backs up due to the new
traffic lights. Mr. Aarons does not understand why we are spending
thousands of dollars on traffic lights and feels that just by removing the right
turn arrow would help people in those intersections. Ms. Lilholt stated that
over a three year period there were six bicycle and pedestrian accidents; two
at Veteran's Plaza; two at the southbound ramps and two on South Riverside
Avenue.

Steve DeName, 1 Croton Point Avenue, is concerned that with the new traffic
lights he will not be able to get out of his driveway. Mr. DeName said that the
business owners were never consulted; some of us will lose parking and he is
concerned for his tenants. Ms. Lilholt said that it will be an actuated traffic
light that will permit people to exit out of the driveway.

Mark Franzoso, 33 Croton Point Avenue, said that he felt this project will
have an impact on his business and asked how was this design formulated;
how many meetings were held on this topic; was there an initial survey of
the businesses for their input; will DOT fund these traffic lights if parking
remains; will easements be needed; how will cyclists and pedestrians
maneuver around the bus stop if they remain; and how will street deliveries
to businesses be made. Ms. Lilholt advised that these plans are consistent
with the Village's Comprehensive Plan and Bicycling Plan; meetings and
discussions with the Board, community and DOT are detailed in the time-line
that is available to the public. Ms. Lilholt stated that DOT will not approve
funds for traffic lights when parking is in travel lanes. Ms. Lilholt advised
that temporary easements would be necessary during the construction
project and property owners would be compensated. Ms. Lilholt addressed
Mr. Franzoso's question regarding the bus stop and stated that they are
working on this with Westchester County with the possibility that the bus
stop being moved. Mr. Franzoso said that a much safer alternative would be
one bicycle path and sidewalk on the south side with a concrete barrier
protecting both pedestrians and cyclists forcing them to stop at either a stop
sign or a traffic light. Mr. Franzoso said that there are also eight curb cuts in
this plan and cyclists and pedestrians will be expected to traverse these curb
cuts and this is not safe. Scott Lewendon from CHA stated that studies have
shown that a two-way bike path on one side of the road increases the risk for
bicyclist because the bicyclist is put into a position on the roadway when
crossing an intersection motorists do not anticipate the cyclist and the risks
increase dramatically.

Andrew Fischer, P.O. Box 241, Mohegan Lake, stated that this project affects
more than just Croton residents; he has never seen a scenario where you
would need this amount of bicycle lanes and cannot see why they just cannot
share the space. Mr. Fischer said that the southbound exit ramp from Route
9 does not need to be widened just needs striping and better signage;
overhead signals for the three lanes are also not needed; the only lane
changing is the middle lane and the other two will stay in the dedicated
direction. Mr. Fischer added that he did not see any improvement for street
lighting in this project and that should be added as well.
Ms. Roseanne Schuyler, 41 Olcott Avenue, asked what pedestrian facilities
are being planned on Benedict Blvd. and asked where the extra four feet on
Croton Point Avenue is coming from. Ms. Lilholt said that Benedict Blvd. will
have upgrades to the ramps at the four corners, pedestrian signals and
additional crosswalks. Ms. Schuyler went over the calculations of the space
across Croton Avenue and wanted to know where those extra four feet are
coming from. Ms. Schuyler said that this is a very costly project and the
costs concern her. Mr. Cimino said that the extra width for the sidewalk and
bike lanes comes from a reduction of each of the four lanes by one foot and a
reduction of the maintenance strip by about a foot and a half. Ms. Schuyler
asked how this project will be financed. Village Manager Zambrano
responded by saying that the Village is receiving a grant for 1.2 million
dollars and the balance of the project will be funded through borrowing.
Ms. Schuyler said that it is her understanding that various options were
presented to the DOT to maintain parking on the north side and is it CHA's
belief that it would not be approved. Ms. Lilholt said that they asked DOT if
they would approve parking in a travel lane and they said they would not
approve the project with parking in a travel lane. Trustee Schmidt said that
we are hearing about the current situation where cars are parked on the
northbound side and when DOT looked at this project with the bike lanes, the
parking would be in the travel lane. Trustee Schmidt said that if we reduced
the size of these lanes by four feet you could end up with parking on that
side of the street and then vehicles would not be in the travel lane any
longer. Trustee Schmidt said that CHA should be clearer when talking about
the travel lane; are we talking about the existing situation or the situation
that is being proposed to the DOT and these are two different issues.
Trustee Schmidt said that people are parking there now and it works.
Village Manager Zambrano said that currently the Village Ordinance calls for
no parking on Croton Point Avenue. Ms. Schuyler asked if the Board looked
at other alternatives that would not cost as much.

Mr. Bob Wintermeier, 43 Radnor Avenue, Croton-on-Hudson, asked how
much has been invested so far in this project and if the project does not go
through could the Village be reimbursed through the Grant for that money
that was spent so far. Mr. Cimino said that the Village has spent
approximately $150,000. Mr. Cimino said that there would have to be a
justifiable reason not to go forward with the project; typically public
opposition to a project would not be a reason for the DOT and Federal
Government to reimburse the Village for these expenses.

Maria Cudequest, 84 Grand Street, Croton-on-Hudson said that if the transfer
station were to be in operation again the Village would need to factor in this
additional traffic.

Phyllis Morrow, 61 Nordica Avenue, Croton-on-Hudson, said that what she
sees is a doubling of the debt for twenty bicycles; our drinking water is more
important and the Village should be completing the Harmon Water Project.
  Trustee Schmidt said that a study was mentioned this evening stating that
  "bike lanes going in both directions are very dangerous". Trustee Schmidt
  said that this new proposal has cyclists going from bike lanes to no bikes to
  bikes lanes and in his opinion this is an even more dangerous situation.
  Trustee Schmidt said that when he asked Mr. Lewendon about this he said
  "hopefully the cyclists will know what to do". Trustee Schmidt said we are
  just creating a greater hazard and a more dangerous situation than what we
  currently have. Trustee Schmidt said that if we just put in traffic lights it will
  make pedestrians and cyclists safer because there will be crosswalks and
  everyone will be moving in a pattern and a flow.

  Robert Olsson, 5 Hamilton Avenue and member of the Croton-on-Hudson
  Bicycle Pedestrian Committee, said that he rides his bike to the train station
  every day; when he gets to the traffic light he rides on the sidewalk because
  cars in this area during the morning and evening hours are rabid and
  steadfast to get to the train station and to get home. Mr. Olsson said that he
  has had dozens of near misses. Mr. Olsson said that the issue of this project
  is about trying to share this roadway with very diverse traffic uses and we
  need to have some kind of traffic calming effort during certain times of the
  day.

5. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION-AGENDA ITEMS

   Phyllis Morrow, 61 Nordica Avenue, Croton-on-Hudson said that she is still
   struggling on how we are going to come up with the money for the
   Community Garden Fence and why can't we come up with an I.D. Checker
   for Mayo's Landing.

   Normal Sheer, 1 Croton Lake Road, Croton-on-Hudson and representative of
   the Croton Community Nursery School, encouraged the Board to accept the
   conveyance of the open space conservation parcel, the trail and the storm
   water easement on the agenda this evening.

   Roseanne Schuyler, 41 Olcott Avenue, Croton-on-Hudson asked if there are
   any changes in the status of Metro Enviro. Village Attorney James Staudt
   said that he has not heard anything at this time; it would be extraordinary if
   the court did not notify us before making any decisions.


6. RESOLUTIONS:

a. On motion of TRUSTEE GALLELLI seconded by TRUSTEE RASKOB, the
following resolution was adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson, New York with a vote of 5-0.

WHEREAS, the Planning Board has given final approval to the Croton Community
Nursery School for subdivision of an 11-acre property into three building lots;
and

WHEREAS, the subdivision approval consists of three building lots, six small
parcels for conveyance to neighbors, and a 5-acre open space conservation
parcel to be dedicated to the Village, subject to the approval of the New York
State Attorney General's Office and the Westchester County Supreme Court; and
WHEREAS, the subdivision approval also consists of the dedication of a trail
easement over subdivision Lot 1 for access to Lower North Highland Place, and a
storm water easement to allow the Village to enter a residential lot for
maintenance of storm water facilities if a homeowner fails to do so,

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED: that the Village Board of Trustees accepts
the conveyance of the Open Space Conservation parcel, the trail easement, and
the storm water easement, subject to approval of the Attorney General's Office,
the Westchester County Supreme Court, and the Village Attorney as provided in
the proposed Easement Agreement.

DISCUSSION:

Trustee Raskob and Trustee Gallelli said that they remember discussing this
when their children were attending the school and they are very pleased that
this is going through. Trustee Schmidt asked that the resolution indicate that
the costs will be billed to the property owner if the homeowner fails to do the
maintenance of the storm water facilities as indicted in the last whereas.Village
Attorney James Staudt suggested adding the wording "as provided in the
proposed Easement Agreement". Trustee Murtaugh said that this is a win-win
situation for the nursery school and the Village. Trustee Murtaugh said that he
was elected three years ago on the issue of re-zoning in the Harmon area which
could had potentially delivered new school children to the school district. Mr.
Murtaugh pointed out that this approval adds three large single family homes
which could also deliver new students to the school district and it is both ironic
and interesting to point out that there was not a single bit of opposition about
the student population as a result of this. Trustee Schmidt said that this is
fundamentally different; the Harmon development would have allowed eleven
homes and increased the density of that area; this only adds three
properties.Trustee Raskob said that this piece of property sort of adjoins his
property; the part that is being deeded over is lovely and mostly unbuildable
and the parts that are buildable will front on an avenue and will not impact the
existing homeowners.Trustee Gallelli said that this is something that we will
probably need to revisit; when we first discussed accepting this easement the
Board talked about having Westchester Land Trust take over the subdivision of
this property so that it does not become something we actively have to
supervise. Mayor Wiegman said that when all the closing documents are
circulated we will meet with the Westchester Land Trust.

b. On motion of TRUSTEE MURTAUGH, seconded by TRUSTEE GALLELLI, the
following resolution was adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson, New York with a vote of 5-0

WHEREAS, the Village has a contract with Acocella Contracting for the High
Street Infrastructure Improvement Project, and

WHEREAS, part of this project includes tying in the new water main to the
existing water main on North Riverside Avenue, which is a state road, and
WHEREAS, the contractor and Village are co-applicants on the permit application
to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYS DOT); and

WHEREAS, the NYS DOT is requiring a $50,000 bond before it will issue a work
permit; and

WHEREAS, the contractor has requested that the Village provide the required
bond; and,

WHEREAS, it is absolutely essential that this work gets completed; and

WHEREAS, if in the case that the NYS DOT withholds all or part of the bond, the
Village will reduce this amount from the contracted amount owed to Acocella
Contracting,

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED: that the Village Treasurer is authorized to
issue a check in the amount of $50,000 payable to the NYS DOT as a cash bond.

DISCUSION:

Trustee Murtaugh said that it was his understanding from earlier discussions
that this is just an insurance policy, we owe Acocella a lot more than $50,000
and we are merely facilitating this on their behalf. Village Manager Abe
Zambrano explained that we are co-applicants with the State and both the
Village and the contractor bear the burden of securing these bonds. Mr.
Zambrano said that because of the DOT's delay in issuing the permits the
contractor is unable at this particular time to secure the necessary money for
these bonds. Mr. Zambrano said that by the Village providing for the Bond we
are not only saving money but making sure that the project goes on schedule
and the money will be returned to the Village from the Contractor. Trustee
Gallelli said that if the State determines that the work was not done properly we
will hold some of that money back and will be subtracted from Acocella's
contract. Trustee Raskob said that he remains somewhat troubled that they are
not bondable. Manager Zambrano said that they are bondable, this was not
originally in the scope of the project; they would have to pay for the bond which
is expensive and at this point in time they did not have the funds to do so. Mr.
Zambrano said that instead of rebidding the project we determined that it would
be in the best interest to secure the bond and be reimbursed by the contractor.

c. On motion of TRUSTEE MURTAUGH, seconded by TRUSTEE GALLELLI, the
following resolution was adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson, New York with a vote of 5-0

WHEREAS, Zott Construction is a firm which provides various emergency and
restoration services to municipalities; and

WHEREAS, the Village Manager and staff have met with representatives of Zott
Construction to discuss these services; and
WHEREAS, Zott Construction has provided an agreement under which Zott will
provide certain emergency and restoration services to the Village in the event
that they are needed; and

WHEREAS, there is no cost to the Village until such services are required; and

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED: that the Village Manager is authorized to
execute an agreement with Zott Construction whereby Zott Construction will
provide various emergency and restoration services to the Village if and when
such services are required.

DISCUSSION:

Trustee Murtaugh asked Manager Zambrano to give the Board a scenario of
when we would need to use them. Village Manager Abe Zambrano said that
after hurricane Irene there were many instances where the Village could have
used additional equipment to assist in the clean-up. Mr. Zambrano said that this
company will also assist the Village with insurance claims and FEMA
reimbursements. Trustee Schmidt asked if this restricts us from using other
companies. Manager Zambrano responded by saying no, the Village can still use
other companies. Mayor Wiegman said that this firm specializes in municipal
work and the benefit is that they will become familiar with the Village and our
needs.

d. On motion of TRUSTEE GALLELLI seconded by TRUSTEE RASKOB, the
following resolution was adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson, New York with a vote of 5-0

WHEREAS, the Treasurer has analyzed the 2011/12 year to date budget and
recommends the following budget transfers as detailed below,

NOW THEREFORE be it resolved that the Village Treasurer is authorized to make
the following amendments to the 2011/12 budget to reflect these changes:

WATER FUND
       INCREASE

           Dept         Item      Amount

           F8340        1000        63,198

           F9060        8010        16,832

      Total Increases            $ 80,030

        DECREASE

           F1650        4400        74,335
              F8320          4000       2,095

              F8320          4300       1,350

              F8340          4000       2,250

           Total Decreases          $ 80,030

   DISCUSSION:

The Board asked Village Treasurer Bullock to explain this Resolution.
Village Treasurer Bullock explained that for purposes of balancing our Budget
transfers were made between the Water Department and the Department of Public
Works. Ms. Bullock said that DPW staff was assisting the Water Department and
paid from the Water Fund and these funds needed to be moved from the DPW Fund
to balance that Water Fund Account. Village Manager Abe Zambrano explained that
New York State Finance Law allows you to reallocate money so that you have a
balanced budget.

   e. On motion of TRUSTEE RASKOB seconded by TRUSTEE GALLELLI, the
   following resolution was adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of
   Croton-on-Hudson, New York.

   WHEREAS, the Treasurer has analyzed the 2011/12 year to date budget and
   requests a budget transfer of $14,000 from the general fund to cover payroll of
   department of public work employees who worked on and were charged against
   the water department general ledger account F8340.1000; and

   WHEREAS, the salaries of the Department of Public Work employees are
   budgeted within the General Fund which created a short fall within the Water
   Fund,

   NOW THEREFORE be it resolved that the Village Treasurer is authorized to make
   a transfer of $14,000 from the general fund to the water fund account
   F8340.1000 within the 2011/12 budget.

f. On motion of TRUSTEE RASKOB, seconded by TRUSTEE GALLELLI, the following
resolution was adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Croton-on-
Hudson, New York:

WHEREAS, the Village Treasurer wishes to open both sides of the General Fund
budget to record the receipt of insurance recoveries from the damage to the street
sweeper and subsequent disbursement of these funds towards the purchase of a
new street sweeper.

GENERAL REVENUE          Increase A1000.2680       Insurance Recoveries
     $75,000
GENERAL EXPENSES         Increase A9901.9030        Transfer to Capital
     $75,000

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Village Treasurer is authorized to
amend the 2012-2013 General Fund budget to reflect these changes.


   7. CITIZEN PARTICPATION-NON AGENDA ITEMS

      Andrew Fischer, P.O. Box 241, Mohegan Lake, stated that his daughter
      received a ticket while parking her car in the Post Office/CVS shopping
      center. Mr. Fischer felt that since this is private property the police should
      not have the jurisdiction to go on that property and issue tickets. Mr. Fischer
      additionally complained about the hours of operation of the Court Office.

      Mark Franzoso, 43 Croton Point Avenue, continued to add some comments
      with respect to the presentation this evening. Mr. Franzoso said that two
      bike lanes are not necessary since the bike lanes start and end without a
      continuous connection to other parts of the Village. Mr. Franzoso suggested
      that there only be one bike/pedestrian lane on the south side with a concrete
      barrier for safety leading directly to the train station.

      Bob Wintermeier, 43 Radnor Avenue, Croton on Hudson said he is concerned
      about the overall cost to the Village and the impact on the businesses along
      Croton Point Avenue. Mr. Wintermeier asked someone to clarify a program
      called "Agenda 21"; he noticed that Croton is on this list and asked if we are
      paying any money to this group.

      John Perillo, 43 Croton Point Avenue, asked if delivery trucks will receive
      parking tickets when making deliveries to Croton Point Avenue businesses.
      Village Manager Abe Zambrano said that the Village understands that the
      properties of some of the businesses along Croton Point Avenue are not large
      enough and that delivery trucks will need to park on Croton Point Avenue
      while making deliveries. Mr. Zambrano said that delivery trucks will not be
      ticketed.

      Phyllis Morrow, 61 Nordica Avenue, Croton-on-Hudson, said that the meeting
      should have been postponed because of the weather. Ms. Morrow asked that
      the Board pay attention to what the community wants and to put the various
      scenarios and costs on the Village web-site.

      Andrew Fischer, P.O. Box 241, Mohegan Lake, said that he submitted a
      Freedom of Information Request for the copy of the agreement with Croton
      View Associates that would allow the Village to ticket cars on their property.

9. REPORTS

    Village Manager Zambrano responded to a question this evening regarding
whether or not the Village has the right to enforce parking on private property.
Mr. Zambrano stated that the Village has an agreement with the property owner
for over ten years and does have the right to issue tickets. Village Manager
Zambrano responded to a question this evening regarding repair of the fence on
Riverside Avenue. Mr. Zambrano advised that this is DOT property and the
Village cannot go on their property. Mr. Zambrano said that he contacted the
Department of Transportation and they have advised that they do not have it on
their schedule for repair at this time. Village Manager Zambrano advised that
the Croton River Task Force will meet on September 27th at 6:30pm at Village
Hall. Village Manager Zambrano advised that the Recreation Department
brochure has been mailed and is now available on line.

    Trustee Schmidt encouraged everyone to attend the Croton Rotary Club's Car
Show on September 30th at the Croton Harmon Train Station. Trustee Schmidt
said that there will be lots of activities for adults and children. Trustee Schmidt
advised that the Village and Croton Business Council are sponsoring a Block
Party on September 27th in the Upper Village. Trustee Schmidt encouraged
everyone to attend. Trustee Schmidt advised that the Croton Conservation
Advisory Council is holding a presentation this evening on the "Birds and Bees"
that includes a demonstration and talk by local Bee Keepers. Trustee Schmidt
said that the CAC is doing a great job coming up with interesting topics.
Trustee Schmidt said that we had a very interesting and lively conversation
about the proposed improvements on Croton Point Avenue. Trustee Schmidt
said that you heard my comments about my concerns with certain aspects of
this proposal. Trustee Schmidt said that the verbal agreement about not
ticketing cars and trucks making deliveries represents an example of how this
system is not going to work because all it is going to take is someone to be
struck by a vehicle as they are travelling in the bike lane and we will have to
then go to enforcement. Trustee Schmidt said that this is an unworkable
situation; when talking about bicycle and pedestrian safety we have to do it
properly and carefully and we must think it through. Trustee Schmidt said that
in terms of bike safety, until we as a nation change how we get a driver's license
the interaction between motor vehicles and cyclists is not going to change.
Trustee Schmidt said that most drivers do not understand the simple fact that
when you are a bicyclist you are a motor vehicle and must obey all the rules and
regulations of the road. Trustee Schmidt said that it does not make sense that
we are unable to fix a fence on State property but we are getting ready to spend
1.5 million dollars to fix the exit and entrance ramps that are on State property
and do not belong to us as well. Trustee Schmidt said that the Village is being
faced with a lot of financial issues; 3 million dollars for water improvements and
millions of dollars for a new well along with other things that have to be done to
protect our water system. Trustee Schmidt said that we need to control the
traffic in that area and the biggest way to control the traffic is to put up the
traffic lights. Trustee Schmidt said that he is also concerned that if we do not
clean up those sidewalks immediately after a snow storm we are opening
ourselves up to lawsuits and that creates a whole other level of maintenance at
a time that we have to cut back and to try to manage things smarter.

    Trustee Raskob addressed the question of when our Courts meet. Trustee
Raskob said that Village Court meets from 8:30am to 4:00pm and it is
unrealistic to expect someone to come after those hours. Trustee Raskob said
that restrictions on private property are enforceable and while he feels for the
gentlemen whose daughter received the ticket; we are trying to keep people
from using properties throughout Village as a place to park a car free while they
go to the train station. Trustee Raskob said that the Board deals with many
different issues and today's discussion addresses an issue of competing uses.
Trustee Raskob said that he was recently in Germany and standing in front of a
train station he saw something like four thousand bicycles in front of the train
station; this was quite an amazing site and we need to do something in this
country to address our transportation issues. Trustee Raskob said that what we
have is a competition between the auto user, pedestrian and bicyclists and we
need some kind of traffic control. Trustee Raskob said that he is not sold on this
and we need to look more at the plan. Trustee Raskob said that he understands
that it has been the established practice to allow parking and when you upset
the establishment it is legitimate to have concerns. Trustee Raskob said he is
concerned with the proposed traffic signal on the on/off ramp at 9A; he does not
know how that is going to work and is concerned that this might back vehicles
up on 9A and this needs to be discussed with DOT. Trustee Raskob said that he
is not un-sympathetic to the needs of our pedestrians and cyclists and we need
to arrive at a way to make it safer for them. Trustee Raskob said that if it was
possible for a ramp to be built from the train station directly to 9A southbound it
would solve most of our problems.

   Trustee Gallelli thanked everyone who came out and made their points
known and assured everyone that the Board will be taking their comments
under consideration and that this will be the topic of many more discussion.
Trustee Gallelli said that the 9-11 Memorial was officially dedicated with well
over 300 people in attendance. Trustee Gallelli welcomed the Black Cow in the
upper Village and wished them lots of success. Trustee Gallelli advised that the
Croton Council of Arts held their opening exhibit at Symphony Knoll and advised
that fifty local artists displayed their work. Trustee Gallelli said that Symphony
Knoll will be the new home for the Croton Council of the Arts. Trustee Gallelli
said that if you missed the opening last Saturday the exhibit will be open on
Sundays from 4:00-6:00pm. Trustee Gallelli congratulated the Croton Fire
Department on the celebration of their 120th anniversary. Trustee Gallelli
advised that the Croton Community Coalition will be holding the 3rd "Drug
Return Day" at the Croton Commons this Saturday between 10:00am and
2:00pm. Trustee Gallelli said that this is a safe way to get rid of unused and
expired drugs that you may have in your medicine cabinet.

    Trustee Murtaugh advised that Cleveland Drive has been repaved and asked
Village Manager Zambrano to elaborate on the advantages of this older
technique. Village Manager Zambrano explained that this process works best on
streets that have not deteriorated drastically. Mr. Zambrano explained that the
first process is to repair the cracks, then apply gravel and tar and within one
week the final surface takes place. Mr. Zambrano stated that this is an old
technique which avoids the need to mill the streets and saves fifty percent of the
costs.

    Mayor Wiegman responded to the question of "Agenda 21"- a UN Program"
Mayor Wiegman said that for clarification purposes Croton is a member, along
with hundreds of local governments, of a consortium called "Local Governments
for Sustainability". Mayor Wiegman said that this gives local governments the
ability to pool their resources and learn from one another about all kinds of
infrastructure questions and ways to save money. Mayor Wiegman said that
this is not only restricted to the United States but there are quite a number of
members from around the world. Mayor Wiegman said that we pay a small
amount of dues to be part of this Consortium and we have taken advantage of
some templates and guidance that they provide. Mayor Wiegman said that this
is a way for local governments to work together. Mayor Wiegman said that the
9-11 Memorial is stunning and is very thankful for all of the individuals and
private contractors that donated material, labor, equipment and expertise to pull
this off; this is clearly something that any one of us could not have done by
ourselves but by pooling our resources together we were able to produce
something quite remarkable and stunning. Mayor Wiegman additionally thanked
Village staff who put in quite a lot of time behind the scenes. Mayor Wiegman
said that the recent Tough-Man Race held this past weekend had approximately
1,300 participants and brought in thousands of people into Croton Park. Mayor
Wiegman said that this race involved a lot of coordination with the County, race
coordinators and Village staff. Mayor Wiegman advised that the Town of
Cortlandt will be holding a "Swap Fair" for athletic equipment this Saturday from
9:00am to 1:00pm.

There being no further business to come before the Board, Trustee Raskob made
a motion to adjourn the meeting. Trustee Schmidt seconded the motion;
approved 5-0. The meeting was adjourned at 11:30pm

Respectfully submitted
Judy Weintraub, Board Secretary

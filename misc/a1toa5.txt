Subject:                  Summary of Project Actions for Greenhouse Gas Reduction and
                          Environmental/Sustainable Measures

Dear Mrs. Alison Bermudez:

Please find the below the summary overview of the project's environmental and sustainability measures, including
actions for greenhouse gas reduction, light pollution reduction, and recycled and sustainable materials specified
for the project.

      ·   Parking Lot Area: Minimize parking lot area by providing motorcycle parking.
      ·   Materials and Resources: The buildings floors, solid pre-fabricated "tilt-up" concrete panel walls and
          building roof structure will be reused. A new, more energy-efficient roof system will be installed over the
          existing roof structure. This includes utilizing ecological-sensitive materials for site fencing used at
          designated exterior trash enclosure gates, exterior storage and exterior smoking areas. In place of typical
          wood materials, the site fencing is to be constructed with Resysta, a "fiber reinforced hybrid" product
          called Resysta that very closely looks and feels similar to natural wood and that is defined as an
          "extruded composite consisting of a proprietary blend of approximately 60% rice husks, 22% common
          salt and 18% mineral oil". The advantages are a look and feel of natural wood product with greater
          durability and resistance to wear from use and weather, using wood-free technological innovation. The
          project will also source local materials and resources, where feasible.
      ·   Water Efficiency: Building to be upgraded to more efficient faucets, fixtures and fittings inside and water-
          wise landscaping and automatic irrigation systems outside (Citrus Heights Municipal Code 106.34.050-C).
      ·   Site and Exterior Lighting: To address light pollution reduction and energy efficiency and consumption the
          lighting systems have been designed with energy efficient sources that respect the Night Sky and
          neighboring properties. Lighting levels are designed in accordance with the Illuminating Engineering
          Society's recommendations and all fixtures are shielded or aimed down. Pulse start metal halide (efficacy
          of 96 lumens per watt) light fixtures illuminate the parking lot; ceramic metal halide (efficacy of 100
          lumens per watt) luminaires light the pedestrian paths close to the building. Where metal halide could not
          be used, infrared halogen (higher efficiency halogen technology) is used or luminaires are controlled such
          that they are only on when needed.
      ·   Landscape: The parking lot tree shading calculations have been added to the site plan, indicating enough
          tree coverage to meet the 50% shade requirements in 10 years. Shrubs and trees have been added to
          the landscape plan to bring the planters in compliance with section (Citrus Heights Municipal Code
          106.34.050). Currently the trees proposed to be removed in the parking lots do not provide enough

                                                                                                                  Page 1 of 7
        coverage to meet the shade requirements. The trees to be removed are being replaced with bigger trees
        that will now provide more shade and will meet the 50% parking lot shade requirement.
    ·   Energy and Atmosphere: The project will be designed to utilize building controls with energy-use
        monitoring capabilities to ensure efficient design, construction and operations. This includes specifying
        energy-efficient equipment, systems and lighting.
    ·   Indoor Environmental Quality: the project will implement design strategies to provide thermal comfort and
        daylighting issues by maintaining energy-efficient glazing and exterior solar shading at south-facing
        glazed curtain walls. They will be balanced with daylighting and thermal comfort solutions that take
        advantage of passive air quality and temperature control where feasible.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions regarding the responses submitted above. I would be
glad to offer further assistance or clarification as required

Subject:              Traffic Study for Proposed Casino, Bar, and Grill on Antelope Road

                                                                                                       RS12-3057


This technical memorandum summarizes level of service and queuing analysis we performed for
the proposed Casino, Bar, and Grill to be located at 6510 Antelope Road in Citrus Heights,
California. The proposed project is located on the south side of Antelope Road, directly west of
Interstate 80 (I-80). Based on the current site plan, project consists of a 23,600 square-foot
building that would include a restaurant/bar and gaming floor space. Seating would be provided
for 180 restaurant patrons and 270 cardroom patrons.

Study recommendations may be found on pages 14-15.



EXISTING CONDITIONS

We performed intersection level of service and queuing analysis for the weekday PM peak hour1
at the following study intersections:

          ·   Antelope Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway

          ·   Antelope Road/Zenith Drive/Tupelo Drive

Existing intersection turning movement counts were collected from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on
Wednesday, November 7, 2012. Weather conditions were good and roads were dry when the
counts were collected. The count sheets are provided in the Attachments. Figure 1 shows the
existing traffic volumes.




      1
          The PM peak hour was selected for evaluation (versus the AM peak hour) because casino/cardrooms are
          known to generate more traffic during this period.

INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS

Intersection level of service analysis was performed using the SimTraffic micro-simulation
software, which utilizes the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology.                             SimTraffic is a
valuable tool when analyzing congested or closely spaced intersections because it considers the
effects of queue spillbacks on adjacent intersections, coordinated signal timing, lane changing,
and other travel behaviors on corridor operations.

The two study intersections are spaced approximately 580 feet apart and feature coordinated
traffic signal timings. Field observations revealed that consistent eastbound-westbound
bandwidths of green time were not always provided for the Antelope Road approaches. Signal
timings plans and field observations revealed cycle lengths of approximately 2 minutes at each
intersection. The westbound approach of the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive intersection includes
one left-turn lane, one through lane, and one shared through/right-turn lane; however, the shared
through/right-turn lane and adjacent Class II bike lane are approximately 26 feet wide. Some
motorists were observed using the extra width to make right turns and very occasionally travel
through the intersection to the third receiving lane west of the intersection. A short (less than 100
foot) right-turn lane was entered into the SimTraffic model to reflect this behavior.

The delay and level of service shown in Table 1 are the results of an average of 10 simulation runs.
Signal timings provided by the City of Citrus Heights were entered into the model. As shown in
Table 1, both study intersections currently operate at LOS C. The technical calculations are
provided in the Attachments.

QUEUING ANALYSIS

Table 2 shows the maximum observed vehicle queues for critical movements at the Antelope
Road/Lichen Drive intersection. These observations were recorded when the traffic volume data
was collected.

The following vehicular queuing characteristics were observed at the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive
intersection:

    ·         The westbound left-turn lane had a maximum queue of 7 vehicles, which occupied the
              the majority of the 200-foot turn lane.
    ·         Westbound through traffic extended beyond the I-80 WB Ramps/Antelope Road
              intersection, blocking access to the left-turn lane.
    ·         Westbound queued vehicles on Antelope Road at Tupelo Drive occasionally spilled back
              into the Lichen Drive intersection.
    ·         A greater proportion of eastbound Antelope Road traffic at Lichen Drive used the inside
              or middle through lanes, versus the through/right lane (which becomes a `trap' lane onto
              WB I-80 about 350 feet beyond the intersection).

Table 2 also displays the 95th percentile queue length for each movement, as reported by
SimTraffic. The queuing analysis was used to calibrate the SimTraffic model to existing conditions
observed in the field. As shown in Table 2, the westbound left-turn queue was observed reaching
175 feet, which nearly fills the existing storage pocket length leaving room for approximately one
more vehicle. The 95th percentile queue recorded in the SimTraffic analysis is 210 feet. Visual
observation of the SimTraffic simulation shows that the westbound left-turn queue does not
extend out of the existing pocket; however, because of the length of the westbound through
movement queue, some left-turning vehicles are blocked by through traffic upstream of the left-
turn pocket. These vehicles are reflected in the SimTraffic results, which show a queue length
greater than the 200 foot storage pocket. In actuality, the left-turn queue in the SimTraffic
analysis matches what was observed in the field and does not extend beyond the existing pocket
length. Exhibit 1 shows an example of the existing queuing at the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive
intersection.

                Exhibit 1: SimTraffic Simulation Screen Shot ­ Existing Conditions




The eastbound through movement and northbound right-turn movement queues recorded in
SimTraffic are within approximately 1-2 vehicles of the observed queues lengths recorded in the
field. The westbound through movement queue was observed extending beyond the upstream
intersection, which is also shown in the SimTraffic results. Therefore, the SimTraffic model has
been accurately calibrated to match existing conditions.

PROJECT TRAVEL CHARACTERISTICS

TRIP GENERATION RATES

Trip generation rates published in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation
Manual, 9th Edition (2012) are typically used to estimate the trip generation of a proposed land
development. While Trip Generation has a Casino/Video Lottery Establishment land use category,
the PM peak hour trip generation rate is based on six studies of facilities that average only 2,000
square feet (significantly smaller than the proposed project).                     Furthermore, the land use
description of this category specifies that food service was generally not provided within the
surveyed sites. Therefore, we conducted trip generation surveys at the following casinos, which
are generally similar in location, size, and operation to that of the proposed project:

    ·         Casino Royale ­ located at 2052 Auburn Boulevard in Sacramento, CA

    ·         Cordova Casino ­ located at 2801 Prospect Park Drive in Rancho Cordova, CA

The location, size, on-site amenities, and parking associated with these casinos are described
below, followed by their measured trip generation characteristics.

As shown in Table 3, Casino Royale devotes a greater proportion of its overall facility space to
gaming operations when compared to the Cordova Casino.                       Data regarding the size of the
restaurant/bar space and back-of-house operations was not available.

Comparable Casino Trip Generation Survey Results

We conducted counts at each facility during the PM peak period (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) on
Tuesday, October 30 and Thursday, November 1, 2012 (the count data is provided in the
Attachments). Table 4 summarizes the results. At each facility, conditions were slightly busier (6
to 8 percent) during the Thursday count period versus the Tuesday count period. Despite having
less square footage, Casino Royale generated more PM peak hour trips than Cordova Casino.

As shown in Table 5, the deviation in trip rates between the two sites is less when the rates are
expressed on a "per gaming table" basis versus a "per ksf" basis. When the average rate of 7.00
PM peak hour trips per gaming table is used, trips generated by Casino Royale are
underestimated by 13% (77 vs. 89), while trips generated by Cordova Casino are overestimated by
24% (63 vs. 51). Use of the average rate of 5.11 trips per ksf yields far less accurate results.

Based on the results in Table 5, the following trip generation rates were used for the proposed
project:

    ·      Weekday PM Peak Hour = 7 trips per gaming table

           o   53% are inbound / 47% are outbound based on comparable facility counts


PROJECT TRIP GENERATION

Table 6 shows the PM peak hour trip generation estimates for the proposed Casino, Bar, and Grill.
As shown, the proposed project would generate 210 trips during the PM peak hour. The average
trip generation rates developed from the data at Casino Royale and Cordova Casino included not
only gaming table patrons, but also employees, deliveries, and bar/restaurant patrons (to the
extent they arrived/departed during the PM peak hour).           Therefore, it was not necessary to
account for these users separately within Table 6,

PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION

Project generated trips were distributed to the surrounding roadway network based on existing
travel patterns within the area and the population distribution within a 10 mile radius of the
project site. A map of the population distribution is provided in the Attachments. Although the
exact catchment area of the project is not known, the use of a 10-mile radius provides important
information regarding the potential market within a 10 to 20 minute drive.

Project trips were distributed to the adjacent roadway network based on the following
distribution pattern:
Alison Bermudez & Kevin Becker, City of Citrus Heights
January 9, 2013
Page 9 of 16
      ·    80% travel to/from east on Antelope Road (toward I-80)

      ·    15% travel to/from west on Antelope Road

      ·    2% travel to/from south on Tupelo Drive

      ·    2% travel to/from north on Zenith Drive

      ·    1% travel to/from north on Lichen Drive

Figure 2 shows the project only trips at the study intersections. Since the northbound movement
at the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway intersection is restricted to right-turns only,
project trips traveling westbound from the project site would need to use the Tupelo Drive/East-
West Drive Aisle intersection (shown as intersection #3 on Figure 2).         Project trips at this
intersection are shown on Figure 2 for reference purposes only.

As shown on Figure 2, the proposed project would add 89 westbound left-turns during the PM
peak hour to the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway intersection. This would result in
this movement increasing from 131 vehicles (today) to 220 vehicles with the project.



SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA

On August 11, 2011, the City of Citrus Heights adopted its General Plan Update. Policy 29.2
of the General Plan specifies the following:

  ·       The City will strive to achieve LOS E or better conditions for roadways and intersections
          during peak hours (these may include weekday AM, midday, and PM, as well as
          Saturday midday or PM). The intent of this policy is to effectively utilize the roadway
          network capacity while balancing the desire to minimize potential adverse effects of
          vehicle travel on the environment and other modes. Exceptions to the LOS E policy are
          allowed for roadway segments and intersections along five arterials in the City
          including Antelope Road east of I-80. On these five arterials, no roadway widening to
          provide additional vehicle capacity will be permitted. Development projects that cause
          an impact at these locations may also require mitigation (including, but not limited to)
          the following:
               o   Actions that reduce vehicle trips or provide non-auto improvements to the
                   transportation network or service.

In accordance with Policy 29.2, the proposed project would have a significant impact on the
roadway system if it would:

    ·       Worsen peak hour operations at an intersection maintained by the City of Citrus
            Heights from LOS E or better to LOS F. 

It is worth noting that the City may also place conditions of approval on proposed projects to
make certain frontage or on-site improvements if warranted. Typical improvements to the
transportation system may include: lengthening of turn pockets, modified traffic signal
timings, driveway reconfigurations, bicycle/pedestrian/transit system enhancements, and on-
site circulation improvements. A study, such as this one, is often prepared to demonstrate the
nexus between project implementation and the need for the specified improvements.

operational changes, such as signal timing adjustments, were assumed for this scenario. Table 7
shows the level of service results (the technical calculations are provided in the Attachments).

As shown in Table 7, the project would cause modest increases in delays at the Antelope
Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway intersection. However, operations would remain at LOS C.

QUEUING ANALYSIS

Table 8 shows the existing plus project conditions queue lengths for the critical movements at the
Antelope Road/Lichen Drive-Project Driveway intersection.

The results in Table 8 reveal the following key conclusions:

 ·   Development of the project would cause traffic to spill out of the westbound left-turn lane (see
     Exhibit 2 for SimTraffic screenshot). The maximum  green  time  for  the  westbound  leftturn 
     movement  is  18.5  seconds,  which  is  not  sufficient  to  accommodate  existing  traffic  plus 
     projectgenerated trips.   Observations of the simulation show frequent queues  that  do not 
     fully dissipate (i.e. vehicles at the end of the queue do not make it through the intersection 
     and  have  to  sit  through  an  additional  signal  cycle  before  clearing  the  intersection).  
     Recommendations to address this situation are provided in the following section.  
      
 ·   Development of the project would cause increased queuing on the project driveway approach
     to Antelope Road. Traffic would queue nearly back to the first internal intersection, but would
     not adversely affect that intersection or public street operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Since  the  project  would  not  cause  a  significant  impact  at  either  study  intersection,  it  is  consistent 
with  Policy  29.2  of  the  General  Plan.    However,  the following recommendations are offered to
address the expected vehicular queuing problem caused by the project in the westbound left-turn
lane at the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway intersection (see Figure 4):

    ·    Increase the westbound left-turn pocket length at the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive/Project
         Driveway intersection from 200 feet to 300 feet.
    ·    Increase the maximum green time for the westbound left-turn movement at the Antelope
         Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway intersection from 18.5 seconds to 24.5 seconds.

The effects of these changes were modeled using SimTraffic. These modifications would reduce
average delays in the westbound left-turn lane, provide adequate green time to enable all queued
vehicles to clear the intersection during the green phase, and supply sufficient storage for the 95th
percentile queue length (i.e., traffic would not spill into the adjacent through lane). Furthermore,
these improvements would not adversely affect other intersection turning movements. Lastly,
lengthening the left-turn pocket can be accommodated within the existing 14-foot wide median
on Antelope Road and would not encroach into Caltrans Access Control.

The following recommendations (see Figure 4) relating to internal circulation are offered:

    ·   Post a "mandatory (right-turn) movement" sign (R3-5R) on the far side signal mast arm of
        the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway intersection for the northbound
        movement. Currently, there is just one sign within the project site that is difficult to see.

    ·   Provide enhanced intersection striping and signage for the internal site intersection south of
        the Antelope Road/Lichen Drive/Project Driveway intersection. Potential enhancements
        may include:

        o   Delineation of dedicated left and through/right lanes on the southbound approach.

        o   STOP bars / signs on the northbound, eastbound, and westbound approaches.

        o   Signs at the eastbound and westbound approaches indicating that "Traffic from Left
            (Right) Does Not Stop" [W4-4aP (Left) and W4-4aP (Right)].

                                                           sign (R3-5R) on far side signal mast arm.

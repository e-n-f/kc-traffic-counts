                   MINUTES OF THE MEETING
                         MAY 25, 2011

I.     ROLL CALL

       Members Present: Mike Avila, James Batcho, Derek Neff, Adrian Reid, Sara
       Ryterband, Jeff Weber
       Staff Present: Justin Wykoff, Denise Dean

II.    APPROVAL OF MINUTES

       Weber made the motion to approve the minutes of the April 27, 2011 meeting.
       Neff seconded the motion. The motion carried with a vote of 5-0-0
       (Avila arrived after roll call and approval of minutes).

III.   REPORTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

       Wykoff stated there was a large amount of signal upgrade work going on in
       the downtown area. The Atwater and Henderson Street project has started
       which includes the installation of a new signal.

IV.    OLD BUSINESS

       A. East/west alley between Walnut & Washington and Grimes & Davis ­ Ian
          Woollen's request to make the alley one-way westbound.

          This request was tabled from the last meeting allowing the Engineering
          Department to review the Plan Commission file to see if there were any
          conditions of approval that were not met. Wykoff stated by the traffic
          count numbers, the City was not in support of the request for the alley to
          be one-way westbound. Wykoff stated there was a note in the Plan
          Commission file which stated the Fire Department considered the
          alleyway a safety valve and they approved "the access plan with regard to
          safety and accessibility". Wykoff stated recently there have been
          discussions about closing this section of alleyway. Wykoff stated this
          request would need to go before the Board of Public Works. This would
          allow the public as well as the BP Station to have input. The alleyway
          would basically become a driveway for the two adjacent property owners.

          Ian Woollen: The neighborhood had a meeting last night and approved a
          resolution to close the alley. This letter was sent to Wykoff. Woollen
          discussed with the Commission the notes from the Plan Commission file.

          Weber asked if the City could use signage (i.e. no trucks, maximum
          vehicle weight, and local traffic only) to deter traffic from going down the
        alley. Woollen stated he thought this type of signage as well as the one-
        way sign would be ignored.

        Isabel Piedmont Smith: She is the Council member for District 5 and
        stated the best thing to do would be to withdraw the request to make the
        alley one-way and petition the Board of Public Works to close the section
        of the alley.

        The request was withdrawn; therefore, no motion was necessary.

V.   NEW BUSINESS

     A. Olcott Blvd. & Moore's Pike ­ request for a multi-way stop

        Wykoff stated the traffic counts for the area were: Olcott Blvd.
        (northbound) ­ 922 vehicles, Moore's Pike (eastbound) ­ 3,880 and
        Moore's Pike (westbound) ­ 3,276. The 85th percentile speed on Moore's
        Pike was 44 MPH. There were two accidents which included someone
        sliding on wet pavement and someone hitting a deer. Wykoff stated this
        stretch of Moore's Pike was previously in the County's jurisdiction and
        the speed was posted at 40 MPH. When the street was taken in by the
        City the speed limit was not changed to 30 MPH which was recently
        brought to the City's attention. The speed limit sign has been changed to
        reflect 30 MPH. The line of sight requirements would not have been met
        if the speed limit was 40 MPH but is met with the change to 30. Wykoff
        stated the Engineering Department had received seven phones calls
        opposed to the request and one call in favor. There were three e-mails
        opposed which the members were given copies of.

        Ed Robertson: His wife made the request for the multi-way stop but was
        unable to attend tonight's meeting. He stated it is difficult for a pedestrian
        to cross Moore's Pike at this intersection with the hills and the speed of
        vehicles. He does not feel the lower speed limit has helped. He has seen
        three dead deer within three weeks. Robertson stated one problem is that
        the sidewalk on the south side of Moore's Pike ends just west of Olcott
        Blvd. so you have to cross to the north.

        George Fedynskyj-2102 S. Smith Road: He has lived at this address for
        25 years and is travels Moore's Pike daily and is not in favor of the multi-
        way stop. He handed the commission members a list of reasons he is not
        in favor of the request (attached). One observation is that Hyde Park is
        not getting any bigger and there are four entrance/exits to this subdivision.
        He feels the area will be more dangerous in the winter time with the
        addition of the stop sign. Fedynskyj has seen the new 30 MPH speed limit
        sign but felt that the 40 MPH was a more comfortable speed for this area.
          He feels that there needs to be more speed limit signs if the City wants to
          make the public aware.

          Weber asked if the City could use some type of flags on the speed limit
          signs to alert drivers of a change. Due to the amount of negative response
          from e-mails, phone calls and public present, Ryterband made a motion to
          recommend the denial of the request for a multi-way stop at Olcott Blvd.
          and Moore's Pike. Neff seconded the motion. The motion carried with a
          vote of 6-0-0. Ryterband stated Robertson should contact the Public
          Works Department in regards to pedestrian/bicyclists concerns and have
          the City put out the speed board with the new speed limit.

VI.    DISCUSSION

       There was none at this time.

VII.   ADJOURNMENT

       The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled for June
       22, 2011.
Dear Commissioners: 
 
Please consider adding a "No Turn on Red" sign to westbound traffic on 3rd Street as they 
approach Jordan Avenue from the east. Right now there is some type of small banking center on 
the southeast corner of that intersection that blocks the vision to the left of those stopped at 
that light on 3rd. One can see only a few yards before seeing oncoming northbound traffic on 
Jordan Avenue coming from south of that intersection.  To me, this represents a dangerous 
situation, especially since there is also much pedestrian traffic at that intersection. A "No Turn 
on Red" sign would make this intersection much safer. 
 
Thank you for this consideration. 
 
Regards, 
 
Jack Dvorak

I am sending this email as a request for the addition of a street side handicapped parking
space for Upland Brewing Company at our 350 W 11th Street location. Although we
currently offer handicap parking spaces within our parking lot, Upland Brewing
Company would like to have a handicapped parking space that is closer and easier for our
patrons to the entrance to our establishment. Upland Brewing Company is asking for this
request and would be willing to provide any more information or assistance for this
request.

Sincerely,

MEETING NOTICE
Bloomington Traffic Commission
Request to Change Parking to allow for the Addition of Bike Lanes/Sharrow's on Rogers
Street


July 27, 2011: The City of Bloomington Traffic Commission will meet to discuss a request to change parking
along Rogers Street from the East side to the West Side.

The City of Bloomington Greenways Plan calls for the addition of Bike Lanes along Rogers Street between
2nd Street and 17th Street. With the recent work and resurfacing along Rogers Street between Kirkwood
Avenue and 11th Street, we would like to work to implement this change.

Due to the pavement width of 36 feet, a bicycle lane in each direction is not possible, however with the
usage of a `sharrow' pavement marking (indicates a lane shared between bicyclist and vehicle) this can
be accomplished. In doing this, we would like to place a bike lane along the east side of Rogers between
Kirkwood Avenue and 11th Street, to allow slower moving bike traffic to travel safely outside the vehicular
travel lane and additionally safer by moving parked cars to the west side of Roger Street to eliminate
conflicts with opening car doors.              Sharrow pavement markings would then be placed along the
southbound lane of Rogers Street to indicate shared usage of the roadway between vehicles and bicyclists
who may travel faster with the downward grades in this section of Rogers Street.

These changes in parking are to be discussed and voted on by the Bloomington Traffic Commission, an
advisory Commission to the Bloomington City Council.

This meeting will be held on July 27, 2011 at 5:30p.m. at City Hall Council Chambers, 401 North Morton
Street, Bloomington, Indiana.

Members of the public are welcome to attend and express their thoughts and opinions on this request that
will be voted on and if approved, forwarded to the City Council for their consideration.

                                                            Introduction and Overview

Overview
     The San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD or District), as the lead agency under the California
     Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), has prepared this Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration
     (IS/MND) to evaluate the potential environmental consequences associated with the O'Farrell
     Community School Modernization and New High School Project (Project). The Project consists of the
     repair and renovation of an existing community school's facilities, construction of a new high school,
     and development of a joint-use playfields site. Implementation of the Project would require
     approval by the SDUSD Board. As part of the District's discretionary review process, the Project is
     required to undergo an environmental review in accordance with CEQA.



CEQA Requirements
     The Project is subject to the requirements of CEQA. Per CEQA requirements (Public Resources Code
     [PRC], Division 13, Sections 21000­21177) and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of
     Regulations [CCR], Title 14, Sections 15000­15387), an Initial Study/Environmental Checklist Form
     was prepared to provide the basis for deciding whether to prepare an Environmental Impact Report
     (EIR), a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), or a Negative Declaration (ND) for the Project. As
     provided in CEQA Section 15070 (CCR Title 14), an MND may be prepared for a project subject to
     CEQA when an Initial Study has identified potentially significant effects on the environment, but
     when revisions to the project have been made so that no significant effect on the environment would
     result from project implementation. Based on the findings of the Initial Study, the District has
     determined that preparation of the IS/MND is the appropriate method to present environmental
     review of the Project in compliance with CEQA. Chapter 3 of this IS/MND contains the Initial
     Study/Environmental Checklist Form.



Impact Terminology
     The following terminology is used to describe the level of significance of impacts:
     ·    A finding of no impact is appropriate if the analysis concludes that a project would not affect the
          particular topic area in any way.
     ·    An impact is considered less than significant if the analysis concludes that a project would cause
          no substantial adverse change to the environment and requires no mitigation.
     ·    An impact is considered less than significant with mitigation incorporated if the analysis
          concludes that a project would cause no substantial adverse change to the environment with the
          inclusion of environmental commitments or other enforceable measures that have been agreed
          to by the applicant.

Project Overview
     The O'Farrell Community School Modernization and New School Project consists of modernization
     improvements to the O'Farrell Community School, construction of a new high school, and
     redevelopment of a 2-acre joint-use athletic playfields site.

     The new 480 student high school would be operated as a charter school. The high school would be
     built on District property; therefore, as lead agency under CEQA, the District is responsible for
     completing the environmental review for implementation of this feature of the Project.

     Following the ratification of Proposition S (Prop S)--the San Diego Repair and Safety Measure for
     the repair and renovation of district school facilities--the Project would employ bond funds to
     improve the school facilities at O'Farrell Community School. As mandated, Prop S funds must be
     used for projects listed in the bond language placed before voters, and many of the facilities at this
     school were identified for renovations, repairs, and/or upgrades. Proposed Project improvements
     consist of various upgrades to classrooms and recreational facilities including redevelopment of the
     2-acre turf playfields site proposed for joint-use between the District and the City of San Diego.
     Additionally, the Project includes development of a new high school directly east of the O'Farrell
     Community School and within the District's property.



Project Location
     The Project would occur within District-owned property located in the City of San Diego (see
     Figure 1). Specifically, the Project site is bordered to the north by Benson Avenue, to the west by
     61st Street, to the south by Skyline Drive, and to the east by single-family residences. The existing
     onsite community school (O'Farrell Community School) is located at 6130 Skyline Drive, and is
     situated within the southwestern portion of the Project site. The new high school would be located
     adjacent to and east of the existing school, within the site's southeastern corner. The site for the
     proposed joint-use turf playfields is directly north of the existing community school facility. Figure 2
     shows the location of these Project elements.



Environmental Setting
     Currently the Project site includes the O'Farrell Community School and two large undeveloped
     lots--one located to the east of the school, the other to the north. The vacant lot to the east of the
     school is proposed for construction of the new high school. The proposed joint-use turf playfields
     would be located within the undeveloped lot to the north of the existing school.

     The existing onsite school was opened in 1960 and serves grades 6 through 9, with current
     enrollment at approximately 916 students (Ed-Data 2013). This facility includes classrooms,

     administration buildings, service buildings, storage buildings, utility buildings, athletic facilities, and
     asphalt-paved parking lots.

     Surrounding land uses are predominantly single-family residential with the exception of the
     Bayview Baptist Church, which is located directly north of the site across Benson Avenue. Regional
     access to the site is generally provided by Interstate (I-) 805 or State Route (SR-) 94, and local access
     is provided by Skyline Drive and 61st Street.



Proposed Project Elements
     As analyzed in this IS/MND, the Project is separated into three Project elements. These comprise the
     Prop S modernization improvements for the existing O'Farrell Community School, construction of a
     new high school, and development of a 2-acre joint-use playfields site. Each of these Project
     elements is described below.

O'Farrell Community School Modernization Improvements
     Supported by bond funds under Prop S, modernization improvements are proposed for the existing
     community school to benefit student health, safety, and security; upgrade school accessibility and
     facilitate code compliance; and perform needed building systems repairs and replacements. None of
     the improvements would accommodate an increase in the student capacity of the school. A list of the
     O'Farrell Community School improvements is provided below.

Student Health, Safety, and Security
     ·     Installation of new entry gates throughout campus and a 6-foot fence at new relocatables
           (portable classrooms).

     ·     Installation of six (6) 10-foot exterior light poles.

     ·     Installation of new signal and communication system in all buildings and new relocatables.

     ·     Removal of hazardous materials at exterior stucco and plaster where modifications to windows
           take place.

     ·     Installation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units in applicable buildings.
           This improvement includes installation of new windows, structural upgrades to existing
           buildings, installation of energy management system (EMS) controls, and work on exposed
           ducts.

     ·     Installation of fire alarms to new devices required for upgrade of HVAC units.

School Accessibility and Code Compliance Upgrades
     ·     Renovation of restrooms in applicable buildings per code.

     ·     Modifications to existing paving where existing portables are to be removed, as well as areas for
           new modulars. Various renovations to parking areas including parking re-striping and signage,

     Construction of a new high school is proposed on vacant District property adjacent to and east of the
     existing O'Farrell Community School. The new school would function as a separate campus within
     the Project site, serving grades 9 through 12, and would be sufficient to accommodate 480 students.
     Figure 3 provides a site plan of the new high school. Construction of the school would add eight (8)
     new modular buildings and a small gymnasium. Development of the school would also comprise
     landscaping, including new trees, and stormwater retention ponds. Areas planned for landscaping
     are located adjacent to or near the boundaries of the property and would not be intended for
     student use. Also, 74 general parking spaces and 5 handicapped parking spaces would be included
     with development of the new high school, and an access road to the parking lot would connect to the
     existing O'Farrell Community School's driveway along Skyline Drive. The access road would require
     some minor grading in the southeast portion of the property.

New Joint-Use Playfields
     The District proposes to join with the City of San Diego to co-fund redevelopment of a site for
     athletic playfields. The proposed site is currently owned by the District and located just north of the
     existing O'Farrell Community School. Athletic fields are currently located on this site, and
     implementation of the new joint-use playfields would renovate these existing uses. The new
     playfields site would cover approximately 2 acres, incorporate new turf playfields, and include
     irrigation. No stadium-type lighting is proposed at the fields.



Discretionary Approvals Required
     The District is the lead agency under CEQA and is responsible for the permitting of the joint-use field
     and modernization portions of the Project. The District would also need the approval of compliance
     with the Office of the Division of State Architect.

     The new school would be a charter high school. The charter for the school would be responsible for
     obtaining any clearances from the Division of State Architect or any local agencies for the
     construction of the project. The high school would be built on District property; therefore, as lead
     agency under CEQA, the District is responsible for completing the environmental review for
     implementation of the school.

exempt this project from such land use controls. General Plan and zoning information is therefore provided only for
reference, as they will not apply to the property.

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
     1. A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are adequately
        supported by the information sources a lead agency cites in the parentheses following each question.
        A "No Impact" answer is adequately supported if the referenced information sources show that the
        impact simply does not apply to projects like the one involved (e.g., the project falls outside a fault
        rupture zone). A "No Impact" answer should be explained if it is based on project-specific factors as
        well as general standards (e.g., the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on
        a project-specific screening analysis).
     2. All answers must take account of the whole action involved, including off-site as well as on-site,
        cumulative as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as well as operational
        impacts.
     3. Once the lead agency has determined that a particular physical impact may occur, the checklist
        answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant, less than significant with
        mitigation, or less than significant. "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is
        substantial evidence that an effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant
        Impact" entries when the determination is made, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required.
     4. "Less than Significant with Mitigation Incorporated" applies when the incorporation of mitigation
        measures has reduced an effect from a "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less-than-Significant
        Impact." The lead agency must describe the mitigation measures and briefly explain how they reduce
        the effect to a less-than-significant level. (Mitigation measures from Section XVII, "Earlier Analyses,"
        may be cross-referenced.)
     5. Earlier analyses may be used if, pursuant to tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA process, an effect
        has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration [Section 15063(c)(3)(D)]. In
        this case, a brief discussion should identify the following:
           a.   Earlier Analysis Used. Identify and state where earlier analyses are available for review.
           b. Impacts Adequately Addressed. Identify which effects from the above checklist were within the
              scope of and adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards
              and state whether such effects were addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier
              analysis.
           c.   Mitigation Measures. For effects that are "Less than Significant with Mitigation Incorporated,"
                describe the mitigation measures that were incorporated or refined from the earlier document
                and the extent to which they address site-specific conditions for the project.
     6. Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information sources for
        potential impacts (e.g., general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a previously prepared or
        outside document should, when appropriate, include a reference to the page or pages where the
        statement is substantiated.
     7. Supporting Information Sources: A source list should be attached, and other sources used or
        individuals contacted should be cited in the discussion.
     8. This is only a suggested form, and lead agencies are free to use different formats; however, lead
        agencies should normally address the questions from this checklist that are relevant to a project's
        environmental effects in whatever format is selected.
     9. The explanation of each issue should identify:
           a.   the significance criteria or threshold, if any, used to evaluate each question; and
           b. the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the impact to a less-than-significant level.

    scenic highway?
 c) Substantially degrade the existing visual
    character or quality of the site and its
    surroundings?
 d) Create a new source of substantial light or
    glare that would adversely affect daytime or
    nighttime views in the area?


I. a & b) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Improvements proposed for the existing school would not substantially affect a scenic vista or
     damage scenic resources along a scenic highway because there are no scenic vistas or scenic
     highways within the vicinity or in the greater surrounding areas of the existing school. All Project
     improvements would occur within existing District property, which is relatively flat and surrounded
     by residential development. Eligible State Scenic Highways within the City and County of San Diego
     include portions of SR-163 and SR-125; however, neither is in the vicinity of the existing school
     (Caltrans 2013). Therefore, no impact associated with these issues would occur.

     New High School

     No scenic vistas or scenic highways occur within the vicinity or in the greater surrounding areas of
     the new high school site; therefore, no impact on visual resources would occur with construction of
     the high school. The site is relatively flat and surrounded by an urban environment. In addition, as
     shown in Figure 2, the new high school would be a visual extension of the existing community school
     campus facilities. Within the City and County of San Diego, portions of SR-163 and SR-125 are
     eligible State Scenic Highways; however, neither is in the vicinity of the proposed site (Caltrans
     2013). Therefore, no impact associated with these issues would occur.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not damage scenic resources along a
     scenic highway or impact a scenic vista. Portions of SR-163 and SR-125 are eligible State Scenic
     Highways within the City and County of San Diego; however, neither of these is in the vicinity of the
     proposed playfields site. Further, the site is flat and surrounded by residential development and,
     therefore, would not disrupt a scenic vista. In addition no new lighting is proposed at the field.
     Therefore, no impact would occur.

I. c) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The school improvements are not anticipated to degrade the existing visual character or quality of
     the proposed site or the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Instead, improvements are planned
     to improve the look and function of the existing school facilities by replacing older structures with
     newer and more efficient buildings and infrastructure. Overall, the appearance of the existing onsite
     uses would be improved, thus improving the surrounding neighborhood character as well.
     Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would not occur.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not degrade the existing visual character or quality of
     the site because it would represent an extension of the visual character of the school uses that
     currently exist on the property. Additionally, development of the new high school would improve
     the appearance of the site by planting new trees and incorporating other types of landscaping to
     create an aesthetically pleasing facility. Therefore, the new facility would improve the overall
     appearance of the property, thus improving the character of the surrounding neighborhood as well.
     No impact associated with this issue would occur.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the 2-acre turf playfields would not degrade the existing visual character or
     quality of the site. The site is currently a vacant dirt lot used for athletic activities within the
     District's property. Redevelopment of the site would improve its condition by providing a new
     interactive and inviting facility on a currently underutilized site. In addition, no new lighting is
     proposed at the field other than for security purposes. Therefore, no impacts associated with this
     issue would occur.

I. d) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The school improvements would not create a new source of substantial light or glare. Improved
     security lighting is proposed within the campus through installation of six 10-foot exterior light
     poles, which would be shielded and focus light downward to avoid light trespass (light being cast
     where it is not wanted or needed). The improved lighting would therefore not provide a substantial
     source of light that would adversely affect daytime or nighttime views in the area. Impacts would be
     less than significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not create a new source of substantial light or glare
     because new lighting would incorporate light shielding features and focus light downward to avoid
     light trespass. Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new playfields site would not create a new source of substantial light or glare.
     Security lighting is planned for the joint-use field, but no stadium-type lighting is proposed.
     Therefore, no significant impacts would occur.

 II. Agriculture and Forest Resources                       Impact      Incorporated       Impact          Impact
 In determining whether impacts on agricultural
 resources are significant environmental effects,
 lead agencies may refer to the California
 Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment
 Model (1997) prepared by the California
 Department of Conservation as an optional model
 to use in assessing impacts on agriculture and
 farmland. In determining whether impacts to
 forest resources, including timberland, are
 significant environmental effects, lead agencies
 may refer to information compiled by the
 California Department of Forestry and Fire
 Protection regarding the state's inventory of forest
 land, including the Forest and Range Assessment
 Project, the Forest Legacy Assessment project, and
 forest carbon measurement methodology provided
 in Forest Protocols adopted by the California Air
 Resources Board. Would the project:
 a. Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
      Farmland of Statewide Importance
      (Farmland), as shown on the maps prepared
      pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and
      Monitoring Program of the California
      Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?
 b. Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural
      use or conflict with a Williamson Act contract?
 c. Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause
      rezoning of, forest land (as defined in Public
      Resources Code section 12220(g)),
      timberland (as defined by Public Resources
      Code section 4526), or timberland zoned
      Timberland Production (as defined by
      Government Code section 51104(g))?
 d. Result in the loss of forest land or conversion
      of forest land to non-forest use?
 e. Involve other changes in the existing
      environment which, due to their location or
      nature, could result in conversion of Farmland
      to non-agricultural use or conversion of forest
      land to non-forest use?


II. a ­ e) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements/New High School/New Joint-Use Playfields

     No elements of the Project would result in impacts on agriculture or forest resources. The existing
     school site is in a densely urbanized area where there are no farmlands or forest resources.

     According to the California Department of Conservation San Diego County Important Farmland 2008
     map (California Department of Conservation 2008), the Project site is classified as "urban and built-
     up land," which does not contain any agricultural uses or areas designated Prime Farmland, Unique
     Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance. Furthermore, there are no Williamson Act

     Therefore, there would be no impact.

 When available, the significance criteria
 established by the applicable air quality
 management or air pollution control district may
 be relied upon to make the following
 determinations. Would the project:
 a. Conflict with or obstruct implementation of
      the applicable air quality plan?
 b. Violate any air quality standard or contribute
      substantially to an existing or projected air
      quality violation?
 c. Result in a cumulatively considerable net
      increase of any criteria pollutant for which the
      project region is a nonattainment area for an
      applicable federal or state ambient air quality
      standard (including releasing emissions that
      exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
      precursors)?
 d. Expose sensitive receptors to substantial
      pollutant concentrations?
 e. Create objectionable odors affecting a
      substantial number of people?


III. a) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not conflict with or obstruct implementation of
     any applicable air quality plan. San Diego County is currently designated a nonattainment area for
     the Federal 8-hour ozone standard and the State ozone (O3), Respirable Particulate Matter (PM10),
     and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) standards. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Strategy (RAQS)
     is the region's plan for improving air quality and attaining the Federal and State air quality
     standards. The RAQS relies on information from the California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the
     San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) to project future emissions and determine
     appropriate emissions reduction strategies. The San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD)
     has also adopted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone, as well as measures to help attain the
     particulate matter California Ambient Air Quality Standards (PM CAAQS).

     A project is deemed inconsistent with air quality plans if it would result in population and/or
     employment growth that exceeds estimates used to develop applicable air quality plans, which, in
     turn, would generate emissions not accounted for in the regional emissions budgets. Therefore, this
     Project element was evaluated to determine if it is consistent with the land use designations and
     growth anticipated in the RAQS and ozone SIP prepared for the San Diego region.

     During construction, the school improvements would include replacement of old portable
     classrooms with new modular buildings, installation of new gates and fences, and various facility

     improvements related to access, plumbing, and HVAC upgrades. Emissions from these activities
     would be short-term, minimal, and localized, resulting in air pollutants below any air quality
     standard. Additionally, Project construction requires compliance with SDAPCD Rules and
     Regulations, including Rules 50, 51, and 55, which forbid visible emissions and nuisance activities.
     These regulations also include fugitive dust control measures. The modernization improvements
     would not increase the student capacity of the school and therefore would not involve an increase in
     the number of employees at the school or indirectly cause an increase in the population of residents
     in the area with students at the school. Thus, the project would not conflict with or obstruct the
     implementation of the applicable air quality plan. Impacts would be less than significant, and no
     mitigation is required.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not conflict with or obstruct implementation of any
     applicable air quality plan. Implementation of this Project element involves construction and
     operation of a new high school within the District's existing boundaries. The new high school would
     accommodate 480 new students in a vacant area on the east side of the existing facility. The site is
     currently zoned "Southeast San Diego Planned District: Single-family residential (SESDPD-SF-5000)"
     in the City of San Diego General Plan, which allows for minimum 5,000 square foot lot sizes. These
     land use designations are included in SANDAG's most recent growth forecast used to prepare the
     RAQS. The existing General Plan assumptions for this site would yield forecasted vehicular traffic of
     approximately 864 average daily trips (ADT), assuming maximum buildout and standard City of San
     Diego trip rates (see Table 1).

     The 864 ADT value (see Appendix D) is equal to the number that maximum buildout of current
     zoning could accommodate. Projects that propose development consistent with the growth
     anticipated by the General Plan would be consistent with the RAQS. In this case, the new high school
     would propose development that generates the same amount of trips as anticipated in the General
     Plan and as projected in the RAQS. Further, construction and operations would result in emissions
     below relevant threshold levels, as discussed below in Section III. b. This Project element would
     comply with SDAPCD Rules and Regulations, including Rules 50, 51, and 55, which forbid visible
     emissions and nuisance activities. These regulations also include fugitive dust control measures to
     limit airborne and track-out/carry-out dust beyond project boundaries.

     Therefore, implementation of the new high school would be in conformance with the current RAQS
     and would thus not conflict with or obstruct the implementation of the applicable air quality plan.
     Impacts would be less than significant, and no mitigation is required.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields would not conflict with or obstruct implementation
     of any applicable air quality plan. Implementation of this Project element involves construction of
     new joint-use playfields within the District's existing boundaries. Once constructed, the new
     joint-use playfields would result in minimal additional motor vehicle trips, because the fields would
     be used primarily by both current students and new students associated with the new high school.
     Additionally, nearby City residents may use the joint-use playfields, but visitation is expected to be
     minimal and limited to non-school hours. For example, the default trip rate for a "city park" within
     the California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod) is 1.59 ADT per acre. Therefore, the playfields
     may result in only an estimated 3 ADT for the 2-acre playfields. Similar to the new high school, this
     site is currently zoned "Southeast San Diego Planned District: Single-family residential (SESDPD-SF-
     5000)" in the City of San Diego General Plan, which allows for minimum 5,000 square foot lot sizes.
     The existing General Plan assumptions for this site would yield forecasted vehicular traffic of
     approximately 162 ADT, assuming maximum buildout and standard City of San Diego trip rates (see
     Table 1). In this case, the new playfields would propose development that generates fewer vehicle
     trips than anticipated in the General Plan and as projected in the RAQS. Further, construction and
     operations would result in emissions below relevant threshold levels, as discussed below in Section
     III. b. This Project element would comply with SDAPCD Rules and Regulations, including Rules 50,
     51, and 55, which forbid visible emissions and nuisance activities. These regulations also include
     fugitive dust control measures to limit airborne and track-out/carry-out dust beyond Project
     boundaries.

     Therefore, implementation of the new joint-use playfields would be in conformance with the current
     RAQS and would not conflict with or obstruct the implementation of the applicable air quality plan.
     Impacts would be less than significant, and no mitigation is required.

III. b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not violate any air quality standard or
     contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation. School improvements
     include replacement of old portable classrooms with new modular buildings, installation of new
     gates and fences, and various facility improvements related to access, plumbing, and HVAC
     upgrades. Construction activities would include the use of offroad equipment on site as well as light-

     and heavy-duty vehicle travel to and from the site. However, activity would be short-term, minimal,
     and would likely result in emissions far below applicable thresholds. Improvements would not
     result in additional student capacity, and replacement of inefficient building fixtures and other
     retrofits would likely reduce energy consumption and result in a regional reduction in criteria air
     pollutants. The community school improvements would neither generate a significant number of
     new vehicles trips nor add additional capacity to area roadways. Therefore, this Project element
     would not violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or Project air
     quality violation, Impacts would be less than significant, and no mitigation is required.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new school would not violate any air quality standard or contribute
     substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation. The new high school would consist of
     eight new modular buildings and a small gymnasium on a currently vacant lot adjacent and east of
     the existing O'Farrell Community School. The high school would include 78 parking spaces and an
     access road to the parking lot. Construction activities associated with this Project element would
     generate short-term emissions of Reactive Organic Gas (ROG), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX), carbon
     monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides (SOX), PM10, and PM2.5. Emissions would originate from off-road
     diesel equipment exhaust, employee and material delivery vehicle exhaust, re-entrained paved road
     dust, fugitive dust from land clearing, and off-gassing from architectural coating and asphalt paving.

     Following construction, operation of the new high school would generate long-term emissions of
     ROG, NOX, CO, SOX, PM10, and PM2.5 that would originate from motor vehicle exhaust, re-entrained
     paved road dust, off-gassing associated with reapplication of architectural coatings, consumer
     products (e.g., cleaning supplies), and onsite natural gas combustion for space and water heating.

     Construction- and operations-related emissions were quantified using the California Emissions
     Estimator Model (CalEEMod), version 2011.1.1, vehicle trip estimates from the traffic engineer
     (Appendix D), and modeling defaults associated with a new 480-student high school. It was assumed
     that the earliest that construction would start would be the fourth quarter of 2013 and would
     continue into 2014. Emissions associated with this Project element were compared to SDAPCD's "Air
     Quality Impact Analysis (AQIA) Trigger Levels" as contained within SDAPCD Regulation II, Rule 20.2.

     An estimate of emissions associated with construction of the new high school is presented in Table
     2. For purposes of a conservative analysis, it was assumed that all construction activity would
     overlap on a given day. As shown in Table 2, criteria pollutant emissions associated with
     construction of this Project element would be well below the applicable threshold levels. Therefore,
     air quality impacts as a result of new high school construction would be less than significant.

     An estimate of emissions associated with operation of the new high school is presented in Table 3.
     As shown in Table 3, criteria pollutant emissions associated with operation of the new high school
     would be well below applicable threshold levels. Therefore, air quality impacts as a result of this
     Project element would be less than significant.

III. c) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not result in a cumulatively considerable net
     increase of criteria pollutants in a nonattainment region. The existing school site is located in the
     San Diego Air Basin (SDAB), which is currently classified as nonattainment for certain Federal- and
     State-designated criteria pollutants including O3, PM10, and PM2.5 (SDAPCD 2008). As discussed
     above, emissions from construction activities at the existing school campus and for the new high
     school would be minimal, short-term, and localized. This Project element would comply with all
     required SDAPCD emissions and fugitive dust measures to ensure that the cumulative contribution
     of criteria pollutants during construction would be less than significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not result in a cumulatively considerable net increase
     of criteria pollutants in a nonattainment region. This Project element would result in a cumulatively
     considerable net increase of these pollutants if emissions exceed the AQIA Trigger Levels discussed
     above and shown in Tables 2 and 3. In addition, cumulative impacts could occur if emissions of
     concern from other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects within the proximity
     relevant to the pollutants of concern are in excess of direct air quality impact thresholds.

     As discussed above, the new high school would have a less-than-significant direct impact on air
     quality during both short-term construction (see Table 2) and long-term operations (see Table 3).
     Possible cumulative impacts on air quality as a result of combined activities would be addressed by
     the standard SDAPCD measures that apply to all construction projects, in addition to project-level
     mitigation strategies identified for each project, if any. Therefore, this Project element would not
     result in a cumulatively considerable net increase in emissions. This impact is less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in a cumulatively considerable
     net increase of criteria pollutants in a nonattainment region. As discussed above, emissions from
     construction of the playfields would be minimal and short-term. This Project element would comply
     with all required SDAPCD emissions and fugitive dust measures to ensure that the cumulative
     contribution of criteria pollutants during construction would be less than significant.

III. d) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial
     pollutant concentrations. Sensitive receptors are facilities and structures where people live or spend
     considerable amounts of time, including retirement homes, residences, schools, playgrounds, child
     care centers, and athletic facilities. This Project element would be located near residences, and the
     site itself is an existing school facility, which is considered a sensitive receptor. However, as
     discussed above, construction at the existing school campus would be minimal, and compliance with
     all SDAPCD emissions and fugitive dust standards would ensure impacts on sensitive receptors near
     construction activities are not significant. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial
     pollutant concentrations. This Project element would be located near residences and adjacent to a
     school facility, which is considered a sensitive receptor. However, as discussed above, construction
     at the site for the new high school would be minimal and occur over a period much shorter than the
     assumed 70-year exposure period used to estimate lifetime cancer risks. The new high school would
     not create new toxic air contaminant (TAC) emissions sources on site. In addition, the new high
     school would not create additional bus trips or change the location of bus access on site, as existing
     buses would accommodate the new students. Accordingly, neither construction nor operation of this
     Project element would expose sensitive populations to substantial pollutant concentrations.
     Therefore, this impact is considered to be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not expose sensitive receptors to
     substantial pollutant concentrations. This Project element is located near residences and adjacent to
     a school facility, which is considered a sensitive receptor. However, as discussed above, construction
     at the site would be minimal, and compliance with all SDAPCD emissions and fugitive dust standards
     would ensure impacts on sensitive receptors near construction activities are not significant.
     Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

III. e) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements/New High School/New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the school improvements, the new high school, and the new joint-use playfields
     would not create objectionable odors that would affect a substantial number of people. During
     construction, emissions from construction equipment may be evident in the immediate area on a
     temporary basis. Potential sources that may emit odors during construction activities include any
     architectural coating and asphalt paving. Also, material deliveries and hauling heavy-duty truck trips
     could create an occasional "whiff" of diesel exhaust for nearby receptors. These odors would not
     affect a substantial number of people, as the scale of construction is small. Further, standard
     operation of the school would not produce objectionable odors and there would be no permanent
     impacts. Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would be less than significant.

IV. a ­ f) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Improvements to the existing school campus would not impact biological resources. The entire site
     has been previously developed and is located within a densely urbanized area. Further, review of
     the City of San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP) Multiple Habitat Planning Area
     (MHPA) shows improvement activities would be far removed from any sensitive vegetation
     communities (City of San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan 1997).
     Therefore, this Project element would not result in impacts on biological resources.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not impact biological resources. Currently, the proposed
     school site is an empty lot that has been previously disturbed by clearing and grading. A small strip
     of vegetation is located along the southern border of the site; however this vegetation is not
     identified as sensitive habitat per the City of San Diego MHPA (City of San Diego Multiple Species
     Conservation Program Subarea Plan 1997). Additionally, the site is completely surrounded by a
     dense urban environment where no sensitive biological resources or vegetation communities occur.
     Therefore, there would be no impact.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new playfields site would not result in impacts on biological resources. The
     site consists of a previously disturbed and empty lot that is completely devoid of vegetation or other
     biological resources. There are also no sensitive biological resources or vegetation communities in
     the site's vicinity. Therefore, there would be no impact.

V. a ­ c) Less-than-Significant Impact.

      Community School Improvements/New Joint-Use Playfields

      The school modernization improvements and implementation of the joint-use playfields would not
      cause a substantial change in the significance of a historic, archeological, or paleontological
      resource. A records search and historical evaluation of the property was completed in December
      2012 (see Appendix A ­ California Register of Historic Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter
      School Pursuant to CEQA Compliance). ICF International determined that the existing O'Farrell
      Community School should be considered ineligible for listing on the California Register of Historic
      Resources, and that it not be considered a historic resource for the purposes of CEQA. Consequently,
      the proposed modernization of the school does not appear to have the potential to result in
      substantial adverse effects on a historical resource.

      Although the existing facility is not considered a historical resource, improvements that include any
      type of earthwork activity, such as trench work for utility upgrades, could encounter cultural
      resources. While this scenario is highly unlikely, in the event that buried cultural deposits or
      paleontological resources are encountered during any phase of construction, activities in the vicinity
      of the resources would be temporarily halted, and a qualified archaeologist/paleontologist would be
      consulted to assess the significance of the resource and to provide proper management
      recommendations. Impacts for this issue would therefore be less than significant.

      New High School

      Development of the new high school would not result in adverse impacts on cultural resources. This
      site is included within District property that has been significantly disturbed by previous grading
      activities associated with construction of the O'Farrell Community School in 1960. Any significant
      historical, archeological, or paleontological resources would have likely been disturbed or
      unearthed during past grading activities. Also, minimal grading would be necessary for this element
      of the Project; therefore, project-related impacts on archeological or paleontological resources are
      not anticipated to occur. However, in the unlikely event that buried cultural deposits or

     of the resources would be temporarily halted, and a qualified archaeologist/paleontologist would be
     consulted to assess the significance of the resource and to provide proper management
     recommendations. Therefore, impacts for this issue would be less than significant.

V. d) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     It is not anticipated that the school improvements would disturb any human remains. The entire site
     has been significantly disturbed by previous grading activities associated with the development of
     the community school. Also, no human remains are known to be present in the area, and no Project-
     related impacts on any unknown remains are expected to occur. Therefore, there would be no
     impact.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school is not anticipated to disturb any human remains. The site has
     been disturbed by previous grading activities, and no human remains are known to be present in the
     area. Further, no Project-related impacts on any unknown remains are expected to occur. Therefore,
     there would be no impact.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site is not anticipated to disturb any human remains
     because the site has been disturbed by previous grading activities, and no human remains are

VI. a & c) Less-than-Significant Impact.

      Community School Improvements

      The school modernization improvements are not anticipated to result in impacts associated with
      seismic activity or ground failure. No active or potentially active faults are located within the
      existing school site itself; however, the site is located in a known seismically active region where the
      potential for seismic hazards exists. Because there is a potential for seismic events that could cause
      significant groundshaking on the site, design and construction of all improvements would comply
      with applicable seismic-safety development requirements, including Title 24 standards of the 2010
      California Building Code (CBC) (based on the 2009 International Building Code [IBC]). Additionally,


O'Farrell Community School Modernization                                                                           July 2013

     all improvements would occur within the existing District property, which has a low potential for
     ground-failure because the site has been previously graded and developed. Therefore, given the
     existing conditions of the property, and conformance with all applicable seismic-safety development
     requirements during improvement activities, impacts related to this issue would not be significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school is not anticipated to result in significant seismic activity or
     ground failure-related impacts. There are no active or potentially active faults located on the
     proposed site itself; however, the school would be located in a known seismically active region
     where the potential for seismic hazards exists. To address potential seismic hazards, design and
     construction of the school would comply with applicable seismic-safety development requirements,
     including Title 24 standards of the 2010 CBC (based on the 2009 IBC). Further, all improvements
     would occur within the proposed site, which has a low potential for ground-failure because the site
     has been previously graded. Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would be less than
     significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in significant impacts
     associated with seismic activity or ground failure. Although the site is located in a known seismically
     active region, this Project element does not include construction of structures or features that could
     cause hazards or soil instability during a seismic event. Therefore, significant impacts associated
     with this issue would not occur.

VI. b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not result in substantial soil erosion or the loss
     of topsoil. The site is currently developed on soils classified within the Diablo-Urban land complex
     unit (USDA 2013). These soils have been altered through development cut-and-fill operations and
     have low erodibility potential within development areas (USDA 1973). Also, the site is relatively
     level, which limits the opportunity for rapid stormwater runoff that could intensify erosion
     potential. Additionally, all construction activities to implement the improvements would be subject
     to local pre-and post-construction Best Management Practices (BMPs), required as part of the local
     Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), which would effectively minimize soil erosion.
     Therefore, substantial soil erosion impacts would not occur.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil.
     All construction activities to implement the new school would be subject to local pre-and post-
     construction BMPs required as part of the local SWPPP, which would effectively minimize soil
     erosion. Also, soils under the site are classified within the Diablo-Urban land complex unit
     (USDA 2013), which have been altered through cut-and-fill operations and include low erodibility
     potential within development areas (USDA 1973). Further, plans for the new high school involve
     implementation of landscaped areas with stormwater retention ponds that would limit the
     opportunity for stormwater runoff, which would minimize erosion potential. Therefore, impacts
     associated with this issue would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil is not anticipated to result with implementation of the
     new joint-use playfields site. This element would be built upon altered soils that are classified within
     the Diablo-Urban land complex unit (USDA 2013), which include low erodibility potential within
     development areas (USDA 1973). Also, the site is relatively level, which limits the opportunity for
     rapid stormwater runoff that could intensify erosion potential. Therefore, impacts would be less
     than significant.

VI. d) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The community school site is not located on expansive soil that would create substantial risks to life
     or property. Expansive soils are fine-grained soils that can undergo a significant increase in volume
     with an increase in water content and a significant decrease in volume with a decrease in water
     content. The soils that underlay the school campus (Diablo-Urban land complex unit) are shown to
     have little to no potential for expansion due to the previously graded nature of the site. Therefore,
     impacts would be less than significant.

     New High School

     The new high school would not be constructed on soils considered expansive (soils that expand or
     contract due to water introduction or absence) that would create substantial risks to life or
     property. Diablo-Urban land complex unit makes up the soils that underlay the site, which have little
     to no potential for expansion. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     The site proposed for implementation of the new joint-use playfields does not include expansive
     soils that could create substantial risks to life or property. The soils that underlay the site
     (Diablo-Urban land complex unit) have little to no potential for expansion. Therefore, impacts would
     be less than significant.

VI. e) No Impact.

     The school improvements would not result in any impacts regarding inadequate soils to support
     septic systems. This Project element would use the existing sewer system for the disposal of
     wastewater and would not use septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems. Therefore,
     there would be no impact associated with this issue.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not result in any impacts regarding inadequate soils
     to support septic systems. This Project element would connect to the existing sewer system for the
     disposal of wastewater and would not use septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems.
     Therefore, there would be no impact associated with this issue.

Would the project:

           adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of
           greenhouse gases?


VII. a) Less-than-Significant Impact.

       Methodology

       California's Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, codified the State's
       greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target by requiring the State's global warming emissions to be
       reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. The State CEQA Guidelines do not prescribe a particular threshold
       of significance or method for determining significance of GHG emissions in CEQA documents, but
       instead allow lead agencies to adopt thresholds and methods that are previously adopted or
       recommended by other public agencies or recommended by experts (State CEQA Guidelines
       Sections 15064.4(a) and 15064.7(c)).

       The District has not yet formally adopted specific thresholds of significance with regards to GHG
       emissions in CEQA documents. However, the County of San Diego formally adopted guidelines in
       2012 for evaluating the significance of climate change impacts (County of San Diego 2012). The
       guidelines identify a tiered approach to determining significance of project-related GHG emissions.
       Two bright-light numeric thresholds were adopted for annual emissions: 10,000 metric tons (MT) of
       carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (MTCO2e) for stationary source projects and 2,500 MTCO2e for
       other development projects (County of San Diego 2012). Additionally, the City of San Diego has
       identified an interim GHG threshold for commercial and residential land use development projects.
       This interim threshold is based on the 900-MT screening threshold in the California Air Pollution
       Control Officers Association (CAPCOA) report CEQA & Climate Change and serves as a conservative
       screening threshold (City of San Diego 2010).

       The County GHG thresholds were developed to evaluate operational-related GHG emissions, as
       opposed to construction-related emissions. Indeed, no air district within the state has adopted
       construction-related GHG emissions thresholds. However, by way of comparison, criteria pollutant
       thresholds for project operations are often equal to or more stringent than those adopted for
       construction emissions. Accordingly, operational thresholds can be used to provide a conservative
       analysis of construction-related GHG emissions. A significant amount of GHG emissions is therefore
       defined as 2,500 MTCO2e per year,2 consistent with the County's draft guidance. In accordance with

2 Consistent
           with City and County guidance, construction emissions are amortized over 30 years to obtain an
annual GHG estimate.

     the State CEQA Guidelines and scientific consensus regarding the cumulative nature of GHGs,3 the
     analysis herein includes a cumulative, rather than project-level, evaluation of GHG impacts.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not generate GHG emissions, either directly or
     indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the environment. GHG emissions associated with
     community school improvements would be minimal and limited to modifications of existing
     structures, replacement of old portable buildings with eight new modular buildings, and installation
     of security lighting. Improvements would not result in additional student capacity and replacement
     of inefficient building fixtures, and other retrofits would likely reduce energy and water
     consumption and result in a regional reduction of GHG emissions, while security lighting would
     result in minor electricity consumption. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not generate GHG emissions, either directly or
     indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the environment. This Project element would
     construct a new 480-student high school. The new high school would consist of eight new modular
     buildings and a small gymnasium on a currently vacant lot adjacent to and east of the existing
     O'Farrell Community School. The high school would include 78 parking spaces and an access road to
     the parking lot. Construction of this Project element would result in GHG emissions associated with
     off-road diesel equipment exhaust and from employee and material delivery travel to and from the
     Project site. The primary emissions occur as CO2 from gasoline and diesel combustion, with more
     limited vehicle tailpipe emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4).

     Following construction, operation of the new high school would generate direct and indirect
     operational GHG emissions. Sources of direct emissions include motor vehicle trips to and from the
     site as well as natural gas combustion for space and water heating on site. Indirect emissions would
     result from electricity use, waste generation, and water consumption associated with the new
     building and athletic facilities.

     Construction- and operations-related CO2, CH4, N2O, and CO2e emissions were quantified using
     CalEEMod, version 2011.1.1. Modeling estimates utilized CalEEMod modeling defaults for
     construction and operation of a new 480-student high school. It was assumed that the earliest
     construction would start would be fourth quarter 2013 and would continue into 2014.

     Estimated project-related GHG emissions are presented in Table 4. As shown in Table 4,
     construction emissions were calculated to be approximately 229 MTCO2e over the entire
     construction period. Consistent with the County's draft GHG guidance, the sum of Project-related
     GHG emissions were amortized over a 30-year period and added to annual operational emissions.
     Further, as shown in Table 4, annual operational emissions were calculated to be approximately
     1,070 MTCO2e alone, and 1,077 MTCO2e when combined with the amortized construction total. This
     1,077 MTCO2e total is considerably lower than the 2,500 MT per year threshold used by the County.
     Therefore, this Project element would not generate GHG emissions, either directly or indirectly, that



3 Climate change is a global problem, and GHGs are global pollutants, unlike criteria air pollutants (such as ozone
precursors), which are primarily pollutants of regional and local concern. Given their long atmospheric lifetimes,
GHGs tend to accumulate in the atmosphere. Therefore, GHG impacts are inherently cumulatively considerable.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields would not generate GHG emissions, either directly or
     indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the environment. Construction of this Project
     element would be short-term and minimal, while operation would not result in additional motor
     vehicle trips or major emission sources. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant, and no
     mitigation is required.

VII. b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements/New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the school improvements and new joint-use playfields would not conflict with an
     applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of GHGs. The
     District, the City, and the San Diego Air Pollution Control District have yet to adopt a qualified plan,
     policy, or regulation to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, the most applicable plan, policy, or
     regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions is AB 32, which codified the State's
     GHG emissions reduction targets for the future.

     ARB adopted the AB 32 Scoping Plan as a framework for achieving AB 32. The Scoping Plan outlines
     a series of technologically feasible and cost-effective measures to reduce statewide GHG emissions.
     These strategies are geared towards sectors and activities that generate significant amounts of
     GHGs. For example, the majority of measures address building energy, waste and wastewater
     generation, goods movement, on-road transportation, water usage, and high global warming
     potential gases.

     Although the school improvements and new joint-use playfields include several of these sources,
     activities associated with this Project element are not considered by the AB 32 Scoping Plan as
     having a high potential to emit GHGs. Community school improvements would include modifications
     of existing structures, replacement of old portables with eight new modular buildings, and the
     installation of security lighting. This project element would not result in additional student capacity.
     Emissions would be minimal and considerably lower than the 2,500 MT per year threshold used by
     the County of San Diego, which was adopted to help the County support achievement of the
     statewide reduction goals of AB 32. Consequently, none of the AB 32 reduction strategies are
     applicable to construction and operation of this Project element. Implementation of the school
     improvements would therefore not conflict with implementation of AB 32, and this impact is
     considered less than significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or
     regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of GHGs. While the new high school
     includes several of these sources, activities associated with this Project element are not considered
     by the AB 32 Scoping Plan as having a high potential to emit GHGs. This statement is substantiated
     by the project-level emissions analysis, which demonstrates that the GHG emission rate is
     considerably lower than the 2,500 MT per year threshold used by the County of San Diego, which
     was adopted to help the County support achievement of the statewide reduction goals of AB 32.
     Consequently, none of the AB 32 reduction strategies are applicable to construction and operation of

     the review based on the potential environmental concerns associated with the current and historical
     uses of the Project element sites and adjoining properties followed by an analysis of impacts based
     on this review.

     Environmental Setting

     Ninyo & Moore reviewed in-house documents, files, and online regulatory agency databases for
     information regarding known or potential environmental issues on the District's property and in the
     surrounding vicinity. No properties of potential environmental concern were noted adjacent to or
     within approximately 2,000 feet of the proposed Project site. However, areas of potential concern
     were identified within the property site, as discussed below.

     Community School Improvements

     In August and October 2012, Ninyo and Moore conducted soil sampling and analysis in the northeast
     and southwest quadrants of the existing school campus to evaluate potential impacts due to an
     identified arsenic-impacted soil area located north of the campus and within the joint-use playfields
     site. The soil samples collected from the northeast and southwest quadrants of the campus did not
     contain concentrations of arsenic at or above the California Department of Toxic Substances
     Control's (DTSC) regional action level. A discussion of the arsenic-impacted soil area is provided
     under "New Joint-Use Playfields" below.

     New High School

     In July 2012, Ninyo & Moore conducted soil sampling and analysis in each quadrant of the proposed
     high school site to identify potential soil impacts from arsenic and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs).
     Arsenic was detected in two soil samples at concentrations exceeding the regional action level for
     arsenic. The OCP dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) was also detected in soil samples
     analyzed.

     In August 2012, Ninyo & Moore performed soil sampling and analysis to further evaluate the area of
     arsenic-impacted soil. One soil sample collected at 3 feet below ground surface (bgs) contained
     arsenic at a concentration that equaled the regional action level; however, the soil samples collected
     at depths of 1 and 2 feet bgs did not contain elevated concentrations of arsenic.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     North of the existing school campus, a 6,000-gallon underground storage tank (UST) used to store
     heating/fuel oil was removed from the site on March 22, 1988. During removal activities, the
     Department of Environmental Health (DEH) noted "ponded product in the excavation and
     petroleum-impacted soil." Remediation activities removed approximately 144 cubic yards of
     petroleum-impacted soil from the site in February 1989. The DEH issued case closure on March 14,
     1989, under the condition that, "if the current use of the site changes, additional site
     characterization and mitigation activity may be required."

     In October 2002, URS Corporation (URS) prepared a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)
     report at the proposed joint-use playfields site. The assessment identified the known presence of
     asbestos-containing materials (ACM), lead-based paint (LBP), and petroleum-impacted soil
     associated with a former UST as recognized environmental conditions.

     In 2005, the site of the UST was listed as "Inactive ­ action required"; however, potential
     contaminants of concern were listed as "unspecified." Contact with the DTSC regarding the potential

     issues at the site revealed that review of the Phase I ESA was terminated before the site was listed
     "Inactive" and if future modernization or development activities at the site require DTSC review,
     then an updated Phase I ESA report would need to be submitted for review and determination.

     In July 2012, Ninyo & Moore conducted soil sampling and analysis in each quadrant of the proposed
     joint-use playfields site to identify potential soil impacts from arsenic and OCPs. Arsenic was
     detected in three soil samples at concentrations exceeding the regional action level for arsenic of
     12 milligrams per kilogram. The OCP DDE was detected in one soil sample and gamma chlordane
     was detected in another sample.

     In August and October 2012, additional soil sampling was performed around the samples with
     arsenic to further evaluate the area of arsenic impacted soil. Two soil samples contained arsenic at
     concentrations that equaled the regional action level.

     In May 2013, as a precautionary measure, the District installed fencing around an area within the
     existing fields to restrict access. The access restriction is temporary and will be stopped after soil is
     removed as a part of future improvements to the field.

     Impact Analysis

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not create a significant hazard to the public or
     the environment associated with the handling of hazardous materials. During construction,
     potentially hazardous materials found on site (anticipated for exterior stucco and plaster where
     modifications to windows take place) would be removed. Also, construction activities would require
     the use of typical materials associated with construction activities, such as diesel fuels, hydraulic
     liquids, oils, solvents, and paints; however, any hazardous materials used or removed during
     construction would be transported, used, and stored in accordance with State and Federal
     regulations regarding hazardous materials.

     No impacts associated with hazardous materials after implementation of the school improvements
     are anticipated. Soil samples collected by Ninyo & More at the campus did not contain
     concentrations of arsenic at or above DTSC's regional action level (i.e., regional action level).
     Therefore impacts at this site would not occur.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not create a significant hazard to the public or the
     environment associated with the handling of hazardous materials. The use of typical materials
     associated with construction activities such as diesel fuels, hydraulic liquids, oils, solvents, and
     paints would be required; however, any hazardous materials used or removed during construction
     would be transported, used, and stored in accordance with State and Federal regulations regarding
     hazardous materials.

     No impacts associated with hazardous materials are anticipated during operation of the new high
     school. Ninyo & Moore did detect OCP DDE in their soil samples from the proposed site; however, a
     human health screening evaluation estimated that the risk from DDE in soil was considered less
     than significant. Also, Ninyo & Moore identified concentrations of arsenic at or above the regional
     screening level at 3 feet bgs on the site; however, because the impacted area is limited in nature and
     is not present in the top 2 feet of surface soil, which serves as a protective cap, it is not considered to

     present a significant health risk to student, staff, or the public. Mitigation measures have been
     identified to ensure that removal of soil during construction does not result in significant hazards.

     The four relocatable/portable buildings that are scheduled to be removed from the high school site
     may contain ACM and/or LBP. If hazardous materials are found to be present prior to building
     demolition, the District will complete the abatement as needed before removing these buildings
     from their existing location. This represents a significant, but mitigable impact. Mitigation measures
     to reduce impacts to less-than-significant levels are provided below.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Development of the new joint-use playfields site could potentially create a significant hazard to the
     public or the environment associated with hazardous materials. The use of typical materials during
     construction (such as diesel fuels, hydraulic liquids, oils, solvents, and paints) would be transported,
     used, removed, and stored in accordance with State and Federal regulations regarding hazardous
     materials; however, as discussed above, hazardous material-impacted areas have been identified on
     the site. Based on review by Ninyo & Moore in accordance with CCR Title 5 requirements, the
     findings for these areas are discussed below.

     Properties of potential environmental concern were not noted adjacent to or within approximately
     2,000 feet of the site, and the site is not considered a "hazardous waste property" or a "border zone
     property," as defined by Section 25221 of the California Health and Safety Code, or a current or
     former "hazardous waste disposal site" or a "solid waste disposal site," in accordance with Section
     17213 of the California Education Code. The site may be considered a "hazardous substance release
     site" as result of the unauthorized release (UAR) of heating/fuel oil. However, the UAR was closed
     under regulatory oversight of the DEH after removal of the impacted soil, and no restrictions were
     placed on the closure regarding further use or development of the site as a school. Also, as discussed
     below, areas of arsenic-impacted soil are proposed to be removed and/or capped with material that
     does not contain elevated arsenic concentrations.

     Soil samples collected at the site by Ninyo & More contained arsenic concentrations that equaled the
     regional action level at 2 feet bgs, and arsenic concentrations above the regional action level were
     found at a depth greater than 2 feet bgs. However, the areas of arsenic-impacted soil are limited in
     nature, and the top 2 feet of soil, which includes the arsenic-impacted soil areas, will be removed
     from the site and backfilled with imported soil during construction of the joint-use field. After soil
     removal and backfilling is complete, the soil sample with an arsenic concentration above the
     regional action level at a depth of greater than 2 feet bgs will be overlain by 2 feet of soil that does
     not contain arsenic at or above the regional action level, which will serve as a protective cap.
     Because soils outside of these arsenic-impacted areas do not present a significant health risk to
     students, staff, or the public, after the soil removal and backfilling is completed in the construction
     area, the remaining arsenic impacts in the area would not present a significant health risk impact.

     Lastly, OCP DDE and gamma chlordane were detected in onsite soil samples. However, a human
     health screening evaluation estimated that the health risk from DDE and gamma-chlordane in the
     soil was considered less than significant. Although the soil at the site does not present a significant
     health risk to students, staff, or the public, the OCPs DDE and gamma-chlordane that were detected
     in the soil would likely require special handling and disposal. This represents a significant, but
     mitigable impact. In May 2013, as a precautionary measure, the District installed fencing around an
     area within the existing fields to restrict access. The access restriction is temporary and will be

     stopped after soil is removed as a part of future improvements to the field. Mitigation measures to
     reduce impacts to less-than-significant levels are provided below.

     Mitigation Measures

     To mitigate the potential impact, the District will implement a Community Health and Safety Plan
     (CHSP), Soil Management Plan (SMP), and site-specific Health and Safety Plan (HASP). These plans
     will be prepared for the subsurface construction activities to address petroleum-hydrocarbon-,
     arsenic-, and OCP-impacted soil. If the CHSP, SMP, and HASP are implemented during proposed
     subsurface construction activities, as needed, the impacts would be considered less than significant,
     and additional mitigation measures would not be required.

     Mitigation Measure HAZ-1: Community Health and Safety Plan (CHSP) and Site-Specific Health
     and Safety Plan (HASP)

     The CHSP and the HASP shall be prepared by the contractor or agency performing the work prior to
     construction. The contents of the site-specific plan shall be reviewed and approved by the District
     prior to starting construction. The site-specific HASP shall be prepared in accordance with Federal
     and State Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Wastes Operations and
     Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standards, 29 CCR 1910.120, and 8 CCR 5192.

     The CHSP and the HASP will be applied during construction activities for the playfield. The
     procedures identified in the CHSP that could be implemented to minimize hazards during
     construction include the following.
     ·     Evaluation of potential public exposure to hazards
     ·     Action planning to reduce airborne concentrations if found
     ·     Documentation of daily instrument readings
     ·     Implementation of administrative and engineering control methods (e.g., reduce public access;
           prevent or minimize fugitive vapors, odors, and dust; and reduce noise and other physical
           hazards)
     ·     Implementation of site security
     ·     Daily backfill (when feasible) or fencing off of open excavations
     ·     Use of metal, water-tight roll-off bins and multiple liners during temporary storage of stockpiled
           materials
     ·     Onsite vehicle traffic tracking
     ·     Implementation of BMPs regarding hazardous materials
     ·     Emergency planning in case of accidental or unauthorized release
     ·     Providing Public Notice and Proposition 65 Warning required under Section 25249.6 of the
           State of California Health and Safety Code

     The procedures identified in the HASP that could be implemented to minimize hazards during
     construction include the following.

     ·     Identify potential chemicals that may be encountered during subsurface construction activities
           at the site
     ·     Provide guidelines for use of personal protective equipment based on site-specific conditions
     ·     Provide location and directions to the nearest hospital
     ·     Develop contingency plans in general accordance with the Federal OSHA HAZWOPER Standard
           (29 CFR 1910.120) and 8 CCR 5192

     Mitigation Measure HAZ-2: Soil Management Plan (SMP)

     The objective of the SMP is to assist construction workers at the project site with notifications of the
     excavation, monitoring, segregation, characterization, handling, and reuse and/or disposal (as
     appropriate) of wastes that may be encountered during earthwork activities. The SMP's procedures
     that could be implemented during construction to minimize hazards are as follows.
     ·     Periodic site inspections
     ·     Notification for disturbance of subsurface materials
     ·     Segregation of excavated materials that are contaminated, potentially contaminated, or clean
           soils/materials per Environmental Professional guidance
     ·     Determination of soils suitable for possible on- or offsite reuse
     ·     Stockpile management (includes implementation of BMPs and odor/vapor control measures)
     ·     Waste characterization (involves stockpile sampling)
     ·     Management of contaminated soil or waste transport and disposal
     ·     Precautions in the event of encountering unknown hazardous substance
     ·     Documentation of contaminated soils or wastes if encountered

     Mitigation Measure HAZ-3: Regulatory Requirements for Structures

     For projects where buildings, structures, and/or paved surface areas are to be demolished, the
     contract shall include specifications for abatement and/or removal of ACM and LBP. The District
     shall be responsible for any for abatement and/or removal of ACM and LBP associated with
     demolition of any structures associated with construction of the high school. The contract
     specifications shall include the applicable Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements for the
     proper removal and disposal of ACM and LBP.

     Mitigation Measure HAZ-4: DTSC Reporting Requirements

     If future modernization/development activities require DTSC approval, an updated Phase I ESA

     with any applicable rules and regulations as they pertain to airports and airport safety, and no
     impacts would result with implementation of the school improvements.

     New High School

     The new high school would not be located within 2 miles of a public or private airport facility. The
     closest airport to the site, the San Diego International Airport, is located about 6.5 miles to the
     northwest of the proposed site. Additionally, there are no private airstrips within the vicinity.
     Therefore, this Project element would not conflict with any applicable airport safety rules and
     regulations, and no impacts would result.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     The proposed joint-use playfields site would not be located within 2 miles of a public or private
     airport facility. The closest airport to the site is located about 6.5 miles to the northwest, and no
     private airstrips are within the vicinity. Therefore, no impacts would result.

VIII. g) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Improvements to the community school would not impair or physically interfere with an emergency
     response plan. The San Diego Fire-Rescue Department oversees emergency management services,
     which include responses to earthquakes, floods, or terrorist acts. Also, the District maintains a
     Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan (NHMP) that addresses multiple hazards, including earthquakes,
     floods, wildfire, landslides, and tsunamis. All school improvement activities would occur within the
     existing school site, and access for emergency vehicles (provided along Skyline Drive and 61st Street)
     would not be restricted. After the school improvements are implemented, emergency access to the
     site would remain similar to existing conditions. Therefore, implementation of this Project element
     would not result in impacts on emergency access.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not impair or physically interfere with an emergency
     response plan. Both the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department and District oversee emergency
     response planning that pertains to the site. During construction, access for emergency vehicles
     (provided along Skyline Drive) would not be restricted. After implementation of the new school,
     emergency access to the site would connect to the existing O'Farrell Community School's driveway
     that links to Skyline Drive. Therefore, implementation of this Project element would not result in
     impacts on emergency access.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not impair or physically interfere with an
     emergency response plan. During construction, access for emergency vehicles (provided along

VIII. h) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Improvements to the community school would not expose people or structures to potential wildfire
     hazards. The site is in a region known to have high risk associated with wildfires; however, the site
     itself is located within a densely urbanized area far from areas identified as having wildland fire
     hazards. As identified by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's (CAL FIRE's)
     Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) Map, the site is listed as a Non-VHFHSZ (CAL FIRE
     2009). Therefore, implementation of this Project element would not result in a significant hazards
     risk associated with wildfires, and impacts would be less than significant.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not expose people or structures to potential wildfire
     hazards. Although the site is in a region that is prone to wildfire, the site itself is completely
     surrounded by a dense urban environment and is identified by CAL FIRE as a Non-VHFHSZ, or
     non-fire hazard area (CAL FIRE 2009). Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields would not involve structures that would present
     potential wildfire hazards. Therefore, no impacts associated with this issue would occur.

IX. a, e, & f) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not violate any water quality standards or waste
     discharge requirements or create runoff water that would exceed the capacity of the stormwater
     drainage system. Short-term water quality impacts associated with temporary increased erosion
     could occur during construction activities; however, the District would implement BMPs, required
     as part of the local SWPPP, to minimize erosion effects and ensure that significant water quality
     impacts during construction would not occur. Also, implementation of the school improvements
     would result in similar hard structure areas and other impervious surfaces as the existing site.
     Therefore, runoff flow velocity is not anticipated to change and would continue to be accommodated
     by the existing storm drain system. Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would be less than
     significant.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not violate any water quality standards or waste
     discharge requirements or create runoff water that would exceed the capacity of the stormwater
     drainage system. Temporary water quality impacts associated with increased erosion could occur
     during construction activities; however, the District would implement BMPs, required as part of the
     local SWPPP, to minimize erosion effects and ensure that significant water quality impacts during
     construction would not occur. Also, when compared to the existing site, development of the school
     would result in an increase of hard structure areas and other impervious surfaces that would
     increase urban runoff and could potentially degrade surface water quality. However, plans for the
     new school involve implementation of landscaped areas with stormwater retention ponds that
     would limit the opportunity for increased stormwater runoff. Thus, adherence to the local water
     quality controls and implementation of stormwater retention ponds would ensure that impacts
     associated with these issues would not be significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not violate any water quality standards or
     waste discharge requirements or create runoff water that would exceed the capacity of the
     stormwater drainage system. During construction, any short-term water quality impacts that could
     occur would be minimized by the implementation of BMPs, required as part of the local SWPPP, to
     ensure that temporary water quality impacts would be less than significant. Also, the site would be
     converted to pervious surfaces with implementation of turf fields. Therefore, impacts associated
     with this issue would be less than significant.

IX. b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Impacts on groundwater with implementation of the school improvements would not occur. The site
     would continue to be served by the City of San Diego, Water Utilities Department, and no
     groundwater would be used by the existing school campus. Also, the site is currently developed and,
     therefore, would not interfere substantially with groundwater recharge. Consequently, there would
     be no impact with implementation of this Project element.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would result in less-than-significant impacts on groundwater.
     The site would be served by the City of San Diego, Water Utilities Department, and no groundwater
     would be used by the new school campus. Existing conditions of the site include an open lot where
     the development of the new school would result in an increase of hard structure areas and other
     impervious surfaces that could interfere with groundwater recharge. However, plans for the new
     school involve implementation of landscaped areas with stormwater retention ponds that would
     allow water to infiltrate the site. Therefore, impacts on groundwater would be less than significant
     with implementation of this Project element.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in significant impacts on
     groundwater. Water for the site (assumed for irrigation and drinking fountains) would be provided
     by the City of San Diego, and no groundwater would be used. Additionally, development of the
     2-acre site would include pervious turf areas that would not interfere with groundwater recharge.
     Therefore, impacts on groundwater with implementation of this Project element would be less than
     significant.

IX. c & d) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not substantially alter the site's existing
     drainage pattern in a manner that would result in substantial erosion or flooding. The site has been
     previously graded and developed and, therefore, would be minimally disturbed by the proposed
     construction activities. As discussed in Section IX. a, e, & f, the District would implement BMPs,
     required as part of the local SWPPP, to minimize erosion impacts during construction. Also, there
     are no natural streams or rivers within the site's vicinity that would be affected by the proposed
     improvements. Therefore, impacts associated with erosion or flooding would be less than
     significant.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not substantially alter the site's existing drainage pattern
     in a manner that would result in substantial erosion or flooding. As discussed in Section IX. a, e, & f,
     the District would implement BMPs, required as part of the local SWPPP, to minimize erosion
     impacts during construction. Also, implementation of the new high school would include landscaped
     areas with stormwater retention ponds, and, as a result, surface runoff would not increase that
     could increase erosion potential. Lastly, there are no natural streams or rivers within the site's
     vicinity that would be affected by the proposed activities. Therefore, impacts associated with these
     issues would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not substantially alter the site's existing
     drainage pattern in a manner that would result in substantial erosion or flooding. The existing site is
     relatively flat, and erosion and flooding from construction activities are not anticipated. Also, the site
     would be converted to pervious surfaces with implementation of turf fields. Therefore, impacts
     associated with these issues would be less than significant.

     Community School Improvements/New Joint-Use Playfields

     The school improvements and implementation of the new joint-use playfields would not place
     housing or structures within a 100-year flood hazard area, as the site is not located within a flood
     hazard area; expose people or structures to significant risks involving flooding as a result of the
     failure of a levee or dam, as there are no dams or levees in the vicinity of the site; or result in impacts
     involving inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow, as the site is inland and located at least 3 miles
     from any major water body. Therefore, there would be no impact associated with these issues.

X. a & b) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not divide an established community or conflict
     with any applicable land use plan. This Project element consists of the modernization of an existing
     school supported by bond funds under Prop S for the repair and renovation of District school
     facilities. All improvements would occur within the District's property, which has been dedicated to
     school uses since its construction in 1960. Therefore, these activities would not physically divide an
     established community or conflict with any applicable land use plan. Impacts would not occur.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not divide an established community or conflict with
     any applicable land use plan. This Project element consists of the development of a new school on a
     vacant portion of a District-owned lot adjacent to the existing O'Farrell Community School. This
     Project element would represent an extension of current uses within the District's property, and,
     therefore, implementation would not result in impacts on an established community or conflict with
     any applicable land use plan.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the joint-use playfields site would not divide an established community or
     conflict with any applicable land use plan. The site is currently a vacant dirt lot used for athletic
     activities adjacent to the existing O'Farrell Community School within the District's property.
     Development of this Project element on the site would improve its condition by providing a new
     interactive and inviting facility to be shared with the community. Thus, impacts on an established
     community would not occur, and no conflicts with an applicable land use plan are anticipated.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not conflict with any applicable habitat or
     natural community conservation plan. The site is currently developed as a community school
     campus within a highly urbanized area. No sensitive habitat exists within or surrounding the
     property as existing development completely surrounds the site. Further, no habitat conservation
     plans or natural community conservation plans are in place or applicable to the Project site or
     vicinity. Therefore, there would be no impact.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not conflict with any applicable habitat or natural
     community conservation plan. The site is an empty cleared lot that is completely surrounded by
     development. No sensitive habitats exist within or surrounding the site, and no habitat conservation
     plans or natural community conservation plans are in place or applicable to the Project site or
     vicinity. Therefore, there would be no impact.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not conflict with any applicable habitat or
     natural community conservation plan. The site consists of an empty dirt lot that is completely
     devoid of vegetation or other biological resources. Also, there are no sensitive biological resources
     or vegetation communities within the site's vicinity. Lastly, no habitat conservation plans or natural
     community conservation plans are in place or applicable to the Project site or vicinity. Therefore,
     there would be no impact.

     Methodology

     Potentially significant noise impacts from implementation of the proposed Project activities were
     evaluated by ICF. The analysis is summarized in a Noise Impact Assessment Memorandum prepared
     by ICF, which is included as Appendix C to this IS/MND. This assessment evaluates the temporary
     noise increase associated with construction activities, long-term operational noise generated by
     onsite activities and by sound-generating equipment (e.g., HVAC), and traffic noise associated with
     project-related traffic increase. The discussion below presents the existing ambient noise
     environment and findings of noise impacts from the assessment.

     Environmental Setting

     The existing ambient noise environment in the vicinity of the three Project elements is characteristic
     of a suburban environment with local vehicle traffic being the dominant noise source. To generally
     quantify existing ambient noise levels in this area, four 15-minute short-term measurements were
     conducted on April 19, 2013, at various locations around the Project element sites. Noise monitoring
     data and a figure showing the short-term noise measurement sites are included in Appendix C.
     Table 5 below summarizes the results of those noise measurements. The noise environment in the

       area consists of noise from traffic along Skyline Drive, 61st Street, and local residential streets. Other
       noise sources in the vicinity are typical of residential land uses, such as cars starting up, barking
       dogs, and occasional activities such as landscape maintenance. The ambient noise level in the area is
       about 52 dBA Leq4 at the residential areas on local residential streets and 59­60 dBA Leq at the
       residential area along Skyline Drive and 61st Street.

       Impact Analysis

       Community School Improvements

       Construction and operation of the school improvements are not expected to result in significant
       noise impacts. During construction, activities would be limited to 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. to comply
       with the City of San Diego's noise ordinance. The construction activities for the modernization
       improvements are expected to be small in scale due to use of smaller equipment and short duration
       of use, and most of the activities would be contained within the buildings inside the school property.
       Therefore, noise generated by the modernization improvements is not expected to result in
       significant noise impacts at noise-sensitive land uses.

       The modernization improvements would include the installation of HVAC units for the existing
       buildings at the O'Farrell school campus. The HVAC units are expected to be installed either on the
       roof or adjacent to the buildings. HVAC units are typically considered noise-generating sources and
       could potentially cause noise concerns at noise-sensitive uses adjacent to the equipment. However,
       the nearest school buildings are approximately 120 feet from the closest residences on the west side
       of 61st Street. Because traffic on 61st Street is the dominant noise source at the residences, the HVAC
       units installed at these buildings would not generate noise that would be audible to nearby
       residences. Therefore, the noise impact associated with the operation of HVAC units would be less
       than significant.

       New High School

       Construction Noise

       Construction of the new facilities would require the use of heavy equipment that could temporarily
       increase noise levels at properties near the work areas. Noise from construction equipment would

     likely be audible at noise-sensitive land uses surrounding the work site, the closest of which are to
     the north of the site. Table 6 presents typical noise levels for various types of construction
     equipment that would be used for the construction of new high school facilities. To evaluate the
     construction noise impacts at adjacent noise-sensitive land uses, construction equipment that would
     result in the highest noise level is used to estimate the noise levels at various distances from the
     construction sites, as shown in Table 6.

     During construction of the new facilities, the estimated construction noise level would be as high as
     83 dBA Leq at nearest single-family residences on Kimmy Court to the north of proposed school site.
     Although the actual noise levels could be lower than estimated noise levels, the construction noise
     would exceed the City's noise limit of 75 dBA Leq. Therefore, when the construction activities occur
     near the residential areas, the construction noise impact at the single-family residences would be
     significant, and Mitigation Measure NOI-1 (presented below) would be required.

     Noise from HVAC Equipment

     This Project element would include modular buildings with HVAC units, and HVAC units would be
     installed in the new classroom, gym, and administration buildings at the high school campus. The
     new classroom buildings would be approximately 220 feet from the closest residences on the north
     side of the proposed school. Because the buildings are close to the residences, noise generated by
     the HVAC units at the buildings is expected to be lower than the ambient noise level (52 dBA at ST2).
     Therefore, the noise impact associated with the operation of HVAC units would be less than
     significant.

     Noise from High School Generated Traffic

     With implementation of this Project element, potential noise impacts were assumed associated with
     increased traffic generated by the new school. Because there is no City ordinance and regulation that
     would be applicable to traffic noise generated by increased Project vehicle trips, traffic noise
     impacts were evaluated using a threshold of substantial noise increase of 3 dBA, which is generally
     considered to be the threshold of a perceptible change.

     Traffic generated by the new high school would mostly travel on Skyline Drive to and from the
     school. Therefore, noise-sensitive land uses along Skyline Drive could be affected by the increase in

      traffic noise caused by this Project element. Table 7 summarizes the increase in traffic noise levels
      (Leq) during peak hours along Skyline Drive as a result of Project-generated traffic. Traffic noise
      levels (Leq) were estimated based on the PM peak traffic volumes predicted to occur. The
      calculation of traffic noise levels is included in Appendix C.

      As shown in Table 7, traffic noise is expected to increase by less than 3 dBA as a result of the Project
      element under both existing and cumulative conditions. 2035 Cumulative plus Project-generated
      traffic noise levels along Project-access streets are also expected to increase by less than 3 dBA
      compared to the existing (no Project) condition. Therefore, the Project would not result in an
      increase in traffic noise that is greater than 3 dBA under any of the conditions evaluated. The traffic
      noise impact would be less than significant.

      Exterior Noise Levels at High School

      Lastly, this Project element would be required to meet the interior noise standard of 45 dBA CNEL5
      for the new classroom buildings of the new high school because the buildings could potentially be
      exposed to exterior traffic noise levels in excess of 60 dBA. The existing noise level at this site is just
      under 60 dBA, and with the cumulative traffic growth on Skyline Drive, the exterior traffic noise
      level at the building is estimated to be approximately 61 dBA. Therefore, building materials would
      need to be designed to provide an exterior-to-interior sound reduction of 16 dBA for classrooms
      facing the street. Normal construction materials and techniques will typically provide a minimum
      reduction of 15 dB in exterior-to-interior sound levels if there are no openings such as windows,
      doors, or ventilation ports on the sides of the buildings that are exposed to traffic noise. Therefore,
      the classrooms facing Skyline Drive could potentially experience interior noise levels exceeding the
      noise standards of 45 dBA CNEL. This noise impact at the buildings is therefore potentially
      significant, and Mitigation Measure NOI-2 (below) would be required.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Construction of the new joint-use playfields site could result in significant noise impacts.
     Construction of the new joint-use turf playfield would require the use of heavy equipment that could
     temporarily increase noise levels at properties near the work areas. The estimated construction
     noise level would be as high as 79 dBA Leq at nearest single-family residences on Benson Avenue to
     the northwest of the playfields site, which exceeds the City's noise limit of 75 dBA Leq. Therefore,
     when construction activities occur near the residential areas, the construction noise impact at the
     single-family residences would be significant, and Mitigation Measure NOI-1 (below) would be
     required.

     During operation, the activities at the softball field could generate elevated noise levels during the
     day from sporting events and games. Noise sources associated with these activities generally consist
     of occasional shouting and cheering of the participants and observers. The average noise levels
     generated during games are approximately 60 dBA Leq at a distance of 100 feet from the effective
     noise center of the playing fields. The reported noise levels were based on field data collected at
     various softball and soccer venues and do not include sound amplification equipment. The nearest
     single-family residences are located 300 feet northwest of the proposed playfields, which would
     result in a noise level of 50 dBA Leq. This estimated noise level is lower than the existing ambient
     noise level (52­60 dBA Leq) and would not exceed the City noise limit of 50 dBA Leq for the hours
     between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Therefore, the activities at the new turf playfields would not result in
     significant noise impacts at single-family residences adjacent to the joint-use playfields site. Impacts
     would be less than significant.

     Mitigation Measures

     The mitigation measures listed below would reduce noise impacts to less-than-significant levels.

     Mitigation Measure NOI-1: Construction Site Noise Control Measures

     The District shall require all contractors to adhere to the following noise abatement measures. The
     District shall be responsible for ensuring implementation.
     ·     Comply with manufacturers' muffler requirements on all construction equipment engines.
     ·     Turn off construction equipment when not in use, where applicable.
     ·     Locate stationary equipment as far as practical from receiving properties.
     ·     Use temporary sound barriers or sound curtains6 around loud stationary equipment when the
           construction activity would generate noise in excess of 75 dBA Leq over any 1-hour period at
           impacted residences if the other noise reduction methods are not effective or possible to resolve
           a noise complaint.
     ·     Provide advance written notification of construction activities to residences around the
           construction site. Notification will include a brief overview of the proposed construction activity
           and its purpose and schedule. It also will include the name and contact information of the
           Project manager or representative responsible for resolving any noise concerns.

     Mitigation Measure NOI-2: Site-specific Building Acoustical Analysis and Noise Control
     Treatments Where Required

     A qualified acoustical consultant shall review final site plans, building elevations, and floor plans
     prior to construction to calculate expected interior noise levels as required by State noise
     regulations. Project-specific acoustical analyses are required by the California Building Code to
     confirm that the design results in interior noise levels being reduced to 45 dBA CNEL or lower. The
     specific determination of what noise insulation treatments are necessary will be completed on a
     unit-by-unit basis. Results of the analysis, including the description of the necessary noise control
     treatments, shall be submitted to the District along with the building plans, and shall be approved
     prior to issuance of a building permit.

     Special building techniques (e.g., sound-rated windows and building façade treatments) shall be
     implemented as recommended by the qualified acoustical consultant to maintain interior noise
     levels at or below acceptable levels. These treatments may include, but are not limited to, sound-
     rated windows and doors, sound-rated wall constructions, acoustical caulking, and protected
     ventilation openings. Preliminary calculations indicate that classrooms nearest to and facing Skyline
     Drive with direct line-of-sight to the roadway will require sound-rated windows and doors to assure
     that the interior average noise level guidelines are met.

XII. b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The school improvements would not result in significant groundborne vibration impacts. During
     construction, heavy construction equipment or high-impact equipment such as pile drivers would
     not be used. Vibration from non-impact construction activities and truck traffic is typically below
     the threshold of perception when the activity is more than about 50 feet from the noise-sensitive
     land uses. The nearest single-family residences are more than 50 feet from the construction site.
     During operation of this Project element, no vibration impacts are expected because uses would be
     similar to the existing activities conducted within the existing site. Therefore, impacts associated
     with this issue would be less than significant.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not result in significant groundborne vibration impacts.
     Heavy construction equipment or high-impact equipment such as pile drivers would not be used.
     Vibration from non-impact construction activities and truck traffic is typically below the threshold
     of perception when the activity is more than about 50 feet from the noise-sensitive land uses. The
     nearest single-family residences are more than 50 feet from the site. During operation of this Project
     element, no vibration impacts are expected because uses would not involve the use of heavy
     machinery or vibration-inducing equipment. Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would be
     less than significant.

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in significant groundborne
     vibration impacts. Heavy construction equipment or high-impact equipment such as pile drivers
     would not be used. Vibration from non-impact construction activities and truck traffic is typically

     The nearest airport to the existing school campus is the San Diego International Airport, located
     approximately 7.5 miles to the northwest. There is no other public airport or private airstrip located
     within the vicinity of the site. This Project element would not expose the facility or students to

     Community School Improvements

     Improvements to the community school would not impact population or housing in the area. The
     Project site is within the District's property in a built-out urbanized community. The proposed
     activities do not include new homes or businesses, and would not displace any housing units or
     people. Proposed activities would improve the existing school property and would not result in the
     extension of public roads or other infrastructure. Therefore, impacts associated with these issues
     would not occur.

     New High School

     Construction of the new high school would not impact population or housing in the area. The new
     school would accommodate the existing population of the community and would not include new
     homes or businesses. Further, this Project element would not displace any housing units or people

XIV. a) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The modernization of the existing school site would not result in substantial adverse physical
     impacts on public services. The school improvements would not increase the capacity or operations
     of the existing school; thus, no additional public services would be required. Therefore, there would
     be no impacts on public services.

     New High School

     The addition of the new high school would not place a significant demand on emergency services
     considering the minimal addition of buildings and the location adjacent to an existing school where
     those services are already adequately provided. Also, the new high school would provide adequate
     access to the site for emergency services. Therefore, impacts on public services would be less than
     significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in substantial adverse physical
     impacts on public services. This Project element does not include any features that would increase
     the capacity or operations of the property. Therefore, there would be no impacts on public services.

 Would the project:
 a. Increase the use of existing neighborhood and
    regional parks or other recreational facilities
    such that substantial physical deterioration of
    the facility would occur or be accelerated?
 b. Include recreational facilities or require the
    construction or expansion of recreational
    facilities that might have an adverse physical
    effect on the environment?


XV. a & b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not result in an impact on recreational facilities.
     This Project element would not increase the capacity of the existing property, which could generate
     additional demand for recreational uses or require the provision of new facilities. Therefore,
     impacts would not occur.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not result in a significant impact on recreational
     facilities. Recreational demand for new students attending the high school would be accommodated
     by the gymnasium proposed for the school and the joint-use playfields site that is proposed on the
     property. Therefore, impacts on recreational facilities would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in impacts on recreational
     facilities. This Project element itself is a 2-acre recreational facility comprising turf playfields that
     would be jointly used between the District and the City of San Diego. Implementation of the
     recreational facility would improve the recreational opportunities provided at the property and
     reduce the recreational demand in the community. Therefore, impacts on recreational facilities with
     implementation of this Project element would not occur.

XVI. a & b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not cause a significant increase in existing traffic
     or conflict with an applicable traffic plan. During construction, this Project element would include
     minor construction activities that would result in a small increase in traffic related to construction
     traffic trips. However, this increase would be minimal and temporary. Traffic from short-term
     construction activities would also not conflict with standards set forth in SANDAG's County
     Congestion Management Program because there would be no change in Level of Service (LOS), and
     substantial effects on designated roadways would not occur. Furthermore, modernization of the
     school would not increase operation or student capacity compared to existing conditions and,

     therefore, would not result in an increase in existing traffic. Consequently, impacts associated with
     these issues would be less than significant.

     New High School

     A Traffic Impact Study was prepared by KOA Corporation (Appendix D) to analyze potential traffic
     impacts with implementation of the new high school. The study area for this focused traffic impact
     analysis includes those locations that are expected to be affected by this Project element. The scope
     of the study area is based on the City of San Diego Guidelines and was developed through a review of
     ongoing traffic studies and a working knowledge of the local transportation system. The specific
     study area includes two roadway segments and seven intersections, as listed below.

     Roadway Segments:
     ·     Skyline Drive between Valencia Parkway and Woodman Street
     ·     61st Street between Imperial Avenue and Division Street

     Intersections:
     ·     Imperial Avenue and 61st Street
     ·     61st Street and Benson Avenue
     ·     Skyline Drive and Valencia Parkway
     ·     Skyline Drive and 61st Street
     ·     Skyline Drive and Omeara Street
     ·     Skyline Drive and Woodman Street
     ·     Skyline Drive and Division Street

     The traffic study provides the existing conditions of the study area's roadway network and analyzes
     the conditions at near-term and horizon year (representative traffic conditions in 2035) for traffic
     volumes and the circulation network with and without the addition of Project-generated traffic. The
     trip generation for this Project element is 864 daily trips per unit (see Appendix D). Table 8 shows
     the findings of the existing, near-term, and horizon year roadway segment conditions with and
     without this Project element, and Table 9 shows the findings associated with the existing, near-term,
     and horizon year intersection conditions with and without this Project element.

     Skyline Drive, which runs east/west connects Woodman Street to the east and Valencia Parkway to
     the west. Both Woodman Street and Valencia Parkway run north/south and connect with Imperial
     Avenue to the north and Division Street to the south. Skyline Drive functions as a 2-Collector
     between Valencia Parkway and 61st Street, and between Omeara Street and Woodman Street.
     Skyline functions as a 4-Collector between 61st Street and Omeara Street, and has a two-way left
     turn lane (TWLTL) throughout the length of the study segment. Skyline Drive has bike lanes and
     sidewalks, allows street parking, and serves as a bus route with stops at key locations. The posted
     speed limit on the street is 35 mph. This roadway provides driveway access to adjacent residential
     land uses.

     The San Diego Unified School District and the City of San Diego have cooperated over the last several
     years to deliver substantial streetscape, lighting, and selected signalized intersection and other

       updates to Skyline Drive in the vicinity of the project. These improvements are now virtually
       complete except for some signal timing revisions being finalized by the City. These are regarded as
       safety, aesthetic, and traffic-calming improvements that are making the mobility for all users of the
       corridor better--from pedestrians and bicyclists to motorists.

     As is shown in the above tables, none of the roadway segments or intersections would exceed any
     LOS thresholds at either intersections or road segments that would lead to transportation impacts.
     In fact, recent traffic improvements along Skyline Drive have improved LOS and have created
     additional capacity for increased traffic activity. Implementation of the new high school would not
     introduce new traffic volumes that would exceed LOS standards from any plans, ordinances, or
     policies. Also, any changes in traffic resulting from implementation of this Project element would not
     conflict with standards set forth in SANDAG's County Congestion Management Program. Therefore,
     impacts associated with these issues would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the joint-use playfields would not cause a significant increase in existing traffic or
     conflict with an applicable traffic plan because the proposed improvements would be to a field
     currently used for athletic activities. During construction, this Project element would include minor
     construction activities that would result in a small increase in traffic related to construction traffic
     trips. However, this increase would be minimal and temporary, and would not conflict with
     standards set forth in SANDAG's County Congestion Management Program because there would be
     no change in LOS, and substantial long-term effects on designated roadways would not occur.
     Therefore, impacts associated with these issues would be less than significant.

XVI. c ­ f) No Impact.

     Community School Improvements/New Joint-Use Playfields

     The school improvements and new joint-use playfields would involve improvements to existing
     facilities and, therefore, would not increase hazards due to design features; result in inadequate
     emergency access; or conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit,
     bicycle, or pedestrian facilities. In addition, the proposed improvements to the school would not
     change air traffic patterns. Therefore, this Project element would have no impacts associated with
     these issues.

     New High School

     Implementation of the new high school would not increase hazards due to design features or
     changing air traffic patterns; nor would it conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs
     regarding public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities. This Project element would be accessed
     through the existing driveway on Skyline Drive. The driveway, which presently exists to serve the
     existing elementary school campus, would function as a common entrance/exit. The proposed
     parking lot of the new high school would be connected to the northeast corner of the existing
     parking lot with a short access street. Skyline Drive connects Woodman Street and Valencia
     Parkway, which provide major access to the neighboring communities. In addition, 61st Street, which
     also connects Imperial Avenue and Division Street, provides access to the existing school. After
     implementation of the new high school, emergency access to the site would connect to the existing
     O'Farrell Community School's driveway that links to Skyline Drive. Therefore, this Project element
     would have no impacts associated with these issues.

     The preferred passenger loading activity would occur on Skyline Drive. Currently the elementary
     school has approximately 500 feet of passenger loading zone on the north side of Skyline Drive
     between 61st Street and the east entry driveway to the school parking lot. The space allows for
     approximately 17 cars to position at a time for passenger drop-off and pick-up.

     In addition to the on-street drop-off and pick-up, the project may allow for onsite drop-off and pick-
     up. As such, parents could use the main access point from the parking lot on Skyline Drive to enter
     and exit the site and conduct this activity.

     To allow for adequate pedestrian access to the campus an accessible path of travel will be provided
     from Skyline Drive directly to the high school. The pathway will be designed to comply with the
     requirements of the ADA. The pathway will be provided from the edge of the Skyline Drive public
     right-of-way to the campus.

XVII. a ­ e) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     Implementation of the school improvements would not result in impacts on water, wastewater, or
     stormwater utilities. Currently, these utilities provide adequate supply to serve the existing school,
     and implementation of the school improvements would not increase the capacity of the existing
     property, which could generate additional demand for these utilities or require the provision of new
     facilities. Because the need for these utilities would not change from existing conditions as a result
     of the school improvements, impacts would not occur.

     New High School

     The addition of the new high school would not place a significant demand on water, wastewater, or
     stormwater utilities considering the minimal addition of buildings and the location near an existing
     school where those utility services are already adequately provided. Additionally, plans for the new
     school would add in new stormwater retention features per the local Standard Urban Stormwater

     Mitigation Plan (SUSMP) and City Stormwater Standards that would limit increased stormwater
     runoff to the existing storm drain system. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in significant impacts on water,
     wastewater, or stormwater utilities. This Project element does not include any features that would
     increase the capacity or operations of the property necessitating the need for additional services.
     Also, BMPs would be incorporated throughout development of the site as required by the local
     SUSMP and City Stormwater Standards. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

XVII. f & g) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     The school improvements would not result in significant impacts on solid waste services. The
     existing school is currently served by a permitted landfill capable of accommodating project waste
     and would continue to comply with all applicable regulations related to solid waste. During
     construction, non-recyclable solid waste would be taken to a permitted landfill with sufficient
     capacity to accommodate disposal needs. During operation, this Project element would not increase
     the capacity or operations of the existing school; thus, no additional waste services would be
     required. Therefore, impacts on solid waste services would be less than significant.

     New High School

     Implementation and operation of the new high school would not result in significant impacts on
     solid waste services. During construction, non-recyclable solid waste would be taken to a permitted
     landfill with sufficient capacity to accommodate disposal needs. During operation, the demand for
     solid waste service on the property is not anticipated to substantially increase considering the
     minimal addition of buildings. Also, operation of the new school would comply with all applicable
     regulations related to solid waste. Therefore, impacts associated with this issue would be less than
     significant.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use playfields site would not result in impacts on solid waste
     service. This Project element does not include features that would increase the capacity or
     operations of the property or conflict with applicable regulations related to solid waste. Therefore,
     there would be no impacts.

 a.    Does the project have the potential to degrade
       the quality of the environment, substantially
       reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species,
       cause a fish or wildlife population to drop
       below self-sustaining levels, threaten to
       eliminate a plant or animal community,
       substantially reduce the number or restrict
       the range of a rare or endangered plant or
       animal, or eliminate important examples of
       the major periods of California history or
       prehistory?
 b.    Does the project have impacts that are
       individually limited but cumulatively
       considerable? ("Cumulatively considerable"
       means that the incremental effects of a project
       are considerable when viewed in connection
       with the effects of past projects, the effects of
       other current projects, and the effects of
       probable future projects.)
 c.    Does the project have environmental effects
       that will cause substantial adverse effects on
       human beings, either directly or indirectly?


XVIII. a) No Impact.

      Community School Improvements

      As discussed in Section IV of this Environmental Checklist Form, due to the highly urbanized nature
      of the Project area, no sensitive plant or animal species, habitats, or wildlife migration corridors are
      located on or near this Project element's site. Additionally, as discussed in Section V, this Project
      element does not have the potential to eliminate important examples of major periods of California
      history or prehistory. No other aspects of this Project element would substantially degrade the
      environment.

      New High School

      As discussed in Section IV and Section V, construction and operation of the new high school would
      not degrade the quality of the environment or impact biological or known cultural resources.
      Therefore, there would be no impact with implementation of this Project element.

      New Joint-Use Playfields

      Implementation of the new joint-use fields would not degrade the quality of the environment or
      impact biological or known cultural resources. Therefore, there would be no impact.

XVIII. b) Less-than-Significant Impact.

     Community School Improvements

     As discussed in this document, all impacts associated with the proposed school improvements that
     have the potential to be significant, either directly or indirectly, would be mitigated to less-than-
     significant levels. The site is located within a built-out community, and no major development
     projects are planned in the area. Therefore, the significant-but-mitigable impacts of this Project
     element would not have an incremental contribution to a potential cumulative effect.

     New High School

     Construction and operation of the new high school would result in significant impacts that would be
     mitigated to less-than-significant levels. Because the proposed site is located within a built-out
     community and no major development projects are planned in the area, the significant-but-
     mitigable impacts of this Project element would not add appreciably to any existing or foreseeable
     future significant cumulative impact.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Implementation of the new joint-use fields would result in impacts that have the potential to be
     significant, either directly or indirectly, but would be mitigated to less-than-significant levels. No
     major development projects are planned in the area due to the built-out nature of the surrounding
     community; therefore, the significant-but-mitigable impacts of this Project element would not have
     an incremental contribution to a potential cumulative effect.

XVIII. c) Less-than-Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated.

     Community School Improvements

     As discussed in this document, all impacts associated with the proposed school improvements that
     have the potential to be significant, either directly or indirectly, would be mitigated to less-than-
     significant levels. Therefore, no substantial adverse effects on human beings with implementation of
     this Project element would occur.

     New High School

     All potentially significant impacts, either directly or indirectly, that would result from construction
     or operation of the new high school would be mitigated to less-than-significant levels. Therefore, no
     substantial adverse effects on human beings with implementation of this Project element would
     occur.

     New Joint-Use Playfields

     Any impacts associated with implementation of the new joint-use playfields site with the potential
     to be significant, either directly or indirectly, would be mitigated to less-than-significant levels.
     Therefore, no substantial adverse effects on human beings with implementation of this Project
     element would occur.

                  School Pursuant to CEQA Compliance, San Diego Unified School District



Introduction
   This cultural resources technical memorandum has been prepared by ICF for the San Diego Unified
   School District (SDUSD). SDUSD is seeking to undertake improvements to the infrastructure of
   O'Farrell Charter School in accordance with Proposition S Bond List. The proposed modernization
   would involve alterations to the built environment of the school that include:
           upgrades to classrooms and recreational facilities
           construction of a new high school adjacent to the existing O'Farrell Charter School

Regulatory Setting
   The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires public agencies to evaluate the
   implications of their project(s) on the environment and includes significant historical resources as
   part of the environment.

   According to CEQA, a project that causes a substantial adverse change in the significance of a
   historical resource or a unique archaeological resource has a significant effect on the environment
   (CEQA Guidelines 15064.5, Pub. Res. Code section 21083.2). CEQA defines a substantial adverse
   change as:

               Physical demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration of the resource or its
               immediate surroundings such that the significance of a historical resource would be
               materially impaired; or

                 Demolition or material alteration of the physical characteristics that convey the
                 resource's historical significance and justify its designation as a historical resource

    Public agencies must treat any cultural resource as significant unless the preponderance of evidence
    demonstrates that it is not historically or culturally significant (Title 14 CCR, Section 15064.5). A
    historic resource is considered significant if it meets the definition of historical resource or unique
    archaeological resource.

    The term historical resource includes, but is not limited to any object, building, structure, site, area,
    place, record, or manuscript that is historically or archaeologically significant, or is significant in the
    architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or
    cultural annals of California (Public Resource Code PRC 5020.1(j)). Historical resources may be
    designated as such through three different processes:

    1. Official designation or recognition by a local government pursuant to local ordinance or
       resolution (PRC 5020.1(k))
    2. A local survey conducted pursuant to PRC 5024.1(g)
    3. The property is listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
       (PRC 5024.1(d)(1))


    The process for identifying historical resources is typically accomplished by applying the criteria for
    listing in the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) (Title 14 CCR, Section 4852), which
    states that a historical resource must be significant at the local, state, or national level under one or
    more of the following four criteria:

    1. It is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
       California's history and cultural heritage.
    2. It is associated with the lives of persons important in our past.
    3. It embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or
       represents the work of a master or possesses high artistic values.
    4. It has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.


    To be considered a historical resource for the purposes of CEQA, the resource must also have
    integrity, which is the authenticity of a resource's physical identity evidenced by the survival of
    characteristics that existed during the resource's period of significance.

    Resources, therefore, must retain enough of their historic character or appearance to be
    recognizable as historical resources and to convey the reasons for their significance. Integrity is
    evaluated with regard to the retention of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling
    and association. It must also be judged with reference to the particular criteria under which a
    resource is eligible for listing in the CRHR (California Code of Regulations title 14, Section 4852(c)).

Summary of Efforts and Findings
    Prior to commencing field activities pursuant to the evaluation, a records search was undertaken at
    the South Coastal Information Center. No previously recorded cultural resources had been found
    within or adjacent to the O'Farrell Charter School.

    On December 12, 2012, ICF historian Timothy Yates visited the campus and recorded its buildings
    and landscape with digital photography. On December 12, 2012, Dr. Yates also researched the
    construction of the school using original plans on file at the Architectural Archives of the SDUSD
    Maintenance and Operations Center. Additional research on the historic context of San Diego School
    development was performed on-line, at the San Diego History Center, and at the Main Branch of the
    San Diego Public Library.

    ICF International recommends that O'Farrell Charter School be considered ineligible for listing on
    the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR), and that it not be considered a historical
    resource for the purposes of CEQA. Consequently, the proposed modernization of the school in
    association with Proposition S does not appear to have the potential to result in substantial adverse
    effects to a historical resource.

    The school is described and formally evaluated for CRHR eligibility below. Attachment 1 of this
    report is a historic context statement on modern San Diego public school development that has
    informed the evaluation of O'Farrell. Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) Forms 523A and
    523B for the school are attached to this memorandum (Attachment 2).

    While Dr. Yates concentrated his efforts on the above ground resources, Martin Rosen, RPA,
    researched the potential for below ground resources within the school property. Mr. Rosen's
    discussion follows the school evaluation below.

O'Farrell Charter School Description
    O'Farrell Charter School is located at 6130 Skyline Drive, in a suburban neighborhood near the
    Encanto and Valencia Park areas of southeastern San Diego. The campus consists of nine original
    buildings dating to 1960, a library addition, and numerous portable classrooms. The main entrance
    to the school is located west of the main parking lot along Skyline Drive, between the Administration
    Building and the Auditorium. Photographs of the school referenced in parentheses in this
    description can be consulted below beginning on page 7. A site map of the campus is included below
    on page 6.

    The largest and most boldly designed building on the O'Farrell campus is the school's late mid-
    century modern Auditorium, situated at the corner of Skyline Drive and 61st Street amid lawns,
    shrubs, and concrete walkways and stairs (Photograph 1). Irregular in plan, the angular and largely
    stucco-clad building features a prominent butterfly-shaped eave projection with tile-clad support
    columns at the east-facing façade. The projecting eave shelters four symmetrically arranged entries
    outlined by molding and secured by double-leaf institutional-grade doors. West of the Auditorium's
    one-story-high entry area, the audience and stage enclosures of the building are formed by two
    wedge-shaped masses attached at their narrower ends. Topped by angled roofs with low perimeter
    parapets that form an internal gutter valley at the center of the building, these two wedge-shaped
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA
Compliance, January 23, 2013
Page 4 of 50

    masses rise as high as two-stories on their east and west sides. The west elevation has a sign
    identifying the school, a large non-original mural, two square-shaped louvered vents, and a molding-
    outlined entry with single- and double-leaf institutional-grade doors (Photograph 2). An attached
    circulation canopy at the north elevation is supported on its north side by steel piloti or posts set at
    interior leaning angles (Photograph 16). At the northeast corner of the Auditorium, a steel gate
    secures the school's main entrance, which is sheltered by a piloti-supported canopy attached to both
    the Auditorium and the southwest corner of the Administration Building (Photograph 3).

    Most of the campus's other buildings are altogether commonplace examples of mid-century modern
    school architecture. Rectangular in plan, the Administration Building has a flat roof, stucco cladding,
    multiple entries with institutional-grade doors, and rectangular aluminum-frame windows arranged
    mainly in multiple four-light stacks, or--at north and south elevations--as clerestory ribbons
    (Photographs 3-4, 18). Broad eaves shelter paved circulation corridors around the building. The
    main entry at the west elevation features a large bank of rectangular aluminum-frame windows and
    a concrete-block planter. Long concrete-block planters interrupted by concrete stairways parallel
    the sheltered corridor at the north elevations of both the Administration Building and Building 100
    immediately to the east. Attached eaves at the east end of the Administration Building and the west
    end of Building 100 form a breezeway secured by chain link gates.

    Housing classrooms, Building 100 has a long rectangular plan, stucco cladding, a flat roof with
    broadly projecting eaves at the north and south elevations, a central breezeway secured by steel-
    wire gates, and a combination of rectangular aluminum-frame clerestory windows and large
    window banks formed of a series of rectangular aluminum-frame windows stacked four-lights high
    (Photographs 4-5). Security screens front the windows at the south elevation. The building's
    numerous entries at the eave-sheltered north and south elevations mainly have single-leaf
    institutional-grade doors, some with rectangular vision lights.

    North of Building 100, Building 200 mainly contains classrooms with entries at the north and south
    elevations and largely repeats the design of Building 100 (Photograph 6). Building 200 differs,
    however, in that it has two breezeways, a longer plan, and its original rectangularity has been
    altered by a shed-roofed and stucco-clad library addition at the west end of the south elevation
    (Photograph 7). The library addition has several rectangular windows that are larger than the
    campus's original windows. Its entry is accessed by both concrete steps and a concrete ramp.
    Circulation canopies with angled steel piloti supports connect the southwest corner and the library
    addition entry of Building 200 to the north side of the Administration Building, and connect Building
    200 at its eastern breezeway to the Building 100 breezeway (Photographs 5, 7, 13).

    Located north of Building 200's east end, Building 300 also contains classrooms. It has a rectangular
    plan and is a third of the size of Building 200, but essentially repeats Building 200's other original
    design features (Photograph 8). A circulation canopy with steel piloti extends from Building 200 at
    its eastern breezeway to the eave projection on the west side of Building 300. This arrangement is
    repeated on the north side of Building 300, where a circulation canopy connects to the southern
    eave extension of the Physical Education Building (Photographs 8-9).

    Rectangular in plan, the Physical Education Building has a flat roof, stucco cladding, few aluminum-
    frame windows, numerous single- and double-leaf institutional grade doors, and no eave projections
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA

    except at the circulation route along its south elevation (Photograph 10). Containing locker rooms
    and a central studio with the rectangular studio roof rising slightly higher than the rest of the roof,
    the Physical Education Building is connected to the east side of classroom Building 400 by a
    breezeway (Photograph 11).

    Building 400 originally housed shops and appears to have since been converted to classrooms
    (Photographs 11-12). Its flat roof forms broad sheltering eaves at its north and south elevations. Its
    exterior walls are clad in stucco and its fenestration consists of banks of rectangular, aluminum-
    frame windows stacked three lights high, several clerestory windows, single- and double-leaf
    institutional-grade doors, and metal roll-up vehicle or equipment doors at the west end of the north
    and south elevations.

    Well south of Building 400, and immediately west of the Administration Building and north of the
    Auditorium is an open-air lunch area bordered on the northwest by the school's Cafeteria and on the
    west by Building 500, which contains music rooms. The rectangular-plan, stucco-clad Cafeteria is
    connected via circulation canopies with angled steel piloti supports or by its broad eaves to
    Buildings 500 and 200 (Photograph 13). The south elevation accommodates lunch service windows
    and the east elevation features a series of partitioned bays with stacks of rectangular aluminum-
    frame windows (Photograph 14). An additional, larger bank of aluminum-frame windows lights the
    building's interior from the north elevation. Multiple entries feature single- and double-leaf
    institutional-grade doors, some with glazing. The west elevation along S. 61st Street has a ribbon of
    rectangular aluminum-frame windows with louvered exterior sun screens, and a loading area
    secured by a steel wire fence (Photograph 15). A non-original lunch shelter with square steel
    support posts and a flat roof rising higher than the surrounding roofs and circulation canopies is
    situated on the east side of the Cafeteria (Photograph 14).

    The Cafeteria is connected by a breezeway to Building 500, which is in turn connected to the
    Auditorium (Photographs 15-17). Rectangular in plan and clad in stucco, Building 500 has flat roofs,
    with the northern roof rising higher than the southern, and a broad, sheltering eave extension at the
    south elevation with angled piloti supports. The building is accessed at various entries secured by
    single- and double-leaf institutional-grade doors. The west elevation along 61st Street has windows
    fronted by exterior louvered sun shades (Photograph 15). A steel gate secures the breezeway
    between Building 500 and the auditorium (Photograph 17).

    The O'Farrell Charter School campus is equipped with numerous portable classroom buildings. Nine
    of these positioned in rows of three, all located north of the Cafeteria, appear to have remained at
    their original sites since the early 1960s (historicaerials.com). These rectangular-plan buildings
    feature composite-cladding, slightly angled roofs with broad sheltering eaves at their entries, banks
    of rectangular aluminum-frame windows stacked four high, single-leaf institutional-grade entry
    doors and wood entry stairs or disability access ramps with steel railing (Photograph 19).
    Additional portable buildings, some dating to recent decades, are located west of Building 400,
    between Building's 400 and 200, and east of Buildings 100 and 200, atop a slope surmounted by
    non-original concrete stairs and a concrete disability access ramp, both with steel railing
    (Photographs 20-22).

    In addition to previously mentioned concrete circulation routes and concrete-block planters, the
    campus is landscaped with lawns, numerous trees and shrubs, unsheltered concrete walkways
    between canopies and buildings, several concrete planters, and concrete and steel picnic tables and
    benches, the latter of which do not appear to be original in many cases. The open lunch area west of
    the Administration Building and north of the Auditorium features six terraced planters comprised of
    mortar and solid rusticated concrete blocks that do not appear to be original (Photograph 18) . A
    similar planter is located east of the library addition to Building 200. Running along the undersides
    of some of the circulation canopies and building eaves are aluminum ducts that do not appear to be
    original features of the school (Photographs 3, 5, 7-9, 13, 16-18).

O'Farrell Charter School Evaluation
    O'Farrell Charter School does not appear to meet the criteria for listing on the California Register of
    Historical Resources (CRHR) due to insufficient historic significance. The period of potential
    significance is 1960, the year the school was built.

    Originally planned and developed as Mabel E. O'Farrell Junior High School, the school was designed
    by the firm Frank L. Hope and Associates, Architects in 1958 (Frank L. Hope and Associates 1958).
    All of the school's permanent mid-century modern buildings were completed by 1960. By 1964,
    nine of the portable classrooms currently at the campus had been sited north of the Cafeteria
    (historicaerials.com 1964; SDUSD 2007). Apart from these early portables, other portables have
    been replaced with newer models or added to the school property in the area north of the Cafeteria
    and west of Building 400, the area north of Building 200 and south of Building 400, and the area
    west of Buildings 100 and 200. Around 2002, new construction at the campus included concrete
    walks and landscaping north of the western two-thirds of Building 200, a concrete stairway and
    ramp to provide access to portable classrooms east of Buildings 100 and 200, and a major shed-roof
    library addition to the west end of Building 200's south elevation. The food service counter at the
    south elevation of the Cafeteria and the lunch shelter on the east side of the Cafeteria were also
    developed at this time (historicaerials.com 1989, 2003; Edward J. Cass and Associates 2002). A
    playground and concrete walkways south of Building 400, and planters comprised of rusticated
    solid concrete blocks and mortar in the open lunch area west of the Administration Building and in
    the area north of Building 100, appear to have been built in more recent years.

    O'Farrell Charter School was built during the post-World War II boom of population growth in the
    San Diego area, which resulted in extensive development of new suburban neighborhoods and new
    public schools to serve the region's growing population of children (see Attachment 1). Residential
    neighborhoods, school complexes, and other infrastructure constructed to encourage or
    accommodate growth are not historically significant by virtue of their association with growth.
    Most built environments are products of planning for population growth or accommodating
    population growth. Association with growth is entirely commonplace, and were it a qualification for
    historical significance all buildings, complexes, and infrastructure surviving from an era of growth
    would be considered historical resources. Obviously, however, not all built resources developed
    during a given era are historically significant. The school does not appear to be associated with
    discrete events of historical significance to San Diego, the State of California, or the United States.
    Hence it does not appear to meet Criterion 1 for listing in the CRHR.

    Although the school is associated with an important San Diego architectural firm, such associations
    are properly assessed with reference to Criterion 3 of the CRHR, which is discussed in greater detail
    below. The school does not appear to have associations with other individuals important to the
    history of San Diego, the State of California, or the United States. It does not, therefore, appear to be
    eligible for the CRHR under Criterion 2. Criterion 4 relates primarily to archaeological data and
    would not normally factor into an evaluation of an above-ground resource like O'Farrell Charter
    School, unless, of course, archaeological sites had been previously recorded within the school limits.
    That is not the case in this situation.

    The O'Farrell Charter School buildings constructed in 1960 were designed by the architectural firm
    of Frank L. Hope and Associates. Two San Diego master architects with the Hope surname were
    associated with this firm, Frank L. Hope Sr., and Frank L. Hope Jr. Born in San Bernardino in 1901,
    Hope Sr. attended the University of California, Berkeley, Pittsburgh's Carnegie Institute of
    Technology, and San Diego State University. In 1925 he worked for Requa and Jackson, Architects. In
    1928 he started his own firm, Frank L. Hope and Associates. In 1930 Hope Sr. designed Normal
    Heights' Carmelite Monastery in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. He continued to produce a
    number of buildings and complexes for the Catholic Church over the next several decades. As
    modernism swept the field in the mid twentieth century, Hope and his firm created Contemporary
    Style homes and commercial buildings, and designed larger modernist public and commercial
    buildings and complexes, including public schools. Born in 1931, Hope Sr.'s son, Frank L. Hope Jr.,
    eventually became an architect and joined his father's firm. After Hope Sr. retired in 1965, Hope Jr.
    became head of the firm. Under Hope Jr., the firm designed multiple residential projects and several
    San Diego area landmarks, including San Diego Stadium (now Qualcomm Stadium), the Timken
    Museum, the May Company building in Mission Valley, and several buildings on the UCSD campus
    (City of San Diego 2007:79, 92; Feeley et al. 2011:16; Modern San Diego n.d.).

    O'Farrell Charter School's original landscape elements may have been designed by Jane Minshall.
    Minshall earned her degree in landscape architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, in
    1941. In 1947, SDUSD hired her as a landscape architect, and she remained the District's sole
    landscape architect for many years. Minshall retired from the District in the mid-1970s. During the
    post-World War II decades of Minshall's SDUSD service, landscape design--the placement of lawns,
    trees, and shrub clusters, and the design and placement of circulation features, planter boxes,
    benches, and other features--became an increasingly important component of school planning and
    modernist school architecture. During this period, school planners and architects sought to foster
    indoor-outdoor experience, which expanded the outdoor spaces of school campuses and made them
    integral to overall school design (Minshall 1974; San Diego Tribune 1954; SDUSD 1967).

    Despite the association between O'Farrell's 1960s buildings and Frank L. Hope and Associates, and
    despite the potential association between O'Farrell's original landscape design and Jane Minshall,
    the school complex does not appear to be eligible for the CRHR under Criterion 3. Although much of
    the O'Farrell campus is representative of modernist public school design, despite some diminished
    historic integrity, it does not appear to constitute a Frank L. Hope and Associates masterwork. The
    most architecturally compelling building on the campus, the Auditorium, registers the shift from the
    International style--the most prevalent architectural style exhibited by larger mid-century San
    Diego public school buildings--to the more angular roof shapes and complex massing associated
    with the Contemporary, Post-and-Beam, and Googie styles. The building does not, however, appear
    to reach the threshold of significance necessary to justify individual listing on the CRHR under
    Criterion 3, nor does it give the school as a whole the architectural significance necessary to justify
    listing on the CRHR under Criterion 3 as a historic school complex or historic district. The other
    1960 buildings on the campus are commonplace examples of mid-century modern school
    architecture. They do not possess high artistic value and do not embody distinctive characteristics of
    a type, period, or method of construction. O'Farrell's landscape elements are also commonplace with
    respect to San Diego Public schools developed during the 1950s and 60s, and do not confer historic
    significance on the campus.

O'Farrell Charter School Cultural Resources Records Search
    To set the stage for the records search that follows this small introduction is provided. O'Farrell
    Charter School is located in a part of the City of San Diego that was once occupied by the Kumeyaay,
    AKA, Diegueños, Ipai, and Tipai (Luomala 1978). Prior to their migration into San Diego County,
    roughly 1,500 years ago, archaeologists have divided the prehistory of the County into artifactual
    units because no one knows what the people called themselves. Near O'Farrell, there could have
    been manifestations of Early Archaic peoples, c. 9,000 to 7,000 years B.P. This culture is also known
    as the San Dieguito Complex in the County (Warren et al. 1998). They were in turn followed by
    Middle Archaic cultures, variously called the La Jollan (coastal) or Pauma (interior North County),
    who lived in this area from roughly 7,000 to 1,500 years B.P. (Warren 1964). The Late Archaic
    peoples or Kumeyaay, are believed to have originated in the east and moved west as the interior
    areas continued to become more arid. The Kumeyaay themselves were displaced into the foothills
    after the arrival of the Spanish, who came in force in A.D. 1769, when they founded Mission San
    Diego de Alcalá (Pourade 1960). After Mexican independence, the Missions were secularized in
    1834, and those Kumeyaay living there were forced to move into interior areas or take menial jobs
    in Old Town San Diego (Carrico 2008). O'Farrell itself was built on lands that once belonged to the
    Mission and used for cattle grazing. After Mexico lost its war with the United States, the lands now
    comprising San Diego County came under American jurisdiction in 1848. Following the discovery of
    gold at Sutter's Fort in 1849, peoples of all nationalities flooded into California. California officially
    became part of the United States in 1851 (Bancroft 1888). San Diego has seen its boom and bust
    years, but after World War II, a steady influx of settlers has pushed the City's population to eighth
    largest in the nation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_cities_in_the_United_States_by_
    population_by_decade#2010.

    To meet the "due diligence requirements" of CEQA, ICF conducted a cultural resources records
    search to determine if any cultural resources had been previously recorded within the O'Farrell
    Charter School campus. The records search of the school property also included a one-quarter mile
    radius around the school. The South Coastal Information Center (SCIC), which is the local repository
    acting on behalf of the State Office of Historic Preservation's California Historical Resources
    Information System (CHRIS), performed the records search. The SCIC reviewed their digitized
    records to:
            Identify previously recorded archaeological sites or historic buildings within the record
            search limits
            Identify any previously conducted cultural resource studies
            Provide some historical maps of the area, and
            Provide copies of any relevant site record forms

    The results of the records search were received on December 18, 2012. It indicated that no cultural
    resources of any kind had been previously recorded within or adjacent to O'Farrell Charter School.
    This can be explained by the dearth of anthropologists, archaeologists, or ethnographers working in
    the San Diego region during the early Twentieth Century. Those that were here were more
    interested in capturing information from living Native Americans before their cultural heritage

    disappeared forever (Barrows 1900; Curtis 1907; DuBois 1901; Harrington 1908; Kroeber 1907;
    Sparkman 1908; Waterman 1910).

    Even by the mid-twentieth century, few archaeologists were exploring the inland areas of San Diego
    County, other than Malcolm Rogers of the San Diego Museum of Man (Rogers 1939, 1945). Delbert
    True was exploring northern San Diego County beginning in the 1950s (True 1954, 1957, 1958), and
    research in the deserts caught the attention of not only Rogers (1966), but also Adan Treganza
    (1942, 1945), Harold Colton (1945), Frederick Hodge (1949), Benjamin McCown (1954), Michael
    Harner (1958), and Clement Meighan (1959). Throughout most of this period, however, most
    Southern California archaeologists were far more interested in the more complex hunter-gatherer
    societies of the coast and the Channel Islands.

    Archaeological work in the area of O'Farrell Charter School would not have begun until after the
    passage of laws requiring developers and agencies to examine how their projects might be affecting
    the environment. Impacts caused by freeway construction in the 1960s led to significant work
    regarding the coastal cultures of San Diego County (e.g., Garfinkel 1982). By 1969 and 1970, the
    National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) had
    been enacted. By 1972 archaeologists were working almost everywhere in the County where
    projects were being proposed. It is not surprising that archaeological sites had not been recorded for
    the area around O'Farrell Charter School, even though the land was still relatively undeveloped in
    the 1950s. That changed quickly during the 1960s and into the 1970s, as development boomed
    along with San Diego's population. Since O'Farrell dates to 1960, it was a full decade or more
    removed from the era of compliance-oriented archaeology.

    While it is unlikely that the proposed work at O'Farrell Charter School would extend deep enough to
    affect buried archaeological or paleontological remains, nevertheless this needed to be documented.
    Additional archival research was conducted using historic maps, aerial images, soil survey records,
    and geologic maps to discern the development history in and around O'Farrell. The purpose of this
    research was to determine if buried cultural resources could exist within the school campus limits.

    Soil survey maps indicate the underlying soils to be classified as DcD or "Diablo Urban Land
    Complex" (Bowman 1973:43). As described by Bowman (1973:44), this soil occurs on uplands in
    areas from 100 to 600 feet in elevation (O'Farrell is at 300'), where the landscape has been altered
    through cut and fill operations and leveled for building sites. In cuts, materials like sandstone and
    shale are visible, which are sedimentary rock units likely to contain fossils. These rocks, classified as
    Tmv or "Mission Valley Formation," date from the early to middle Eocene, roughly 40-46 million
    years ago. These deposits are known to contain a diverse array of mammalian and molluscan fauna
    (Kennedy and Tan 2005). The City of San Diego's general plan EIR has this to say about the Mission
    Valley Formation:

        This formation is the only Eocene rock unit in southern California to have a radiometric date directly
        associated with fossil mammal localities. The marine strata of the Mission Valley Formation have
        produced abundant and generally well-preserved remains of marine microfossils, macro-
        invertebrates, and vertebrates. Fluvial strata of the formation have produced well-preserved
        examples of petrified wood and fairly large and diverse assemblages of fossil land mammals. The fact
        that marine microfossils and land mammals occurred at the same time is extremely important, as it
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA
Compliance, January 23, 2013
Page 22 of 50

        allows for the direct correlation of terrestrial and marine faunal time scales ...The Mission Valley
        Formation represents one of the few instances in North America where such comparisons are
        possible, and they are assigned high paleontological resource sensitivity. [City of San Diego 2007]

    Whether paleontological monitoring during subsurface excavations should be conducted at O'Farrell
    Charter School depends on how deep construction impacts might occur, i.e., whether any proposed
    project activities involve excavation into previously undisturbed deposits. This means that the soils
    directly under O'Farrell, if not already highly disturbed through cutting and filling, are likely to be
    tens of millions of years old and could not possibly contain prehistoric archaeological remains. The
    oldest Native American archaeological remains in the county are generally believed to be no more
    than 8,000 to 10,000 years old (Warren 1967, 1968; Warren et al. 1998).

    Historical archaeological remains are another matter. During historic periods before there were
    garbage services and indoor plumbing, people would bury some of their garbage on their property.
    They used trash pits and privies to depose of garbage. Privies would be kept open until the property
    owners planned to move away. Quite often, any possessions no longer desired would be dumped
    into a privy. The area surrounding O'Farrell Charter School, however, is not particularly noteworthy
    for its developmental history. People were living is this area as early as 1900 because as many as 12
    buildings are shown on the 1904 San Diego 15' topographic quadrangle within 20 to 1300 feet of
    school property. By 1944, when the next USGS quadrangle, National City 7.5', becomes available,
    there are 14 buildings located near the school, and one within school property at its southwest
    corner. This building was still there in 1953, as shown on the earliest available aerial photograph
    (accessed at www.historicaerials.com), as is a second one near the northwest corner. Both are gone
    by the time of the 1955 edition of the USGS National City 7.5' quadrangle. A 1963 edition of the same
    quadrangle also shows the buildings gone, but it does not show the school because the map had
    been surveyed prior to the O'Farrell's construction. By 1964, the next available aerial photograph,
    the school has been built, but the surrounding area is still relatively devoid of housing. Only one
    housing tract has been built, this one immediately to the south of the school. Some of the oldest
    buildings shown on the 1904 topographic map can still be seen in the area.

    Old maps and aerials reveal that a couple of buildings just east of the school date to 1945 and 1948,
    while a couple just west date to 1949 and 1952, according to Google Earth Pro parcel data,
    confirmed at www.zillow.com, and by the 1953 edition of the National City USGS 7.5' quadrangle.
    Even today, in an area where homes are packed in very tightly, some remaining larger lots may be
    remnants of the homesteaders who settled in this area around 1900.

    Three questions need to be asked:

    (1) What are the chances of finding archaeological remains within the school property that date to c.
        1900?

    (2) What are the chances of finding archaeological remains within the school property that date to c.
        1950?

    (3) In addition, if remains were found, would they have archaeological value?

    Answering these questions:
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA
Compliance, January 23, 2013
Page 23 of 50

    (1) It is extremely unlikely that c. 1900 archaeological remains would occur on school property.
        While there is scant data available to rule this out entirely, evidence strongly suggests this part
        of San Diego was always very sparsely populated until after World War II. The first housing tract
        did not go in until 1962. The school was built in possible anticipation of the burgeoning
        population moving to San Diego after the Second World War.

    (2) The earliest aerial, 1953, shows two buildings on the property. One may date back to a structure
        shown on the 1944 topo, but both are gone by 1964. There are no earlier aerials than 1953, but
        the 1944 USGS probably shows the same building in the southwest corner of the property. This
        building does not appear on the 1930 revised version of the 1904. A more detailed analysis also
        determined that the building in the northwest corner was actually built outside school property,
        where today three houses stand. The three houses appear to be on the exact same lot that held
        the one structure in 1953. The southwest structure is in an area now occupied by the
        auditorium. No doubt the foundation work for this building would have destroyed any possible
        archaeological remains that might have existed there. Since plans do not call for the replacement
        of the auditorium, this area of campus would not be affected by the Proposition S projects.

    (3) Archaeological data pertaining to c. 1900 could be very important for research purposes as long
        as it were found at the site where it was used and discarded, i.e., where it could be directly
        associated with the people who lived at this location. The existing literature is limited with
        respect to this time-period, so any new information has the potential to address the everyday
        lives of common folk. It is much harder to make a case for the research potential of mid-
        twentieth century archaeological remains. By 1950, the everyday habits of Americans are widely
        known, publicized, and described in the literature of the day, from newspapers to magazines.
        Even so, the two most likely spots for 1950s remains would be under three homes outside the
        school limits and another under the existing auditorium.

Record Search Conclusions
    Based on the above findings, the following conclusions reflect the potential for archaeological or
    paleontological remains to be exposed during project construction at O'Farrell Charter School:

            Prehistoric Archaeology: Unlikely, monitoring during construction is not recommended.

            Historical Archaeology: Unlikely, monitoring during construction is not recommended.

            Paleontology: Quite possible, depending upon the depth of proposed construction
            excavation on school property. Monitoring is recommended if construction would affect
            previously undisturbed deposits, as the paleontological deposits are highly sensitive and
            scientifically important.

Conclusions
    O'Farrell Charter School does not appear to meet the Criteria for listing on the CRHR. The school was
    evaluated in accordance with Section 15064.5(a) (2)-(3) of the CEQA Guidelines, using the criteria
    outlined in Section 5024.1 of the Public Resources Code, and determined not to be a historical
    resource for the purposes of CEQA.

Compliance, January 23, 2013

    It is not possible to rule out paleontological construction monitoring based on the record research
    results. If construction on campus extends into previously undisturbed deposits, then
    paleontological monitoring is recommended.

    Loss of Pre-1933 San Diego Public School Buildings

    Due largely to the 1933 Field Act (or Field Bill), which the California State Legislature passed in the
    aftermath of the Long Beach Earthquake of that year, none of the larger San Diego public school
    buildings constructed prior to 1933 continue to stand today. These included numerous two-to-three
    story, rectangular, L-, or U-shaped buildings designed in nineteenth-century Victorian styles or in
    the early-twentieth-century Neo-Classical, Mission Revival, and Spanish Colonial Revival styles
    (Kistner 1915; Sanborn Map Company 1906, 1921, 1926, 1940 [Volume 1, Sht. 299I], 1940 [Volume
    2, Sht. 411]; Smythe 1908). The 1933 Long Beach Earthquake destroyed 70 schools and caused 40
    masonry buildings to be condemned in the greater Los Angeles area. Inspectors found that across
    the Los Angeles region, more recently constructed fireproof buildings with steel or reinforced
    concrete beams in floors and roofs withstood the earthquake much better than older masonry
    buildings. Passed in response to the post-earthquake inspections, the Field Act empowered the
    State Division of Architecture to institute new regulations and codes mandating earthquake
    resistant buildings. Six years later, the Garrison Act created new criteria for continued use of school
    buildings constructed prior to 1933 (Heumann and Doehne 2002a:8-9; Department of General
    Services 2012). It appears that during the 1950s and 60s, multiple San Diego public school buildings
    constructed in the early-twentieth-century were declared seismically unsafe and replaced under the
    Field Act and subsequent supplementary legislation. In the wake of the 1971 San Fernando
    Earthquake, the state provided new funding for retrofitting or replacing pre-1933 buildings. During
    the mid-1970s, pre-1933 Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival buildings at La Jolla, Point
    Loma, and Hoover High Schools--all important examples of these architectural styles in major civic
    buildings--succumbed to the wrecking ball (Dalberg ca. 1975; San Diego Union 1973). The demand
    for seismic safety had a major impact on the San Diego built environment as a whole and on
    individual school sites across the city, many of which would come to be dominated by buildings
    developed in the post-World War II period.

    The Great Depression and World War II

    Following the stock market crash of 1929, the onset of the Great Depression initiated a new period
    of financial hard times for San Diego schools. As unemployment rates skyrocketed and the local tax
    base dwindled, school officials increased class sizes and reduced teacher salaries. San Diego public
    schools and the city at large benefited from federal public-works expenditures under programs
    created by the Roosevelt administration's New Deal. The Works Progress Administration (WPA)
    sponsored murals by local artists at public schools and funded a major curriculum development
    initiative in San Diego. Although the WPA built a complex at today's San Diego State University, the
    San Diego public school system appears to have received no new complexes and a relatively small
    number of individual buildings or athletic facilities under the WPA and the Public Works
    Administration (PWA). This contrasted with the Los Angeles area, where large sums of federal
    money were spent to rebuild schools in the wake of the 1933 Long Beach Earthquake. However,

    during the early 1940s, a limited number of school complexes shaped by emerging architectural
    modernism were constructed in the San Diego area (City of San Diego 2007:29-30; Gelernter
    1999:246-248; Leighninger 1996; McElvaine 1984:152-153, 255, 265-75; Mehren 1972a; Mehren
    1972b, SDUSD 1954:10).

    The modernist International style made its first appearance in southern California school
    architecture during the 1930s. Associated with the Bauhaus School of modernist design, Architects
    Richard Neutra and Rudolf Schindler first introduced the International style to the west coast after
    emigrating from Europe. These and other practitioners of the style dispensed with ornament and
    architectural historicism and instead sought to create building forms that expressed their functions
    through "rational, clean, uncluttered" design. Institutional buildings in the International style were
    sometimes box-shaped and sometimes incorporated varied massing and asymmetrical facades.
    Such buildings also typically featured flat roofs, smooth wall surfaces of concrete, brick, stucco, or
    steel, square corners, and expansive horizontal bands of steel-frame fixed or sash windows. In the
    Los Angeles area, Richard Neutra employed the style in his design of the Corona Avenue School, built
    in 1935. The U-plan school featured large L-shaped classrooms with sliding full-length glass doors
    that opened to a courtyard, serving both to maximize natural light and facilitate an indoor-outdoor
    curriculum. Neutra's Corona Avenue School would prove highly influential over subsequent decades
    (City of San Diego 2007:24 [quoted], 59; Heumann and Doehne 2002b; Ogata 2008:564).

    In San Diego, the International style only faintly influenced the architecture of public schools
    developed prior to the end of World War II. The pre-war architecture of San Diego Public schools
    was mainly shaped by the Streamline Moderne and PWA Moderne styles. Departing from the
    geometrically ornate surfaces, vertical emphasis, and pre-modern historicism (or "primitivism") of
    Art Deco, Streamline Moderne engaged in a more populist version of the future-orientated
    aesthetics observable in International style buildings. As with the International style, architects
    working with the Streamline Moderne style dispensed with historical ornament and shifted toward
    a horizontal emphasis. Unlike the International style, however, Streamline Moderne evoked
    movement through visual reference to transportation technology such as airplanes, trains, and
    ships. Streamline Moderne architecture featured asymmetrical massing, flat roofs, smooth wall
    surfaces, curving corners, glass-block windows, steel-framed windows, horizontal molding, string
    courses at cornices. In contrast, PWA Moderne buildings--a number of which were constructed at
    Los Angeles schools during the late 1930s--typically retained stripped-down classicism or other
    restrained historical references. PWA Moderne school buildings often featured recessed centered
    entries framed by column- or quoin-evoking molding, sometimes with pediments, as well as regular
    patterns of rectangular window openings, fluted patterns borrowed from Art Deco, and sometimes
    curved corners borrowed from Streamline Moderne (City of San Diego 2007: 24, 27, 54-55;
    Gelernter 1999:249-50, 241-43; Heumann and Doehne 2002a:13; Heumann and Doehne 2002b).

    San Diego retains a small number of public school buildings shaped by these architectural trends.
    One is the Kensington Neighborhood's Franklin School, built in 1940-41 and mainly exhibiting
    Streamline Moderne influence (San Diego Union 1940). Research for this report has yielded no
    evidence that this was a WPA or PWA project. The Franklin School incorporated curved walls,
    horizontal banding, and glass block windows in the Streamline Moderne style, as well as a chevron
    cornice band consistent with the PWA Moderne style's Art Deco influences. The school also featured
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA
Compliance, January 23, 2013
Page 33 of 50

    a horizontal pattern of stacked rectangular window banks that pointed toward the International
    style.

    School complexes exhibiting elements of these architectural trends were also constructed in Linda
    Vista during the early 1940s. Designed and developed by the federal government, Linda Vista was a
    planned defense-worker Charter High of low-cost housing built with unprecedented mass-
    production efficiency atop the mesa north of western Mission Valley. The federal government
    constructed Linda Vista's schools during the years 1941-42, well after workers had occupied the
    residential units. In October 1941 the San Diego Union announced that architectural contracts had
    been awarded to master architect William Templeton Johnson for Linda Vista Elementary, the firm
    of Kistner & Curtis for Kearny Junior-Senior High School (today's Montgomery Middle School), and
    William Lodge for Carson Elementary School (San Diego Union 1941).

    Linda Vista Elementary School consisted of a long irregular-plan main building along Ulrich Street
    north of Oster Street, and two rectangular buildings extending west from near the south end of the
    main building. Johnson styled the school's main entryway along Ulric Street north of the auditorium
    with features such as an open pediment above a central entryway arch with flanking columns,
    entablatures, and corner quoins. The school incorporated large banks of rectangular classroom
    windows similar to Franklin Elementary. Kearny Junior-Senior High School (Montgomery Middle
    School) consisted of two rectangular-plan two-story buildings sited parallel along Ulric Street and
    topped with low-pitch hip roofs. Apart from Moderne-influenced curved and horizontally scored
    walls at the centered and recessed main entry, the building fronting Ulric Street exhibited a decided
    lack of ornament reflecting the transition from Moderne styles to the International style.

    Linda Vista's U-shaped Carson Elementary School is probably the most historically significant pre-
    World War II public school building still standing in San Diego. WPA-sponsored sculptural panels
    created by San Diego artist Donal Hord adorn the cut-out portion of the two-story building's upper
    northeast corner and a portion of exterior wall above the main entry to the classrooms west of the
    auditorium entry (San Diego History Center n.d.). At the northeast corner, the building also features
    a curved wall with glass blocks, and the auditorium entrance incorporates multiple door bays below
    clerestory windows divided by partitions with curving fluted ends. The building's interior is lit
    naturally along the north elevation west of the auditorium entry by large recessed rectangular
    window stacks. The building's main entry along Kramer Street registered none of the classicism
    associated with the PWA Moderne style. Apart from the imagery of the sculptural panels, Carson
    Elementary School's lack of architectural historicism pointed toward the modernism that would
    dominate San Diego public school architecture after World War II.

    Post-World War II San Diego Public Schools

    A San Diego population that stood at 203,341 in 1940, just prior to World War II, grew to 334,387 by
    1950. Military expansion, growth of the defense industry, and the baby boom all contributed to this
    population growth. Bond issues of $6,866,000 in 1946, $11,806,000 in 1950, and $15,800,000 in
    1953 helped fund both construction of new schools and improvements to existing ones. Still,
    throughout the 1940s and 50s, planning and construction of permanent facilities could not keep
    pace with the growing student population. As a result, the San Diego Unified School District
    (SDUSD) was the nation's first school district to design and build portable classrooms (City of San
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA
Compliance, January 23, 2013
Page 34 of 50

    Diego 2007:23, 30-32, 36; Scarr 1956). Most of the previously discussed schools were developed to
    serve first- and third-ring streetcar suburbs such as La Jolla, Point Loma, Kensington, City Heights,
    or to serve the planned defense-worker Charter High of Linda Vista. During the 1950s, the
    construction of new public school complexes took place mainly in new automobile suburbs located
    further out from the urban core--Pacific Beach, Bay Park, Clairemont, Serra Mesa, the College and
    Fairmont areas, and suburbs further east and south (City of San Diego 2007:36-41, and Residential
    Development Patterns Map).

    The International style had the most immediate impact on the architecture of new public schools
    locally and across the country, but other strains of Mid-Century Modernism also influenced school
    architecture in San Diego. Compared to earlier large two-story school buildings, most school
    complexes developed in the new post-World War II suburbs would have dramatically different plans
    and spatial configurations, reflecting a new emphasis on the kind of indoor-outdoor experience that
    Neutra had fostered at the Corona Avenue School. Many post-war schools in San Diego and across
    the country were heavily influenced by the earlier example of Crow Island School, designed by Eliel
    and Eero Saarinen, Lawrence B. Perkins, E. Todd Wheeler, and Philip Will, Jr. in the International
    style. Located in Winnetka, Illinois, the school was completed in 1940. The Crow Island School plan
    consisted of a central common building and extensive wings with central corridors and projecting L-
    shaped classrooms with large windows and immediate access to courtyard spaces between
    classrooms (Baker 2012:11-12; Ogata 2008:566-67). Crow Island, like Neutra's Corona Avenue
    School, was informed by evolving principles of progressive education.

    Emerging during the early twentieth century, progressive education underwent important changes
    following World War II that mirrored the mainstreaming of International style architecture.
    Informed by the pragmatic philosophy of John Dewey, progressive education had dispensed with
    rote memorization exercises in favor of a more child- or pupil-centered pedagogy geared to
    nurturing the student's process of organizing meaning through experience, problem solving, and
    critical thinking. Additionally, progressive reformers and educators had instituted new standards
    for enhancing building safety, ventilation, and natural lighting through larger windows, and had
    introduced physical education, vocational training, and the 6-3-3 division of elementary, junior, and
    senior high schools, which reflected the new notion that children and adolescents developed in
    distinct stages. Amid the left turn in American politics during the Great Depression and New Deal
    years of the 1930s, some progressive educators increasingly emphasized the need for education to
    promote critical assessment of social problems and to serve the goal of "social reconstruction."
    (Baker 2012:8-9; Bowers 1967; Bederman 1995:77-120; Hendrick 1974; Hyatt et al. 1914:8-13;
    SDUSD 1954:7; Zellie 2005:12, 14-15, 17-18, 21-22, 26-27).

    Under pressure from critics, many Cold War educators put new emphasis on fundamentals and
    moved away from the pre-war emphasis on teaching for social reconstruction. Within the Cold War
    context, it became increasingly important for schools to ready an entire generation to beat the
    Soviet Union in the arms and space races. Education remained child- and pupil-centered, but the
    emphasis shifted to students' social adjustment and integration, and elementary schools in
    particular were thought of as socializing domestic extensions of the home. At the same time, the
    International style--which had first been developed and introduced to the United States by leftist
    European architects-- and newer strains of architectural modernism became the architecture of
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA

    mainstream institutional authority. The architectural precedents and indoor-outdoor designs of
    Neutra's Corona Avenue School and the Crow Island School informed the adoption of indoor-
    outdoor school plans. Amid the changed political climate, many post-war educators and school
    planners continued to retain an older progressive faith in psychological and social
    environmentalism--the notion that a properly designed physical environment could shape
    educational experience for the better. As Charles Wesley Bursch, chief school planner for the
    California of Department of Education explained in 1947: "school architecture. . . must recognize
    [that] its forms, dimensions, color, materials, and texture are capable of creating an environment
    which either attracts or repels the child. . .The school plant designed for the child is unpretentious,
    open, colorful; spread out planning permits him to blow off steam and breath fresh air . . . the
    general environment is not forbidding and monumental but is informal and devoid of affectation as
    the child himself" (Brown 1988:70-78; Gelernter 1999:238, 263-264, Ogata 2008:564-567, 569
    [quote]).

    The quote captures the philosophical basis of suburban school planning in the post-World War II
    years. Like the Corona Avenue and Crow Island Schools, new suburban schools in San Diego and
    other parts of California would combine modernist architecture with campus plans that fostered
    indoor-outdoor experience. Completed in 1949, for example, architect John Lyon Reid's Montecito
    School in Martinez, California, consisted of parallel rows of classrooms and open corridors which, as
    architectural historian Amy F. Ogata explains, "maximized space and access to light." During the
    1950s, new school sites in San Diego's expanding automobile suburbs provided opportunities for
    spatial organization along the lines of Reid's Montecito School. The earlier, monumental, multistory
    school building would gave way to spread-out campuses comprised of numerous low-rise office and
    classroom buildings with ample windows, and perhaps an auditorium and gymnasium built to
    greater heights. As Ogata explains, post-war school "architects across the country used poured-
    concrete slabs for low-rise structures, lightweight steel frames . . . and expanses of glass," which
    proved less expensive to build than pre-war schools. Circulation through new school facilities
    would take place mainly in open-air corridors covered by projecting eaves or canopies supported by
    steel piloti. Within a Cold War context of students performing "duck-and-cover" drills in
    preparation for potential nuclear attack, observers praised schools arranged in this manner as
    easier to evacuate than the older large multistory school buildings. Notable architects and
    architectural firms that designed post-war San Diego public schools in the modernist idiom included
    Lloyd Ruocco, Frank Hope and Associates, and Clyde Hufbauer (City of San Diego 200:92; Brown
    1988; Ogata 2008:568-569; Pitman n.d.; Ruocco 1951).

    Hufbauer appears to have designed more post-war San Diego schools than any other architect. After
    earning Master of Arts and Doctorate degrees in Architecture at the University of California,
    Berkeley, Hufbauer moved to San Diego and began his architecture career in the late 1930s. In 1939
    Hufbauer made a mark with his first "ultra modern" home in Mission Beach, which was featured in
    with San Diego Union. He would later build a second modern home for his family in La Jolla that has
    been designated a San Diego Historical Landmark. In 1947 Hufbauer established his own firm and
    began working for the San Diego School District. Structural engineer Theodore Paulson worked
    with Hufbauer on many of the school projects. In addition to designing the SDUSD Board of
    Education-Eugene Brucker Education Center in University Heights--built in 1953 and arguably the
    most significant local example of the International style--Hufbauer's firm designed eight high
California Register of Historical Resources Evaluation of O'Farrell Charter School Pursuant to CEQA

    schools, 16 junior high schools, and 63 elementary schools. At schools such as Alice Birney
    Elementary and Mission Bay High School, both built in 1953, and others, Hufbauer created distinctly
    modernist classroom and office buildings with ample windows, smooth surfaces, and flat, shed, or
    more boldly V-shaped or butterfly roofs, some with broadly projecting eaves to shelter corridors not
    covered by piloti-supported canopies. His cafeterias combined these features with walls consisting
    almost entirely of windows. Although the bolder roof shapes of some of Hufbauer school buildings
    resonated with the Contemporary and Post-and-Beam styles, Hufbauer's auditorium designs
    remained closer to the International style in their cubic shapes and horizontal lines (City of San
    Diego 2007:58, 103; May n.d.; San Diego Tribune 1993).

    In order to achieve the ideal of a psychologically appealing environment, the expanded outdoor
    spaces of post-war schools required careful attention to landscaping--the design and placement of
    lawns, trees, shrub clusters, and concrete walkways, planter boxes, benches. Landscape architect
    Jane Minshall made essential contributions to the built environments of post-war San Diego public
    schools. Minshall earned her degree in landscape architecture at the University of California,
    Berkeley, in 1941. In 1947 SDUSD hired her as its landscape architect, a position she held until her
    retirement in the mid-1970s. Working with Hufbauer and other architects, Minshall chose plants
    and trees based on their fit for the San Diego climate, water needs, and long-term growth patterns.
    According to Minshall, the task required her "to visualize how planting will look at all stages in its
    development and at all seasons. So many factors are involved in plant selection that development of
    a planting plan is much like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle." "In the preliminary stages," Minshall
    told a San Diego Tribune reporter in 1954, "I work with the building architect and show him where
    I'd like planting. I also decide where the paving and the playground should go." Elsewhere, Minshall
    also explained that the landscape planning process entailed careful "study of anticipated student
    circulation or traffic flow." Declaring her "philosophy" in 1974, Minshall argued that the "most
    important justification for landscaping our schools . . . is the effect that an attractive, comfortable
    environment has on the emotional well-being of students and staff . . . children accustomed to a
    pleasant environment at school, will as adults take greater pride in their homes and Charter High"
    (Minshall 1974:1, 4 [quoted]; San Diego Tribune 1954; SDUSD 1967).

(Discuss importance in terms of historical or architectural context as defined by theme, period, and geographic scope. Also address integrity.)

O'Farrell Charter School does not appear to meet the criteria for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) due to
insufficient historic significance. The period of potential significance is 1960, the year the school was built.

Originally planned and developed as Mabel E. O'Farrell Junior High School, the school was designed by the firm Frank L. Hope and
Associates, Architects in 1958 (Frank L. Hope and Associates 1958). All of the school's permanent mid-century modern buildings were
completed by 1960. By 1964, nine of the portable classrooms currently at the campus had been sited north of the Cafeteria
(historicaerials.com 1964; SDUSD 2007). Apart from these early portables, other portables have been replaced with newer models or
added to the school property in the area north of the Cafeteria and west of Building 400, the area north of Building 200 and south of
Building 400, and the area west of Buildings 100 and 200. Around 2002, new construction at the campus included concrete walks and
landscaping north of the western two-thirds of Building 200, a concrete stairway and ramp to provide access to portable classrooms east
of Buildings 100 and 200, and a major shed-roof library addition to the west end of Building 200's south elevation (see continuation sheet).

*P3a. Description (cont.):

The largest and most boldly designed building on the O'Farrell campus is the school's late mid-century modern Auditorium, situated at the
corner of Skyline Drive and 61st Street amid lawns, shrubs, and concrete walkways and stairs (Photograph 1). Irregular in plan, the
angular and largely stucco-clad building features a prominent butterfly-shaped eave projection with tile-clad support columns at the east-
facing façade. The projecting eave shelters four symmetrically arranged entries outlined by molding and secured by double-leaf
institutional-grade doors. West of the Auditorium's one-story-high entry area, the audience and stage enclosures of the building are
formed by two wedge-shaped masses attached at their narrower ends. Topped by angled roofs with low perimeter parapets that form an
internal gutter valley at the center of the building, these two wedge-shaped masses rise as high as two-stories on their east and west
sides. The west elevation has a sign identifying the school, a large non-original mural, two square-shaped louvered vents, and a molding-
outlined entry with single- and double-leaf institutional-grade doors (Photograph 2). An attached circulation canopy at the north elevation
is supported on its north side by steel piloti or posts set at interior leaning angles (Photograph 16). At the northeast corner of the
Auditorium, a steel gate secures the school's main entrance, which is sheltered by a piloti-supported canopy attached to both the
Auditorium and the southwest corner of the Administration Building (Photograph 3).

Most of the campus's other buildings are altogether commonplace examples of mid-century modern school architecture. Rectangular in
plan, the Administration Building has a flat roof, stucco cladding, multiple entries with institutional-grade doors, and rectangular aluminum-
frame windows arranged mainly in multiple four-light stacks, or--at north and south elevations--as clerestory ribbons (Photographs 3-4,
18). Broad eaves shelter paved circulation corridors around the building. The main entry at the west elevation features a large bank of
rectangular aluminum-frame windows and a concrete-block planter. Long concrete-block planters interrupted by concrete stairways
parallel the sheltered corridor at the north elevations of both the Administration Building and Building 100 immediately to the east.
Attached eaves at the east end of the Administration Building and the west end of Building 100 form a breezeway secured by chain link
gates.

Housing classrooms, Building 100 has a long rectangular plan, stucco cladding, a flat roof with broadly projecting eaves at the north and
south elevations, a central breezeway secured by steel-wire gates, and a combination of rectangular aluminum-frame clerestory windows
and large window banks formed of a series of rectangular aluminum-frame windows stacked four-lights high (Photographs 4-5). Security
screens front the windows at the south elevation. The building's numerous entries at the eave-sheltered north and south elevations mainly
have single-leaf institutional-grade doors, some with rectangular vision lights.

North of Building 100, Building 200 mainly contains classrooms with entries at the north and south elevations and largely repeats the
design of Building 100 (Photograph 6). Building 200 differs, however, in that it has two breezeways, a longer plan, and its original
rectangularity has been altered by a shed-roofed and stucco-clad library addition at the west end of the south elevation (Photograph 7).
The library addition has several rectangular windows that are larger than the campus's original windows. Its entry is accessed by both
concrete steps and a concrete ramp. Circulation canopies with angled steel piloti supports connect the southwest corner and the library
addition entry of Building 200 to the north side of the Administration Building, and connect Building 200 at its eastern breezeway to the
Building 100 breezeway (Photographs 5, 7, 13).

Located north of Building 200's east end, Building 300 also contains classrooms. It has a rectangular plan and is a third of the size of
Building 200, but essentially repeats Building 200's other original design features (Photograph 8). A circulation canopy with steel piloti
extends from Building 200 at its eastern breezeway to the eave projection on the west side of Building 300. This arrangement is repeated
on the north side of Building 300, where a circulation canopy connects to the southern eave extension of the Physical Education Building
(Photographs 8-9).

Rectangular in plan, the Physical Education Building has a flat roof, stucco cladding, few aluminum-frame windows, numerous single- and
double-leaf institutional grade doors, and no eave projections except at the circulation route along its south elevation (Photograph 10).
Containing locker rooms and a central studio with the rectangular studio roof rising slightly higher than the rest of the roof, the Physical
Education Building is connected to the east side of classroom Building 400 by a breezeway (Photograph 11).

Building 400 originally housed shops and appears to have since been converted to classrooms (Photographs 11-12). Its flat roof forms
broad sheltering eaves at its north and south elevations. Its exterior walls are clad in stucco and its fenestration consists of banks of
rectangular, aluminum-frame windows stacked three lights high, several clerestory windows, single- and double-leaf institutional-grade
doors, and metal roll-up vehicle or equipment doors at the west end of the north and south elevations.

Well south of Building 400, and immediately west of the Administration Building and north of the Auditorium is an open-air lunch area
bordered on the northwest by the school's Cafeteria and on the west by Building 500, which contains music rooms. The rectangular-plan,
stucco-clad Cafeteria is connected via circulation canopies with angled steel piloti supports or by its broad eaves to Buildings 500 and 200
(Photograph 13). The south elevation accommodates lunch service windows and the east elevation features a series of partitioned bays
with stacks of rectangular aluminum-frame windows (Photograph 14). An additional, larger bank of aluminum-frame windows lights the

building's interior from the north elevation. Multiple entries feature single- and double-leaf institutional-grade doors, some with glazing. The
west elevation along S. 61st Street has a ribbon of rectangular aluminum-frame windows with louvered exterior sun screens, and a loading
area secured by a steel wire fence (Photograph 15). A non-original lunch shelter with square steel support posts and a flat roof rising
higher than the surrounding roofs and circulation canopies is situated on the east side of the Cafeteria (Photograph 14).

The Cafeteria is connected by a breezeway to Building 500, which is in turn connected to the Auditorium (Photographs 15-17).
Rectangular in plan and clad in stucco, Building 500 has flat roofs, with the northern roof rising higher than the southern, and a broad,
sheltering eave extension at the south elevation with angled piloti supports. The building is accessed at various entries secured by single-
and double-leaf institutional-grade doors. The west elevation along 61st Street has windows fronted by exterior louvered sun shades
(Photograph 15). A steel gate secures the breezeway between Building 500 and the auditorium (Photograph 17).

The O'Farrell Charter School campus is equipped with numerous portable classroom buildings. Nine of these positioned in rows of three,
all located north of the Cafeteria, appear to have remained at their original sites since the early 1960s (historicaerials.com). These
rectangular-plan buildings feature composite-cladding, slightly angled roofs with broad sheltering eaves at their entries, banks of
rectangular aluminum-frame windows stacked four high, single-leaf institutional-grade entry doors and wood entry stairs or disability
access ramps with steel railing (Photograph 19). Additional portable buildings, some dating to recent decades, are located west of
Building 400, between Building's 400 and 200, and east of Buildings 100 and 200, atop a slope surmounted by non-original concrete stairs
and a concrete disability access ramp, both with steel railing (Photographs 20-22).

In addition to previously mentioned concrete circulation routes and concrete-block planters, the campus is landscaped with lawns,
numerous trees and shrubs, unsheltered concrete walkways between canopies and buildings, several concrete planters, and concrete and
steel picnic tables and benches, the latter of which do not appear to be original in many cases. The open lunch area west of the
Administration Building and north of the Auditorium features six terraced planters comprised of mortar and solid rusticated concrete blocks
that do not appear to be original (Photograph 18) . A similar planter is located east of the library addition to Building 200. Running along
the undersides of some of the circulation canopies and building eaves are aluminum ducts that do not appear to be original features of the
school (Photographs 3, 5, 7-9, 13, 16-18).

*B10. Significance (cont.):

The food service counter at the south elevation of the Cafeteria and the lunch shelter on the east side of the Cafeteria were also
developed at this time (historicaerials.com 1989, 2003; Edward J. Cass and Associates 2002). A playground and concrete walkways south
of Building 400, and planters comprised of rusticated solid concrete blocks and mortar in the open lunch area west of the Administration
Building and in the area north of Building 100, appear to have been built in more recent years.

O'Farrell Charter School was built during the post-World War II boom of population growth in the San Diego area, which resulted in
extensive development of new suburban neighborhoods and new public schools to serve the region's growing population of children (see
Attachment 1). Residential neighborhoods, school complexes, and other infrastructure constructed to encourage or accommodate growth
are not historically significant by virtue of their association with growth. Most built environments are products of planning for population
growth or accommodating population growth. Association with growth is entirely commonplace, and were it a qualification for historical
significance all buildings, complexes, and infrastructure surviving from an era of growth would be considered historical resources.
Obviously, however, not all built resources developed during a given era are historically significant. The school does not appear to be
associated with discrete events of historical significance to San Diego, the State of California, or the United States. Hence it does not
appear to meet Criterion 1 for listing in the CRHR.

Although the school is associated with an important San Diego architectural firm, such associations are properly assessed with reference
to Criterion 3 of the CRHR, which is discussed in greater detail below. The school does not appear to have associations with other
individuals important to the history of San Diego, the State of California, or the United States. It does not, therefore, appear to be eligible
for the CRHR under Criterion 2. Criterion 4 relates primarily to archaeological data and would not normally factor into an evaluation of an
above-ground resource like O'Farrell Charter School, unless, of course, archaeological sites had been previously recorded within the
school limits. That is not the case in this situation.

The O'Farrell Charter School buildings constructed in 1960 were designed by the architectural firm of Frank L. Hope and Associates. Two
San Diego master architects with the Hope surname were associated with this firm, Frank L. Hope Sr., and Frank L. Hope Jr. Born in San
Bernardino in 1901, Hope Sr. attended the University of California, Berkeley, Pittsburgh's Carnegie Institute of Technology, and San Diego
State University. In 1925 he worked for Requa and Jackson, Architects. In 1928 he started his own firm, Frank L. Hope and Associates. In
1930 Hope Sr. designed Normal Heights' Carmelite Monastery in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. He continued to produce a number of
buildings and complexes for the Catholic Church over the next several decades. As modernism swept the field in the mid twentieth
century, Hope and his firm created Contemporary Style homes and commercial buildings, and designed larger modernist public and
commercial buildings and complexes, including public schools. Born in 1931, Hope Sr.'s son, Frank L. Hope Jr., eventually became an
architect and joined his father's firm. After Hope Sr. retired in 1965, Hope Jr. became head of the firm. Under Hope Jr., the firm designed

multiple residential projects and several San Diego area landmarks, including San Diego Stadium (now Qualcomm Stadium), the Timken
Museum, the May Company building in Mission Valley, and several buildings on the UCSD campus (City of San Diego 2007:79, 92;
Feeley et al. 2011:16; Modern San Diego n.d.).

O'Farrell Charter School's original landscape elements may have been designed by Jane Minshall. Minshall earned her degree in
landscape architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1941. In 1947, SDUSD hired her as a landscape architect, and she
remained the District's sole landscape architect for many years. Minshall retired from the District in the mid-1970s. During the post-World
War II decades of Minshall's SDUSD service, landscape design--the placement of lawns, trees, and shrub clusters, and the design and
placement of circulation features, planter boxes, benches, and other features--became an increasingly important component of school
planning and modernist school architecture. During this period, school planners and architects sought to foster indoor-outdoor experience,
which expanded the outdoor spaces of school campuses and made them integral to overall school design (Minshall 1974; San Diego
Tribune 1954; SDUSD 1967).

Despite the association between O'Farrell's 1960s buildings and Frank L. Hope and Associates, and despite the potential association
between O'Farrell's original landscape design and Jane Minshall, the school complex does not appear to be eligible for the CRHR under
Criterion 3. Although much of the O'Farrell campus is representative of modernist public school design, despite some diminished historic
integrity, it does not appear to constitute a Frank L. Hope and Associates masterwork. The most architecturally compelling building on the
campus, the Auditorium, registers the shift from the International style--the most prevalent architectural style exhibited by larger mid-
century San Diego public school buildings--to the more angular roof shapes and complex massing associated with the Contemporary,
Post-and-Beam, and Googie styles. The building does not, however, appear to reach the threshold of significance necessary to justify
individual listing on the CRHR under Criterion 3, nor does it give the school as a whole the architectural significance necessary to justify
listing on the CRHR under Criterion 3 as a historic school complex or historic district. The other 1960 buildings on the campus are
commonplace examples of mid-century modern school architecture. They do not possess high artistic value and do not embody distinctive
characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction. O'Farrell's landscape elements are also commonplace with respect to San
Diego Public schools developed during the 1950s and 60s, and do not confer historic significance on the campus.

In summary, O'Farrell Charter School does not appear to meet the Criteria for listing on the CRHR. The school was evaluated in
accordance with Section 15064.5(a) (2)-(3) of the CEQA Guidelines, using the criteria outlined in Section 5024.1 of the Public Resources
Code, and determined not to be a historical resource for the purposes of CEQA.

               Limited Title 5 Review
               6130 Skyline Drive
               San Diego, California


Dear Mr. Harry:

It is our understanding that the San Diego Unified School District plans to perform site-wide im-
provements to the campus at the above-referenced O'Farrell Community School as part of the
Proposition S Bond Program (Figure 1). Proposed projects include, but are not limited to, demo-
lition of existing portable classrooms, constructing new portable classrooms, new mechanical
heating/ventilation/air conditioning systems, electrical power, lighting, and fire alarm system up-
grades, building interiors/exteriors, new joint-use field, new site fencing, and accessibility
upgrades. This letter report has been prepared to address select California Code of Regulations
Title 5 Section 14010 (Title 5) requirements for the site. The scope of work included:

    a review of existing environmental reports and documents,

    identification of nearby airport runways and railroads,

    the proximity of former hazardous waste disposal sites, hazardous substance release sites,
    solid waste disposal sites, and border zone properties, and

    a review of federal, state, and local regulatory agency databases for known hazardous waste
    sites, landfills, leaking underground storage tanks (USTs), permitted facilities that utilize
    USTs, and facilities that use, store, or dispose of hazardous materials.

San Diego, California                                                         Project No. 107482001



The southwestern portion of the site is currently occupied by classrooms, administration build-
ings, service buildings, storage buildings, utility buildings, sports facilities, and asphalt-paved
parking lots. The southeastern portion of the site is currently undeveloped, but proposed for de-
velopment as the O'Farrell Charter High School. The northern portion of the site is currently
occupied by playing fields (Figure 2).



PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS
The following provides a summary of previous environmental assessments performed at the site.


       Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
       URS prepared a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) report for the site that identi-
       fied the known presence of asbestos-containing materials (ACM), lead-based paint (LBP),
       and petroleum-impacted soil associated with a former UST as recognized environmental
       conditions (URS, 2002). Information regarding the former UST is presented in the Potential
       Hazardous Waste Sites section of this letter.

       Based on Ninyo & Moore's review of the Phase I ESA, portions of the site may have been
       utilized for agricultural purposes prior to construction of the school in 1958. Based on a
       screening review of historical aerial photographs performed by Ninyo & Moore, it appears
       that a portion of the site may have been utilized for dry farming; however, based on the qual-
       ity of the photograph, it was difficult to differentiate between dry farming and graded land.


       Joint-Use Field Area and Main Campus ­ Soil Sampling and Analysis
       On July 2, 2012, Ninyo & Moore advanced four hand auger borings in the area proposed for
       construction of the joint-use field (Figure 2). The samples were analyzed for total arsenic
       and for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Arsenic was detected in three soil samples at con-
       centrations exceeding the California Department of Toxic Substances Control's regional
       action level (i.e., regional action level) for arsenic of 12 milligrams per kilogram. The OCP
       4,4-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) was detected in one soil sample and gamma-

San Diego, California                                                          Project No. 107482001



       chlordane was detected in one sample; however, a human health screening evaluation esti-
       mated that the health risk from DDE and gamma-chlordane in soil was considered less than
       significant (Ninyo & Moore, 2012a).

       In August and October 2012, additional soil sampling and analysis (step-out sampling) was
       performed around the samples with arsenic at or exceeding the regional action level in the
       northern half of the joint-use field area to further evaluate the area of arsenic impacted soil
       and also in the northeast and southwest quadrants of the main campus to evaluate potential
       impacts in other areas of the school campus. Two step-out soil samples contained arsenic at
       concentrations that equaled the regional action level. The soil samples collected from the
       northeast and southwest quadrants of the campus did not contain concentrations of arsenic at
       or above the regional action level (Ninyo & Moore, 2012c)

       The areas of arsenic impacted soil at the joint-use field area are limited in nature (Figure 3).
       The top 2 feet of soil in the joint-use field construction area, which includes the arsenic-
       impacted soil areas, will be removed from the site and backfilled with imported soil during
       construction of the joint-use field. Therefore, after soil removal and backfilling is complete,
       the soil sample with an arsenic concentration above the regional action level at a depth of
       greater than 2 feet below ground surface (bgs) will be overlain by 2 feet of soil that does not
       contain arsenic at or above the regional action level, which will serve as a protective cap.


       Proposed Charter High School ­ Soil Sampling and Analysis
       On July 2, 2012, Ninyo & Moore advanced four hand auger borings, one in each quadrant of
       the proposed charter high school site. The samples were analyzed for total arsenic and for
       OCPs. Arsenic was detected in two soil samples at concentrations exceeding the regional ac-
       tion level for arsenic. The OCP DDE was detected in soil samples analyzed; however, a
       human health screening evaluation estimated that the risk from DDE in soil was considered
       less than significant (Ninyo & Moore, 2012).

       In August 2012, step-out soil sampling and analysis was performed around the samples with ar-
       senic at or exceeding the regional action level to further evaluate the area of arsenic impacted
       soil. One soil sample collected at 3 feet bgs, contained arsenic at a concentration that equaled the
       regional action level. However, the soil samples collected at depths of 1 and 2 feet bgs from the
       boring did not contain elevated concentrations of arsenic (Ninyo & Moore, 2012b).

       The area of arsenic impacted soil at the charter high school site is limited in nature and is not
       present in the surface soil (i.e., top 2 feet). In addition, the soil sample collected in the step-
       out boring at a depth of 3 feet bgs is overlain by 2 feet of soil that does not contain arsenic at
       or above the regional screening level, which serves as a protective cap. Based on this infor-
       mation, the concentrations of arsenic detected at the charter high school site are not
       considered to present a significant health risk to student, staff, or the public.



RAILROADS AND AIRPORT RUNWAYS
Title 5 requires consideration of railroad tracks within 1,500 feet or an airport runway within
2 nautical miles of a school site. An aerial photograph, dated August 23, 2010, United States
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map, dated 2012, and a Thomas Guide Map Book, dated
2008, were reviewed for the presence of railroad tracks and airport runways in the site vicinity.
The closest railroad tracks to the site are San Diego Metropolitan Transit System light-rail trolley
tracks located approximately 1,700-feet north of the site on the north side of Imperial Avenue.
The closest airport runway to the site is the San Diego International Airport, which is approxi-
mately 6.5 nautical miles to the northwest of the site. Based on this information, railroads and
airport runways do not pose a potential risk to the site.



POTENTIAL HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES
Ninyo & Moore reviewed in-house documents and files and the following on-line regulatory
agency databases for information regarding known or potential environmental issues at the site
and vicinity:

       California Department of Toxic Substances Control's (DTSC) EnviroStor database
       (http://www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov/public/)

       County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health's (DEH), Hazardous Materials
       Department (HMD) scanned files (http://deh.yourrecords.com/)

Based on a review of the above-referenced sources, properties of potential environmental con-
cern were not noted adjacent to or within approximately 2,000 feet of the site.

Based on a review of GeoTracker, in-house Ninyo & Moore files, and HMD files, an approximately
6,000-gallon UST utilized to store heating/fuel oil located north of the main campus buildings
was removed from the site on March 22, 1988 (Attachment A). During UST removal activities,
the DEH noted ponded product in the excavation and petroleum-impacted soil. The site was assigned
unauthorized release (UAR) case number #H24742-001. Approximately 144 cubic yards of petro-
leum-impacted soil was removed from the site in February 1989. The DEH issued case closure on
March 14, 1989 under the condition that, "if the current use of the site changes, additional site char-
acterization and mitigation activity may be required."

Based on a review of Envirostor, the site is listed as "Inactive ­ action required as of 2/15/2005";
however, the potential contaminants of concern are listed as unspecified. Additional information
was not available for review on Envirostor. Mr. Shahir Haddad of the DTSC was contacted re-
garding the potential outstanding issues at the site. He indicated that the DTSC had received the
URS Phase I ESA report for review; however, the review process was terminated before the
DTSC made a determination and the project was made inactive. Mr. Haddad indicated that he
was not aware of any outstanding environmental issues; however, if future moderniza-
tion/development activities at the site require DTSC review then an updated Phase I ESA report
would need to be submitted for review and determination.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on the information summarized above, Ninyo & Moore concludes the following:

       Soil outside of these arsenic-impacted areas identified within the joint-use field area does not
       present a significant health risk to students, staff, or the public. Based on this information, af-
       ter the soil removal and backfilling is completed in the joint-use field area, the remaining
       arsenic impacts in the area will not present a significant health risk to students, staff, or the
       public. Although the soil at the site does not present a significant health risk to students,
       staff, or the public, the OCPs DDE and gamma-chlordane were detected in soil and soil ex-
       cavated and removed from the site would likely require special handling and disposal.

       Railroads are not located within 1,500 feet of the site and airport runways are not located
       within 2-nautical miles of the site. Based on this information, railroads and airport runways
       do not pose a potential risk to the site.

       Based on our review, properties of potential environmental concern were not noted adjacent to
       or within approximately 2,000 feet of the site and the site is not considered a "hazardous waste
       property" or a "border zone property," as defined by Section 25221 of the California Health
       and Safety Code, or a current or former "hazardous waste disposal site" or a "solid waste dis-
       posal site," in accordance with Section 17213 of the California Education Code. The site may
       be considered a "hazardous substance release site" as result of the UAR of heating/fuel oil.
       However, the UAR was closed under regulatory oversight of the DEH after removal of the
       impacted soil and restrictions were not placed on the closure regarding further use or devel-
       opment of the site as a school and the areas of arsenic-impacted soil are proposed to be
       removed and/or capped with material that does not contain elevated arsenic concentrations.



RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the information summarized above, Ninyo & Moore recommends the following:

       If subsurface excavation activities are proposed, a Community Health and Safety Plan
       (CHSP), Soil Management Plan (SMP), and Site-Specific Health and Safety Plan (HASP)
       should be prepared for the subsurface construction activities to address petroleum-
       hydrocarbon-, arsenic-, and OCP-impacted soil. If the CHSP, SMP, and HASP are imple-
       mented during proposed subsurface construction activities, as needed, the impacts would be
       considered less than significant and additional mitigation measures would not be required.

       The objective of the CHSP is to promote a safe and healthy environment for the public by
       minimizing community exposures to hazards from site activities and/or releases that may
       migrate off site and fostering community awareness. The objective of the SMP is to assist
       construction contractors working at the site with notifications and excavation, monitoring,
       segregation, characterization, handling, and reuse and/or disposal (as appropriate) of waste
       that may be encountered during earthwork activities. A HASP identifies potential chemicals

San Diego, California                                                        Project No. 107482001



       that may be encountered during subsurface construction activities at the site, provides guide-
       lines for use of personal protective equipment based on site-specific conditions, location and
       directions to the nearest hospital, and contingency plans in general accordance with Federal
       Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazardous Waste Operations and Emer-
       gency Response Standard (29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.120) and Title 8 California
       Code of Regulations Section 5192.

       For projects where buildings, structures, and/or paved surface areas are to be demolished,
       the contract should include specifications for abatement and/or removal of ACM and LBP.
       The contract specifications should include the applicable federal, state, and local regulatory
       requirements for the proper removal and disposal of ACM and LBP.

       If future modernization/development activities require DTSC approval, an updated Phase I
       ESA report should be submitted to the DTSC for review and determination.

We appreciate the opportunity to be of service.

Sincerely,
NINYO & MOORE

                        Project




Introduction
      San Diego Unified School District (District) is proposing to modernize and upgrade several facilities
      at the O'Farrell Community School and construct a new charter high school directly to the east of the
      community school.

      The purpose of the memorandum is to identify the potential noise impacts related to construction
      and operation of the Project under CEQA. Included are a review of existing conditions, a summary of
      applicable policies, regulations, and standards to be used for the CEQA evaluation, and an analysis of
      noise impacts resulting from construction and operation of the Project. Where feasible, mitigation
      measures are identified to reduce the level of expected impacts.



Projection Description
      The Project would provide modernization improvements for the existing O'Farrell Community
      School, develop a two-acre, joint-use turf playfield, and construct a new charter high school. A list of
      the O'Farrell Community School improvements and description of the proposed new high school are
      provided below.

      Community School Modernization Improvements

      Supported by bond funds under Prop S, modernization improvements are proposed for the existing
      community school to aid student learning and instruction; benefit student health, safety, and
      security; upgrade school accessibility and code compliance; and perform needed building systems
      repairs and replacements. A list of the O'Farrell Community School improvements is provided
      below.

       Student Health, Safety, and Security.
           Installation of new entry gates throughout campus and a 6-foot fence at new relocatables
           (portable classrooms).
           Installation of six (6) 10-foot exterior light poles.
           Installation of new signal and communication system in all buildings and new relocatables.
           Hazardous materials removal at exterior stucco and plaster where modifications to
           windows take place.
           Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units to be installed in applicable
           buildings. This improvement includes installation of new windows, structural upgrades to
           existing buildings, installation of energy management system (EMS) controls, and work on
           exposed ducts.
           Installation of fire alarms to new devices required for upgrade of HVAC units.
       School Accessibility and Code Compliance Upgrades
           Renovation of restrooms in applicable buildings per code.
           Modifications to existing paving where existing portables are to be removed, as well as area
           for new modulars. Various renovations to parking including parking re-striping and signage,
           installation of truncated domes, and installation of concrete ramp with handrails per
           Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.
           Replacement of old portables with eight (8) new modular buildings.
       Major Building Systems Repair/Replacement (with 20+ year life).
           Plumbing upgrades and repairs as part of HVAC upgrades and installation of new modular
           buildings (trenching would be required).
           Installation of service distribution for new equipment and new light fixtures in applicable
           buildings.
           Installation of main switchboard, transformer, conduit and cabling throughout site.
           Installation of new tack boards and painting of interior walls in applicable buildings.
           Renovation of flooring for applicable buildings includes either new carpet or wood floor
           refinish.

   New Charter High School Campus

   On a currently vacant lot adjacent and east of the existing O'Farrell Community School, construction
   of a new charter high school is proposed. The new charter high school is proposed to function as a
   separate campus within the Project site, serving grades 9 through 12. This new facility would be
   sufficient to accommodate 480 students. The proposed new school would add eight (8) new
   buildings and a gymnasium on a currently vacant lot adjacent and east of O'Farrell Community
   School. Development of the property for the school would also include landscaping, including new
   trees, and stormwater retention ponds. Areas planned for landscaping are located adjacent to or
O'Farrell Community School Modernization and New Charter High School Project - Noise Impact Assessment

   near the boundaries of the property and would not be intended for student use. The Project would
   also add 78 parking spaces, including 5 handicapped parking spaces. An access road to the parking
   lot would require some minor grading in the southeast portion of the property.

   New Joint-Use Playfield

   Just north of the existing O'Farrell Community School, within a currently vacant lot, the District
   proposes to join with the City of San Diego to co-fund development of turf playfields. The joint-use
   playfield site would be approximately two acres and irrigation would be provided. No stadium
   lighting is proposed.



Existing Condition
Noise Terminology
   The following are brief definitions of noise terminology used in this evaluation.
       Sound. A vibratory disturbance transmitted by pressure waves through a medium such as air
       and capable of being detected by a receiving mechanism, such as the human ear or a
       microphone.
       Noise. Sound that is loud, unpleasant, unexpected, or otherwise undesirable.
       Decibel (dB). A measure of sound based on a logarithmic scale that indicates the squared ratio
       of actual sound pressure level to a reference sound pressure level (20 micropascals).
       A-Weighted Decibel (dBA). A measure of sound that is weighted to take into account the
       varying sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound. The dBA scale is the most
       widely used for environmental noise assessments. Typical A-weighted noise levels for various
       types of sound sources are summarized in Table 1.
       Equivalent Sound Level (Leq). Leq represents an average of the sound energy occurring over a
       specified period. In effect, Leq is the steady-state sound level that would contain the same
       acoustical energy as the time-varying sound that actually occurs during the monitoring period.
       The 1-hour A-weighted equivalent sound level (Leq 1h) is the energy average of A-weighted
       sound levels occurring during a 1-hour period.
       Maximum Sound Levels (Lmax). The maximum (Lmax) sound levels measured during a
       monitoring period.
       Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The energy average of the A-weighted sound
       levels occurring during a 24-hour period with 5 dB added to the A-weighted sound levels
       occurring during the period from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and 10 dB added to the A-weighted sound
       levels occurring during the period from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.

   Sound from multiple sources operating in the same area such a multiple pieces of construction
   equipment will result in a combined sound level that is greater than any individual source. The
   individual sound levels for different noise sources cannot be added directly to give the sound level
   for the combined noise sources. Rather, the combined noise level produced by multiple noise
   sources is calculated using logarithmic summation. For example, if one bulldozer produces a noise
   level of 80 dBA, then two bulldozers operating side by side would generate a combined noise level of
   83 dBA (only 3 dBA louder than the single bulldozer).

   Human sound perception, in general, is such that a change in sound level of 3 dB is just noticeable; a
   change of 5 dB is clearly noticeable; and a change of 10 dB is perceived as doubling or halving the
   sound level. A doubling of actual sound energy is required to result in a 3 dB (i.e., barely noticeable)
O'Farrell Community School Modernization and New Charter High School Project - Noise Impact Assessment
May 13, 2013
Page 5 of 18

   increase in noise; in practice, for example, this means that the volume of traffic on a roadway
   typically needs to double to result in a noticeable increase in noise.

   Sound perception also depends on whether a new sound is similar to existing sounds in an area.
   Most people cannot detect differences of 1­2 dB between noise levels of a similar nature (for
   example, a 1-dB increase in traffic noise compared to existing traffic noise). However, under ideal
   listening conditions, some people can detect differences of 2 or 3 dB, and most people under normal
   listening conditions would probably perceive a 5-dB change in sounds of a similar nature. When a
   new, intruding sound is of a different nature than the background sound (for example, a car alarm
   compared to quiet residential sounds), most people can detect changes as small as 1 dBA.

   When distance is the only factor considered, sound levels from isolated point sources of noise
   typically decrease by about 6 dB for every doubling of distance from the noise source. When the
   noise source is a continuous line, such as vehicle traffic on a highway, sound levels decrease by
   about 3 dB for every doubling of distance. Noise levels can also be affected by several factors other
   than the distance from the noise source. Topographic features and structural barriers that absorb,
   reflect, or scatter sound waves can affect the reduction of noise levels over distance. Atmospheric
   conditions (wind speed and direction, humidity levels, and temperatures) and the presence of dense
   vegetation can also affect the degree of sound attenuation. Normally the presence of acoustically
   absorptive ground such as grass will increase the rate of attenuation by about 1.5 dB per doubling of
   distance. Thus, where absorptive ground is present the attenuation rate for a point source will
   increase to about 7.5 dB per doubling of distance and the rate for a line source will increase to about
   4.5 dB per doubling of distance.

Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
   Noise-sensitive land uses are generally defined as locations where people reside or where the
   presence of unwanted sound could adversely affect the use of the land. Noise-sensitive land uses
   typically include residences, hospitals, schools, guest lodgings, libraries and certain types of passive
   recreational uses, such as parks to be used for reading, conversation, and meditation (Federal
   Transit Administration 2006).

   The existing land uses surrounding the Project site are primarily single-family residences located on
   Skyline Drive to the south, Henson Street to the east, Kimmy Court to the north, and S 61th Street to
   the west. Onsite noise-sensitive uses include classrooms and outdoor play areas in the O'Farrell
   school campus.

Ambient Noise Environment
   The existing ambient noise environment in the project vicinity is characteristic of a suburban
   environment with the local vehicle traffic to be the dominate noise source. To generally quantify
   existing ambient noise levels in the project area, four 15-minute short-term measurements were
   conducted on April 19, 2013, at various locations around the Project site. Noise monitoring data is
   included in Attachment 1. Figure 1 shows the short-term noise measurement sites. Table 2
   summarizes the results of the noise measurements. The noise environment in the area consists of
O'Farrell Community School Modernization and New Charter High School Project - Noise Impact Assessment

Page 6 of 18

   noise from traffic along Skyline Drive, S 61st Street, and local residential streets. Other noise sources
   in the project vicinity are typical of residential land uses, such as cars starting up, barking dogs, and
   occasional activities such as landscape maintenance. The ambient noise level in the Project area is
   about 52 dBA Leq at the residential areas on local residential streets and 59-60 dBA Leq at the
   residential area along Skyline Drive and S 61st Street.

Noise Regulations
Federal
   There are no federal regulations that are directly applicable to noise impact evaluation of the
   Project.

State
   The State of California Governor's Office of Planning and Research has published recommended
   guidelines for the preparation and content of a noise element of a general plan. Each jurisdiction is
   required to consider these guidelines when developing the general plan noise element and
   determining acceptable noise levels within the community. Based on the guidelines, City of San
   Diego has developed noise standards as part of the general plan and the municipal code.

   Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR) includes sound transmission control
   requirements that establish uniform minimum noise insulation performance standards for new
   hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment houses, and dwellings other than detached single-family
   units. Specifically, Title 24 states that interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources (greater
   than 60 dBA CNEL) shall not exceed 45 dBA CNEL in any habitable room of new dwellings.

Local
   City of San Diego Municipal Code
   Construction noise within the City of San Diego is governed by the City's Municipal Code Section
   59.5.0404. The relevant parts are cited below:

   "(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, between the hours of 7:00 p.m. of any day and 7:00 a.m. of the
   following day, or on legal holidays as specified in Section 21.04 of the San Diego Municipal Code, with
   the exception of Columbus Day and Washington's Birthday, or on Sundays, to erect, construct, demolish,
   excavate for, alter or repair any building or structure in such a manner as to create disturbing,
   excessive, or offensive noise unless a permit has been applied for and granted beforehand by the Noise
   Abatement and Control Administrator.

   (b) Except as provided in subsection C hereof, it shall be unlawful for any person, including the City of
   San Diego, to conduct any construction activity so as to cause, at or beyond the property lines of any
   property zoned residential, an average sound level greater than 75 dBA during the 12-hour period
   from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m."

   Operation noise within the City of San Diego is governed by the City's Municipal Code Section
   59.5.0401, which established the allowable noise limits at the property boundaries for different land
   use zones. The relevant parts are cited below:

   "(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to cause noise by any means to the extent that the one­hour
   average sound level exceeds the applicable limit given in the following table, at any location in the City
   of San Diego on or beyond the boundaries of the property on which the noise is produced. The noise

   subject to these limits is that part of the total noise at the specified location that is due solely to the
   action of said person.

   (b) The sound level limit at a location on a boundary between two zoning districts is the arithmetic
   mean of the respective limits for the two districts."

   The noise limits for residential zones are summarized below in Table 3. The applicable requirement
   is a function of the time-of-day and land use zone.

   Single Family Residential        50 dBA Leq                   45 dBA Leq                   40 dBA Leq
   Multi-Family Residential         55 dBA Leq                   50 dBA Leq                   45 dBA Leq
   All Other Residential            60 dBA Leq                   55 dBA Leq                   50 dBA Leq



   The District has adopted City noise standards for the analysis of the Project's noise impacts. Because
   the proposed school activities are not expected to extend beyond 7:00 p.m., for single-family
   residences, the operation noise limits would be 50 dBA Leq between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.

   As discussed above under Noise-Sensitive Land Uses, classrooms and certain types of school-related
   facilities within the school are considered noise-sensitive uses. However, they are within the Project
   site as part of the Project improvements; the City's noise ordinance exempts the noise generated
   within the property from the noise standard (providing that such activities measured at or beyond
   the property line). Therefore, Project-related noise generation at onsite classrooms and other noise-
   sensitive uses are not evaluated further in this analysis.

   The Project would build new classroom buildings for the proposed charter high school within the
   site, which would be subject to the CCR, Title 24 Noise Insulation Standards and City's noise
   ordinance. According to the regulations, the District requires an acoustical analysis to be conducted
   to show that the proposed design will limit interior noise to less than 45 dBA CNEL, where the CNEL
   exceeds 60 dBA in the vicinity of schools and educational uses.



Impact Significance Criteria
   The City of San Diego has developed significance determination thresholds (guidelines) to assist in
   determining whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment. The following
   significance criteria from the City of San Diego are based on State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G, and
   provide the basis for determining the significance of noise impacts resulting from implementation of
   the proposed Project. The Project would result in a significant impact on noise if it would result in:
   1. Expose persons to or generate noise levels in excess of standards established in the local general
      plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other agencies, as follows.
O'Farrell Community School Modernization and New Charter High School Project - Noise Impact Assessment
May 13, 2013
Page 10 of 18

           Generate construction noise in excess of 75 dBA Leq at noise-sensitive land uses over any
           one-hour between 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
           Generate operation noise from sport events in excess of noise limits listed in Table 2 at
           noise-sensitive land uses.
           Result in an increase in operational traffic noise of greater than 3 dB over the traffic noise
           levels without the project at existing noise-sensitive land uses. The 3 dB is generally
           considered to be the threshold of a perceptible change.
   2. Result in sound levels that adversely affect the educational program, as follows.
           Expose new Project classrooms greater than 45 dBA CNEL of interior noise level.
   3. Expose persons to or generate excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels.
   4. Create a substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity above
      levels existing without the project.
   5. Create a substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project
      vicinity above levels existing without the project.
   6. Expose people residing or working the project area to excessive noise levels where the project is
      located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted, within two
      miles of a public airport.
   7. Expose people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels where the
      project is within the vicinity of a private airstrip.



Impact Analysis
Methodology
   This noise impact analysis evaluates the temporary noise increase associated with Project
   construction activities, long-term operational noise generated by onsite activities and by sound-
   generating equipment (e.g. HVAC), and traffic noise associated with Project-related traffic increase.

   Noise impacts associated with onsite construction activities were evaluated using the construction
   equipment noise data in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) roadway construction noise
   model (RCNM). Table 4 presents typical noise levels for the types of construction equipment that
   would be used for the Project. The noise levels listed represent the A-weighted Lmax, measured at a
   distance of 50 feet from the construction equipment and the utilization factors for the equipment,
   defined as the fraction of time that the equipment typically runs at maximum capacity (Federal
   Highway Administration 2006). The utilization factor is used to estimate Leq values from Lmax
   values.

   Noise impacts associated with increase traffic volumes generated by the new high school were
   evaluated for the existing condition, existing plus Project condition, cumulative no Project condition,
   and cumulative plus Project condition, using a spreadsheet based on the FHWA traffic noise model
   (TNM). This spreadsheet calculates the traffic noise levels at a fixed distance from the centerline of a
   roadway based on the traffic volume, speed, and truck percentage that is predicted to occur under
   each condition. The traffic data used in this analysis were based on the traffic impact study report
   provided by the project traffic consultant (KOA Cooperation 2013). Traffic noise was evaluated in
   terms of how Project-related traffic noise increases could affect existing noise-sensitive land uses on
   existing roadways.

   Operational noise impacts associated with the proposed onsite activities and stationary sources
   were evaluated based on the proposed layout and anticipated noise generating activities.

   Noise generated by point sources (e.g., construction equipment and stationary operational
   equipment) was estimated to include point-source attenuation of 6 dB per doubling of distance.
   Noise generated by line sources (e.g., vehicles traveling on streets) was estimated to include line-
   source attenuation of 3 dB per doubling of distance from the noise source.

Construction Noise Impacts
   During construction of the Project, the construction activities would be limited to 7:00 a.m. to 7:00
   p.m. to comply with the City of San Diego's noise ordinance.

Community School Modernization Improvements
   The construction activities for modernization improvements are expected to be small scale with
   small equipment, short duration, and mostly be contained within the buildings inside of the school
   property. Therefore, noise generated by the modernization improvements is not expected to result
   in significant noise impacts at noise-sensitive land uses.

New Charter High School Campus
   Construction of the new high school facilities would require the use of heavy equipment that could
   temporarily increase noise levels at properties near the work areas. Noise levels generated during
   construction would vary dependent on the types of construction equipment used during
   construction activity, site geometry (i.e., shielding from intervening terrain or other structures), and
   the distance between the noise source and receiver. Noise from construction equipment would
   likely be audible at noise-sensitive land uses surrounding the work site, the closest of which are to
   the north of the Project site. Table 4 presents typical noise levels for various types of construction
   equipment that would be used for the construction of new high school facilities. To evaluate the
   construction noise impacts at adjacent noise-sensitive land uses, construction equipment that would
   result in the highest noise level is used to estimate the noise levels at various distances from the
   construction sites, as shown in Table 5. Calculations assumed simultaneous and continuous
   operation of the three loudest pieces of equipment (a dozer, a grader, and a scraper) proposed to be
   used for the athletic facilities upgrades. The estimated construction noise levels reflect a
   conservative condition where the loudest pieces of equipment are assumed to operate continuously
   for a 1-hour period. In reality, construction activities would likely be intermittent, so actual noise
   levels could be somewhat lower than the estimated noise levels. The construction noise calculations
   are included in the Attachment 2.

   During the construction of new high school facilities, the estimated construction noise level would
   be as high as 83 dBA Leq at nearest single-family residences on Kimmy Court to the north of school
   site. Although the actual noise levels could be lower than estimated noise levels, the construction
   noise would exceed the City's noise limit of 75 dBA Leq. Therefore, when the construction activities
   occur near the near the residential areas, the construction noise impact at the single-family
   residences would be significant. Implementation of the Mitigation Measure 1 would reduce the
   potential noise impacts to a less-than-significant level.

    Leq = equivalent sound levels; dBA = A-weighted decibel.
    Onsite noise levels are estimated based on noise generated from three loudest pieces of
    equipment proposed to be used for athletic facilities upgrades.



    Mitigation Measure 1: Implement construction site noise control measures
        The District will require all contractors to adhere to the following noise abatement measures.
        District will be responsible for ensuring implementation.
             Comply with manufacturers' muffler requirements on all construction equipment engines.
             Turn off construction equipment when not in use, where applicable.
             Locate stationary equipment as far as practical from receiving properties.
             Use temporary sound barriers or sound curtains 1 around loud stationary equipment when
             the construction activity would generate noise in excess of 75 dBA Leq over any one hour
             period at impacted residences if the other noise reduction methods are not effective or
             possible to resolve a noise complaint.
             Provide advance written notification of construction activities to residences around the
             construction site. Notification will include a brief overview of the proposed construction
             activity and its purpose and schedule. It also will include the name and contact information
             of the Project manager or representative responsible for resolving any noise concerns.

    As shown in Table 5, construction activities are not expected to cause the exceedance of City's noise
    limit (75 dBA Leq) at the residences to the east and south of the Project site; however, the
    construction noise would likely be substantially higher than the typical ambient daytime noise levels
    (52 to 60 dBA) measured at these areas. This impact is considered to be significant because
    construction would result in a substantial temporary increase in noise. Implementation of
    Mitigation Measure 1 would reduce this impact to a less-than-significant level.

New Joint-Use Playfield
    Construction of the new join-use turf playfield would require the use of heavy equipment that could
    temporarily increase noise levels at properties near the work areas. The estimated construction
    noise level would be as high as 79 dBA Leq at nearest single-family residences on Benson Avenue to

padded fiberglass absorbers. Sound curtains combine both noise blocking and noise absorbing features.

   the northwest of playfield site (shown in Table 5). Although the actual noise levels could be lower
   than estimated noise levels, the construction noise would exceed the City's noise limit of 75 dBA Leq.
   Therefore, when the construction activities occur near the near the residential areas, the
   construction noise impact at the single-family residences would be significant. Implementation of
   the Mitigation Measure 1 would reduce the potential noise impacts to a less-than-significant level.

Construction Groundborne Vibration
   The operation of heavy construction equipment can generate localized groundborne vibration at
   buildings adjacent to the construction site, especially during the operation of high-impact
   equipment, such as pile drivers. Vibration from non-impact construction activity and truck traffic is
   typically below the threshold of perception when the activity is more than about 50 feet from the
   noise-sensitive land uses (Federal Transit Administration 2006). Consequently, for construction
   activities without the use of high-impact equipment and construction sites that are more than 50
   feet from noise-sensitive land uses, groundborne vibration impacts are expected to be less than
   significant.

   Within the project area, the nearest single-family residences are more than 50 feet to the
   construction sites. Additionally, the project construction would not involve high-impact equipment,
   such as a pile driver. Therefore, the impact would be less than significant. No mitigation is required.

Operational Noise Impacts
   Long-term operational noise associated with the implementation of the Project including noise
   generated by new sources or increased level of activities at the project site and noise generated by
   the increased Project traffic on local streets.

   Implementation of the modernization improvements would not cause the increase in vehicle traffic,
   but could involve with the installation of HVAC units at several existing buildings. Therefore, there
   could be operational noise impacts associated with the new noise source at the existing facilities.
   Noise impacts associated with the new high school would include noise generated by new sources
   and noise generated by the increased vehicle trips on local streets. The new turf playfield would not
   involve with the installation of sound-generating equipment or stadium lighting; therefore, the
   proposed activities on the field would be limited to daytime uses only and would be similar to
   typical baseball and softball activities at other schools.

Community School Modernization Improvements
   The modernization improvements would include the installation of HVAC units for the existing
   buildings at the O'Farrell school campus. The HVAC units are expected to be installed either on the
   roof or adjacent to the buildings. HVAC units are typically considered noise generating sources and
   could potentially cause noise concerns at noise-sensitive uses adjacent to the equipment. A roof-
O'Farrell Community School Modernization and New Charter High School Project - Noise Impact Assessment

Page 15 of 18

    mounted HVAC condenser at an average capacity of 3 tons per unit is assumed to produce an
    average sound level of 52 dBA at 50 feet based on typical manufacturer data 2.

    The school buildings at the O'Farrell school are approximately 120 feet to the closest residences on
    the west side of S 61st Street. Because traffic on S 61st Street is the dominate noise source at the
    residences, the HVAC units installed at these closest buildings would not generate noise that would
    be audible to nearby residences. Therefore, the noise impact associated with the operation of HVAC
    units would be less than significant.

New Charter High School Campus
    Onsite Operation Noise
    The Project would include the installation of HVAC units for the new classroom buildings at the high
    school campus. The new classroom buildings at the new high school would be approximately 220
    feet to the closest residences on the north side of the school. Because the buildings are directly
    adjacent to the residences, noise generated by the HVAC units at the buildings is expected to be
    lower than the ambient noise level (52 dBA at ST2). Therefore, the noise impact associated with the
    operation of HVAC units would be less than significant.

    Traffic Noise
    There is no City ordinance and regulation that would be applicable to traffic noise generated by
    increase Project vehicle trips. To evaluate the traffic noise impact, a substantial increase of 3 dBA,
    which is generally considered to be the threshold of a perceptible change, is used for the assessment.

    Traffic generated by the new high school would mostly travel on Skyline Drive to and from the
    school. Therefore, noise-sensitive land uses along Skyline Drive could be affected by the increase in
    traffic noise caused by the Project. Table 6 summarizes the increase in traffic noise levels (Leq)
    during peak hour along Skyline Drive as a result of Project-generated traffic. Traffic noise levels
    (Leq) were estimated based on the PM peak traffic volumes that are predicted to occur. The
    calculation of traffic noise levels is included in Attachment 3.

    As shown in Table 6, traffic noise is expected to increase by less than 3 dB as a result of the Project
    under both existing and cumulative conditions. 2035 Cumulative plus Project traffic noise levels
    along Project-access streets are also expected to increase by less than 3 dB compared to the existing
    no project condition. Therefore, the Project would not result in in an increase in traffic noise that is
    greater than 3 dB under any of the conditions evaluated. The traffic noise impact is therefore less
    than significant. No mitigation is required.




2 The assumed sound levels for HVAC condensers are based on the manufacturer sound rating specifications for
Lennox XC14-36, XC17-36, and XC21-36. The sound rating specifications are assumed to be equivalent to sound
levels measured at 6 feet from the HVAC condenser.

   Building Interior Noise Levels
   The Project would be required to meet the interior noise standard of 45 dBA CNEL for the new
   classroom buildings in the proposed high school because the buildings could potentially exposed to
   the exterior traffic noise level in excess of 60 dBA. Based on the ambient noise level measured at ST1
   (59.5 dBA), the existing noise level at the project site is approaching 60 dBA. With the cumulative
   traffic growth on Skyline Drive, the exterior traffic noise level at the building is estimated to be
   approximately 61 dBA under the cumulative plus Project condition (see Table 6 and Attachment 3).
   Project building materials would need to be designed to provide an exterior to interior sound
   reduction of 16 dB for classrooms facing the street. Normal construction materials and techniques
   will typically provide a minimum reduction of 15 dB in exterior to interior sound levels if there are
   no openings such as windows, doors, or ventilation ports on the sides of the buildings that are
   exposed to traffic noise. Therefore, the classrooms facing Skyline Drive could potentially experience
   interior noise levels exceeding the noise standards of 45 dBA CNEL. This noise impact at the building
   is therefore potentially significant. Implementation of Mitigation Measure 2 would reduce this
   impact to a less-than-significant level because it requires calculation of interior noise levels based on
   final site plans.

   Mitigation Measure 2: Conduct site-specific building acoustical analysis and
   implement noise control treatments where required.
       A qualified acoustical consultant will review final site plans, building elevations, and floor plans
       prior to construction to calculate expected interior noise levels as required by state noise
       regulations. Project-specific acoustical analyses are required by the California Building Code to

       confirm that the design results in interior noise levels reduced to 45 dBA CNEL or lower. The
       specific determination of what noise insulation treatments are necessary will be completed on a
       unit-by-unit basis. Results of the analysis, including the description of the necessary noise
       control treatments, will be submitted to the District along with the building plans, and will be
       approved prior to issuance of a building permit.

       Special building techniques (e.g., sound-rated windows and building façade treatments) will be
       implemented as recommended by the qualified acoustical consultant to maintain interior noise
       levels at or below acceptable levels. These treatments may include, but are not limited to, sound
       rated windows and doors, sound rated wall constructions, acoustical caulking, protected
       ventilation openings, etc. Preliminary calculations indicate that classrooms nearest to and facing
       45th Street with direct line of sight to the roadway would require sound rated windows and
       doors to assure that the interior average noise level guidelines are met.

New Joint-Use Playfield
   The Project would include a new join-use turf playfield as shown on Figure1. Although the softball
   field would be used only during the day, the activities at the softball field could generate elevated
   noise levels during sporting games. Noise sources associated with the games generally consist of
   occasional shouting and cheering of the participants and observers. The average noise levels
   generated during games are approximately 60 dBA Leq at a distance of 100 feet from the effective
   noise center of the playing fields. The reported noise levels were based on field data collected at
   various softball and soccer venues and do not include sound amplification equipment (City of Citrus
   Heights 2000). The nearest single-family residences are located 300 feet northwest of the proposed
   playfield, which would result in noise level of 50 dBA Leq. The estimated noise level is lower than
   the existing ambient noise level (52-60 dBA Leq) and would not exceed the City noise limit of 50
   dBA Leq for the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Therefore, the activities at the new turf
   playfield would not result in significant noise impacts at single-family residences adjacent to the
   playfield site. Impact would be less than significant.

Operation Groundbourne Vibration
   Operation of the Project would be similar to the existing activities conducted within the Project site,
   which are not expected to involve the use of heavy construction equipment or high-impact
   equipment, such as pile drivers. Therefore, the impact would be less than significant.

Airport Noise
   The nearest airport is the San Diego International Airport, located approximately 7.5 miles
   northwest of the Project. There is no other private airstrip or public airport located within the
   immediate vicinity of the Project. The Project would not expose facility or students to excessive
   noise levels from airport or aircraft operations. Therefore, there would be no aircraft noise impact.

Cumulative Impacts
   Project construction would result in a temporary increase in noise levels in the immediate vicinity of
   the construction areas; however, the noise impact would be reduced to be less than significant with
   the implementation of Mitigation Measure 1. There are no other approved or planned projects in the
   vicinity of the Project that would be constructed in during the same construction period of the
   Project. Therefore, construction noise would not contribute to the cumulatively considerable impact.

   Traffic generated by the new high school would not result in cumulative traffic noise impact.
   Therefore, project operational noise and project-related traffic noise would not contribute to a
   cumulatively considerable impact.

                                         THE PROJECT
This focused traffic impact analysis has been prepared for the proposed O'Farrell Charter High
School on the northeast corner of the Skyline Drive & 61st Street intersection. The proposed
development is located in the City of San Diego, east of Interstate 805 and south of State Route 94.

The Driveway access to the project site is provided on Skyline Drive north-west of Skyline Drive and
Omeara Street intersection. Skyline Drive connects Woodman Street and Valencia Parkway which
provides access to the project site for the surrounding neighborhood communities.

Figure 1-1 shows the project vicinity.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The school plans to add facility that contains eight new buildings and a gymnasium on the east side of
the existing facility which is currently vacant. The new facility will be sufficient to accommodate 480
new students in the grades 9 thru 12. The new facility will function as a separate campus within the
overall property and occur on the southeast quadrant of the site.

With the commencement of the new facility, the operating hours between the elementary and high
school will be staggered by 45 minutes. This will alleviate any traffic congestions that may occur
during the school peak hours.

STUDY AREA

The study area for this focused traffic impact analysis includes those locations that are expected to be
affected by this project. The scope of the study area is based on the City of San Diego Guidelines and
developed through a review of on-going traffic studies, and a working knowledge of the local
transportation system. The study area is shown in Figure 1-2. The specific study area includes two
roadway segments and seven intersections:

Roadway Segments

PROJECT TRIP GENERATION

Trip generation is a measure or forecast of the number of trips that begin or end at the project site.
The traffic generated is a function of the extent and type of development proposed for the site. These
trips will result in some traffic increases on the streets where they occur. Vehicular traffic generation
characteristics for projects are estimated based on established rates. These rates identify the probable
traffic generation of various land uses based on studies of developments in comparable settings. The
rates used in this analysis were determined based on rates contained in the City of San Diego Trip
Generation Manual (2003). This manual provides standards and recommendations for the probable
traffic generation of various land uses based upon local, regional and nationwide studies of existing
developments in comparable settings. Appendix C contains excerpts from this manual.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

Trip distribution and assignment is the process of identifying the probable destinations, directions and
traffic routes that project related traffic will likely affect. Trip distribution and assignment
information can be estimated from observed traffic patterns, experience or through use of a
computerized travel forecast model. Once the proposed development's trips have been estimated, they
are assigned to the study area network. The trip distribution and assignment for this project is based
on observed traffic patterns and engineering judgment.

The trip distribution and assignment for the project-related trips is shown in Figure 1-3. Figures 1-4
through 1-6 show the daily and peak hour project trips.

PROJECT ACCESS

The proposed project will be access through the existing driveway on Skyline Drive. The driveway
will function as a common driveway which presently exists to serve the existing campus. The parking
lot of the proposed project will be connected to the north east corner of the existing parking lot with a
short access street. Skyline Drive connects Woodman Street and Valencia Parkway which provide
major access to the neighboring communities. In addition 61st Street which also connects Imperial
Avenue and Division Street provides access to the school.

PARKING

The proposed project is designed to provide 74 general and 5 handicap parking spaces. The number
of parking spaces allocated is in accordance to the municipal code and is adequate.

PASSENGER LOADING ZONE

Currently the elementary school has approximately 500' of passenger loading zone on the north side
of Skyline Drive between 61st Street and the east, entry driveway to the school parking lot. The space
allows for approximately 17 cars to position at a time for passenger drop-off and pick-up. In addition
to the on-street drop off and pick up, the project may allow for on-site drop off and pickup. As such,
parents could use the main access point from the parking lot on Skyline Drive to enter and exit the
site and conduct this activity.

With the construction of the new facility, demand for more passenger loading space may be required.
Currently between the existing, east school entry driveway and Omeara Street, parking is permitted
along a stretch of approximately 310', and there is red curb stretching for the rest of the segment
length. That red curb is approximately 65' in length. A MTS bus stop and an unutilized driveway
exist on the east side of the permitted parking within the red curb zone. The proposed project would
eliminate the unutilized driveway. An agreement with the MTS to relocate the bus stop to east side of
Omeara Street, and the redesignation of the permitted parking and the red curb would result in
approximately 375' of passenger loading space. This additional space can position approximately 13
cars at a time for passenger drop-off and pick-up. This additional space and the staggering of the
operating hours between the elementary and the high school would alleviate any congestion that may
occur. Figure 1-7 shows the existing and proposed passenger loading zones.

                                      METHODOLOGIES
This chapter documents the methodologies and assumptions used to conduct the traffic impact
analysis for the project. The study methodology and analysis is conducted in accordance with the City
of San Diego Traffic Impact Study Manual (1998) and the City of San Diego Significance
Determination Thresholds Development Services Department (2007). These guidelines are used to
determine the project's potential significant impacts.

STUDY SCENARIOS

This report presents an analysis of the following analysis scenarios:

·   Existing Conditions
·   Existing Conditions with Project
·   Near-term Conditions (existing conditions with minimum growth and approved projects)
·   Near-term Conditions with Project (existing conditions with minimum growth and approved
    projects plus site traffic)
·   Horizon Year Conditions (Year 2035)
·   Horizon Conditions with Project (Year 2035 plus site traffic)

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES

Street system operating conditions are typically described in terms of "level of service." Level of
service is a report-card scale used to indicate the quality of traffic flow on roadway segments and at
intersections. Level of service (LOS) ranges from LOS A (free flow, little congestion) to LOS F
(forced flow, extreme congestion). A more detailed description of the concepts described in this
section is provided in Appendix A of this document. The following methods are outlined in this
publication and used in this study.

Roadway Segment Capacity Analysis
The City of San Diego has published daily traffic volume standards for roadways within its
jurisdiction. To determine service levels on study area roadway segments, we compared the
appropriate average daily traffic thresholds for level of service to the daily capacity of the study area
roadway segments, and the existing and future volumes in the study area. The thresholds for
determining level of service used in this analysis are summarized in Appendix A.

Intersection Capacity Analysis
The analysis of peak hour intersection performance was conducted using the Traffix analysis software
program, which uses methodologies defined in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) to
calculate results. Level of service (LOS) for intersections is determined by control delay. Control
delay is defined as the total elapsed time from when a vehicle stops at the end of a queue to the time
the vehicle departs from the stop line. The total elapsed time includes the time required for the vehicle
to travel from the last-in-queue position to the first-in-queue position, including deceleration of
vehicles from free-flow speed to the speed of vehicles in the queue. Appendix A lists the HCM
delay/LOS criteria for both signalized and unsignalized intersections.

Signalized Intersections
The HCM analysis methodology for evaluating signalized intersections is based on the "operational
analysis" procedure. This technique uses 1,900 passenger cars per hour of green per lane (pcphgpl) as
the maximum saturation flow of a single lane at an intersection. This saturation flow rate is adjusted
to account for lane width, on-street parking, conflicting pedestrian flow, traffic composition, (e.g., the
percentage of vehicles that are trucks) and shared lane movements (e.g., through and right-turn
movements from the same lane). Average control delay is calculated by taking a volume-weighted
average of all the delays for all vehicles entering the intersection.

All-Way Stop-Controlled Intersections
The HCM analysis methodology for evaluating all-way stop-controlled (AWSC) intersections is
based on the degree of conflict for each independent approach created by the opposing approach and
each conflicting approach. Level of service for AWSC intersections is also based on the average
control delay. However, AWSC intersections have different threshold values than those applied to
signalized intersections. This is based on the rationale that drivers expect AWSC intersections to
carry lower traffic volumes than at signalized intersections. Therefore, a higher level of delay is
acceptable at a signalized intersection for the same LOS.

Two-Way Stop-Controlled Intersections
The HCM analysis methodology for evaluating two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections is
based on gap acceptance and conflicting traffic for vehicles stopped on the minor-street approaches.
The critical gap (or minimum gap that would be acceptable) is defined as the minimum time interval
in the major-street traffic stream that allows intersection entry for one minor-street vehicle. Average
control delay and LOS for the "worst approach" are reported. Level of service is not defined for the
intersection as a whole.

Analysis of Significance
To determine direct project impacts, the City of San Diego has developed a series of thresholds based
on allowable increases in volume-to-capacity ratios that become more stringent as level of service
worsens. The City of San Diego January 1, 2007 significance thresholds are used. Appendix A
summarizes these thresholds. Where roadway segments and intersections operate at LOS D or better
impacts are not considered significant.

TRAFFIC VOLUMES

The intersection turning movement counts were conducted during the weekday morning peak period
from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and during the weekday evening peak period from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on
6 and 20 of November, 2012 and 16 of January 2013. Average daily traffic volumes were obtained
through machine data collection. The resultant existing weekday morning and evening peak hour
intersection volumes are shown in Figures 3-3 and 3-4. The daily traffic volumes are shown in Figure
3-2.

ROADWAY NETWORK

The principal roadways in the project study area are described briefly below. The description includes
the physical characteristics, adjacent land uses, and traffic control devices along these roadways. The
existing roadway geometry and control conditions are shown in Figure 3-1. Additional details
regarding specific intersection operating conditions can be found on the capacity analysis worksheets
in Appendix D.

Skyline Drive which runs east/west connects Woodman Street to the east and Valencia Parkway to the
west. Both the streets which run north/south connect Imperial Avenue to the north and Division Street
to the south. Skyline Drive functions as 2-collector between Valencia Parkway and 61st Street, and
between Omeara Street and Woodman Street. The street functions as a 4-Collector between 61st Street
and Omeara Street. The street has two way left turn lane (TWLTL) throughout the length of the study
segment. The street has bike lanes and sidewalks, allow street parking and serves as a bus route with
stops at key locations. The posted speed limit on the street is 35 MPH. This roadway provides
driveway access to adjacent residential land uses.

The San Diego Unified School District and the City of San Diego have cooperated over the last
several years to deliver substantial streetscape, lighting, and selected signalized intersection and other
updates to Skyline Drive in the vicinity of the project. These improvements are now virtually
complete except for some signal timing revisions being finalized by the City. These are regarded as
safety, aesthetic and traffic calming improvements that are making the mobility for all users of the
corridor better from pedestrians and bicyclists to motorists.

61st Street which runs north/south functions as a 2-lane collector, and connects Imperial Avenue to
the north and Division Street to the south. The street has sidewalks and street parking is allowed. The
posted speed is 30 MPH. This roadway provides driveway access to adjacent residential land uses.

                                    NEAR-TERM CONDITIONS
Near-term conditions represent opening day of the proposed project (Year 2014). Project traffic is
added to the near-term base volumes to create the "with project" scenario.

NEAR-TERM TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Traffic growth on area roadways is a function of the expected land development, economic activity,
and changes in demographics. Several methods can be used to estimate this growth.

For this analysis a growth rate of 1% per year based on the SANDAG Series 12 traffic forecast model
was applied to existing volumes and specific project traffic from cumulative projects was added to
develop near-term base volumes. The growth rate is a conservative estimation for ambient growth in
the near-term in addition to other planned projects. Cumulative projects are planned new
developments that will add traffic to the study area roadways. The type, size, and current status of the
one known project, Bayview Baptist Church, is shown in the table below. Appendix C contains
detailed information about volume development.

NEAR-TERM CIRCULATION NETWORK

No circulation network changes are assumed for near-term conditions.

The effect of the proposed project on the study area circulation network was evaluated. Tables 4-2
and 4-3 summarize the results of the segment and intersection analysis respectively. Figures 4-1
through 4-6 show the near-term roadway segment daily volumes and intersection peak hour volumes
for both the without and with the proposed project. Additional details regarding specific intersection
operating conditions can be found on the capacity analysis worksheets in Appendix E.

                                HORIZON YEAR CONDITIONS
Horizon year conditions represent traffic conditions in 2035.

HORIZON YEAR TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Traffic growth on area roadways is a function of the expected land development, economic activity,
and changes in demographics. Several methods can be used to estimate this growth. For this analysis
a growth rate of 0.6% per year based on the SANDAG Series 12 traffic forecast model was applied to
existing volumes to develop horizon year base volumes. Final horizon year volumes were then
calculated by adding cumulative projects to the horizon year base volumes. Appendix C contains
detailed information about volume development.

HORIZON YEAR CIRCULATION NETWORK

No circulation network changes are assumed for horizon year conditions.

The effect of the proposed project on the study area circulation network was evaluated. Tables 5-1
and 5-2 summarize the results of the segment and intersection analysis respectively. Figures 5-1
through 5-6 show the horizon year roadway segment daily volumes and intersection peak hour
volumes for both the without and with the proposed project. Additional details regarding specific
intersection operating conditions can be found on the capacity analysis worksheets in Appendix F.

LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS) DEFINITIONS
The concept of LOS is defined as a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a
traffic stream, and the motorist's and/or passengers' perception of operations. A LOS definition
generally describes these conditions in terms of such factors as speed, travel time, freedom to
maneuver, comfort, convenience, and safety. Levels of service for freeway segments can generally be
categorized as shown in the table above.

Notes:
The volumes and the average daily level of service listed above are only intended as a general planning guideline.
Levels of service are not applied to residential streets since their primary purpose is to serve abutting lots, not carry through traffic. Levels of
service normally apply to roads carrying through traffic between major trip generators and attractors.
                                   Signalized Intersection Level of Service
                            Highway Capacity Manual Operational Analysis Method

 The operational analysis method for evaluation of signalized intersections presented in the 2000
 Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board Special Report 209) defines level of
 service in terms of delay, or more specifically, control stopped delay per vehicle. Delay is a measure
 of driver and/or passenger discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time.

Control Stopped Delay Per      Level of Service (LOS) Characteristics
          Vehicle
        (seconds)
           <10                 LOS A describes operations with very low delay. This occurs when progression is extremely favorable, and
                               most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
         >10 ­ 20              LOS B describes operations with generally good progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop
                               than for LOS A, causing higher levels of average delay.
         >20 ­ 35              LOS C describes operations with higher delays, which may result from fair progression and/or longer cycle
                               lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number of vehicles stopping is
                               significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
         >35 ­ 55              LOS D describes operations with high delay, resulting from some combination of unfavorable progression,
                               long cycle lengths, or high volumes. The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable, and individual
                               cycle failures are noticeable.
         >55 ­ 80              LOS E is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
           >80                 LOS F describes a condition of excessively high delay, considered unacceptable to most drivers. This
                               condition often occurs when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and
                               long cycle lengths may also be major contributing causes to such delay.

MINOR STREET STOP AND ALL-WAY STOP CONTROLLED
INTERSECTION LEVEL OF SERVICE
HIGHWAY CAPACITY MANUAL OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS METHOD

The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) analysis method for evaluating minor street stop intersections
is based on the average total delay for each impeded movement. For all-way stop controlled
intersections it is based on the average total delay for the entire intersection. As used here, total delay
is defined as the total elapsed time from when a when a vehicle stops at the end of a queue until the
vehicle departs from the stop line; this time includes the time required for the vehicle to travel from
the last-in-queue to the first-in-queue position. The average total delay for any particular minor
movement is a function of the service rate or capacity of the approach and the degree of saturation.
The resulting delay is used to determine the level of service as shown in the following table.

   Average Total Delay                                   Level of Service (LOS) Characteristics
          0-10           LOS A ­ Little or no delay
        >10 ­ 15         LOS B ­ Short traffic delay
        >15 ­ 25         LOS C ­ Average traffic delay
        >25 ­ 35         LOS D ­ Long traffic delays
        >35 ­ 50         LOS E ­ Very long traffic delays
          >50            LOS F ­ When the demand exceeds the capacity of the lane, extreme delays will be encountered and
                         queuing may cause severe congestion to the intersection.

Notes:
*         All level of service measurements are based upon HCM procedures for peak-hour conditions. However, V/C ratios for Roadway
          Segments may be estimated on an ADT/24-hour traffic volume basis (using Table 2 or an equivalent LOS chart for each
          jurisdiction). The acceptable LOS for freeways, roadways, and intersections is generally "D" ("C" for undeveloped locations).
          For metered freeway ramps, project traffic impacts are generally acceptable if they do not cause any traffic queues to exceed
          ramp storage capacities.
**        If a proposed project's traffic causes the values shown in the table to be exceeded, the impacts are determined to be significant.
          These impact changes may be measured from acceptable computer programs or expanded manual spreadsheets. The project
          applicant shall then identify feasible mitigation within the Traffic Impact Study [TIS] report that will maintain the traffic facility
          at an acceptable LOS. If the LOS with the proposed project is "E" or "F," the project applicant shall be responsible for mitigating
          significant impact changes.

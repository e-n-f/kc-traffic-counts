HNTB Corporation conducted a School Route Plan Study for Hunter's Creek Elementary
School located at 4650 Town Center Boulevard, Orange County, Florida. This study is being
performed as a part of the County's School Assessment Program to identify safe routes for

and engineering judgment, the following recommendations and conclusions were developed:

1. Overall, pedestrian and bicycle access to the school is generally safe and efficient.

2. The signing for the school crossing at Town Center Boulevard and Hunter's Creek
   Boulevard should be updated to comply with the MUTCD.

3. The signing for the crosswalk across the East Driveway should be updated for uniformity
   and to comply with the MUTCD.

4. The signing at the school crossing of Town Center Boulevard and Lord Barclay Drive/West
   Driveway should be updated to ensure uniformity, compliance with the MUTCD, and that
   the correct signing is provided for each approach that is designated as a school crossing.

5. The pedestrian detectors should be updated at the intersection of Town Center Boulevard
   and Town Loop Boulevard.

6. At the intersection of Town Center Boulevard and Town Loop Boulevard, the pedestrian
   signing should be updated to comply with the MUTCD.

7. The tree on the south approach of Town Loop Boulevard should be trimmed to allow for
   proper sign visibility.

                           3. QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT
Hunter's Creek Elementary School is located on Town Center Boulevard approximately one
half mile west of John Young Parkway. The school serves children who live in adjacent
neighborhoods on the east side of John Young Parkway from South Town Loop Boulevard to
North Town Loop Boulevard and on the west side of John Young Parkway from the Orange-
Osceola County line to south of the SR 417. All of the neighborhoods in the school zone
boundary are within the two mile walk zone.

Orange County currently provides bus service for children who live south of Town Center
Boulevard for neighborhoods on the east side of John Young Parkway and on the west side in
proximity to John Young Parkway. Figure 2 illustrates the school zone boundaries, two-mile
walk radius, and existing bus stops for Hunter's Creek Elementary School. Figure 3 is a School
Route Plan map of the area within the two-mile walk limit and the school zone boundary where
school bus service is not provided. This area is the focus of the qualitative assessment. The
school route plan area was reviewed by a registered professional engineer to evaluate vehicle,
pedestrian, and bicycle flow patterns to determine what improvements are necessary, if any, to
improve the safety and efficiency of the children traveling to and from school.

A majority of the children that walk or bicycle to the school live in the Glenhurst subdivision
located to the north of Hunter's Creek Elementary School. Sidewalks are provided throughout
this neighborhood. The main access to Town Center Boulevard from these homes is provided
via Lord Barclay Drive (eastern entrance) and Glenhurst Way. Guarded un-signalized school
crossings are provided at both of these access points. Sidewalk is also provided for
connecting the cul-de-sacs at the following locations to the sidewalk on Town Center
Boulevard: Lord Barclay Drive (western end of subdivision), Hearthside Drive, Roxshire Drive,
and Maymont Court. Access from this neighborhood to the school is provided via the sidewalk
on the north side of Town Center Boulevard and the guarded school crossing at Lord Barclay
Drive/West Driveway.

Some children were observed to walk to school from the Carrington (north side of Town Center
Boulevard) and Chelsea Landing (north side of Town Center Boulevard, east of the school)
subdivisions. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the roads within these neighborhoods.
Access from these neighborhoods to the school is provided via the sidewalk on the north side
of Town Center Boulevard and the guarded school crossing at Lord Barclay Drive/West
Driveway.

School children walking from the gated Villanova subdivision located north of Town Center
Boulevard, east of Town Loop Boulevard can use the guarded signalized crossing at Town
Loop Boulevard. They can then utilize the sidewalk on the north side of Town Center
Boulevard and the guarded school crossing at Lord Barclay Drive/West Driveway to access the
school.

There are several subdivisions located north and south of Hunter's Creek Boulevard. These
include Calabay Cove, Orista Bay, Hunter's Isle, Montana, Ashton, Ocita, Cypress Pointe, and
Timucua. Colonial Grand at Hunter's Creek Apartments is also located on the north side of
Hunter's Creek Boulevard near John Young Parkway. Bus stops are located close to Timucua
and the apartments, so it is not likely that children would be walking to school from these two
locations.

Sidewalk exists on both sides of Hunter's Creek Boulevard. School children who walk from the
other subdivisions, with the exception of the east entrance of Calabay Cove and Cypress
Pointe, would walk along Hunter's Creek Boulevard to access the guarded un-signalized
crossing at Town Center Boulevard, then use the sidewalk on the south side of Town Center
Boulevard to access the school.

Some of the north and south approach signing for the guarded un-signalized school crossing
at Town Center Boulevard and Hunter's Creek Boulevard does not comply with the MUTCD.
In addition, a school crossing exists across the west approach on Town Center Boulevard, yet
no school signing is provided. The signing for the school crossing at Town Center
Boulevard and Hunter's Creek Boulevard should be updated to comply with the MUTCD.

As for the east entrance of Calabay Cove and Cypress Pointe, a sidewalk exists behind these
two subdivisions that leads to the school. The shortest path for children in these locations
would be to use this sidewalk to the school. There are two cul-de-sacs in Cypress Pointe and
one cul-de-sac in Calabay Cove that have a paved connection to this sidewalk that children
can use to access this sidewalk.

Few children walk or bicycle from the neighborhoods located east of John Young Parkway
within the two-mile walk limit. These neighborhoods within the school boundary include The
Cottages subdivision and the Parks Apartments. Children can use the guarded signalized
school crossings provided at John Young Parkway and Town Center Boulevard (all
approaches) and at Town Loop Boulevard and Town Center Boulevard (three approaches) to
arrive at the school safely. There are two ways for these children to access the school,
depending on which side of Town Center Boulevard they are using. From the sidewalk on the
north side, children can use the guarded un-signalized crossing at Lord Barclay Drive/West
Driveway to access the school. From the sidewalk on the south side, children can use the
sidewalk provided on the east side of the school then cross the East Driveway at the
unguarded marked school crossing to access the school.

The unguarded school crossing on the East Driveway is signed as a "Children Crosswalk" for
the northbound direction and a "Student Crossing" for the southbound direction. The signing
for the crosswalk across the East Driveway should be updated for uniformity and to
comply with the MUTCD.

Hunter's Creek Elementary School was observed during the morning and afternoon hours to
assess the operations of children entering and leaving the school. The following observations
were made:

·   A guarded un-signalized school crossing exists across the north, south, and west
    approaches at Lord Barclay Drive/West Driveway. The guards are stationed at the
    intersection from 8:00 to 9:45 AM and 2:35 to 4:35 PM (with the exception of Wednesday
    early release when they are there one hour earlier). One of the school crossing guards
    present on the day of the observation did not have any comments regarding any safety
    concerns.

·   This school crossing also includes a reduced speed school zone from 40 mph to 20 mph on
    Town Center Boulevard which is activated during the hours the school crossing guards are
    present. This school zone consists of overhead "School Zone" and "End School Zone"
    signs for the east and west approaches. In addition, variable "Your Speed" signs are
    provide on the east and west approaches to encourage motorists on Town Center
    Boulevard to obey the reduced school zone speed limit. These motorists appeared to be
    traveling at or below the reduced school zone speed.

·   The signing for the school crossing at Lord Barclay Drive/West Driveway is not uniform, as
    some of the signs are old, and some of the signs are missing. The signing at the school
    crossing of Town Center Boulevard and Lord Barclay Drive/West Driveway should be
    updated to ensure uniformity, compliance with the MUTCD, and that the correct
    signing is provided for each approach that is designated as a school crossing.

·   Pedestrians and bicyclists were observed to utilize the sidewalks on the east and west
    sides of the school. Curb ramps, school crossing signs, and a crosswalk are provided to
    cross from the sidewalk on the east side of the school across the East Driveway bus loop to
    access the school. Some pedestrians and bicyclists may also use the sidewalk that runs
    behind the subdivisions on the north side of Hunter's Creek Boulevard that leads to the
    back of the school; however, this was not observed.

·   A majority of the pedestrians and bicyclists were observed to be accompanied by parents
    either to the school if using the sidewalk on the south side of Town Center Boulevard or to
    the school crossing at Lord Barclay Drive/West Driveway if using the sidewalk on the north
    side of Town Center Boulevard.

    Overall pedestrian and bicycle access to the school is generally safe and efficient.

·   Carpool vehicles enter the school parking lot via the West Driveway then circulate to the
    drop off and pick up locations at the front of the school. Proper circulation is provided
    within the school via pavement markings and cones as shown in the adjacent photographs.
    Drop off and pickup locations are in a line near the front of the school, and a passing lane is
    provided for motorists to maneuver around parked vehicles waiting for drop off and pick up.
     Carpool drivers then complete the circulation and exit through the West Driveway.

·   The West Driveway also serves the staff parking area.

·   The West Driveway exit is signed as a right turn only. No motorists were observed to
    violate the turn prohibition during the morning or afternoon school periods.

·   Busses enter and exit the school via the East Driveway bus loop and drop the children off
    at the front of the school. This operation was observed to be safe and efficient and with no
    observed conflicts between busses, vehicles, or pedestrians.

·   Westbound left turning carpool motorists were observed to complete their movement when
    eastbound vehicles on Town Center Boulevard were stopped for school children crossing
    the west approach. No conflicts were observed due to this, and adequate gaps are
    provided for these motorists to complete their movement without significant queuing or
    delay.

The signalized intersection of Town Center Boulevard and Town Loop Boulevard was
observed during the morning and afternoon school hours. The following observations were
made:

·   A guarded school crossing exists at this
    intersection across the north, south, and west
    approaches. The guards are stationed at the
    intersection from 8:00 to 9:45 AM and 2:35 to
    4:35 PM (with the exception of Wednesday early
    release). One of the school crossing guards
    present on the day of the observation did not
    have any comments regarding any safety
    concerns.

·   Countdown pedestrian signals are provided for
    each crossing, but the detectors for each of
    these signals are old as shown in the
    photograph to the right.

·   The School crossing signing and pavement markings appear to be in good condition with
    two exceptions. The pedestrian sign for eastbound vehicles located adjacent to the
    crosswalk across the west approach is old. Also, there is no pedestrian sign located
School Route Plan-Hunter's Creek Elementary School                               14

    adjacent to the crosswalk for southbound drivers. The pedestrian signing at this
    intersection should be updated to comply with the MUTCD.

·   The advanced pedestrian crosswalk sign located
    on the south approach is blocked by a tree as
    shown in the photograph to the right. The tree
    on the south approach of Town Loop
    Boulevard should be trimmed to allow for
    proper sign visibility.

Photographs of the school crossing at Lord Barclay
Drive/West Driveway, the overhead school zone, the
East and West Driveways, and the intersection of
Town Center Boulevard at Town Loop Boulevard
are included in Exhibits 1 to 3. In addition, the
school driveway intersections and the intersection of
Town Center Boulevard at Town Loop Boulevard are illustrated on Figures 4 through 6,
respectively.

                               4. RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the analysis, the field observations and engineering judgment, the
following improvements are proposed:

1. The signing for the school crossing at Town Center Boulevard and Hunter's Creek
   Boulevard should be updated to comply with the MUTCD.

2. The signing for the crosswalk across the East Driveway should be updated for uniformity
   and to comply with the MUTCD.

3. The signing at the school crossing of Town Center Boulevard and Lord Barclay Drive/West
   Driveway should be updated to ensure uniformity, compliance with the MUTCD, and that
   the correct signing is provided for each approach that is designated as a school crossing.

4. The pedestrian detectors should be updated at the intersection of Town Center Boulevard
   and Town Loop Boulevard.

5. At the intersection of Town Center Boulevard and Town Loop Boulevard, the pedestrian
   signing should be updated to comply with the MUTCD.

6. The tree on the south approach of Town Loop Boulevard should be trimmed to allow for
   proper sign visibility.

Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 have been included on the following pages to illustrate these
recommendations.

Post-Construction Traffic Study                                                June13,2013
1. SUMMARY:
Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. (KHA) was retained by the City of Santa Clara to
provide traffic engineering services for the Post-Construction Traffic Study (Study) of the
Pruneridge Avenue Bicycle Lanes Improvements Project (Project). The Project installed
bicycle lanes on Pruneridge Avenue from Pomeroy Avenue to the western City Limits.
To allow the installation of bicycle lanes and retain the existing on-street parking,
Pruneridge Avenue was modified with the following changes:

      Restriped from two traffic lanes in each direction to one traffic lane in each
       direction with a two-way left-turn lane between them.
      At the intersection of Pruneridge Avenue and Pomeroy Avenue, an eastbound
       left-turn lane was added and one of the two westbound through lanes was re-
       striped to a right-turn lane.

The purpose of this Study is to evaluate the performance of the corridor after the
modifications have been in place for a few months. This Traffic Analysis Report (Report)
summarizes the findings of the traffic analysis performed for this Study. The installation
of the bicycle lanes and lane re-striping was completed in January 2012.

2. STUDY AREA:
The study area for the Study encompasses the entire Project's corridor on Pruneridge
Avenue from Pomeroy Avenue to the western Santa Clara city limit, near Tantau Avenue
(in the City of Cupertino). Data was collected and observations were made at various
locations along the corridor including the signalized intersections and midblock
locations on Pruneridge Avenue. Figure 1 illustrates the study area.

3. TRAFFIC VOLUME DATA:
Traffic volumes are important to consider when comparing the traffic operations before
and after construction on Pruneridge Avenue due to the new lane geometry. The
corridor was modified from two lanes of traffic in each direction to one lane of traffic in
each direction, essentially cutting its capacity in half. To compare the Average Daily
Traffic (ADT) along the corridor before and after construction, 24-hour machine counts
were collected for seven days on Pruneridge Avenue between Pomeroy Avenue and
Lawrence Expressway. The machine counts were collected from Wednesday, June 6,
2012 to Tuesday, June 12, 2012. The City of Santa Clara provided 24-hr machine counts
collected before construction from Tuesday, May 11, 2010 to Thursday, May 13, 2010 at
the same location. The ADT volumes were calculated and compared. A summary of the
results can be found in Table 1. Copies of the complete ADT counts are located in the
Appendix A.

The ADT totals before and after construction of the Project differ by less than 5%.
Because of this, it is assumed that the addition of bike lanes and removal of one traffic
lane in each direction has not affected the utilization of Pruneridge Avenue by drivers.

Pruneridge Avenue currently carries an average of 12,300 vehicles per day on weekdays.
While the average daily traffic volumes are balanced, the peak period counts show the
peak directions on Pruneridge Avenue to be westbound during the morning peak
period and eastbound during the evening peak period. The maximum hourly volumes
during the data collection period were 865 vehicles in the westbound direction during
the AM peak period and 805 vehicles in the eastbound direction during the PM peak
period. These peak values are less than 50% of the theoretical maximum flow (i.e.,
saturation flow rate) of about 1900 vehicles per hour per lane. 1 These numbers show
Pruneridge Avenue is operating at much less than capacity even after removal of one
traffic lane in each direction. This was confirmed by field observations during both the
AM and PM peak periods on June 6, 2012 and June 9, 2012. Traffic flows freely on
Pruneridge Avenue between Tantau Avenue and Pomeroy Avenue with the main source
of delay coming from the long cycle lengths at Lawrence Expressway which existed
before construction.

Along with ADT counts, bicycle counts were conducted during the AM and PM peak
hours on a weekday and on the weekend both before construction of the bike lanes
project and after construction was completed. The `Before' counts were collected at the
intersection of Pruneridge Avenue and Pomeroy Avenue on Thursday, May 6, 2010 and
Saturday, May 8, 2010 between the hours of 7:30-8:30 AM and 5:00-6:00 PM. The `After'
bicycle counts were collected at the same intersection on Wednesday, June 6, 2012, and
Saturday June 9, 2012 between the same hours as the `Before' bicycle counts. Table 2
summarizes the results of the `Before' and `After' bicycle counts entering the
intersection. Copies of the complete bicycle counts are located in Appendix A.

The results of the bicycle counts show that weekday usage increased by 350% while
weekend usage increased by 17% for a net increase of 100%. The significant increase
may be attributed to more commuter bicyclists using the new bike lanes on weekdays.
The slight increase in demand on the weekend may be attributed to recreational cyclists
beginning to alter their established routes to incorporate the newly installed bike lanes
on Pruneridge Avenue. It is anticipated that a greater number of cyclists will use this
roadway as it becomes more well-known that dedicated bike lanes have been installed.

Project. Turning movement counts were collected and traffic models were created in
Synchro for both the AM (7:00-9:00 AM) and PM (4:00-6:00 PM) peak periods. Table 3
summarizes the delay results, and Level of Service (LOS); a traffic flow rating from A to F,
A being the best rating and F being the worst.

      and Pomeroy Avenue



After construction the intersection delay increased slightly during the AM peak period
but decreased slightly during the PM peak period. However, the LOS remained constant
at LOS A for both peak periods. By adding an exclusive left-turn lane to the eastbound
Pruneridge Avenue approach and an exclusive right-turn lane to the westbound
Pruneridge Avenue approach, the intersection delay remained virtually unchanged even
with the removal of one through lane in each direction. This was confirmed with field
observations during the AM and PM peak periods. The delays were observed to be
minimal during these periods.

The other signalized intersections on the corridor at Lawrence Expressway and Tantau
Avenue should see little to no impact to delay and LOS because the Project left the lane
geometry unchanged at these intersections.

5.    QUEUING ANALYSIS:
Based on the traffic models, a queuing analysis was conducted at the intersection of
Pruneridge Avenue and Pomeroy Avenue for both the AM and PM peak periods using
the 50th and 95th percentile queue lengths.

A field review of queuing was also conducted at the intersections of Pruneridge Avenue
and Pomeroy Avenue and Pruneridge Avenue and Lawrence Expressway during the AM
and PM peak periods. These observations were compared with the queuing analysis
results from the model which confirmed the model's results to be accurate. The
translation from number of vehicles to feet was done assuming an average vehicle
occupies twenty-five feet while in a queue. Table 4 shows the intersection queuing at
said intersections.

The queue lengths at Pruneridge Avenue and Pomeroy Avenue are consistent with field
observations. During the AM peak period, the westbound through movement
experienced the longest queues with an average of about nine vehicles and maximum of
twelve vehicles. During the PM peak period, the eastbound through movement
experienced the longest queues with an average of seven vehicles and maximum of nine
vehicles. The critical queue length to consider for this intersection is the eastbound left
turn. The new eastbound left turn has a storage length of 100 feet. If the queue length
exceeds this storage, the eastbound through movement will be affected adversely. Since
the 95th percentile queue lengths for the eastbound left-turns are well below 100 feet,
queuing issues are not anticipated at the intersection of Pruneridge and Pomeroy
Avenues.

Vehicle queues were also observed at the intersection of Pruneridge Avenue and
Lawrence Expressway on Wednesday, June 6, 2012, during the AM and PM peak periods.
During the AM peak period the maximum queue observed was ten vehicles in the
westbound direction and during the PM peak period the maximum queue observed was
nine vehicles in the eastbound direction. The model shows longer queues expected at
the peak periods which have been observed. Queues close to the 95th percentile queues

have been reported during the peak periods at Lawrence Expressway. These queues are
likely caused by restriping Pruneridge Avenue from two to one lane. This eliminated a
lane of vehicle storage which in turn, holding all other factors constant, would double
the length of the queue. Although the peak period queues are longer than before the
Project, the cycle length at Lawrence Expressway is of sufficient length to allow the
queue to clear the intersection within one cycle and not create any significant additional
delay.

6. TRAVEL TIME SURVEY:
A floating vehicle survey was conducted during the AM and PM weekday and weekend
peak periods to measure the existing travel time and delay along the corridor. The
surveys were conducted on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 and Saturday, June 9, 2012. The
corridor limits along Pruneridge Avenue are Tantau Avenue in the west and Pomeroy
Avenue in the east. The results of the study for each peak period are summarized in
Table 5.

[1] Travel time survey conducted between Tantau Avenue and Pomeroy Avenue with a total distance of 4,922 feet.


During the weekday AM and PM peak periods, the average travel time along Pruneridge
Avenue is just under four minutes in the eastbound direction and about three minutes
in the westbound direction. In the eastbound and westbound directions there is an
average of about three stops and average speeds around fifteen miles per hour and
nineteen miles per hour, respectively.

During the weekend, the average travel time along Pruneridge Avenue is about two and
a half minutes in both the eastbound and westbound directions. There are typically
about two stops and an average speed around twenty-two miles per hour during the
AM and PM peak periods. Copies of the complete travel time surveys are located in
Appendix C.

7. COLLISION HISTORY ANALYSIS:
As part of the Study, midblock collision data for the corridor was reviewed to determine
any trends in incident rates and types of collisions. Incidents were also sorted based on
when they occurred, before construction or after construction, to determine if the new
lane geometry has had any noticeable effect on incident rates or types.

Collision data from August 29th, 2005 through October 1st, 2012 was collected for
Pruneridge Avenue between Pomeroy Avenue and Tantau Avenue. The data was
organized by location into three different segments on Pruneridge Avenue in each
direction. Before the Project (August 29th, 2005 to January 3rd, 2012) a total of 45
collisions were reported along these segments of Pruneridge Avenue over 76 months,
resulting in an average of just over one collision every two months. Of these collisions,
eighteen were reported as injury collisions and none were reported as fatalities. After
the Project (January 4th, 2012 to October 1st, 2012) a total of 6 collisions were reported
on these segments of Pruneridge Avenue over approximately 8 months, resulting in an
average of 0.75 collisions per month. Of these collisions, none were reported as injury or
fatality collisions. The collision data is summarized in Table 6.

Midblock collisions on The Pruneridge Avenue corridor are shown by time of day and
direction of travel in Figure 2 where it can be seen that the pattern of collisions closely
correlates to hourly traffic volumes along the corridor. About 60% of the collisions
reported on Pruneridge Avenue over this seven year period occurred during the AM,
Midday, and PM peak periods indicating that high traffic volumes are contributing
factors.

Eastbound and westbound midblock collisions by type and by segment for Pruneridge
Avenue are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. Typically, rear-end collisions
are the predominate type of collision that occurs. This type of collision is often
associated with congested conditions where stop and go driving takes place. 13% of the
collision that occurred before construction were sideswipe collisions. The occurrence of
this type of collision is likely to diminish with the reduction to a single traffic lane in each
direction.

Before construction, there was an average of 1.22 collisions per million vehicle miles of
travel on the Pruneridge Avenue corridor. Since construction was completed, the
corridor has averaged 1.20 collisions per million vehicle miles of travel. Both of these
rates fall below the national average of 1.86 collisions per million vehicle miles of travel. 2
These statistics will prove more telling as time passes because the study duration for
incidents before construction is longer than the study duration for incidents after
construction. A copy of the complete Traffic Collision History Report is located in
Appendix D.

8. CONCLUSIONS:
The Pruneridge Avenue Bicycle Lanes Improvements Project installed dedicated bicycle
lanes along the Project corridor while retaining on-street parking. The intention of
installing bicycle lanes was to increase safety for cyclists, motorists and residents on the
corridor and encourage cycling, by reducing vehicle and bicycle interactions. With the
added safety inherent in dedicated bicycle lanes, ridership on Pruneridge Avenue has
increased significantly and is expected to continue to rise as more cyclists become
aware of the bike lane installations. One of the most visible changes to the Pruneridge
Avenue corridor is the reduction from two traffic lanes in each direction to one traffic
lane in each direction with a two-way left-turn lane in the middle.

To gain a complete picture of how the corridor is operating after construction, traffic
counts were collected, field observations were made and a floating-car survey was

performed. The traffic counts showed that Pruneridge Avenue is being utilized by
motorists at the same rate as before the bicycle lanes project.

With only one lane of traffic in each direction, the occurrence of sideswipe type
collisions is likely to diminish, adding safety to the corridor for motorists. The installation
of a two-way left-turn lane allows left turning vehicles, turning onto streets or into
driveways, to wait for gaps in traffic without blocking the through traffic lane. This
improvement decreases delay for motorists and will likely reduce the number of rear-
end collisions on the corridor.

There is a concern that the new configuration at the intersection of Pruneridge Avenue
and Harvard Avenue will impact traffic operations adversley. Eastbound traffic on
Pruneridge Avenue has to merge from two lanes to one lane just beyond the
intersection. The concern is that eastbound traffic turning left onto northbound Harvard
Avenue blocks the inside through lane on eastbound Pruneridge Avenue. The
combination of the merge and the left-turning vehicles potentially create a confusing
situation for drivers.

The lane geometry at this intersection was evaluated for consistency with design
standards. Using the posted speed limit of 35 mph, the required merge length and the
stopping sight distance on the eastbound approach of Pruneridge Avenue at Havard
Avenue both exceed the standards of 245' and 250', respectively.3

While the current roadway geometry meets applicable standards at the intersection,
there may still be options to improve the current operations given the potential
confusing situation described above. One option is to restripe the approach to provide a
short left-turn pocket for the movement from eastbound Pruneridge Avenue to
northbound Harvard Avenue. This option would reduce the possibility of turning
vehicles blocking the inside through lane. Another option is to move the lane-drop
(merge) further to the east on Pruneridge Avenue. By doing this, the confusing situation
along this approach would be minimized, if not eliminated. Implementing this would
require lane restriping and likely a loss of on-street parking along eastbound Pruneridge
Avenue. Based on professional engineering judgement, the second option of moving
the lane-drop (merge) further east is recommended. However, the impacts from the loss
of on-street parking will need to be considered by the City.

There is a concern that the larger queues at Pruneridge Avenue and Pomeroy Avenue
will lead to an increased frequency of rear-end collisions. This project did not change
roadway sight distances. Per the California Highway Design Manual (6th Edition), the

stopping sight distance for a 35-mph roadway is 250 feet. There is adequate visibility
along the roadway for vehicles traveling at the posted speed limit to stop before
queued vehicles. To raise driver awareness of stopped vehicles, the installation of
"Watch for Stopped Vehicles" SW60(CA) warning sign can be installed after a collision
history has been developed. Per California MUTCD (2012), this sign should be placed
100 feet in advance of expected vehicle queue.

Improvements were also made to the intersection of Pruneridge Avenue and Pomeroy
Avenue in the bicycle lanes project. These include an exclusive eastbound left-turn lane,
an exclusive westbound right-turn lane, new ADA compliant curb ramps and new
handicap accessible pedestrian push buttons. These modifications provide benefits for
both vehicles and pedestrians using the intersection.

A queuing analysis, as well as level of service and delay calculations, was performed with
the help of a Synchro model and SimTraffic. The results from the analysis were then
compared with the study performed before construction of the bike lanes project. The
level of service calculation resulted in an LOS A and the delay remained virtually
unchanged indicating the intersection is operating as well as it did before construction
of the Project. The queuing analysis results showed that the 50th and 95th percentile
queues will not cause significant issues at the intersection. All of the results from the
analysis were confirmed with field observations during the peak traffic hours.

To keep queues on Pruneridge Avenue from impacting traffic flows from cross-streets,
installation of "Keep Clear" pavement markings at the following intersections near the
eastbound approach of Pruneridge Avenue/ Pomeroy Avenue and eastbound and
westbound approaches of Pruneridge Avenue/ Lawrence Expressway is recommended:
     Pruneridge Avenue/ Geneva Drive
     Pruneridge Avenue/ Tracy Drive
     Pruneridge Avenue/ Hillsdale Avenue (existing "Keep Clear" at Pruneridge
        Avenue/ Norwood Circle)
     Pruneridge Avenue/ Harvard Avenue

Overall, the Project improved safety for cyclists and motorists, increased cycling
ridership on the corridor and improved pedestrian operation at Pomeroy Avenue
without adversely affecting traffic operations, including parking, delay, or level of
service.

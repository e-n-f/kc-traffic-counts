EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to determine the traffic impact that will result from the
development's access point on SR 120 (Roswell Road) across from Providence Road. The
developed site will contain a Continuing Care Retirement Community that includes independent
living as well as healthcare and assisted living units. The traffic analysis evaluated the existing
conditions at the Providence Road intersection with SR 120 (Roswell Road) and future buildout
(2017) conditions with the traffic generated by the development and geometric modifications to
the intersection.

From the existing conditions analysis, it was found that the study intersection is currently
operating at a level-of-service of C or better during peak hours, which is better than minimum
industry standards. The future conditions analysis indicates that the study intersection will
continue to operate at a level-of-service of C or better after including site generated traffic.
Recommendations have been made in this report regarding changes to the signal phasing at the
intersection and necessary geometric modifications to accommodate the site driveway's
approach. A recommendation is also included to lengthen the storage for the eastbound left turn
lane on Roswell Road based on current and future traffic demands.

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this study is to determine the traffic impact that will result from the
development's access point on SR 120 (Roswell Road) across from Providence Road. Measures
to avoid or mitigate possible impacts have been identified where appropriate. The proposed
development will be a new Continuing Care Retirement Community located in unincorporated
Cobb County. The largest portion of the development, closest to SR 120 (Roswell Road), is
designed as independent senior living that will include centralized amenities like dining,
housekeeping, and recreational activities. A separate health care building at the back of the
property will provide 150 healthcare units that focus on assisted living and nursing care. A
location map for the site is shown in Figure 1.

1.1 Site Plan
A site plan for this project is shown in Figure 2. A larger size drawing and a digital copy of the
site plan are also provided with this report.

1.2 Consistency with Adopted Comprehensive County Plan
The property is currently characterized as a "Suburban Residential" in the Cobb County 2030
Comprehensive Plan. The future land use map indicates the property as low density residential,
with medium density residential for the adjacent property to the east and neighborhood activity
center for the adjacent property to the north. The adjacent property to the west is East Cobb Park
and Fullers Park.

1.3 Project Phasing
The project's impact has been evaluated in one phase, estimated for completion in the year 2017.
This study will evaluate the traffic operations in the vicinity of the site for the existing (2013)
conditions and future (2017) conditions including the added traffic from the development.

2. TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation estimates were calculated according to the rates and equations published in the
9th edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. The
Continuing Care Retirement Community land use (ITE Land Use 255) was considered; however,
this was ruled out because of the manual's cautions regarding the varying proportions within the
limited data used. The trip generation for the development was instead based on the following
ITE Land Uses: 253 ­ Congregate Care Facility, 620 ­ Nursing Home, and 254 ­ Assisted
Living.

In regards to the Congregate Care Facility land use, The ITE Trip Generation Manual (9th
Edition) states that "vehicle ownership levels were very low at congregate care facilities; the
facilities' employees or services provided to the residents generated the majority of the trips to
the sites." For the Assisted Living land use, ITE adds that "one study reported that according to
national and local data, less than 5 percent of the residents owned cars, which were rarely
driven."

Trip generation calculations for the development are shown in Table 1.

3. TRIP DISTRIBUTION & ASSIGNMENT
The trip distribution is the percentage of the traffic generated by the site that travels to and from
the site on each segment of the surrounding roadway network. The trip distribution, shown in
Figure 3, was estimated based on GDOT and Cobb ADT volumes and the location of major
roadways and highways that will serve the development. The site-generated volumes were then
distributed to the surrounding roadway network based on the driver's destination and the most
easily accessible route.




                                                                            A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                 4
4. STUDY NETWORK DETERMINATION
The study network was determined by evaluating the amount of traffic that the proposed
development will add to each roadway segment in the area. According to GRTA requirements, a
roadway segment carries a "significant" amount of traffic if the project contributes 7% or more
trips to the two-way daily service volumes of the roadway at the appropriate level of service
standard. Upon agreement with GRTA a level of service standard of "D" was used for
determining the study area network.

The traffic generated by the proposed project was then assigned to the area roadways using the
trip distribution to determine the site-generated traffic on each roadway segment. The boundaries
of the study network extend to the most distant intersections where at least 7% of the service
volumes on the segment are attributed to project traffic. The following study intersection fell
within the 7% rule and/or have been selected as being suitable for evaluation in discussions with
GRTA, GDOT and Cobb County:

   x   SR 120 (Roswell Road) @ Providence Road

The study intersection is shown graphically in Figure 4. Other intersections within this corridor,
such as unsignalized side streets, right-in / right-out driveways or private driveways were viewed
as not being significantly impacted and have not been included in the study network.




                                                                         A&R Engineering Inc.

The following improvements have been identified in the Regional Transportation Plan (Plan
2040). These improvements are within the vicinity of the proposed development.

6. EXISTING CONDITIONS
The Existing Conditions analyses include an inventory of the transportation facilities at the study
location and an evaluation of the current traffic operations in terms of delays and queuing. Other
relevant observations are included from site visits and reported information from the local
jurisdiction and GDOT.

6.1 Description of Transportation Facilities in Study Network
An inventory was performed of the roadways in the area surrounding the site. The following is a
brief description of each of these facilities.



                                                                          A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                8
SR 120 (Roswell Road)
SR 120 is an east-west, divided four lane roadway with a posted speed limit of 45 mph in the
vicinity of the site.

Providence Road
Providence Road is a north-south, two-lane, undivided roadway with a posted with a speed limit
of 35 mph in the vicinity of the site.

6.2 Existing Analysis Summary

Existing traffic counts were performed at the intersections listed in Section 4 - Study Area
Network. In addition to traffic counts, intersection geometry data was also obtained. Turning
movement counts were collected during standard morning and evening hours of 7:00 AM ­ 9:00
AM and 4:00 PM ­ 6:00 PM on a weekday. The four consecutive 15-minute interval volumes
that summed to produce the highest volume at each intersection during each two-hour period
were then determined. These volumes make up the AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes for
the intersections counted.

The counts for the intersection of SR 120 at Providence Road were collected on May 21, 2013.
The existing traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5 and the existing intersections traffic control
and lane geometry for the study area network is shown in Figure 6. Existing traffic operations at
all study intersections were analyzed in accordance with HCM methodology using Synchro
software. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 3.

The result of the existing intersection analysis indicates that the study intersection is currently
operating at a LOS D standard. Queue lengths have been analyzed for the current traffic
conditions at the study intersection. The 95th percentile queue lengths are shown in Table 4.




                                                                          A&R Engineering Inc.

The results in Table 4 show that there is currently insufficient storage for the eastbound left turn
lane on SR 120 (Roswell Road) during the evening peak hour. If feasible, it is recommended that
this left turn lane be extended to accommodate the vehicle queues (200+ feet) at the intersection
as a system improvement.

6.3 Accident History

Accident report history was obtained at the intersection of SR 120 (Roswell Rd) / Providence Rd
West. During the most recent three years (2010, 2011, and 2012) there have been 27 accidents at
the intersection, ranging from 6-11 accidents each year. Of the 27 accidents reported, 10 were
rear-end collisions, 2 were sideswipe collisions, and 8 were not collisions with another vehicle
(e.g. deer, sign, tree). The remaining 7 accidents in the past three years involved head-on or
angled collisions. Five of the angle and head-on collisions involved eastbound left turning
vehicles colliding with westbound through vehicles at the intersection. A common theme in
these reports includes left turns failing to yield to through traffic. The remaining two angle
collisions were between eastbound U-turning vehicles and southbound right turning vehicles.
There is an sign on Providence Road directing right turners to yield to U-turning vehicles on
Roswell Road. Accident data and collision diagrams are also included in the Appendix.




                                                                           A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                10
7. FUTURE YEAR BACKGROUND TRAFFIC
In order to evaluate future traffic operations in this area, a projection was made for base year
traffic volumes. It was agreed upon with GRTA to use a growth factor of 1% per year up to
2017. This growth factor accounts for the expected increases in non-site related traffic volumes
on SR 120 (Roswell Road) and Providence Road. The growth rate was applied to the existing
traffic volumes on the roadways to estimate the future year 2017 traffic volumes prior to the
addition of the site-generated volumes. Future year (base) traffic volumes for 2017 for the study
intersection are shown in Figure 7.




                                                                         A&R Engineering Inc.
                                               13
8. FUTURE YEAR TOTAL TRAFFIC
The traffic volumes that will be generated by the proposed development (Figure 8) were added to
the future base traffic volumes in order to determine the traffic volumes that will be on the
roadway network after completion of the project. The future traffic volumes for 2017, including
the site-generated volumes for the study intersections, are shown in Figure 9.




                                                                       A&R Engineering Inc.

9. FACILITY NEEDS ANALYSIS
9.1 Site Access

The future site proposes a single full access driveway that will act as the only access to the
development. The proposed driveway will add a northbound to the signalized intersection of
Providence Road at SR 120 (Roswell Road). It is recommended that the driveway approach be
given a dedicated left turn lane and a shared through / right lane for traffic exiting the
development. If feasible, Providence Road should be restriped to include a short through lane to
accommodate one or two cars worth of stacking for vehicles that would enter the site from this
approach. Because of the acute angle of the intersection, it is important that care be given to
align through movements along the side street approaches to the intersection (Providence Road
and the site driveway).

It is also recommended that the side street approaches (Providence Road and the site driveway)
have permissive signal phasing with similar split times as the current signal timing plan, in
which 37 seconds of time is allocated to the side streets during each cycle. The projected traffic
volumes turning left from SR 120 (Roswell Road) into the site do not warrant the inclusion of a
westbound left turn lane; therefore, permissive phasing is recommended for this approach as
well.

GDOT standards require the installation of a left and right turn lane on SR 120 (Roswell Road)
for traffic entering the development as there are greater than 75 right-turns per day and greater
than 250 left turns per day. The current westbound left lane at the intersection will be utilized for
traffic entering the site driveway. There is an existing bus lane that can be utilized in
construction of a right turn on SR 120 (Roswell Road) for traffic entering the site; however, it
will likely need to be lengthened.

9.2 Intersection Analysis

The future year total traffic volumes were used to analyze the study network intersections. This
analysis assumes the required left and right turn lanes are constructed with the site driveway,
along with the recommended signal phasing discussed in Section 9.1. The results of the analysis
are shown in Table 5.

The result of the future intersection analysis indicates that the study intersection will continue to
operate at the same level-of-service as in the existing conditions, with minor increases in overall
delay at the intersection. The recommended traffic control and lane geometry for the site
driveways are shown in Figure 10.

The calculated future 95th percentile queue lengths for the study intersection are shown in Table
6.

A recommendation from the existing conditions queue analysis (Section 6.2) was to extend the
storage for this lane to 200 feet to accommodate current stacking demands for this movement.
With the proposed changes to signal timing and configuration of the intersection to
accommodate the site driveway approach, the eastbound left turn lane is anticipated to need
additional storage to accommodate 230 feet of storage.

10. EXPEDITED REVIEW CRITERIA
According to the Criteria for Expedited Review as outlined in Section 3-102 of the Procedures
and Principles for GRTA DRI Review (Effective Date: February 13, 2013):

       "A proposed DRI shall be eligible for Expedited Review if the Proposed DRI complies
       with the requirements of any one of the subsections B, C, D, E, or F, of this Section 3-
       102, and is consistent with all of the general criteria applicable to the proposed DRIs
       listed in Section 3-101."

Section 3-102, Subsection B.2 further states:

       "More than one thousand (1,000) but no more than three thousand (3,000) gross daily
       trips will be generated by the DRI, based on a trip generation memorandum and requires
       the submittal of an Access Analysis."

As indicated in the trip generation analysis in this report (Section 2, Table 1), the development
will generate 2,064 projected daily trips. Therefore, the expedited DRI criterion is met and is
supported with the Access Analysis in this Traffic Impact Study.

The following information is in reference to Section 3-101, General Criteria Applicable to All
Proposed DRIs:

A.     Accessibility
       The proposed DRI is designed to provide both vehicular and pedestrian access to the site.
       Sidewalks are in-place along SR 120 (Roswell Road) and will be continued into the site.
       Furthermore, sidewalks are planned between onsite buildings, amenities, and trail areas.
B.     Connectivity
       The proposed DRI will provide access to SR 120 (Roswell Road) at an existing traffic
       signal. The proposed intersection modifications will provide safe ingress and egress to
       the public roadway and without significant impacts anticipated to the current operations
       in the area.
C.     Access Management
       The operational characteristics of the proposed site access have been evaluated in the
       previous sections in this Traffic Impact Study and are further outlined in the following
       section.
D.     Regional Policies and Adopted Plans
       The proposed development does not conflict with planned or programmed improvements
       in the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) or Transportation Improvement Program
       (TIP) as indicated in Section 5 of this report.
E.     Local Standards Supporting Regional Policies
       The proposed DRI does not conflict with locally adopted codes that support regionally
       adopted policies and does not conflict with the locally adopted comprehensive plan as
       discussed in Section 1.2 of this report.


                                                                         A&R Engineering Inc.
                                                21
11. SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ANALYSIS
From the existing conditions analysis, it was found that the study intersection is currently
operating at a level-of-service of D or better, which is in accordance with industry standards. The
future conditions analysis indicates that the study intersection will continue to operate at a level-
of-service of D or better after adding including site generated traffic.

No improvements are need to the road network to mitigate site traffic except for those required
to accommodate the site driveway's approach to the signalized intersection of SR 120 (Roswell
Road) at Providence Road. These improvements have been summarized below. Further details
can be found in Section 9.1 ­ Site Access.

   x   The site driveway's approach to the signal should be given a dedicated left turn lane and
       a shared through / right lane for traffic exiting the development.
   x   If feasible, Providence Road should be restriped to include a short through lane to
       accommodate one or two cars worth of stacking for vehicles that would enter the site
       from this approach.
   x   The existing traffic signal equipment at the intersection should be upgraded to
       accommodate the fourth approach and all pedestrian movements.
   x   The eastbound left turn lane should be extended to accommodate 200 feet of storage.
   x   An eastbound right turn lane should be provided for traffic entering the site from SR 120
       (Roswell Road).

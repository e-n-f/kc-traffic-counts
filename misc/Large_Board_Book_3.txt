I.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION

      This report presents a summary of findings for a Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis
      performed by HNTB Corporation, Inc. for the intersection of 183A Frontage Road and
      Hero Way in Leander, Williamson County, Texas. A Site Location Map has been included
      in the Appendix of this report as Exhibit 1.

      In order to conduct the signal warrant analysis 24-hour traffic counts were collected for the
      intersection of 183A and Hero Way on January 16, 2014. Based on previous data obtained
      in September 2013 for the Annual Traffic Report, the intersection of 183A Southbound
      Frontage Road and Hero Way had the highest volumes and number of accidents. This data
      can be found in the Appendix of this report as Exhibit 2. A site visit was also conducted to
      observe the geometric configuration of the intersection as well as any unique characteristics
      about the approaches.

      The intersection of 183A and Hero Way is currently a diamond interchange with the
      frontage road divided with 183A main lanes. The northbound and southbound frontage
      roads speed limit is 60 mph and Hero Way Approach is 45 mph. Hero Way Approach is
      currently stop-controlled at both intersections.


II.   ANALYSIS

      The 2011 Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (TMUTCD) requires that
      certain warrants be met prior to the installation of a traffic signal. These warrants are
      summarized at follows:

      1.       Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume             5.       School Crossing
      2.       Four-Hour Vehicular Volume              6.       Coordinated Signal System
      3.       Peak Hour                               7.       Crash Experience
      4.       Pedestrian Volume                       8.       Roadway Network
                                                       9.       Intersection Near a Grade Crossing

      Below are the TMUTCD descriptions of the Traffic Signal Warrants. In addition to the
      descriptions, TMUTCD also considers sound engineering judgment and recommendations
      as enough evidence to warrant the necessity of a traffic signal.

      A.   Warrant 1 ­ Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume

           This warrant involves three (3) conditions (A, B, or a combination of A and B) which
           can individually satisfy the conditions of Warrant 1. Condition A is the Minimum
           Vehicular Volume which is intended for application at locations where a large
           volume of intersecting traffic is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic
           control signal. Condition B is the Interruption of Continuous Traffic which is
           intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that
           traffic on a minor street suffers excessively.

                                               1
B.   Warrant 2 ­ Four-Hour Vehicular Volume

     This warrant is intended to be applied where the volumes of intersecting traffic is the
     principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal.

C.   Warrant 3 ­ Peak Hour

     This warrant is intended for use at a location where traffic conditions are such that for
     a minimum of one (1) hour of an average day, the minor-street traffic suffers undue
     delay when entering or crossing the major street.

D.   Warrant 4 ­ Pedestrian Volume

     This warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is
     so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street.

E.   Warrant 5 ­ School Crossing

     This warrant is intended for application where the fact that school children cross the
     major street is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal.

F.   Warrant 6 ­ Coordinated Signal System

     This warrant is when progressive movement in a coordinated signal system
     sometimes necessitates installing traffic control signals at intersections where they
     would not otherwise be needed in order to maintain proper platooning of vehicles.

G.   Warrant 7 ­ Crash Experience

     This warrant is intended for application where the severity and frequency of crashes
     are the principal reasons to consider installing a traffic control signal. Requests for
     crash data have been submitted to TxDOT and we have yet to receive them.

H.   Warrant 8 ­ Roadway Network

     This warrant is analyzed when installing a traffic control signal at some intersections
     might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a
     roadway.

I.   Warrant 9 ­ Intersection Near a Grade Crossing

     This warrant is analyzed when installing a traffic control signal at some intersections
     might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a
     roadway.


                                         2
III. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   The following results and recommendations are based on data that has been collected,
   standards set by the TMUTCD. The signal warrant was performed for the 183A
   Southbound Frontage Road and Hero Way existing conditions. Due to the high volume of
   accidents, Warrant 7 was analyzed but did not meet the minimum volumes criteria.
   Warrant 3 satisfied the peak hour criteria therefore a traffic signal installation is
   recommended to be installed. Please refer to Exhibit 3 within the Appendix of this report
   for the detailed Signal Warrant Worksheets.

I.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION

      This report presents a summary of findings for a Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis
      performed by HNTB Corporation, Inc. for the intersection of 183A Frontage Road and
      Scottsdale Drive in Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas. A Site Location Map has been
      included in the Appendix of this report as Exhibit 1.

      In order to conduct the signal warrant analysis 24-hour traffic counts were collected for the
      intersection of 183A and Scottsdale Drive on September 18-19, 2013. In addition to the
      24-hour traffic counts, turning movements counter were collected on September 19, 2013
      and updated turning movement counts were collected on December 13, 2013. This data
      can be found in the Appendix of this report as Exhibit 2. A site visit was also conducted to
      observe the geometric configuration of the intersection as well as any unique characteristics
      about the approaches.

      The intersection of 183A and Scottsdale Drive is currently a diamond interchange with the
      frontage road divided with 183A mainlanes. The 183A northbound and southbound
      frontage roads speed limit is 60 mph and Scottsdale Drive approach is 25 mph. Scottsdale
      Drive approach is currently stop-controlled at both intersections.


II.   ANALYSIS

      The 2011 Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (TMUTCD) strongly
      recommends at least one warrant be met prior to the installation of a traffic signal. These
      warrants are summarized at follows:

      1.       Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume            5.        School Crossing
      2.       Four-Hour Vehicular Volume             6.        Coordinated Signal System
      3.       Peak Hour                              7.        Crash Experience
      4.       Pedestrian Volume                      8.        Roadway Network
                                                      9.        Intersection Near a Grade Crossing

      Below are the TMUTCD descriptions of the Traffic Signal Warrants. In addition to the
      descriptions, TMUTCD also considers sound engineering judgment and recommendations
      as enough evidence to warrant the necessity of a traffic signal.

      A.   Warrant 1 ­ Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume

           This warrant involves three (3) conditions (A, B, or a combination of A and B) which
           can individually satisfy the conditions of Warrant 1. Condition A is the Minimum
           Vehicular Volume which is intended for application at locations where a large
           volume of intersecting traffic is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic
           control signal. Condition B is the Interruption of Continuous Traffic which is
           intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that
           traffic on a minor street suffers excessively.

                                               1
B.   Warrant 2 ­ Four-Hour Vehicular Volume

     This warrant is intended to be applied where the volumes of intersecting traffic is the
     principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal.

C.   Warrant 3 ­ Peak Hour

     This warrant is intended for use at a location where traffic conditions are such that for
     a minimum of one (1) hour of an average day, the minor-street traffic suffers undue
     delay when entering or crossing the major street.

D.   Warrant 4 ­ Pedestrian Volume

     This warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on a major street is
     so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major street.

E.   Warrant 5 ­ School Crossing

     This warrant is intended for application where the fact that school children cross the
     major street is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control signal.

F.   Warrant 6 ­ Coordinated Signal System

     This warrant is when progressive movement in a coordinated signal system
     sometimes necessitates installing traffic control signals at intersections where they
     would not otherwise be needed in order to maintain proper platooning of vehicles.

G.   Warrant 7 ­ Crash Experience

     This warrant is intended for application where the severity and frequency of crashes
     are the principal reasons to consider installing a traffic control signal.

H.   Warrant 8 ­ Roadway Network

     This warrant is analyzed when installing a traffic control signal at some intersections
     might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a
     roadway.

I.   Warrant 9 ­ Intersection Near a Grade Crossing

     This warrant is analyzed when installing a traffic control signal at some intersections
     might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a
     roadway.



                                         2
III. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   The following results and recommendations are based on data that has been collected,
   standards set by the TMUTCD. Due to the high volume of accidents, Warrant 7 was
   analyzed but did not meet the minimum volumes criteria. Warrants 2 (Four-hour Vehicular
   Volume) and 3 (Peak Hour) satisfied the volume criteria set by TMUTCD therefore a
   traffic signal installation is recommended to be installed. For analysis purposes, Scottsdale
   Drive was evaluated as a single lane approach and the WB right turning vehicles were not
   considered because the right-turn lane is currently free-flowing. Please refer to Exhibit 3
   within the Appendix of this report for the detailed Signal Warrant Worksheets.

Description of Matter:
       This item authorizes the Executive Director, with approval of the Executive
Committee, to issue any Directive Letters, in an amount not to exceed $5 million, under
the design/build contract with Central Texas Mobility Constructors, LLC, for
development of the Manor Expressway Project.
       Because of the critical importance of completing the Manor Expressway Project
on schedule, the Executive Director recommends that the Board authorize his approval
to issue Directive Letters, in an amount not to exceed $5 million, for certain change
orders to Central Texas Mobility Constructors, LLC. The Executive Director shall
promptly provide a written report to the members of the Board of Directors describing
each such approved Directive Letter and his reason for issuing that Directive Letter.
       Most change orders will continue to be scheduled for Board approval during a
regular monthly meeting, but this power will allow the Executive Director to act on
behalf of the Mobility Authority if circumstances require the issuance of a Directive
Letter in the period between the Board's monthly meetings.

WHEREAS, Section 101.038(b)(7) of the Policy Code provides that the Executive Director
"shall have such obligations and authority as may be described in one or more Resolutions
enacted from time to time by the board;" and

WHEREAS, under Section 14.1.1.2 of the Design/Build Comprehensive Development
Agreement with Central Texas Mobility Constructors, LLC, ("CTMC") effective June 15, 2011
(the "Contract"), the Mobility Authority may issue a Directive Letter to CTMC to require

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Executive Director shall promptly provide a written
report to the members of the Board of Directors describing each such approved Directive Letter

                             (d)     to revise other terms and conditions      of the Contract

                            Upon the CTRMA's approval of the matters set forth in the
Change Order form, whether it is initiated by the CTRMA or D/B CDA Developer, the CTRMA
shall execute such Change Order form.

                 14.1.1.2    Issuance of Directive Letter.

                                The CTRMA may, at any time, issue a letter to D/B CDA
Developer in the event of any desired change in the Development Work or in the event of any
dispute regarding the scope of the Development Work to be performed by D/B CDA Developer
(a "Directive Letter"). The Directive Letter will describe the Development Work in question
and will state the basis for determining compensation, if any. D/B CDA Developer will proceed
immediately with the Development Work as directed in the Directive Letter, pending the
execution of a formal Change Order or, ifthe Directive Letter states that the Development Work
is within the original scope of the Development Work, D/B CDA Developer will proceed with
the Development Work as directed, but shall have the right to submit the question of entitlement
to a Change Order and the amount of allowable additional compensation and time to dispute
resolution in accordance with Section 25 of this Agreement.

                 14.1.1.3    Prerequisites for Change Orders for Work Outside of Scope.

                              As a condition precedent to D/B CDA Developer's entitlement to a
price increase or time extension for work which D/B CDA Developer believes is outside of the
scope of the Development Work, D/B CDA Developer shall have received either a Directive
Letter from the CTRMA stating that it is issued pursuant to Section 14.1.1.2 or a Change Order
for such item signed by the CTRMA. D/B CDA Developer shall not be entitled to additional
compensation or time extension for any such work performed prior to receipt of a Directive
Letter or Change Order, except to the extent that Section 14.3.2.2 preserves D/B CDA
Developer's right to compensation for work performed following delivery of a Request for
Change Order Resolution Meeting. D/B CDA Developer acknowledges that it will be at risk if it
elects to proceed with any such work, since CTRMA may later decide not to provide direction
with regard to such work.

                   14.1.1.4   Additional Provisions Concerning Directive Letters.

                           In addition to provision of a Proposed Change Order ("PCO")
Notice and subsequent Change Order request pursuant to Section 14.3.2, receipt of a Directive
Letter from the CTRMA shall be a condition precedent to D/B CDA Developer's right to make a
Claim that a CTRMA-Directed Change has occurred. However, the fact that a Directive Letter
was issued by the CTRMA shall not be considered evidence that a CTRMA-Directed Change has
occurred. The determination as to whether a CTRMA-Directed Change has occurred shall be
based on an analysis of the original requirements of the Contract Documents and a determination
whether the Directive Letter constituted a change in those requirements. The foregoing
requirements do not require that a Directive Letter be issued by the CTRMA in order for D/B
CDA Developer to have the right to receive compensation for Development Work within the
original scope of the Development Work (such as certain types of Utility Adjustment Work) for
which additional compensation is specifically allowed under this Section 14.

          14.1.2 Right of the CTRMA to Issue Change Orders.

        The CTRMA may, at any time and from time to time, without notice to any Surety or
Guarantor, authorize andlor require changes in the Development Work within the general scope
of the Development Work pursuant to a Change Order. All additions, deductions or changes to
the Development Work as directed by Change Orders shall be executed under the conditions of
the original Contract Documents.

14.2 Procedure for Issuance of Change Orders by the CTRMA.

       This Section 14.2 concerns Change Orders issued by the CTRMA following a Request
for Change Proposal and Change Orders unilaterally issued by the CTRMA.

         14.2.1 Request for Change Proposal.

               14.2.1.1        If the CTRMA desires to issue a CTRMA-Directed Change or to
evaluate whether to initiate such a change, the CTRMA may, at its discretion, issue a Request for
Change Proposal. The CTRMA may, at any time, ask D/B CDA Developer to provide two
alternative Change Order forms in accordance with Section 14.3.3.

                14.2.1.2       Within five Business Days after D/B CDA Developer's receipt of a
Request for Change Proposal, the CTRMA and D/B CDA Developer shall arrange an initial
consultation (at no charge to the CTRMA) concerning the estimated cost and time impacts. D/B
CDA Developer shall provide data regarding such matters as requested by the CTRMA.

               14.2.1.3     After the initial consultation and delivery by D/B CDA Developer
of data and information as described in Section 14.2.1.2, the CTRMA shall notify D/B CDA

                                                  adopt the exceptions authorized by state law
                                                  from procurement requirements for a county.

Description of Matter: The Procurement Policies adopted in the Policy Code require a
competitive bidding or competitive proposal process for all goods and services that cost
more than $50,000 if not otherwise subject to a specific procurement process established
by state law or the Policy Code. This amendment to the Policy Code authorizes the
board, in its discretion, to approve an exemption from a competitive bidding or
competitive proposal process for those goods or services the Legislature has authorized
a county to exempt from competitive bidding or proposal requirements established by
the County Purchasing Act.

The list of discretionary exemptions from Section 262.024, Local Government Code, is
incorporated into the Policy Code by reference (copy attached for reference). The
discretionary exemptions most likely to be relevant to the Mobility Authority are those
purchases needed to preserve public health or safety, necessary because of unforeseen
damage to public property, for personal services, or for a professional services not
subject to the Professional Services Procurement Act.

                                                        Economic Commentary
After strong gains in 2013, markets generally stumbled in January. Global equity markets largely ended the month down, and
most spread sectors widened. Meanwhile, Treasury markets rallied, as the U.S. Treasury yield curve between two and five- year
maturities flattened by 20 basis points (bps) on the month. The yield of the two-year note decreased 5 bps to 0.33%, and the yield of
the five-year note fell 25 bps to 1.49%. While the weak December U.S. employment report was generally dismissed as an anomaly
due to weather, the other economic data during the month reflected less strength than expected. Despite the recent slowdown in
economic data and the subsequent rate rally in January, the view on the economy remains largely unchanged. Above-trend growth
for the U.S. over the medium term is expected, led by the consumer, as the political uncertainty and the effects of the fiscal drag
of 2013 fade away. Consumers ended the fourth quarter of 2013 with positive momentum that should continue into 2014. The first
quarter should see a rebound in government spending. The drop in federal government spending attributable to the shutdown in
October should reverse as federal employees work a full quarter. Furthermore, as tax receipts continue to strengthen, state and
local governments should be in a better position to increase spending and reverse the contraction observed over the last few years.
Assuming a successful increase of the debt ceiling, less uncertain fiscal policy should also have positive secondary effects on the
economy relative to last year. The Federal Reserve's reduction of accommodation should, all else being equal, continue to bias rates
higher, though it is expected the Fed will manage the rate rise without impairing growth. In the case that tapering appears to choke off
growth, the Fed would be prepared to suspend tapering or add back accommodation, likely by strengthening forward rate guidance.

                                                  Briefing on procedures to establish the speed
                                                  limit for Mobility Authority roadways.




Strategic Plan Relevance: Regional Mobility given that the posted speed limit conveys
traveler information to the driver to facilitate safe passage.

Department: Engineering

Associated Costs: N/A

Funding Source: N/A

Board Action Required: No

Description of Matter:

      This briefing will outline the authority and procedures for establishing speed
      limits on turnpike facilities constructed and maintained by the Mobility
      Authority as enumerated in Section 545.354 of the Texas Transportation Code
      which additionally references TxDOT's Procedures for Establishing Speed Zones.

Briefing on How Speed
Limits are Established

February 26, 2014
Interim Speed Limits ­ New/Reconstructed Highways


   · Shall be determined and posted
     before opening highway to traffic

   · Traffic and engineering investigation
     required for determination
Interim Speed Limits ­ New/Reconstructed Highways


   Investigation will include review of:

   · Statutory prima facie applicable
   · Design speed
   · Trial-run speed study
Interim Speed Limits ­ New/Reconstructed Highways


   Statutory Prima Facie
   (for passenger cars):

   · City street ­ 30 mph
   · County roads ­ 60 mph
   · State highways ­ 70 mph*

    *RMA's can establish speed
     limits up to 75 mph/TTC up
     to 85 mph
Interim Speed Limits ­ New/Reconstructed Highways


   Design Speeds:

   Facility                 Minimum

   Mainlanes - Urban        50 mph

   Mainlanes - Rural        70 mph
Interim Speed Limits ­ New/Reconstructed Highways


   Trial Run:

   · A drive through of the roadway at
     various chosen speeds near and at
     the prima facie speed to determine if
     the speeds are appropriate for the
     area
Interim Speed Limits ­ New/Reconstructed Highways


   · Interim speed limit shall be posted
     based on those factors using
     engineering judgment (prior to
     opening)

   · Once speeds have stabilized, 85th
     percentile speed study should be
     conducted
85th Percentile Speed Limits


Speed checks should:

· Be made on avg week day at off-
  peak
· Be made during good weather
· Include only free flowing vehicles
· Include 125 vehicles minimum
  each direction
85th Percentile Speed Limits

Examples of factors that allow up to a 12 mph
adjustment * to the 85th percentile speed:

·   Narrow lane widths
·   High driveway density
·   Crash history exceeding statewide norm
·   Lack of shoulders
·   Limited sight distance

(* maximum adjustment allowed would penalize
   over 50% of drivers)
  85th Percentile Speed Limits

· Breaks in speed distribution
  curve at 15% and 85%
  indicate lack of normality
  (i.e. unreasonably fast or
  slow drivers)
· 85% of drivers are safe and
  prudent (in theory)
· A 7 mph reduction below the
  85th percentile penalizes
  25% of drivers
85th Percentile Speed Limits


· A trial run at the 85th percentile speed
  should then be conducted for length of
  roadway to look for irregularities that
  might require advisory signing (i.e.
  curves, etc.)

· Finally, the signs should be replaced
  where 85th percentile speed differs
  from the interim speed posted
85th Percentile Speed Limits



Responsibility for setting speed limits:
· Main lanes ­ Mobility Authority
· Frontage Roads ­ TxDOT*

Action to codify:
· Mobility Authority resolution

* assumes TxDOT will maintain frontage
  roads

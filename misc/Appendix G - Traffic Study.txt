                  Introduction and Summary

                  Introduction
                  This report presents the results of a traffic impact and circulation study for an Assisted Living
                  Facility development proposed by Fountain Square Development West at 2808 El Camino Real in
                  the City of Redwood City, California. Figure 1 shows a map of the study area vicinity. Figure 2
                  shows the project site plan.

                  The proposed project consists of redeveloping parcels in the southwest quadrant of the
                  intersection of El Camino Real and Oakwood Drive with a senior assisted living facility. Currently,
                  the parcels include a jewelry store and an unoccupied restaurant on the El Camino Real frontage,
                  and a vacant lot on the southwest end of the site. The proposed project consists of demolishing
                  the existing structures and constructing 45 assisted living units on the site, to accommodate a
                  maximum of 60 residents and beds.

                  According to the project site plan, a new driveway will be provided on Oakwood Drive
                  approximately 225 feet west of El Camino Real. New curb, gutter, and sidewalk will be constructed
                  along the entire project frontage on Oakwood Drive and El Camino Real, and pedestrian walkway
                  connections between the project's building access points and the new public sidewalk on Oakwood
                  Drive will also be provided. The project also proposes vacation of an existing easement that had
                  been reserved for a possible right-turn lane on eastbound Oakwood Drive.

                  This report includes an analysis of potential project traffic impacts, including the need for a right-
                  turn lane on eastbound Oakwood Drive approaching El Camino Real; pedestrian, bicycle, and
                  transit conditions, both existing and with the proposed project; an evaluation of site external access
                  and internal circulation; and the project parking supply and demand.

                  Summary
                  The proposed project is expected to generate a net increase of approximately 9 a.m. peak
                  hour vehicle trips (6 inbound, 3 outbound), 12 school p.m. peak hour vehicle trips (2 inbound,
                  10 outbound), and 16 commute p.m. peak hour vehicle trips (9 inbound, 7 outbound).

                  Under Existing Conditions, the study intersection of El Camino Real/Oakwood Drive/Dumbarton
                  Avenue is operating at level of service (LOS) C or better during the peak hours. These existing
                  service levels meet current City of Redwood City LOS standards.

                  Under Existing plus Proposed Project Conditions, the study intersection of El Camino Real/Oakwood
                  Drive/Dumbarton Avenue is expected to continue operating acceptably at LOS C or better during
                  all peak hours, just as under Existing Conditions, with minor changes in average vehicle delay. The
                  95th-percentile left-turn queue lengths on northbound and southbound El Camino Real during the
                  peak hours with the additional project trips would be accommodated within the available left-turn
                  lane storage lengths. Therefore, no mitigations due to project traffic are necessary at the study
                  intersection.

                  TJKM also analyzed the expected 95th-percentile queue lengths for the peak hours under Existing
                  plus Proposed Project Conditions assuming only one lane for eastbound Oakwood Drive
                  approaching El Camino Real, which is the same lane configuration as existing conditions. The
                  project's impact on peak-hour queue lengths would be less than significant. The a.m. peak hour
                  would have the longest 95th-percentile queue length of approximately 210 feet, which is not expected
                  to block the project driveway. Although an additional eastbound lane on Oakwood Drive
                 Draft Report ­ Traffic Impact Study for Assisted Living Facility Development at 2808 El Camino Real           Page 1
                 in the City of Redwood City                                                                           March 12, 2012

                  approaching El Camino Real would reduce the a.m. peak hour delay and queue length, the expected
                  36.3 seconds of delay with the existing one-lane eastbound approach, where 35.0 seconds is the
                  LOS C/D threshold, clearly meets the City's acceptable LOS D standard. Based on these findings,
                  TJKM recommends that widening for a right-turn lane on eastbound Oakwood Road is not needed
                  and the proposed vacation of an existing easement that had been reserved for such lane may proceed.

                  Based on the existing daily and peak hour traffic volumes on Oakwood Drive east of Leahy Street,
                  and the net additional project trips expected to use Oakwood Drive west of the project driveway,
                  TJKM determined the percentage increases in traffic volumes expected with the project. Because
                  the increase in local residential street volumes would be less than five percent, the project impact
                  on these streets would be less than significant.

                  In terms of potential effects on local public transportation, some of the 25 project employees could
                  ride public transportation to commute. The resulting additional transit passenger trips during peak
                  hours would be a small number, and no impacts are expected on local SamTrans services, including
                  Routes 390 and KX that stop on El Camino Real at Oakwood Drive adjacent to the project site.
                  As part of the project, additional requests for Redi-Wheels paratransit service for project residents
                  may occur. However, this is not expected to adversely impact existing Redi-Wheels service.

                  In terms of pedestrian facilities, the project will construct new sidewalk along the entire project
                  frontage on Oakwood Drive and El Camino Real, and internal pedestrian walkway connections
                  between the project's building access points and the new public sidewalk on Oakwood Drive will
                  also be provided. Existing crosswalks with pedestrian signal indications are provided across
                  Oakwood Drive, Dumbarton Avenue, and the north leg of El Camino Real at their signalized
                  intersection, but no crosswalk is provided across the south leg of El Camino Real adjacent to the
                  project site. In terms of bicycle facilities, the only available facilities in the project vicinity are
                  roadways shared with motorized vehicles. However, no impacts to local pedestrian or bicycle
                  circulation are expected to result from the proposed project.

                  TJKM reviewed the project site plan to evaluate on-site circulation and access. The location of the
                  single, full access driveway to be provided on Oakwood Drive in relation to the intersections at
                  El Camino Real and at Leahy Street is expected to be adequate. Internal circulation is also expected
                  to be adequate in terms of parking circulation aisles and internal pedestrian and bicycle circulation.

                  In terms of potential sight-distance for motorists exiting the new proposed project site driveway on
                  Oakwood Drive, a field visit revealed adequate sight lines. TJKM recommends, however, that all
                  landscaping along the project street frontage that is located in the line of sight of traffic approaching
                  the project driveway in either direction shall be limited to plants with foliage no more than three
                  feet above the closest adjacent curb elevation, or trees with canopy foliage no less than seven feet
                  above the closest adjacent curb elevation. This measure is expected to address any potential
                  visibility issues for motorists exiting the proposed project driveway.

                  Finally, TJKM evaluated the proposed parking supply using data presented in Parking Generation,
                  4th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, to estimate the project's potential
                  parking demand. The proposed project parking supply ratio of 0.6 spaces per unit would exceed
                  both the average peak parking demand of 0.41 vehicles per dwelling unit and the 85th-percentile
                  peak demand of 0.54 vehicles per dwelling unit observed at similar Assisted Living facilities. Based
                  on this analysis, the proposed parking supply of 27 spaces for the proposed 45 units in the project
                  would be adequate to accommodate peak parking demand on-site.

                  Analysis Methodology

                  Study Methodology
                  TJKM evaluated traffic conditions at the signalized intersection of El Camino Real and Oakwood
                  Drive, during typical weekday a.m., school dismissal p.m., and commute p.m. peak hours. As
                  presented in a subsequent section of this report, the project would generate substantially less than
                  50 peak hour trips, which would not necessarily require detailed intersection traffic analysis to
                  evaluate potential impacts. However, evaluating the need for a right-turn lane on eastbound
                  Oakwood Road, which would be precluded by the proposed vacation of an existing easement
                  allowing for such lane, requires the detailed, peak-hour intersection analysis that follows. TJKM
                  also evaluated the potential increase in traffic volume on Oakwood Drive as a neighborhood street
                  west of El Camino Real based on daily as well as peak period traffic volumes.

                  The peak time periods analyzed are as follows:
                      ·    A.M. (7:00-9:00 a.m.)
                      ·    School p.m. (2:00-4:00 p.m.)
                      ·    P.M. (4:00-6:00 p.m.)

                  This study addresses the following two traffic scenarios:
                      1. Existing Conditions ­ This scenario evaluates operational conditions at the study intersection
                          based on existing traffic counts, which include traffic generated by the existing retail use on
                          the site, as well as field surveys.
                      2. Existing plus Project Conditions ­ This scenario is identical to Existing Conditions, but with the
                          addition of net new traffic that the proposed project is expected to generate.

                  Intersection Level of Service Analysis Methodology
                  Traffic impacts on the study intersection were quantified through the determination of level of
                  service (LOS), a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream. There
                  are six levels of service defined for each type of facility (i.e., intersection) that is analyzed. LOS has
                  letter designations ranging from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and
                  LOS F the worst. Procedures for analyzing each type of facility are based on the Highway Capacity
                  Manual 2000 (HCM 2000). Generally speaking, for intersections, average delay per vehicle is the
                  quantitative measure that is used to determine LOS.
                  Signalized Intersections
                  For the signalized study intersection, the operating conditions and LOS will be evaluated using the
                  2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) Operations Method as incorporated in the Synchro traffic
                  software. Peak hour intersection conditions are reported as average delay per vehicle with
                  corresponding levels of service for the intersection as a whole. The methodology is described in
                  detail in Appendix A.

                  Local Residential Street Traffic Volume Analysis Methodology
                  Traffic impacts on Oakwood Drive west of El Camino Real were quantified by determining the
                  percentage increase to existing traffic volumes that would be expected with the proposed project
                  during the peak periods and for the daily 24-hour traffic volume.

                  Significant Impact Criteria
                  The City of Redwood City typically specifies LOS D as the acceptable level of service at signalized
                  intersections. Based on this City criteria, TJKM will consider the signalized study intersection to be
                  impacted if service levels exceed LOS D during peak hours, and will evaluate the intersection for
                  possible mitigation if necessary.

                  For local residential street traffic volumes, the City typically considers an increase of greater than
                  five (5) percent of the existing volumes as a result of additional project-generated trips to be a
                  potentially significant impact.

                  Existing Conditions
                  Roadway Network
                  El Camino Real (State Route 82) and Woodside Road (State Route 84) provide regional access to
                  the project site. These roadways are described below.

                  El Camino Real (SR 82) is a major north-south arterial roadway that connects the San Mateo County
                  Peninsula with Santa Clara County to the south, and the City and County of San Francisco to the
                  north. North of the project site, it provides access to Woodside Road (SR 84) via ramp
                  connections in all directions, and to downtown Redwood City via several intersections. El Camino
                  Real provides access to the project site via its signalized intersection at Oakwood Drive /
                  Dumbarton Avenue, and carries six traffic lanes south of Woodside Road in the project vicinity.

                  Woodside Road (SR 84) is an east-west roadway that has a grade-separated interchange with
                  El Camino Real north of the project site, and serves as a primary arterial for southeasterly areas of
                  Redwood City. It provides access to U.S. 101, and as SR 84, to the East Bay Area via the Dumbarton
                  Bridge across the San Francisco Bay. SR 84 also provides access to San Mateo County locations west
                  of Redwood City, including Interstate 280, the Town of Woodside, and coastal areas.

                  Oakwood Drive is a two-lane, east-west roadway that provides access to El Camino Real for the
                  Oakwood neighborhood of Redwood City. It currently has commercial uses on its frontage along
                  the parcels that also border the west side of El Camino Real, and segments to the west front
                  residential uses. Oakwood Drive provides direct access to the project site.

                  Dumbarton Avenue is a two-lane, east-west collector roadway that provides access to El Camino
                  Real for a residential neighborhood of unincorporated San Mateo County located between
                  El Camino Real and the Caltrain rail right-of-way.

                  Existing Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
                  TJKM reviewed pedestrian conditions along street segments bordering the project site. Field
                  surveys indicate that no sidewalks are provided for pedestrians along the El Camino Real and
                  Oakwood Drive frontages of the project site. A decomposed granite walkway is provided along
                  the south side of Oakwood Drive between the west boundary of the project site and
                  approximately Leahy Street, and a concrete sidewalk is provided on the north side of Oakwood
                  Drive only along the commercial parcel across from the project site and connects to El Camino
                  Real. No other improved walkways are provided on Oakwood Drive west of those already
                  described. Existing sidewalks are provided on both sides of El Camino Real in the project vicinity,
                  except along the project frontage.

                  Crosswalks with pedestrian signal indications are provided across Oakwood Drive, Dumbarton
                  Avenue, and the north leg of El Camino Real at their signalized intersection, but no crosswalk is
                  provided across the south leg of El Camino Real adjacent to the project site. Wheelchair curb
                  ramps are provided at both ends of the crosswalks.

                  There are no completely separated bicycle paths (Class I facilities) or striped bicycle lanes (Class II
                  facilities) in the immediate project vicinity. Field observations indicate that most bicyclists on
                  El Camino Real are willing to ride in the lane shared with motorized traffic, but some bicyclists
                  choose to ride on the sidewalks to avoid sharing a lane with faster vehicles. The existing roadway
                  width on El Camino Real does not appear to allow for adding bike lanes while maintaining the
                  existing number of traffic lanes. On Oakwood Drive and connecting residential neighborhood
                  streets to the west, automobile speeds are generally low (25 miles per hour posted speed) and
                  traffic conditions are generally favorable for bicyclists.

                  Existing Transit Service
                  The San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) provides local bus transit service within
                  San Mateo County and regional service to the City and County of San Francisco. Two bus lines
                  operate on El Camino Real in the project vicinity, and both have stops at the El Camino Real/
                  Oakwood Drive/Dumbarton Avenue intersection. The stop for northbound buses is located
                  approximately 120 feet south of the intersection, and provides a bench and trash receptacle. The
                  southbound bus stop on El Camino Real is located just north of Oakwood Drive, and provides a
                  trash receptacle but no bench for waiting bus patrons.

                  Route 390 provides local service along El Camino Real between the Palo Alto Caltrain Station
                  and the Daly City BART Station, with stops in Menlo Park, Redwood City, San Carlos, Belmont,
                  San Mateo, Burlingame, Millbrae, San Bruno, South San Francisco, and Colma. Weekday runs are at
                  approximately ½-hour headways between 5:30 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., and one-hour headways from
                  7:00 p.m. until approximately Midnight. On weekends, service operates at approximately
                  40-minute headways between 6:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., and one-hour headways from 5:00 p.m. until
                  approximately 1:00 a.m.

                  Route KX provides service between the Palo Alto Caltrain Station and the Transbay Terminal in
                  Downtown San Francisco, running along El Camino Real with local stops between Palo Alto and
                  Hillsdale Boulevard in San Mateo, then on the U.S. 101 freeway to San Francisco International
                  Airport, with express service between the airport and Downtown San Francisco. Service runs at
                  one-hour headways, with weekday runs between 5:30 a.m. and approximately 10:30 p.m., and
                  weekend runs from 6:30 a.m. to approximately 9:30 p.m.

                  Additionally, SamTrans Community Service Route 72 provides limited service during school days only
                  between Selby Lane Elementary School, Woodside Plaza shopping center, and the residential
                  neighborhood of unincorporated San Mateo County located east of El Camino Real. Route 72 runs
                  in a clockwise loop on Selby Lane, San Carlos Avenue, Woodside Road, El Camino Real,
                  Northumberland Avenue, Marlborough Avenue, Dumbarton Avenue, and El Camino Real. School
                  day runs are once at approximately 8:00 a.m. from the residential neighborhood to Selby Lane
                  Elementary School only, and three runs between 1:45 and 3:45 p.m. around the complete loop.

                  Existing Vehicle, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Volumes
                  Existing weekday a.m., school p.m., and commute p.m. peak period motorized vehicle, bicycle, and
                  pedestrian volumes were collected at the El Camino Real/Oakwood Drive/Dumbarton Avenue
                  intersection in late February 2012 when local school were in regular session. Figure 3 illustrates the
                  existing vehicle turning movement volumes for all three peak hours at the study intersection, as well
                  as existing lane geometries. The figure also shows the peak-hour volumes of vehicles entering and
                  exiting the existing jewelry store parking area to and from Oakwood Drive at the project site.
                  Additionally, existing weekday hourly traffic volumes were collected in late February 2012 on
                  Oakwood Drive east of Leahy Street near the proposed project driveway location, and the resulting
                  typical weekday 24-hour volume is approximately 2,950 vehicles per day. Traffic count data sheets are
                  provided in Appendix B.

                  Left-turn queue lengths on El Camino Real at the study intersection were also analyzed for the
                  three peak hours by comparing the 95th-percentile queue lengths with the left-turn storage length
                  provided. The longest left-turn queues occur during the p.m. peak hour, when the northbound
                  queue of approximately 150 feet and the southbound queue of approximately 170 feet are
                  accommodated within the available storage lengths of 200 feet and 195 feet, respectively.

                  Existing plus Proposed Project Conditions

                  Project Proposal
                  The Assisted Living Facility proposed by Fountain Square Development West is a senior residential
                  project to be developed on two parcels in the southwest quadrant of the intersection of El Camino
                  Real and Oakwood Drive in the City of Redwood City, California. Currently, the parcels include a
                  jewelry store and an unoccupied restaurant on the El Camino Real frontage, and a vacant lot on the
                  southwest end of the site. The proposed project consists of demolishing the existing structures and
                  constructing 45 assisted living units on the site, to accommodate a maximum of 60 residents and beds.

                  According to the project site plan, a new driveway will be provided on Oakwood Drive
                  approximately 225 feet west of El Camino Real. New curb, gutter, and sidewalk will be constructed
                  along the entire project frontage on Oakwood Drive and El Camino Real, and pedestrian walkway
                  connections between the project's building access points and the new public sidewalk on Oakwood
                  Drive will also be provided. The project also proposes vacation of an existing easement that had
                  been reserved for a possible right-turn lane on eastbound Oakwood Drive.

                  Project Trip Generation
                  TJKM developed estimated trip generation for the proposed project based on the published trip
                  generation rates from the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) publication Trip Generation
                  (8th Edition). Compared with most residential developments, senior assisted living residential units
                  typically generate fewer peak hour trips, for several reasons. The senior residents of assisted living
                  facilities typically are not able to drive and no longer own vehicles, as they move into such facilities
                  because they need assistance with several daily living activities (e.g. eating, bathing, dressing, mobility,
                  etc.). The occasional trips they may take with others driving typically occur less often during peak
                  hours because they are not commuting, and trips for health care appointments, shopping, recreation,
                  and other purposes can be made at more flexible times of the day. Most of the trips to and from
                  assisted living facilities are employees, visitors, and deliveries, and the employee shift starting and
                  ending times typically do not coincide with the a.m. and p.m. commute peak hours on the adjacent
                  street network. However, the mid-afternoon shift change time that results in the facilities' peak p.m.
                  trip generation hour typically coincides with the 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. school dismissal peak hour. It
                  should be noted that the ITE trip generation rate for Assisted Living (Code 254) reflects these factors
                  and also includes expected a.m., facility (and school) p.m., and commute p.m. peak hour trips that
                  would be generated by facility employees, deliveries, and any visitors to the senior residences.

                  The estimated net project trip generation also reflects a credit for trips currently generated by the
                  existing jewelry store on the project site, because those trips are already included in the existing
                  traffic volumes collected for analysis of the study intersection and roadway segment. TJKM
                  observed traffic entering and exiting the jewelry store parking area during the school p.m. and
                  commute p.m. peak periods on a typical weekday in late February 2012 to determine the existing
                  site trip generation for those periods. The 11 trips that TJKM observed during the school p.m.
                  peak hour corresponds approximately with the 13 peak hour trips observed by Hexagon
                  Transportation Consultants (Hexagon) in 2008 for a traffic study of a development previously
                  considered at the site. The jewelry store business hours are 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and only one
                  trip was observed accessing the site during the a.m. and commute (5:00 to 6:00) p.m. peak hours,
                  consisting of one employee entering in the a.m. observed by Hexagon and one leaving in the
                  commute p.m. observed by TJKM. Based on the peak hour counts of jewelry store trips, TJKM
                  conservatively estimated its existing daily trip generation by assuming that the average number of
                  trips per hour for the seven hours the store is open is approximately half the number of trips
                  observed as the store's peak hour, which results in an estimated 40 trips per day.

                  Table II shows the expected trip generation for the proposed project. Overall, the proposed
                  project is expected to generate a net increase of approximately 9 a.m. peak hour vehicle trips
                  (6 inbound, 3 outbound), 12 school p.m. peak hour vehicle trips (2 inbound, 10 outbound), and
                  16 commute p.m. peak hour vehicle trips (9 inbound, 7 outbound).

                              p.m. peak hour rate of 0.29 (52% in, 48% out).
                              Daily trips at existing jewelry store were conservatively estimated based on peak hour counts at the site.

                  Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
                  TJKM developed trip distribution assumptions for the proposed project based on the collected
                  existing turning movement counts and knowledge of the study area, in coordination with City staff.
                  The estimated trip distribution is as follows:
                      · To / from El Camino Real North ­ 45 percent
                      · To / from El Camino Real South ­ 35 percent
                      · To / from Oakwood Drive West - 20 percent
                      · To / from Dumbarton Avenue East ­ less than one percent

                  Net project trips were assigned to the existing roadway network based on the above distribution
                  and added to Existing turning movement counts. These assigned trips are illustrated in Figure 4.
                  The resulting study intersection volumes for Existing plus Proposed Project Conditions are shown
                  in Figure 5.

                  Table III summarizes peak hour levels of service at the study intersection under Existing plus
                  Proposed Project Conditions. LOS worksheets are provided in Appendix D. Under Existing plus
                  Proposed Project Conditions, the El Camino Real/Oakwood Drive/Dumbarton Avenue intersection
                  is expected to continue operating acceptably at LOS C or better, just as under Existing Conditions,
                  with minor changes in average vehicle delay.

                  Left-turn queue lengths on El Camino Real at the study intersection under Existing plus Proposed
                  Project Conditions were also analyzed for the three peak hours by comparing the 95th-percentile
                  queue lengths with the left-turn storage length provided. The longest left-turn queues would
                  continue to occur during the p.m. peak hour, when the northbound and southbound queues would
                  remain at approximately 150 feet and 170 feet respectively with the additional project trips. These
                  95th-percentile queues would be accommodated within the available left-turn lane storage lengths of
                  200 feet northbound and 195 feet southbound.

                  Because intersection LOS would remain acceptable and 95th-percentile left-turn queues would not
                  exceed the available storage length, no mitigations due to project traffic are necessary at the study
                  intersection.
                  Need for Eastbound Oakwood Drive Right-Turn Lane
                  Based on the peak-hour analysis of the El Camino Real/Oakwood Drive/Dumbarton Avenue
                  intersection, TJKM evaluated the need for a right-turn lane on eastbound Oakwood Road, which
                  would be precluded by the proposed vacation of an existing easement that had been reserved for
                  such lane. The existing curb-to-curb width of Oakwood Drive at El Camino Real is approximately
                  28 feet, and the pavement width tapers down to approximately 23 feet west of the intersection.
                  With the proposed addition of curb, gutter and sidewalk on Oakwood Drive, the curb-to-curb
                  width would be 24 feet near El Camino Real. With both the existing and proposed width of
                  Oakwood Drive, only one lane is provided for all eastbound traffic whether turning left or right or
                  proceeding straight through the signalized intersection with El Camino Real. This one-lane
                  eastbound configuration can prevent potential opportunities to turn right on a red signal, because
                  only one vehicle waiting for the green signal to turn left or proceed straight through blocks any
                  vehicles behind it that might otherwise be able to turn right.

                  Table IV shows the expected 95th-percentile queue lengths on eastbound Oakwood Drive
                  approaching El Camino Real for the three peak hours under Existing Conditions and Existing plus
                  Proposed Project Conditions. As shown in the table, the a.m. peak hour would have the longest
                  95th-percentile queue, which correlates with the peak hour intersection LOS and delay results
                  described above. The project's impact on peak-hour queue lengths would be less than significant.

                  During the a.m. peak hour under Existing plus Proposed Project Conditions, eastbound Oakwood
                  Drive traffic movements at El Camino Real would consist of approximately 95 right turns and
                  154 combined left-turn and through movements. TJKM tested an alternative configuration for
                  eastbound Oakwood Drive approaching the intersection by assuming a right-turn-only lane and one
                  shared left-turn/through lane. The average delay on the eastbound Oakwood Drive approach
                  would decrease from 36.3 seconds with the existing single lane to 25.3 seconds with the alternative
                  two-lane configuration. The resulting a.m. peak hour queue length in a right-turn-only lane would
                  be less than 30 feet, and the 95th-percentile queue length in the shared left-turn/through lane would
                  be approximately 140 feet, compared with a queue length of approximately 210 feet with the
                  existing single lane.

                  Although an additional eastbound lane on Oakwood Drive approaching El Camino Real would
                  reduce the a.m. peak hour delay and queue length, the expected 36.3 seconds of delay on the
                  existing one-lane eastbound approach, where 35.0 seconds is the LOS C/D threshold, clearly meets
                  the City's acceptable LOS D standard. The a.m. peak hour 95th-percentile queue length of
                  approximately 210 feet with only one eastbound approach lane under Existing plus Proposed
                  Project Conditions is not expected to block the project driveway. Delays and queues on
                  eastbound Oakwood Drive during the other peak periods would be shorter than during the a.m.
                  peak hour. These results do not appear to justify widening Oakwood Drive to add an eastbound
                  lane. Additionally, reduced delays and queue lengths with an additional eastbound lane on
                  Oakwood Drive approaching El Camino Real could attract more drivers to use this intersection as
                  part of a "short-cut" route, which is a major concern of residents of the adjacent neighborhood.
                  Based on these findings, TJKM recommends that a right-turn lane on eastbound Oakwood Road is
                  not needed and the proposed vacation of an existing easement that had been reserved for such lane
                  may proceed.

                  Local Residential Street Traffic Volume Analysis
                  Based on the existing daily and peak hour traffic volumes collected on Oakwood Drive east of
                  Leahy Street, and the net additional project trips expected to use Oakwood Drive west of the
                  project driveway as shown on Figure 4, TJKM determined the percentage increases in traffic
                  volumes expected with the project. Daily project trips added were determined using the net
                  increase of 124 daily trips generated by the project shown in Table III and the 20% traffic
                  distribution on Oakwood Drive west shown in Figure 4. Table V shows the results for the total
                  traffic volumes in both directions on Oakwood Drive east of Leahy Street. As shown in the table,
                  the project would result in traffic volume increases of approximately one percent on Oakwood
                  Drive east of Leahy Street. Westerly of the Oakwood Drive/Leahy Street intersection, the project
                  trips are expected to be distributed among multiple streets in the neighborhood and the resulting
                  increases in traffic volumes would be similarly small percentages of existing volumes. Because the
                  increase in local residential street volumes would be less than five percent, the project impact on
                  these streets would be less than significant.

                  Project Transit Circulation
                  TJKM reviewed the proposed project in terms of its potential effects on local public transportation.
                  Some of the 25 employees of the project could ride public transportation to commute between
                  their homes and the project site. The resulting additional transit passenger trips during peak hours
                  would be a small number, and as a result, no impacts are expected from the proposed project on
                  local SamTrans services, including Routes 390 and KX that stop on El Camino Real at Oakwood
                  Drive adjacent to the project site. As part of the project, additional requests for Redi-Wheels
                  paratransit service for project residents may occur. However, this is not expected to adversely
                  impact existing Redi-Wheels service.

                  Project Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation
                  TJKM reviewed the proposed project in terms of its potential effects on local pedestrian and bicycle
                  circulation. The project will construct new sidewalk along the entire project frontage on Oakwood
                  Drive and El Camino Real, and internal pedestrian walkway connections between the project's
                  building access points and the new public sidewalk on Oakwood Drive will also be provided.

                  Crosswalks with pedestrian signal indications are provided across Oakwood Drive, Dumbarton
                  Avenue, and the north leg of El Camino Real at their signalized intersection, but no crosswalk is
                  provided across the south leg of El Camino Real adjacent to the project site. Wheelchair curb
                  ramps are provided at both ends of the crosswalks.

                  The only local facilities available to bicyclists are roadways that must be shared with motorized
                  vehicles. The existing roadway width on El Camino Real does not appear to allow for adding bike
                  lanes while maintaining the existing number of traffic lanes. On Oakwood Drive and connecting
                  residential neighborhood streets to the west, automobile speeds are generally low (25 miles per
                  hour posted speed) and traffic conditions are generally favorable for bicyclists. Parallel curb parking
                  will be prohibited along the project site frontages on Oakwood Drive and southbound El Camino
                  Real, which will avoid additional parking friction with bicyclists. Therefore, no impacts are expected
                  to local pedestrian and bicycle circulation due to the proposed project.

                  Project Site Access and Circulation
                  TJKM reviewed the project site plan to evaluate on-site circulation and access. The site plan shows
                  one full access driveway to be provided on Oakwood Drive approximately 225 feet south of
                  El Camino Real. Spacing of the driveway from the Oakwood Drive intersections at El Camino Real
                  and Leahy Street is expected to be adequate given the 25 mph speed limit, the existing speed hump
                  immediately west of the proposed driveway, and the low net project trip generation expected.
                  Additionally, the maximum peak hour 95th-percentile queue length of approximately 210 feet on
                  eastbound Oakwood Drive extending back from El Camino Real under Existing plus Proposed
                  Project Conditions is not expected to block the project driveway.

                  Within the project site, circulation is expected to be adequate. The site plan shows parking aisle
                  and internal roadway widths that are adequate for internal vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle
                  circulation purposes. The entrance driveway at Oakwood Drive would be more than 25 feet wide,
                  and the internal circulation driveway and parking aisle would be approximately 24 feet wide. These
                  widths are expected to be adequate for two-way on-site vehicle circulation, especially given the low
                  maximum peak hour trip generation of 23 vehicles.

                  On a recent field visit, TJKM found that sight lines from the proposed project driveway location
                  are generally adequate given the flat grades, low prevailing vehicle speeds, and proposed prohibition
                  of curb parking on Oakwood Drive adjacent to the project site. To provide adequate sight-
                  distance for motorists exiting the proposed project driveway on Oakwood Drive, TJKM
                  recommends that all landscaping along the project street frontage that is located in the line of sight
                  of traffic approaching the project driveway in either direction shall be limited to plants with foliage
                  no more than three feet above the closest adjacent curb elevation, or trees with canopy foliage no
                  less than seven feet above the closest adjacent curb elevation, or other dimensions as specified by
                  the City Engineer. The line of sight is defined as an area within 15 feet of the driveway edge
                  between the street curb and a point 15 feet behind the back of the sidewalk or walkway, or as
                  otherwise specified by the City Engineer. This measure is expected to address any potential
                  visibility issues for motorists exiting the proposed project driveway.

                  Project Parking Supply and Demand
                  TJKM evaluated the proposed parking supply based on review of the project site plan. Because
                  the City code does not include specific parking supply requirements for assisted living facilities,
                  TJKM reviewed data presented in Parking Generation, 4th Edition published by the Institute of
                  Transportation Engineers to evaluate the project's potential parking demand. That publication
                  includes data for the Assisted Living land use category directly applicable to the project. The data
                  for weekdays shows an average peak parking demand of 0.41 vehicles per dwelling unit, and the
                  85th-percentile for peak demand is 0.54 vehicles per dwelling unit. Weekend data shows lower
                  parking demand than weekdays. The proposed project parking supply ratio of 0.6 spaces per unit
                  would exceed these parking demand ratios. Additionally, an average parking supply ratio of
                  0.6 spaces per dwelling unit was reported for the Parking Generation study sites, which equals the
                  ratio of the proposed parking supply of 27 spaces to the proposed 45 units in the project.
                  Based on this analysis, the proposed parking supply for the project would be adequate to
                  accommodate peak parking demand on-site.

                  Conclusions and Recommendations

                  TJKM has reached the following conclusions regarding the Assisted Living Facility development
                  proposed by Fountain Square Development West at 2808 El Camino Real:
                  ·   The proposed project is expected to generate a net increase of approximately 9 a.m. peak hour
                      vehicle trips (6 inbound, 3 outbound), 12 school p.m. peak hour vehicle trips (2 inbound,
                      10 outbound), and 16 commute p.m. peak hour vehicle trips (9 inbound, 7 outbound).
                  ·   Under Existing Conditions, the study intersection of El Camino Real/Oakwood
                      Drive/Dumbarton Avenue is operating at level of service (LOS) C or better during the peak
                      hours. These existing service levels meet current City of Redwood City LOS standards.
                  ·   Under Existing plus Proposed Project Conditions, the study intersection of El Camino
                      Real/Oakwood Drive/Dumbarton Avenue is expected to continue operating acceptably at
                      LOS C or better during all peak hours, just as under Existing Conditions, with minor changes in
                      average vehicle delay. The 95th-percentile left-turn queue lengths on northbound and
                      southbound El Camino Real during the peak hours with the additional project trips would be
                      accommodated within the available left-turn lane storage lengths. Therefore, no mitigations
                      due to project traffic are necessary at the study intersection.
                  ·   TJKM also analyzed the expected 95th-percentile queue lengths for the peak hours under
                      Existing plus Proposed Project Conditions assuming only one lane for eastbound Oakwood
                      Drive approaching El Camino Real, which is the same lane configuration as existing conditions.
                      The project's impact on peak-hour queue lengths would be less than significant. The a.m. peak
                      hour would have the longest 95th-percentile queue length of approximately 210 feet, which is
                      not expected to block the project driveway. Although an additional eastbound lane on
                      Oakwood Drive approaching El Camino Real would reduce the a.m. peak hour delay and queue
                      length, the expected 36.3 seconds of delay with the existing one-lane eastbound approach,
                      where 35.0 seconds is the LOS C/D threshold, clearly meets the City's acceptable LOS D
                      standard. Based on these findings, TJKM recommends that widening for a right-turn lane on
                      eastbound Oakwood Road is not needed and the proposed vacation of an existing easement
                      that had been reserved for such lane may proceed.
                  ·   Based on the existing daily and peak hour traffic volumes on Oakwood Drive east of Leahy
                      Street, and the net additional project trips expected to use Oakwood Drive west of the project
                      driveway, TJKM determined the percentage increases in traffic volumes expected with the
                      project. Because the increase in local residential street volumes would be less than five
                      percent, the project impact on these streets would be less than significant.
                  ·   In terms of potential effects on local public transportation, some of the 25 project employees
                      could ride public transportation to commute. The resulting additional transit passenger trips
                      during peak hours would be a small number, and no impacts are expected on local SamTrans
                      services, including Routes 390 and KX that stop on El Camino Real at Oakwood Drive adjacent
                      to the project site. As part of the project, additional requests for Redi-Wheels paratransit
                      service for project residents may occur. However, this is not expected to adversely impact
                      existing Redi-Wheels service.
                  ·   In terms of pedestrian facilities, the project will construct new sidewalk along the entire project
                      frontage on Oakwood Drive and El Camino Real, and internal pedestrian walkway connections
                      between the project's building access points and the new public sidewalk on Oakwood Drive
                      will also be provided. Existing crosswalks with pedestrian signal indications are provided across
                      Oakwood Drive, Dumbarton Avenue, and the north leg of El Camino Real at their signalized

                      intersection, but no crosswalk is provided across the south leg of El Camino Real adjacent to
                      the project site. In terms of bicycle facilities, the only available facilities in the project vicinity
                      are roadways shared with motorized vehicles. However, no impacts to local pedestrian or
                      bicycle circulation are expected to result from the proposed project.
                  ·   TJKM reviewed the project site plan to evaluate on-site circulation and access. The location of
                      the single, full access driveway to be provided on Oakwood Drive in relation to the
                      intersections at El Camino Real and at Leahy Street is expected to be adequate. Internal
                      circulation is also expected to be adequate in terms of parking circulation aisles and internal
                      pedestrian and bicycle circulation.

                      driveway on Oakwood Drive, a field visit revealed adequate sight lines. TJKM recommends,
                      however, that all landscaping along the project street frontage that is located in the line of sight
                      of traffic approaching the project driveway in either direction shall be limited to plants with
                      foliage no more than three feet above the closest adjacent curb elevation, or trees with canopy
                      foliage no less than seven feet above the closest adjacent curb elevation. This measure is
                      expected to address any potential visibility issues for motorists exiting the proposed project
                      driveway.
                  ·   Finally, TJKM evaluated the proposed parking supply using data presented in Parking Generation,
                      4th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, to estimate the project's
                      potential parking demand. The proposed project parking supply ratio of 0.6 spaces per unit
                      would exceed both the average peak parking demand of 0.41 vehicles per dwelling unit and the
                      85th-percentile peak demand of 0.54 vehicles per dwelling unit observed at similar Assisted Living
                      facilities. Based on this analysis, the proposed parking supply of 27 spaces for the proposed
                      45 units in the project would be adequate to accommodate peak parking demand on-site.

                                         LEVEL OF SERVICE

The description and procedures for calculating capacity and level of service (LOS) are found in
Transportation Research Board, Highway Capacity Manual 2000. Highway Capacity Manual 2000
represents the latest research on capacity and quality of service for transportation facilities.

Quality of service requires quantitative measures to characterize operational conditions within a traffic
stream. LOS is a quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in
terms of such service measures as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and
comfort and convenience.

Six levels of service are defined for each type of facility that has analysis procedures available. Letters
designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the
worst. Each LOS represents a range of operating conditions and the driver's perception of these
conditions. Safety is not included in the measures that establish service levels.

A general description of service levels for various types of facilities is shown in Table A-I

Urban Streets
The term "urban streets" refers to urban arterials and collectors, including those in downtown areas.

Arterial streets are roads that primarily serve longer through trips. However, providing access to
abutting commercial and residential land uses is also an important function of arterials.
Collector streets provide both land access and traffic circulation within residential, commercial and
industrial areas. Their access function is more important than that of arterials, and unlike arterials their
operation is not always dominated by traffic signals.

Downtown streets are signalized facilities that often resemble arterials. They not only move through
traffic but also provide access to local businesses for passenger cars, transit buses, and trucks.
Pedestrian conflicts and lane obstructions created by stopping or standing buses, trucks and parking
vehicles that cause turbulence in the traffic flow are typical of downtown streets.

The speed of vehicles on urban streets is influenced by three main factors, street environment,
interaction among vehicles and traffic control. As a result, these factors also affect quality of service.

The street environment includes the geometric characteristics of the facility, the character of roadside
activity and adjacent land uses. Thus, the environment reflects the number and width of lanes, type of
median, driveway density, spacing between signalized intersections, existence of parking, level of
pedestrian activity and speed limit.

The interaction among vehicles is determined by traffic density, the proportion of trucks and buses, and
turning movements. This interaction affects the operation of vehicles at intersections and, to a lesser
extent, between signals.

Traffic control (including signals and signs) forces a portion of all vehicles to slow or stop. The delays
and speed changes caused by traffic control devices reduce vehicle speeds, however, such controls are
needed to establish right-of-way.

The average travel speed for through vehicles along an urban street is the determinant of the operating
LOS. The travel speed along a segment, section or entire length of an urban street is dependent on the
running speed between signalized intersections and the amount of control delay incurred at signalized
intersections.

LOS A describes primarily free-flow operations. Vehicles are completely unimpeded in their ability to
maneuver within the traffic stream. Control delay at signalized intersections is minimal.

LOS B describes reasonably unimpeded operations. The ability to maneuver within the traffic stream is
only slightly restricted, and control delays at signalized intersections are not significant.

LOS C describes stable operations, however, ability to maneuver and change lanes in midblock location
may be more restricted than at LOS B. Longer queues, adverse signal coordination, or both may
contribute to lower travel speeds.

LOS D borders on a range in which in which small increases in flow may cause substantial increases in
delay and decreases in travel speed. LOS D may be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate
signal timing, high volumes, or a combination of these factors.

LOS E is characterized by significant delays and lower travel speeds. Such operations are caused by a
combination of adverse progression, high signal density, high volumes, extensive delays at critical
intersections, and inappropriate signal timing.

LOS F is characterized by urban street flow at extremely low speeds. Intersection congestion is likely at
critical signalized locations, with high delays, high volumes, and extensive queuing.

The methodology to determine LOS stratifies urban streets into four classifications. The classifications
are complex, and are related to functional and design categories. Table A-II describes the functional and
design categories, while Table A-III relates these to the urban street classification.
Once classified, the urban street is divided into segments for analysis. An urban street segment is a
one-way section of street encompassing a series of blocks or links terminating at a signalized
intersection. Adjacent segments of urban streets may be combined to form larger street sections,
provided that the segments have similar demand flows and characteristics.

Levels of service are related to the average travel speed of vehicles along the urban street segment or
section.

Travel times for existing conditions are obtained by field measurements. The maximum-car technique is
used. The vehicle is driven at the posted speed limit unless impeded by actual traffic conditions. In the
maximum-car technique, a safe level of vehicular operation is maintained by observing proper following
distances and by changing speeds at reasonable rates of acceleration and deceleration. The maximum-
car technique provides the best base for measuring traffic performance.

An observer records the travel time and locations and duration of delay. The beginning and ending
points are the centers of intersections. Delays include times waiting in queues at signalized
intersections. The travel speed is determined by dividing the length of the segment by the travel time.
Once the travel speed on the arterial is determined, the LOS is found by comparing the speed to the
criteria in Table A-IV. LOS criteria vary for the different classifications of urban street, reflecting
differences in driver expectations.

Interrupted Flow
One of the more important elements limiting, and often interrupting the flow of traffic on a highway is
the intersection. Flow on an interrupted facility is usually dominated by points of fixed operation such
as traffic signals, stop and yield signs. These all operate quite differently and have differing impacts on
overall flow.

Signalized Intersections
The capacity of a highway is related primarily to the geometric characteristics of the facility, as well as to
the composition of the traffic stream on the facility. Geometrics are a fixed, or non-varying,
characteristic of a facility.

At the signalized intersection, an additional element is introduced into the concept of capacity: time
allocation. A traffic signal essentially allocates time among conflicting traffic movements seeking use of
the same physical space. The way in which time is allocated has a significant impact on the operation of
the intersection and on the capacity of the intersection and its approaches.

LOS for signalized intersections is defined in terms of control delay, which is a measure of driver
discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and increased travel time. The delay experienced by a
motorist is made up of a number of factors that relate to control, traffic and incidents. Total delay is the
difference between the travel time actually experienced and the reference travel time that would result
during base conditions, i. e., in the absence of traffic control, geometric delay, any incidents, and any
other vehicles. Specifically, LOS criteria for traffic signals are stated in terms of average control delay
per vehicle, typically for a 15-minute analysis period. Delay is a complex measure and depends on a
number of variables, including the quality of progression, the cycle length, the ratio of green time to
cycle length and the volume to capacity ratio for the lane group.
For each intersection analyzed the average control delay per vehicle per approach is determined for the
peak hour. A weighted average of control delay per vehicle is then determined for the intersection. A
LOS designation is given to the control delay to better describe the level of operation. A description of
levels of service for signalized intersections can be found in Table A-V

LOS                                                    Description

       Very low control delay, up to 10 seconds per vehicle. Progression is extremely favorable, and most
  A    vehicles arrive during the green phase. Many vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may tend to
       contribute to low delay values.


       Control delay greater than 10 and up to 20 seconds per vehicle. There is good progression or short cycle
  B
       lengths or both. More vehicles stop causing higher levels of delay.

       Control delay greater than 20 and up to 35 seconds per vehicle. Higher delays are caused by fair
       progression or longer cycle lengths or both. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear. Cycle failure
  C
       occurs when a given green phase doe not serve queued vehicles, and overflow occurs. The number of
       vehicles stopping is significant, though many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
       Control delay greater than 35 and up to 55 seconds per vehicle. The influence of congestions becomes
       more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
  D
       lengths, or high volumes. Many vehicles stop, the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual
       cycle failures are noticeable.

       Control delay greater than 55 and up to 80 seconds per vehicle. The limit of acceptable delay. High
  E    delays usually indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high volumes. Individual cycle failures are
       frequent.

       Control delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. Unacceptable to most drivers. Oversaturation, arrival
  F    flow rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. Many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and
       long cycle lengths may also be contributing factors to higher delay.

The use of control delay, which may also be referred to as signal delay, was introduced in the 1997
update to the Highway Capacity Manual, and represents a departure from previous updates. In the third
edition, published in 1985 and the 1994 update to the third edition, delay only included stopped delay.
Thus, the LOS criteria listed in Table A-V differs from earlier criteria.

Unsignalized Intersections
The current procedures on unsignalized intersections were first introduced in the 1997 update to the
Highway Capacity Manual and represent a revision of the methodology published in the 1994 update to
the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual. The revised procedures use control delay as a measure of
effectiveness to determine LOS. Delay is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption,
and increased travel time. The delay experienced by a motorist is made up of a number of factors that
relate to control, traffic and incidents. Total delay is the difference between the travel time actually
experienced and the reference travel time that would result during base conditions, i. e., in the absence
of traffic control, geometric delay, any incidents, and any other vehicles. Control delay is the increased
time of travel for a vehicle approaching and passing through an unsignalized intersection, compared with
a free-flow vehicle if it were not required to slow or stop at the intersection.
Two-Way Stop Controlled Intersections
Two-way stop controlled intersections in which stop signs are used to assign the right-of-way, are the
most prevalent type of intersection in the United States. At two-way stop-controlled intersections the
stop-controlled approaches are referred as the minor street approaches and can be either public streets
or private driveways. The approaches that are not controlled by stop signs are referred to as the major
street approaches.

The capacity of movements subject to delay are determined using the "critical gap" method of capacity
analysis. Expected average control delay based on movement volume and movement capacity is
calculated. A LOS designation is given to the expected control delay for each minor movement. LOS is
not defined for the intersection as a whole. Control delay is the increased time of travel for a vehicle
approaching and passing through a stop-controlled intersection, compared with a free-flow vehicle if it
were not required to slow or stop at the intersection. A description of levels of service for two-way
stop-controlled intersections is found in Table A-VI.

 LOS                                                        Description

  A    Very low control delay less than 10 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  B    Low control delay greater than 10 and up to 15 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  C    Acceptable control delay greater than 15 and up to 25 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  D    Tolerable control delay greater than 25 and up to 35 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  E    Limit of tolerable control delay greater than 35 and up to 50 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

  F    Unacceptable control delay in excess of 50 seconds per vehicle for each movement subject to delay.

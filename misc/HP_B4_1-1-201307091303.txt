1.0     Project Description

    This Transportation Impact Feasibility Study examines the potential project-
    generated traffic impacts on the surrounding roadway system in the vicinity
    of the proposed Hogan-Pancost Property residential development. The
    analysis includes impacts for the projected build-out year - Year 2012 - and
    long-range planning year - Year 2025. This study was conducted in
    accordance with the scope outlined by the City of Boulder Transportation
    staff. This includes Level of Service analyses for the following intersections in
    the vicinity of the Hogan-Pancost Property:

           South Boulder Road/Manhattan Drive
           South Boulder Road/55th Street
           Baseline Road/Manhattan Drive
           Baseline Road/55th Street
           Kewanee Drive/Manhattan Drive
           Proposed Street Connection to 55th Street

    A daily volume analysis of proposed roadways and a Travel Demand
    Management (TDM) plan will be provided upon finalization of a site plan.
    The City scoping document can be seen in the Appendix.

    The site for the proposed Hogan-Pancost Property is a 22.2 acre
    undeveloped site located between Manhattan Drive and 55th Street,
    approximately one quarter mile north of South Boulder Road in Boulder
    County. Annexation into the City of Boulder is anticipated as part of site
    development. The site location is shown on the following page.

    An Existing residential development, Keewaydin Meadows, borders the site to
    the west, with East Boulder Community Park bordering the development to
    the north and east. There are two unincorporated Boulder County parcels
    immediately to the south of the proposed development. South of these
    parcels include the Greenbelt Meadows development. This study was also
    coordinated with the "East Boulder Community Park Traffic Study" dated
    October 6, 2008 by the Fox-Higgins Transportation Group.

    The proposed development is currently zoned by Boulder County as
    "Suburban Residential." A detailed site plan of the proposed Hogan-Pancost
    Property is illustrated in Figure 1.

    Access
    There are two potential access point scenarios analyzed as part of this study
    per the direction of City of Boulder Transportation staff; with and without an
    access to the existing Kewanee Drive. Both access scenarios would also
    include a primary access point to 55th Street, located north of Ontario Place.

2.0     Existing Conditions

    The roadways within the vicinity of the project are detailed below:

    Baseline Road:
    In the vicinity of Manhattan Drive and 55th
    Street, Baseline Road is a four-lane,
    east/west Minor Arterial roadway. Baseline
    Road becomes a two-lane roadway to the
    east of its intersection with 55th Street.
    Baseline Road provides access to Foothills
    Parkway (SH 157) to the west. The posted
    speed limit in the vicinity of this proposed
    development is 35 mph.

    South Boulder Road:
    In this project vicinity, South Boulder Road is
    a four-lane, east/west Primary Arterial
    roadway.       It provides access to U.S.
    Highway 36 to the west and the City of
    Louisville to the east. South Boulder Road
    has a posted 35 mph speed limit in the
    vicinity of the site. The posted speed limit
    changes from 35 to 45 mph approximately
    400 feet to the east of the intersection with
    55th Street.

    Manhattan Drive:
    Manhattan Drive is a north/south Local
    Roadway. Manhattan Middle School is
    located on the east side of Manhattan
    Drive, approximately 0.4 miles to the south
    of Baseline Road. Keewaydin Meadows
    Park is located east of Manhattan Drive,
    immediately south of the school.

    The road has a posted 25 mph speed limit
    in the vicinity of the project and a 20 mph
    school zone speed limit in the vicinity of Manhattan Middle School. Twenty-
    four hour volume/speed counts taken September 16, 2008 north of the
    intersection of Manhattan Dr/S Boulder Road show an 85th percentile speed
    of 24-25 mph on this roadway. It is generally desirable for the 85th percentile
    speed to match the posted speed limit, which is the case at this location.
    This count indicates that approximately 3,000 vehicles use Manhattan in this
    area per day.

    55th Street:
    55th Street is a north/south Collector
    Roadway in the vicinity of the proposed
    development. 55th Street runs from Baseline
    Road and becomes Valmont Road north of
    the intersection with Pearl Parkway. East
    Boulder Community Park and Recreation
    Center is located on the west side of 55th
    Street and on the south side of Sioux Drive.
    The proposed development would include
    an access to 55th Street.

    The posted speed limit is 25 mph in the vicinity of the project site. Twenty-
    four hour volume/speed counts taken on 55th Street north of S Boulder Road
    show an 85th Percentile Speed of 26-28 mph at this location, slightly higher
    than the posted speed limit. This count also indicates that approximately
    1,800 vehicles currently use this roadway per day.


    Kewanee Drive:
    Kewanee Drive is an east/west community
    collector roadway that extends east from
    Manhattan Drive and terminates at the site
    of the proposed development.          This
    roadway has no posted speed limit, but is
    assumed to be 25 mph.

    Transit:
    Route 206, is a local bus route providing
    connections to both South Boulder and the Downtown Transit Center. This
    route follows Manhattan Drive in the vicinity of the site. There is a stop for this
    route adjacent to Kewanee Drive.

    Route 203 provides a more direct connection to downtown Boulder via
    Baseline Road. This route terminates at the East Boulder Community Center.

    2.1          Existing Traffic Data

    Existing traffic turning movement counts were conducted at the following
    intersections for the morning peak (7am-9am) and evening peak (4pm-6pm)
    periods:

             S Boulder Road / Manhattan Drive
             Baseline Road / Manhattan Drive
             Kewanee Drive / Manhattan Drive
             S Boulder Road / 55th Street
             Baseline Road / 55th Street

    Twenty-four hour volume and speed data was collected at the following two
    locations:

             Manhattan Drive, north of S Boulder Road
             55th Street, north of S Boulder Road

    Full week (April 15-22, 2008) volume data were obtained from the Fox Higgins
    Transportation Group for two additional locations:

             55th Street, north of Ontario Place
             55th Street, north of Pueblo Place


    The results of all traffic counts can be seen in the Appendix of this report. This
    data is also illustrated in Figure 2.

    Traffic signal timing plans were obtained from the City of Boulder for the
    intersections of Manhattan Drive/Baseline Road and 55th Street/Baseline
    Road on October 5, 2008. The cycle length and signal progression for the
    South Boulder Road corridor was also obtained. This data can also be seen
    in the Appendix.

    2.2          Intersection Levels of Service

    Capacity and Level of Service Analyses were performed for existing,
    background, and total traffic conditions using Synchro 7.0 software package.
    Synchro utilizes the procedures set forth in the Highway Capacity Manual,
    2000. The results are reported as Levels of Service (LOS) and can range from
    LOS A, little or no delay, to LOS F, very high average delay.


    SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION
    Level of                                                                                                 Control Delay
    Service      Interpretation                                                                                (sec/veh)

    A            Progress is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during                                   <=10
                 the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle
                 lengths may contribute to low delay.

    B            Good progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles                               >10 and <=20
                 vehicles stop than with LOS A.

    C            Fair progression, long cycle lengths, or both. The number of                                >20 and <=35

    D            Longer delays result from some combination of unfavorable                                   >35 and <=55
                 progression, long cycle length, or high v/c ratios. Many
                 stop.

     E           High delay values generally indicate poor progression, long                                 >55 and <=80
                 cycle length, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are
                 frequent occurrences.

     F           This level often occurs with over saturation when arrival flow                                     >80
                 rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. Poor progression
                 and long cycle lengths may be major contributing factors to
                 such delay levels.

    STOP-CONTROLLED INTERSECTION
    LOS          Expected Delay to Minor Street Traffic                                        Average Control Delay (s/veh)

    A            Little or no delay.                                                                                0-10
    B            Short traffic delays.                                                                             >10-15
    C            Average traffic delays.                                                                           >15-25
    D            Long traffic delays.                                                                              >25-35
     E           Very long traffic delays.                                                                         >35-50
     F           When volume exceeds the capacity of the lane, extreme delays will be encountered with              >50
                 queuing that may cause severe congestion affecting other traffic movements in the intersection.
                 This condition usually warrants improving the intersection.




    Level of Service information for all conditions analyzed is detailed in Table 1.
    The Existing Conditions Analyses are detailed below. The Background and
    Total Traffic Conditions analyses are detailed in subsequent sections of this
    report. Supporting Synchro analysis, including capacity, delay, and queuing
    analyses can be found in the Appendix of this report.

    Intersection Level of Service - Existing Traffic

    1. South Boulder Road / Manhattan Drive:
    This stop-controlled intersection currently operates at Level of Service F in
    both the northbound and southbound directions during the AM Peak Hour.
    During the PM Peak Hour, the northbound approach operates at LOS F while
    the southbound approach operates at LOS E. The level of delay on the minor
    leg of the intersection can be attributed to the high through movement
    volumes on South Boulder Road. Actual delay may be somewhat mitigated
    by the platooning effect of the traffic signal at the intersections of South
    Boulder Road/Foothills Parkway and South Boulder Road/Cherryvale Road.
    The eastbound and westbound left turn movements are operating
    acceptably for both the AM and PM Peak Hours.

    2. South Boulder Road / 55th Street:
    This southbound stop-controlled intersection is operating acceptably with
    Levels of Service C or better for the critical movements.

    3. Baseline Road / Manhattan Drive:
    This signalized intersection currently operates at an overall Level of Service B
    during both the AM Peak Hour and the PM Peak Hour. However, the
    northbound left turning movement is operating at a Level of Service E during
    the evening peak hour. This LOS E appears to be the result of the 120 second
    cycle length used during this time period.

    4. Baseline Road / 55th Street:
    This signalized intersection currently operates at an overall Level of Service C
    during both the AM Peak Hour and the PM Peak Hours. However, during the
    PM Peak Hour, the southbound left-turn operates at a Level of Service E.

    5. Kewanee Drive / Manhattan Drive:
    This westbound stop-controlled intersection is operating acceptably with
    Levels of Service A.

3.0       Future Background Traffic Conditions

    3.1          Background Traffic Volume Projections

    The City of Boulder provides several sources of historical and predictive
    volume data to assist in the development of long-term growth projections.
    These include base Year 2001 and future Year 2025 predictive traffic models
    as well as historical growth rates for several arterial roadways.

    Per growth predictions from the Boulder TMP Model, A 0.5% growth rate was
    used for the short-term and long-term planning periods on the through
    movements of South Boulder Road.               Correspondingly, the through
    movements of Baseline Road and movements associated with the north leg
    of the 55th Street / Baseline Road intersection were assigned a growth rate of
    1.2%.

    The Fox Higgins Transportation Group assessed the potential traffic impacts of
    a proposed addition to the existing East Boulder Community Park. The
    primary addition is currently expected to consist of athletic fields. Per
    correspondence with Fox Higgins, the site would be expected to have an
    impact on evening peak hour traffic. As organized sports are not scheduled
    during the weekday morning peak hour, the affect of the additional
    development is expected to have a negligible impact on the morning peak
    hour. The text of this report can be found in the Appendix.

    Projected background traffic volumes for Years 2012 and 2025 are illustrated
    in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

    3.2          Intersection Level of Service - Background Traffic

    Levels of Service analyses were conducted for Year 2012 and year 2025
    Background Traffic Volumes. The results of these analyses are detailed below
    and in Table 1. Supporting Synchro analysis, including capacity, delay, and
    queuing analyses can be found in the Appendix of this report.

    1. South Boulder Road / Manhattan Drive:
    With the projected increase in background traffic volumes, the delay for the
    northbound and southbound movements at this intersection will also
    increase.

    In light of the significant delay at this intersection with the projected increase
    in background traffic volumes, two modifications were reviewed that could
    potentially improve the operation of the intersection.

    The first option would be to stripe separate left and through-right lanes on the
    northbound and southbound approaches. Adding a left turn lane in each
    direction of Manhattan Drive would not significantly affect the delay time for
    left turning vehicles, but would allow for right turning vehicles to move with
    less impedance. Both the northbound and southbound approaches of this
    intersection appear to have an existing paved width of approximately 36
    feet, which should be adequate for three lanes of traffic. This may also
    reflect the actual functioning of this intersection under existing conditions.
    RTD bus stops in both north and southbound directions were observed in
    close proximity to the north leg of this intersection. Any restriping of this
    approach may require a minor location shift of these stops to prevent buses
    from interfering with other traffic.

    While the re-striping would slightly improve operations, the Manhattan
    approaches of this intersection would still be expected to operate with high
    levels of delay.

    The second option would be the installation of a traffic signal. In order for a
    traffic signal to be installed, one or more of the Traffic Signal Warrant
    specified in the Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2003 (MUTCD)
    must be met prior to construction. These warrants consist of:

                 Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume.
                 Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume.
                 Warrant 3, Peak Hour.
                 Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume.
                 Warrant 5, School Crossing.
                 Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System.
                 Warrant 7, Crash Experience.
                 Warrant 8, Roadway Network.

    It should be noted, however, that the satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant
    does not mean that a signal will definitely be installed, only that a signal is
    allowed at that location.

    Using traffic data for Manhattan Drive north of South Boulder Road taken
    9/16/2008 and through traffic from the Boulder Valley Count Station Data
    collected east of 76th Street, this intersection appears to currently meet both
    the Four-Hour Vehicular Volume and Peak Hour Vehicular Volume Warrants
    for the installation of a traffic signal. Volumes are high enough to justify the
    Eight-hour Vehicular Volume for six of the required eight hours. This volume
    analysis can be seen in the Appendix.

    As a signalized intersection, this intersection would be expected to operate
    with overall Level of Service A and B in the AM and PM Peak Hours,
    respectively for both Year 2012 and Year 2025 Background Traffic Conditions.

    2. South Boulder Road / 55th Street:
    This southbound stop-controlled intersection is expected to operate
    satisfactorily during the peak hours for short range and long range
    background conditions (including the additional traffic generated by the
    proposed expansion of East Boulder Community Park). The southbound
    approach is projected to operate at LOS E during the AM Peak Hour for Year
    2025 background conditions. However, the delay is projected to be only 38
    seconds per vehicle.

    The remedies available to improve conditions for the southbound approach
    are similar to that of the Manhattan Drive/South Boulder Road intersection,
    adding a left turn lane or signalizing the intersection. With the addition of a
    left turn storage bay, this intersection would be expected to operate with less
    delay for the right-turning vehicles as the left-turning vehicles would be in a
    separate lane.

    It is not anticipated that this intersection will justify signalization, as only the
    peak hour vehicular volume signal warrant is met. Neither the four hour nor
    eight hour vehicular volume warrants are expected to be met with the
    addition of traffic generated by the expansion of East Boulder Community
    Park. A signal warrant analysis can be seen in the Appendix.

    3. Baseline Road / Manhattan Drive:
    This signalized intersection is expected to operate satisfactorily through the
    long-term planning horizon.

    4. Baseline Road / 55th Street:
    This signalized intersection is expected to operate with satisfactory overall
    Levels of Service through Year 2025 background traffic conditions. Two

    movements are projected to experience unsatisfactory conditions prior to
    Year 2025.

    The southbound left-turn movement is expected to reach Level of Service F
    for Year 2025 background traffic conditions.       The eastbound left-turn
    movement is projected to operate at Level of Service E in Year 2025.

    5. Kewanee Drive / Manhattan Drive:
    This westbound stop-controlled intersection is expected to maintain Levels of
    Service A under background conditions.

4.0       Project Generated Traffic and Trip Distribution

    4.1          Trip Generation

    The traffic to be generated as a result of this project has been estimated
    based upon trip generation rates contained in the 7th Edition Trip Generation
    Manual, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2003.

    This development is anticipated to consist of two different residential land
    uses. Included in this are 70 single family homes (ITE Land Use Code #210)
    and 70 senior orientated attached dwellings. While the land use description
    of these senior units conforms most closely to Congregate Care Facility (ITE
    Land Use #253), data for this use is extremely limited. However, the Senior
    Adult Housing-Attached (ITE Land Use #252) also conforms to the proposed
    land use and the data provided is more acceptable. Therefore, Senior Adult
    Housing  Attached was used for this analysis.

    As is shown in the table, the trips projected to be generated from the Senior
    Housing land use is significantly lower than the Single Family home land use.
    This can be attributed to the fact that the residents of these homes do not
    take as many trips over a given day as a typical single family home. Seniors
    are often retired and do not have children living with them. Therefore, the
    typical to/from work trips and to/from school trips are not produced from a
    Senior Adult housing development.

    In discussions with the City of Boulder, 15% discount on generated trips was
    applied to account for the alternate mode use projected for this
    development.      This discount will more accurately reflect the volumes
    projected to be generated by this development and reflects the proximity to
    the Boulder Community Park and the City of Boulder's successful and
    aggressive alternate modes policies.

    The Hogan-Pancost Property development is projected to generate
    approximately 777 trips over the course of an average weekday. This
    includes an estimated 55 AM Peak Hour trips and 71 PM Peak Hour trips.
    These volumes are shown on Table 2.

    4.2          Project Trip Distribution

    The distribution of project-generated vehicular traffic on adjacent roadways
    is influenced by several factors including the following:

                The location of the site relative to adjacent roadways
                The configuration of the existing and proposed adjacent roadway
                 network
                The anticipated land uses for the site and the surrounding areas

    Two distribution patterns were developed: A) With a connection to Kewanee
    Drive and B) Without a connection to Kewanee Drive. The results of applying
    the previous assumptions to the proposed roadway network result in the
    percentile distributions illustrated in Figures 5A and 5B.

4.3     Project Trip Assignment

      The assignment of project-generated traffic onto the existing roadway
      network is illustrated in Figures 6A and 6B. The volumes were derived by
      applying the trip distribution percentages in Figure 5A and 5B to the trip
      generation estimates in Table 2.

6.0              Transportation Impact Analysis

    6.1          Project Level of Service Impacts to Surrounding Roadway Network

    The potential impacts of the proposed Hogan-Pancost Property
    development were determined by performing peak-hour analyses utilizing
    Synchro 7.0. Levels of Service calculations were performed for Year 2012 and
    Year 2025 total traffic for the study intersections. The results of the analyses
    are summarized and below in Table 1.

    Intersection Level of Service  Total Traffic

    1. South Boulder Road / Manhattan Drive:
    Delay at this north-south stop-controlled intersection would not be
    significantly affected by project-generated traffic if a connection to
    Kewanee Drive is not constructed and access is limited to the 55th Street
    Access.

    If the access from the Hogan-Pancost Property to Kewanee Drive is
    constructed, an additional 7 outbound cars during the morning peak hour
    and approximately 5 outbound cars during the evening peak hour are
    expected at this intersection. The majority of these vehicles are expected to
    turn right (westbound) at this intersection. If the southbound movement is
    modeled with the existing single lane of traffic, the average delay would
    increase. Modeling this approach with a dedicated right turn lane makes
    the increase in delay due to project-generated traffic less significant.

    If a traffic signal is installed at this location, it is possible that up to 5 additional
    project-generated vehicles in the peak hour could turn left onto South
    Boulder Road, diverted from the intersection of 55th/South Boulder Road. If
    this intersection is signalized, it is projected to operate acceptably.

    2. South Boulder Road / 55th Street:
    The southbound movement at this stop-controlled intersection is projected to
    operate at a Level of Service E when project-generated traffic is added to
    Year 2012 background traffic. If a separate left turn lane is added in the
    southbound direction, the delay for the right-turning traffic would be
    decreased. In Year 2025, the southbound approach is projected to operate
    at LOS E during the AM Peak Hour and LOS D during the PM Peak Hour. If a
    separate southbound left-turn lane is striped, the left-turn would still be
    projected to operate at a LOS F, however queuing would not be expected
    to regularly exceed 50 feet (two cars) through Year 2025.

    It is unlikely that the addition of project-generated traffic would trigger any
    additional traffic signal warrants beyond the peak hour warrant already
    triggered.

    3. Baseline Road / Manhattan Drive:
    Delay at this signalized intersection would not be affected by project-
    generated traffic if the Hogan-Pancost Property is limited to the 55th Street
    Access.

    Assuming the addition of the Kewanee access, Manhattan Drive is projected
    to see a maximum of 14 peak hour trips in the vicinity of Baseline Road.
    Conditions at this intersection are anticipated to remain satisfactory with the
    addition of project-generated traffic through Year 2025.

    4. Baseline Road / 55th Street:
    This signalized intersection is anticipated to operate satisfactorily overall
    through the long-term planning horizon with the addition of project-
    generated traffic.

    The southbound left movement is currently experiencing high delay during
    the evening peak hour, which is expected to increase in the future under
    background conditions. The Hogan-Pancost Property is not anticipated to
    add volume to this movement.

    The eastbound left movement is projected to experience delay during the
    morning peak hour under Year 2025 background conditions. The Hogan-
    Pancost Property is not expected to traffic to this movement.

    5. Kewanee Drive / Manhattan Drive:
    This westbound stop-controlled intersection is anticipated to operate
    satisfactorily with the addition of project-generated traffic, given that full
    access is given to the Hogan-Pancost Property, through the long-term
    planning horizon.

    6. 55th Street / Access:
    This proposed southeast bound stop-controlled intersection is projected to
    operate satisfactorily with the addition of projected generated traffic
    through the long-term planning horizon.

    6.2          Project Volume Impacts to Surrounding Roadway Network

    The following exhibit, Table 3, shows the approximate contribution that the
    Hogan-Pancost Property could make to key locations to the existing traffic
    volumes. For those locations where less than 24 hours of data was collected,
    daily traffic was assumed to be 10x that of the evening peak hour.

    Accident Analysis
    Accident reports were obtained by the City of Boulder Police Department for
    the intersections of S. Boulder Road/Manhattan Drive, S. Boulder Road / 55th,
    Baseline / Manhattan, and Baseline/55th. The data includes accidents from
    Year 2005 through the available data for Year 2010. Below is a summary by
    intersection.

    South Boulder Road / Manhattan
    A total of 17 accidents were reported at this intersection between 2005 and
    April 2010. One fatality was reported in October, 2007 due to a pedestrian
    "improperly entering the intersection". Two injury accidents were reported in
    2005  both cited to driver error or careless driving. The details follow:
         2005: Four accidents occurred in 2005 and they were all rear-end
            type accidents. Three of the four occurred on Manhattan.
         2006: Three accidents occurred in 2006 and were comprised of one
            rear-end and two right-angle where the turning vehicle failed to yield
            the right-of-way. The rear end accident occurred on Manhattan and
            the right-angle accidents occurred on Boulder Road.
         2007: Four accidents occurred in 2007. Two of the four accidents
            were vehicles hitting the median on Boulder Road. One swerved to
            avoid an animal and the other was cited as reckless driving. A third
            accident as a rear-end type accident on Manhattan where a vehicle
            backed into another. The fourth was a fatality accident where an
            eastbound vehicle hit a northbound pedestrian that entered the
            intersection improperly.
         2008: Four accidents occurred in 2008. One was a side-swipe on
            Boulder Road due to icy road conditions. One was a southbound
            vehicle turning right that collided with a parked vehicle in the
            westbound direction. The site line was blocked by a fire truck. The
            third was a rear-end on Manhattan and the fourth was on Boulder
            Road where two vehicles collided due to an improper lane change.
         2009: One accident occurred in 2009. This accident was caused by
            driver error (driver's dog jumped on him) and the vehicle hit a power
            pole on Boulder Road.
         2010: One accident has occurred this year in which a single vehicle
            collided with several objects on Boulder Road. Reckless driving was
            cited.

    There does not appear to be a particular trend of accidents that could be
    corrected by intersection improvements or changes. Most of the accidents
    over the 5 year 춑lus period were due to driver error and reckless driving. No
    roadway or intersection improvements are recommended.

    South Boulder Road / 55th
    Only one accident was reported at this intersection for the study years. The
    accident occurred in 2006 and involved one vehicle that collided with the
    median on Boulder Road. Careless driving was cited. No roadway and /or
    intersection improvements are warranted.

    Baseline / 55th
    A total of 31 accidents occurred at this intersection between 2005 and 2009.
    No fatalities were reported but four injury accidents occurred.

             2005: Five accidents occurred in 2005. Four were rear end accidents
              of which three occurred on 55th Street in the southbound direction.
              The fifth accident was a right-angle accident on Baseline where the
              turning vehicle failed to yield the right-of-way.
             2006: Six accidents occurred in 2006. Two involved single vehicles 
              one hit the median on Baseline and one hit a deer. Three were rear
              end accidents  two on Baseline and one on 55th. The sixth accident
              was a right-angle on Baseline where the turning vehicle didn't yield
              the right-of-way
             2007: Eight accidents occurred in 2007. Four of the eight accidents
              were rear end of which three occurred on 55th. A fifth was a
              sideswipe on Baseline. The other three were right-angle accidents on
              Baseline where the reason cited was failure to yield right-of-way.
             2008: Eight accidents occurred in 2008. Of the eight accidents, five
              involved vehicles hitting bicyclists. All five occurred during daylight
              hours - four during the summer months, the other in November. The
              accidents involved vehicles turning left or right and failing to yield to a
              bicyclist. Three resulted in injuries. Two of the eight accidents were
              rear end accidents that occurred on 55th Street. The eighth accident
              occurred on Baseline and was due to an improper lane change.
             2009: Four accidents occurred in 2009. Two involved single vehicles
              that hit objects due to careless driving. A third was a vehicle that hit a
              bicyclist, resulting in injury. The vehicle was turning left off of Baseline
              and hit the bicyclist. The fourth accident was a rear end accident on
              55th.

    One pattern that is shown at this intersection is the accidents between
    vehicles and bicyclists. Six accidents involving bicyclists is definitely a pattern
    and this intersection should be annually reviewed by the City of Boulder to
    see if there is a safe means to get the bicyclists through the intersection.

    Baseline / Manhattan
    A total of 14 accidents occurred at this intersection between 2005 and 2009.
    No fatalities were reported but three injury accidents occurred.

             2005: Six accidents occurred in 2005. Four were rear end accidents
              of which three occurred on Manhattan in the northbound direction.
              The fifth accident was a right-angle accident where a vehicle turning
              onto Manhattan failed to yield right-of-way to a vehicle on
              Manhattan. The sixth accident involved a vehicle that hit a
              pedestrian. The vehicle was northbound on Manhattan turning left
              onto Baseline and failed to yield to the pedestrian crossing north on
              Baseline.
             2006: One accident occurred in 2006. The accident was a rear end
              accident where an eastbound vehicle slowed to turn right onto
              Manhattan and was rear ended.
             2007: Two accidents occurred in 2007 and they technically occurred
              south of the intersection. One vehicle hit a parked car on Manhattan
              and the other hit a southbound car as it pulled out of its parking
              place.
             2008: One accident occurred in 2008. It also occurred south of the
              intersection and involved a vehicle pulling out of a driveway hitting a
              northbound vehicle.
             2009: Four accidents occurred in 2009. One involved an eastbound
              vehicle hitting a pedestrian crossing Baseline. One involved an
              eastbound vehicle turning right onto Baseline and hitting a bicyclist.
              The third was a result of an illegal westbound u-turn hitting an
              eastbound vehicle. The fourth was a rear end accident on
              Manhattan where the vehicle failed to stop.

    There is no apparent pattern of accidents that appears correctable by
    intersection modifications.

    The projected increase in traffic to the study intersections from the proposed
    project does not indicate that accidents would increase or that there would
    be improvements warranted due to accidents.

7.0       Recommendations

    7.1          Roadway Improvements

    South Boulder Road / Manhattan Drive
    It is recommended that this intersection be re-striped to accommodate an
    exclusive southbound left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane.
    Analysis indicates that a 75-foot left turn bay and associated taper should be
    adequate to accommodate Year 2025 volumes.

    Using traffic data for Manhattan Drive north of South Boulder Road taken
    9/16/2008 and through traffic from the Boulder Valley Count Station Data
    collected east of 76th Street, this intersection appears to currently meet both
    the Four-Hour Vehicular Volume and Peak Hour Vehicular Volume Warrants
    for the installation of a traffic signal. Volumes are high enough to justify the
    Eight-hour Vehicular Volume for six of the required eight hours. The remaining
    warrants are not expected to be met at this time.

    As a signalized intersection, this intersection would be expected to operate
    with significantly less delay than as a stop-controlled intersection.

    The intersection of Manhattan Drive and South Boulder Road should be
    considered for signalization, regardless of whether the Hogan-Pancost
    Property is constructed.

    South Boulder Road / 55th Street
    It is recommended that the southbound approach be modified to
    accommodate a separate 50 foot left turn lane and associated taper. With
    these modifications, this stop-controlled approach as a whole should remain
    acceptable through Year 2025. It appears that delay can be mitigated
    through Year 2025 with the addition of a left turn bay. This intersection should
    be monitored for potential signalization.

8.0     Conclusions

    If the recommendations of this report are followed, the transportation
    network in the vicinity of the Hogan-Pancost Property development can
    accommodate the addition of project generated traffic.

5399 Kewanee - Traffic Study Parameters
A traffic impact study is a requirement of Site Review since trip generation was shown to exceed
the residential development threshold of 20 vehicle trips or greater during any single hour. In
addition to meeting the following parameters, the traffic study format must be in compliance with
section 2.03 of the City of Boulder Design and Construction Standards (DCS). Accident analyses
and noise attenuation measures are not required by the city for this project.

Relevant Transportation Area and Sub-area Plans:
The traffic study must consider and comply with the following plans regarding future build-out
volumes, connections, etc.:
1. The traffic study and site plan must be in compliance with the City of Boulder Transportation
    Master Plan (TMP).
     The applicant is notified that the TMP shows a multi-use path extending from 55th Street
         on the eastern portion of this site, north across the Recreation Center property to connect
         with the existing multi-use path adjacent to the westernmost parking lot at the Recreation
         Center.
     The TMP can be found on the City of Boulder website (www.bouldercolorado.gov)
         Follow the links to: Departments -> Public Works -> Transportation -> Transportation
         Master Plan
2. The traffic study and site plan should consider and coordinate with the Draft East Boulder
    Community Park Plan.

Proposed Street Sections/Improvements
A daily traffic volume analysis must be provided for each of the proposed public streets within the
development in order to support the proposed street sections in accordance with Table 2-13 of
the DCS. The transportation consultant or engineer preparing the study is encouraged to contact
Michelle Mahan (303-441-4417) prior to Site Review submittal to confirm the street sections
required by the analysis.

If public improvements are proposed in order to bring any approach of any intersection back up to
level of service (LOS) D where the addition of project generated traffic has caused the LOS to fall
below this standard for the city, the improvements must be demonstrated on the submitted site
plans.

Study Area Boundaries
At a minimum, the following intersections must be analyzed:
     Baseline/Manhattan
     Baseline/55th
     South Boulder Road/Manhattan
     South Boulder Road/55th
     Kewanee/Manhattan
     Proposed street connection to Kewanee
     Proposed street connection to 55th

Level of Service Analysis
The level of service analysis must be performed for the above outlined intersections for:
    existing traffic conditions, project completion year background traffic, project completion
        year total traffic, 2025 background traffic, and 2025 total traffic
    am and pm peak hour conditions

For existing timing and phasing of signalized intersections, contact Joe Paulson, City of Boulder
Signal Operations Engineer, at 303-441-3289.

A level of service comparison table must be provided which compares all level of service
scenarios and includes the number of seconds of delay for each movement. All level of service
scenarios must be included on the same page for easy comparison.

Methods for Projecting Future Year Background Traffic Volumes
Future year background traffic volumes should consider the 2025 TMP travel model (see
attached maps), historic traffic volume data if available, and the anticipated East Boulder
Community Park improvements. The following should be noted when using the 2025 TMP travel
model:
     The travel model includes assumptions that Boulder will increase its alternate mode
        share and in some corridors traffic volumes may actually decrease in the future, which is
        built into the model. The user of these model projections should be aware that these
        mode use assumptions are built into the TMP traffic model when developing future traffic
        estimates.
     Determine the percentage that the model is low or high by comparing the Base Year
        (2001) Volumes model assignment (numbers with no parenthesis) and the Base Year
        (2001) Volumes actual count (numbers with parenthesis). Use this percentage to
        appropriately adjust the Fiscally Constrained 2025 Volumes.

Historic Growth Rates and Intersection Count Data
Traffic counts and growth rate information can be found on the "Map It" function on the City of
Boulder website (www.bouldercolorado.gov).
Follow the links to: A-Z -> TMP -> Map It -> Streets -> Traffic Counts

Since the latest available city counts are more than 2 years old, new counts should be taken.

Trip Generation Reductions
Any trip reduction methods used should be clearly demonstrated in the study. This includes but
is not limited to reductions due to multi-modal/shared trips, internal trips, pass-by trips, and
diverted trips.

Travel Demand Management Strategies
At the time of Site Review submittal, a Travel Demand Management (TDM) plan in accordance
with section 2.03(I) of the DCS and section 9-2-14(h)(2)(D) of the Boulder Revised Code is
required to be submitted which outlines strategies to mitigate traffic impacts created by the
proposed development and implementable measures for promoting alternate modes of travel.
The applicant should contact Andrea Robbins (303-441-4139) with GO Boulder, to discuss TDM
options. In addition to incorporating the TDM plan into the traffic impact study, the TDM plan
must also be submitted as a separate document with Site Review submittal.

1.0    Introduction

The City of Boulder Parks and Recreation Department is developing plans to provide
enhancements to the East Boulder Community Park located adjacent to the East Boulder
Recreation and Senior Centers. The park location and vicinity are illustrated on Figure 1.

Currently the park has a variety of outdoor court facilities, a playground, a dog park, and
a large open turf area approximately the size of one and one half soccer fields. The turf
area is used for programmed sports activities with the most active being youth soccer.
The park is served by a 104 space parking lot (separate from the recreation center parking
lot) located between the soccer field and the court area. A paved multi-use path traverses
through the park in an east-west direction. The park currently includes a large
unimproved and unused dirt area located between the soccer field and the dog park, south
of the parking lot.

This traffic study estimates the additional traffic that will be generated by proposed new
uses at the park and analyzes the traffic impact on area roadways. It also evaluates the
impact of completing the missing section of Sioux Drive adjacent to the recreation center
parking lot.

2.0    Proposed Park Expansion

The proposed park improvement plan includes a number of enhancements to the existing
court area, including restrooms, lighting, shelters, and new p'etanque courts. There will
also be improvements made to the dog park area. A second 104 space parking lot will be
added south of the dog park with access to 55th Street. This new parking area will
provide efficient access to the south end of the new turf field and the dog park. The
proposed park enhancement plan is illustrated on Figure 2.

The most significant expansion to the park that will impact traffic access is the addition
of a new soccer/turf field south of the existing parking lot. In addition, both soccer/turf
fields (new and existing) will be surfaced with artificial turf. The new turf/soccer field
will allow for an expansion of the existing programmed recreational sports use on any
given day, and the artificial turf will likely extend the use of the fields over a long season.

3.0    Existing Roadway and Traffic Conditions

All traffic accessing the park and recreation center from outside the immediate
neighborhoods must use 55th Street from either Baseline Road on the north or South
Boulder Road on the south. 55th Street is classified as a collector and has a 25 mph speed
limit. Portions of 55th Street in this segment are narrow, curving, and have landscaped
medians. The 55th Street alignment is not continuous across the park, and the southern
portion winds to the east around the recreation center. Sioux Drive travels along the
north edge of the park and connects the north and south portions of 55th Street but even it
is not continuous adjacent to the recreation center. A short segment of Sioux Drive was
not completed historically, but a connection through the recreation center parking lot is

physically possible. The net result is a very disjointed and indirect roadway connection
between Baseline Road and South Boulder Road in the 55th Street corridor.

Existing traffic conditions in the vicinity of the park were documented this spring during
the youth soccer season (historically the peak use period of the park), including:

       Weekday PM peak hour traffic in the Baseline/55th Street intersection and the
       South Boulder Road/55th Street intersection
       24-hour traffic volume on 55th Street both north and south of the park on
       weekdays and weekends
       Parking lot utilization during weekday PM and Saturday morning peak hours
       when youth soccer was in session
       Parking occupancy on adjacent residential roadways and school parking lot during
       periods of youth soccer activity
       East-west cut-through traffic in the recreation center parking lot adjacent to the
       missing section of Sioux Drive.

Existing traffic conditions are summarized in Figures 3 and 4. Significant observations
include the following:

        There are approximately 2,500 vehicles per weekday using 55th Street just north
        of the park and 1,200 vehicles per day just south of the park.
        Weekend traffic on 55th Street is typically 20 to 25% lower than on weekdays.
        Existing traffic on 55th Street is well below the daily roadway capacity which is
        typically considered to be at least 10,000 vehicles per day on 2-lane collectors.
        The 104 space parking lot is full during the weekday PM peak hour when
        inbound and outbound soccer teams overlap when the fields are transitioning
        between the early and late afternoon programmed use periods. The parking lot
        utilization peaked at 82% on Saturday mornings during the soccer turnover
        period.
        No significant park related parking was observed on any of the surrounding
        neighborhood streets. There was some park related parking in the south lot at the
        Manhattan School to the west of the existing turf area.

Existing weekday PM peak hour traffic level of service (LOS) was calculated for the
Baseline/55th and South Boulder Road/55th intersections using calculation procedures
detailed in the Federal Highway Association's Highway Capacity Manual. The LOS
scale uses letter grades between A and F, with A representing little or no congestion, and
F representing periods with significant congestion and vehicular delay. A detailed
description of traffic conditions associated with each letter grade is attached in the
Appendix. The LOS is calculated for each intersection approach movement (left,
through, or right as appropriate), and summarized for the entire intersection. Intersection
peak hour LOS in the A-D range is typically considered acceptable, while LOS E or F
may indicate the need for mitigation measures (although it should be noted that it is
common for stop sign controlled side street approaches to arterial roadways to operate in
the LOS E or F range at accepted levels of delay) .

Table 1 summarizes the LOS in each intersection and detailed calculation sheets are
included in the Appendix. It can be seen that the signalized Baseline/55th Street
intersection currently operates acceptably at LOS D, with individual southbound
movements experiencing congestion (using the same signal timing inputs as programmed
by City of Boulder staff in the field). The South Boulder Road/55th Street intersection
currently operates well, with the southbound stop controlled movement at LOS C.

4.0    Connecting Sioux Drive to Avoid Parking Lot Cut-Through

As noted above, the discontinuous segment of Sioux Drive results in through traffic
cutting through the recreation center parking lot. This cut-through movement was
documented during the weekday PM peak hour and the Saturday morning peak hour
when there were programmed soccer activities at the park. Figure 4 illustrates the cut-
through route in the parking lot. Approximately 100 vehicles were observed during the
weekday PM peak with half traveling in each direction. Approximately 60 vehicles were
observed on Saturday morning cutting through the lot.

It is not known how much of this
traffic cutting through the parking lot
might have been destined to/from the
west parking lot and the soccer field.
Similarly, it is also not known how
much traffic is from adjacent
neighborhoods, or how much is
traveling all the way between
Baseline Road and South Boulder
Road. But what is known is that this
through traffic in a parking lot is not
desirable and potentially an unsafe
mix with autos and pedestrians
accessing parking stalls at the recreation center. While we are not aware of a documented
accident problem, it is our understanding from recreation center staff that there are
numerous close calls and associated complaints.

The proposed park improvement plan includes the connection of the missing piece of
Sioux Drive. It is our opinion that this will be a significant safety improvement in the
vicinity of the recreation center. It is understood that adjacent neighborhood residents
may be concerned that this connection will "attract" traffic traveling through between
Baseline Road and South Boulder Road. To address this concern, the Parks Department
has proposed that a median and speed humps be constructed in Sioux Drive to add "travel
impedance or friction" and discourage cut-through travel. It is our understanding that the
Boulder Fire Department does not object to these traffic calming measures because this
section of the 55th Street corridor is not a Critical Emergency Response Route and the
speed humps will be placed so as to not impede their response route to the west access of
the recreation center parking lot.

Finally, a serious of timed trips between Baseline Road and South Boulder Road (both
directions) were conducted on Foothills Highway, 55th Street, and Cherryvale Road.
Results indicate that it takes more than twice as long to travel along 55th Street, with over
a two minute penalty relative to either of the other two routes. On this basis we do not
believe this connection on Sioux Drive will attract any new cut-through traffic from
outside the area, and we strongly support its implementation.

5.0      Trip Generation

Studies at many other parks in Boulder and other communities have indicated that each
park and the traffic that they generate tends to be unique to each location and there is no
established "trip generation rate" that would accurately predict what the proposed park
expansions at this location will generate. Since the proposed expansion of this park is
predominantly adding more of the existing park uses, we have estimated the automobile
trips that will be generated based on a detailed observation of the traffic accessing the
existing park. In addition to the traffic data listed above, this study has included
observations of the pedestrian interaction between the existing 104 space parking lot and
the adjacent recreational facilities to help with estimation of future park traffic.

As noted above, the predominant new or expanded use at the park will be the addition of
a new soccer/turf field. The new field will increase the available space for programmed
soccer by approximately 70%.

It is estimated, base on our observations of park access, that the current soccer activity
generates 100 inbound and 100 outbound automobile trips during the weekday PM peak
hour when youth soccer is in operation. For purposes of this study it is estimated that the
new park enhancements and expansions will add an additional 100 inbound and 100
outbound automobile trips during the weekday PM peak hour. Most of this traffic will be
related to the new turf field but some will also be generated by the enhancements to the
rest of the park. Weekend traffic increases will likely be 70 to 80% of the weekday
increases, at a time when the adjacent roadways are carrying less traffic.

6.0      Trip Distribution

Based on the location of the new soccer/turf field within the park, the addition of a new
104 space parking lot on the south side of the park, existing traffic patterns, and the
general location of the park relative to the rest of the community, it is estimated that:

         50% of the new park traffic will be oriented to/from Baseline Road, and 50% will
         be oriented to/from South Boulder Road.
         There will be no significant increase (and possibly a slight decrease) in traffic
         accessing the park from the Manhattan Drive corridor.

The anticipated directional distribution of new park access traffic is illustrated in Figure
5.

7.0    Traffic Assignment

The anticipated new PM peak hour traffic accessing the park has been assigned to the
adjacent roadways using the directional distribution assumptions discussed above. The
result is illustrated in Figures 6A and 6B. It is anticipated that the location of the new
parking lot will minimize the amount of park traffic that circulates around the recreation
center, but will not eliminate it.

8.0    Existing Plus Site Generated Traffic Conditions

The new park traffic was added to the existing peak traffic during the weekday PM peak
hour. The result is illustrated on Figure 7. The 55th Street intersections at Baseline Road
and South Boulder Road were then evaluated, using the same procedures described
above, to determine the impact of the additional park traffic (calculation sheets in the
Appendix). It can be seen in Table 1 that the additional park traffic will add marginally
(less than a second per vehicle) to the overall delay at the Baseline intersection, and none
of the individual intersection approaches will drop a letter grade. The slight increase in
overall delay results in the intersection LOS dropping into the E range, but just slightly.
No improvements are needed to accommodate the additional park traffic at this
intersection.

The delay for the southbound approach at the South Boulder Road/55th Street intersection
will increase by approximately 4 seconds per vehicle, which drops this approach's LOS
into the D range. This intersection will continue to operate acceptably with the existing
stop sign control.

9.0    Year 2030 Background Traffic Conditions

Traffic projections have been made for a long range planning horizon (Year 2030) to
allow an evaluation of the additional park traffic in the future when area traffic has
increased. Background traffic projections (without the addition of new park traffic) have
been made by using projections on area roadways in the City's regional travel model, and
by incorporating the potential traffic increase related to the residential development of the
vacant parcel immediately southwest of the park. This residential development is
currently in the planning process and traffic projections for that site have been
incorporated into this study. That project is currently evaluating two access scenarios,
with and without a local roadway connection to Kiwanne Drive and the Manhattan
corridor. To be conservative relative to 55th Street traffic, this study has used the
projections that do not include a local connection to Kiwanne Drive. The resultant Year
2030 background traffic projections are illustrated in Figure 8 at the Baseline/55th and
South Boulder Road/55th Street intersections.

The LOS at the major intersections serving the park site was evaluated for this future year
background condition using the same procedures described above. The results are
included in Table 1. It can be seen that the signalized Baseline/55th intersection will

continue to operate in the LOS E range with only a marginal increase in average vehicle
delay.

At the South Boulder Road/55th intersection the southbound approach drops into the LOS
E range. This is due to the addition of the new residential traffic and the increases in
background traffic on South Boulder Road which make it harder to turn out onto South
Boulder Road from 55th during the peak hour. The relative need for a traffic signal or
other intersection improvement at this location is discussed in a following section of this
report.

10.0      Year 2030 Plus Site Traffic Conditions

New park traffic has been added to the Year 2030 background traffic discussed above to
yield the projected Year 2030 total traffic illustrated on Figure 9. A LOS evaluation at
the Baseline/55th intersection indicates that the intersection will continue to operate in the
LOS E range with most individual traffic movements remaining at the same LOS. The
northbound left turn is projected to drop into the LOS E range with the addition of both
the new park and new residential traffic.

The South Boulder Road intersection will experience an increase in delay on the
southbound approach with the addition of the new park traffic (on top of the new
residential traffic). This approach is calculated to operate in the LOS F range (although
we typically observe that the LOS software and calculation procedures tend to
overestimate the delay for side streets at stop signs). The next section of this report
discusses potential mitigation measures for this condition.

11.0      Traffic Control at the South Boulder Road / 55th Street Intersection

The LOS analysis at the South Boulder Road/55th Street intersection has concluded that
the southbound stop sign controlled approach to this intersection currently operates
acceptably at LOS D. This approach will drop to LOS E in the PM peak hour in the Year
2030 with the addition of the adjacent residential project (or the park expansion without
the residential project), and it will drop to LOS F with both the park expansion and the
residential project's traffic added.

While this level of side street delay exists today at many other intersections in town, it
does suggest that potential mitigation measures be identified. Two choices are described
below:

           55th Street is approximately 40 feet wide north of South Boulder Road with
           single northbound and southbound travel lanes. The existing pavement could be
           restriped to maintain a single northbound lane but add a separate short (say 40
           feet plus transition) southbound left turn lane. This restriping would require
           prohibiting on-street parking along 55th for some distance north of South
           Boulder Road in an area where the adjacent land area is vacant. This
           southbound left turn lane would allow the higher right turning southbound traffic

              the ability to access westbound South
              Boulder Road more efficiently. In the
              Year 2030 Total traffic scenario, this
              improvement      would     allow     the
              southbound right turns to operate at
              LOS B and the overall southbound
              approach would operate at LOS E
              (calculation sheet in the Appendix).
              This    would     be   a     significant
              improvement for southbound traffic,
              although given the width of the
              roadway, this side-by-side southbound
              approach may already be occurring to
              some extent.

              Another way to minimize congestion for southbound traffic (at the expense of
              east-west traffic on South Boulder Road) would be to install a traffic signal. The
              Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) includes a set of traffic
              signal "warrants" to determine if a traffic signal may be needed, and typically a
              number of these warrants must be met before the City would consider installing
              a traffic signal. The Peak Hour Warrant is one that can be evaluated at the
              traffic study stage and is often used as an indicator for future traffic mitigation
              needs and measures. Figure 10 includes the peak hour warrant graph with
              plotted points for each of the traffic scenarios evaluated in this study. A review
              of this peak hour warrant graph indicates that:

          -         Existing traffic does not warrant a traffic signal in the PM peak hour.
          -         The "Existing Plus Site" and "Year 2030 Background" scenarios both may
                    warrant a signal in the PM with the single southbound lane, and both
                    would not warrant a signal if a second southbound lane were added.
          -         The "Year 2030 Total" traffic scenario may warrant a signal even with the
                    addition of a second southbound approach lane, but the City would need to
                    confirm at the time (looking at all the warrants based on actual traffic
                    volumes, accident history, etc.). It should be noted that not all
                    intersections meeting a peak hour signal warrant are actual candidates for
                    traffic signal installation.

12.0      Conclusions and Recommendations

This traffic study has evaluated the anticipated traffic impacts associated with the
expansion of the East Boulder Community Park. The most significant new traffic
generator during peak traffic access times will be the addition of another soccer/turf field.
Traffic projections have been made for near term and long term planning horizons, and
the addition of traffic from the potential new residential development south of the park
has been included. Significant observations and recommendations include:

       New park uses may add approximately 100 inbound and 100 outbound vehicle
       trips during the weekday PM peak hour when the turf fields are programmed for
       youth soccer.
       Peak weekend traffic is less than peak weekday traffic, and the background traffic
       on adjacent roadways is also less on weekends.
       The 55th Street corridor will be able to easily accommodate the additional traffic
       generated by the park from a volume-to-capacity perspective.
       New traffic will likely be distributed equally from the Baseline and South Boulder
       Road corridors, and no significant increase on Manhattan Drive is anticipated.
       The new 104 space parking lot should be able to accommodate the increased
       parking demand generated by proposed enhancements.
       The missing piece of Sioux Drive should be completed to eliminate the parking
       lot cut-through that currently exists at the recreation center. We do not anticipate
       that this connection will attract any new cut-through traffic between Baseline
       Road and South Boulder Road, but we do support the proposed traffic calming
       treatments on Sioux Drive to manage traffic speed in this area.
       The signalized intersection of Baseline Road and 55th Street will be able to
       accommodate the increased traffic projected from all sources in the Year 2030
       with marginal increase in overall vehicle delay.
       The southbound approach to the stop sign on 55th Street at South Boulder Road
       will experience increased delay over time as traffic grows on South Boulder Road
       and the park expansion and the adjacent residential project are implemented. It is
       questionable whether the City's traffic signal warranting procedure (based on the
       MUTCD) would actually be met at this intersection, but it is certain that delay can
       be minimized with the addition of a short southbound left turn lane. This new
       lane could be striped in the existing roadway width with minimal disruption of
       on-street parking and would greatly improve the unsignalized LOS at this
       location. It is recommended that this improvement be pursued.
       Residents in the area have expressed concerns about pedestrian safety in the
       crosswalks near Ontario Place, and at the multi-use path crossing of 55th Street
       just south of Sioux Drive. It is recommended that the City's transportation
       division staff tours these crossings to make sure that the signing and marking is
       appropriate or if any improvements are needed.

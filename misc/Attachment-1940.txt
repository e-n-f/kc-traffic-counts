RE:         2100 Mayfair Residential Apartments
            Wauwatosa, Wisconsin
            Traffic Impact Assessment

INTRODUCTION
Commercial United, LLC is proposing to construct a 134 unit, 5-story apartment building along
WIS 100 (N. Mayfair Road) in Wauwatosa Wisconsin. An office building currently occupies the
redevelopment site and will be removed. R.A. Smith National has been retained to conduct
traffic analysis services for the development. At the City's request, a traffic impact analysis was
conducted to evaluate existing traffic conditions, identify potential traffic impacts of the
proposed redevelopment, and recommend improvements to mitigate these impacts. This report
summarizes the procedures, findings, and recommendations of the traffic study.

STUDY AREA
The proposed redevelopment parcel is generally located north of US 45, east of WIS 100 (N.
Mayfair Road), and south of W. Garfield Avenue in the City of Wauwatosa, as shown in Exhibit
1. The following intersections were included in the study area.

      WIS 100 with W. Garfield Avenue
      W. Garfield Avenue with the backage/access road

Descriptions of the study area roadways are provide below.

WIS 100 (N. Mayfair Road) is a six-lane divided urban arterial and had a Year 2010 annual
average daily traffic (AADT) volume of 42,900 vehicles per day vpd (north of the US 45 off-
ramp). Within the study area, the posted speed limit along WIS 100 is 40 mph. Sidewalks are
provided along both sides of the roadway and parking is not allowed.

W. Garfield Avenue is a two-lane, undivided local roadway. AADT information is not available.
The unposted statutory speed limit is 25 mph. Sidewalks are provided along both sides of the
roadway and parking is allowed between the backage road and WIS 100 (3 hour limit).

A backage road provides access to two existing office buildings located just east of WIS 100 and
south of W. Garfield Avenue (2130 and 2100 N. Mayfair Road), as well as several single family
residential garages. The backage road is public right-of-way and it is approximately 20' wide.
The backage road connects to W. Fisher Parkway to the south and W. Garfield Avenue to the
north.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
The existing transportation system including intersection geometry, lane configuration,
intersection spacing, and traffic control is shown in Exhibit 2.

Existing Traffic Volumes
R.A. Smith National collected weekday morning (7:00 am to 9:00 am) and weekday evening
(4:00 pm to 6:00 pm) peak period turning movement counts at the W. Garfield Avenue
intersections with WIS 100 and the backage road.

Based on traffic counts, the peak traffic hours were identified as follows.

            Weekday Morning:                        7:45 am to 8:45 am
            Weekday Evening:                        4:30 pm to 5:30 pm

The Year 2014 existing peak hour volumes are provided in Exhibit 3. Raw turning movement
counts are provided in Appendix A.

Existing Development
The existing parcel currently contains a 31,500 SF multi-tenant office building. The building
includes underground parking and an adjacent surface lot. The backage road provides access to
both parking areas. An aerial view of the existing site is provided in Exhibit 4.

Existing Office Building Trip Generation
The existing office building is currently only partially occupied and has the potential for higher
traffic than shown in the existing counts. Therefore, the weekday morning and evening peak
hour vehicle trips for the existing office building were estimated using Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition, 2012. Table 1 summarizes the estimated trip
generation.

                                                              Table 1

As shown in Table 1, the existing development (when fully occupied) is expected to generate 50
trips (45 in/5 out) during the weekday morning and 45 trips (5 in/40 out) during the weekday
evening peak periods.

Year 2014 Existing Traffic Analysis
The study intersections were analyzed using the procedures set forth in the 2010 Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) to evaluate the existing traffic operations based on the Level of Service
(LOS). Level of Service is a quantitative measure that refers to the overall quality of flow at an
intersection ranging from very good, represented by LOS `A', to very poor, represented by LOS
`F'. For analysis and design purposes, LOS `D' was used to define acceptable peak hour
operating conditions. Synchro software was used to perform the traffic signal analysis.

Table 2 provides weekday morning and weekday evening peak hour operating conditions for the
Year 2014 existing traffic at the study intersections. The Year 2014 existing traffic analysis is
based on the existing intersection geometrics and traffic control.

    No traffic control is present at the W. Garfield Avenue intersection with the Backage Road. Based on field
    observations the intersection operates as two-way stop control with W. Garfield Avenue free-flow.

(-) Indicates movement is not allowed.

As shown in Table 2, all movements operate acceptably at LOS C or better under existing traffic
conditions except the westbound right-turn movement at the WIS 100 intersection with W.
Garfield Avenue. The volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c) is 0.36, indicating there is sufficient
capacity to accommodate the movement. Field observations showed moderate delays and
queues for the westbound right-turn movement during the evening peak traffic hour, but minimal
adverse delays and queues during non-peak hours.

Year 2014 existing 95th percentile queues are shown in Exhibit 5. Analysis output reports are
provided in Appendix B.

FUTURE CONDITIONS
Proposed Development
The proposed development includes a 134 unit, 5-story apartment building at 2100 N. Mayfair
Road. The existing office building currently on the site will be removed. A preliminary concept
plan for the proposed redevelopment is provided in Exhibit 6.

The majority of parking for the apartment building is proposed to be provided within first floor
and underground enclosed parking areas. A small surface lot is proposed north of the building.



T:\1130230\Traffic\Deliverables\2100 Mayfair TIA Memo.docx                                                      3|P a g e
Two driveways (one for the surface lot and one for the enclosed parking) are proposed on the
public backage road and will provide access to the apartment building. No access points are
proposed on W. Garfield Avenue or WIS 100. All traffic traveling to and from the apartment
building will use the backage road.

Development Traffic
Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the proposed apartment development were
estimated based on trip data published in the ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition.

Year 2014 Base Traffic Volumes
The proposed apartment development will replace an existing 31,500 SF office building. Trips
associated with this office development were removed from the roadway network. The Year
2014 base traffic volumes, accounting for the removal, are shown in Exhibit 7.

Note the existing office building is only partially occupied. Therefore, the volumes removed will
not match the volumes in Table 1. Also, the two-story office/retail building located just north of
the proposed redevelopment site will remain and traffic associated with this development was
not removed.

Trip Generation
The weekday morning and evening peak hour vehicle trips were estimated for the proposed
apartment development using ITE Trip Generation. Table 3 summarizes the estimated trip
generation.

                                                        Table 3

As shown in Table 3, the proposed development is expected to generate 70 trips (15 in/55out)
during the weekday morning peak hour and 85 trips (55 in/30out) during the weekday evening
peak hour. This results in a net increase of 20 trips in the weekday morning peak and 40 trips in
the weekday evening peak period, when compared to the estimated trip generation for the
existing office building (when fully occupied). It should be noted that the in/out patterns of the
site are expected to change with the apartment development (primarily outbound in the morning
and inbound in the evening) as compared to the office building (primarily inbound in the
morning and outbound in the evening).

Trip Distribution
The trip distribution pattern was developed based on existing traffic volume patterns, AADT
volumes, the surrounding street network, and location of the development site. The trip
distribution pattern used in the analysis is provided below and shown graphically in Exhibit 8.

            To/From the north via US 45:                    10%
            To/From the south via WIS 100:                  20%
            To/From the south vis US 45:                    25%
            To/From the east via North Avenue:              15%
            To/From the west via North Avenue:              10%

Trip Assignment
Traffic generated by the proposed development was assigned to the adjacent roadway system
based on the above directional distribution. The development trip assignment is shown in
Exhibit 9. Specific travel routes for some movements to and from the site will be less direct due
to recent access restrictions implemented along WIS 100 with the 2012 corridor project and
impacts from congestion.

The majority of apartment development traffic is expected to use WIS 100 and W. Garfield
Avenue (west of the backage road) when traveling to and from the site. Although the WIS 100
intersection with W. Garfield Avenue is restricted to right-in/right-out movements only, median
openings and signalized intersections along WIS 100 allowing u-turns will provide full access to
and from the apartment development site. Requiring this type of access maneuver is common
along major arterials and presents a safety benefit by removing left-turn movements at
unsigalized locations.

Based on the traffic analysis and field observations, drivers entering northbound WIS 100 from
W. Garfield Avenue encounter longer delays during the weekday evening peak hour as compared
to other times of the day. Traffic exiting the development site is expected to be most affected by
these delays. As the delays increase, drivers may decide to use W. Garfield Avenue (east of the
backage road), 104th Street, or other local roads as a cut through route to reach the arterial
roadway network.

The travel patterns of the apartment development are opposite of the existing office building.
The office traffic is predominantly inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening, while
the apartment traffic is predominantly outbound in the morning and inbound in the evening.
Therefore, while some exiting apartment drivers may choose to use the cut through routes to the
east during the evening peak hour, the overall volume is expected to be lower with the apartment
development when compared to a fully occupied office building. Few drivers are expected to
use the cut through routes during non-peak times.

Total Traffic
Total traffic volumes were determined by summing the Year 2014 base traffic volumes (Exhibit
7) and the development trip assignment (Exhibit 9). The 2014 total traffic volumes are shown in
Exhibit 10.

Year 2014 Total Traffic Analysis
Table 4 provides weekday morning and weekday evening peak hour operating conditions for the
Year 2014 total traffic at the study intersections. The Year 2014 total traffic analysis is based on
the proposed intersection geometrics and traffic control.

As shown in Table 4, the westbound right-turn movement at the WIS 100 intersection with W.
Garfield Avenue is expected to continue to operate at LOS F. The volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c)
is 0.49, indicating there is sufficient capacity to accommodate the movement. Minimal delays
are expected outside of the peak hours. All other movements are expected to operate acceptably
at LOS C or better under the total traffic conditions.

Year 2014 total traffic 95th percentile queues are shown in Exhibit 11.

Analysis output reports are provided in Appendix B.

Neighborhood Traffic Concerns
The City expressed concerns about the potential for increased cut-through traffic in the
neighborhood to the east associated with the proposed apartment development. The existing
counts show that these cut-through movements are being made under current conditions. Traffic
exiting the redevelopment site during the evening peak hour has the highest potential to make the
cut-through movements due to fewer direct routes and congestion on WIS 100. The proposed
apartments will have less exiting traffic compared to the existing office building during the
weekday evening peak, which is when there is a higher potential for cut-through traffic. Based
on the traffic pattern changes, cut-through traffic is not expected to increase with the apartment
development despite the overall higher traffic volumes.

CONCLUSIONS
No roadway improvements are recommended in conjunction with the proposed apartment
development. The W. Garfield Avenue intersection with the backage road is expected to
continue to operate similar to existing conditions under uncontrolled conditions. This is
consistent with other backage roads serving residential and commercial properties within the city
that also operate under uncontrolled conditions.

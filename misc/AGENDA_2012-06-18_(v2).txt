Trustee Seiden made a motion to adopt the Ordinances. Trustee Oppenheim seconded the
motion.

Trustee Struthers suggested asking the Safety Commission to look at the Lake Cook Road
entrance and make it a right-in, right-out during certain hours. Trustee Benton noted after the
Lake Cook Road construction, it will be a moot point.

Hal Francke with DLA Piper stated he understands the Village's concern. He stated that he only
represents McDonalds and cannot speak for the other businesses. Trustee Jester believes signage
would need to be discussed. Mr. Street suggested referring this to staff, because they need to
determine how to sign the left-in and noted staff will come back to the Board with a report.

ordinances.

Referred To: _________________________________________________________________________

Summary of Background and Reason for Request

Gateway Fairview, owners of Deerbrook Mall, have requested approval of a Letter of Intent with the
Village outlining the proposed sequencing and requested financial incentives for a $26 million
redevelopment of Deerbrook Mall. They propose relocating TJ Maxx and Starbuck's in the first phase.
The second phase would be to remove the indoor mall along with the current TJ Maxx, former movie
theater and current Best Buy space, followed by relocating Jewel to a new store where Best Buy is, adding
30,000 square feet of new retail space, reconfiguring the current Jewel into smaller retail spaces and adding
over 100 parking spaces.

They are also requesting the Village to consider establishing a Business District for the affected properties
so that an additional percent of sales tax could be applied and used to pay project expenses along with the
proceeds of a sales tax sharing agreement for sales above the level established in the base year. In
conjunction with the land use review by the Plan Commission and Village Board, it is proposed to consider
the business district formation and if found to be appropriate, enter into a detailed development agreement
specifying terms and conditions for the redevelopment project. The Village has previously retained a
professional financial advisor (Kane McKenna) to assist the Village in its evaluations of the matter.

Representatives of Gateway Fairview are scheduled to attend the June 18, 2012 Village Board meeting to
review their request and respond to questions from the Mayor and Board of Trustees.

                              LETTER OF INTENT FOR
                  DEERBROOK MALL ECONOMIC INCENTIVE AGREEMENT

        This Letter of Intent ("LOI") is entered into by and between the Village of Deerfield

("Village") and Gateway Fairview, Inc. ("Property Owner") as of this 18th day of June, 2012 (the

"Effective Date") to outline and memorialize basic terms and conditions pursuant to which the

Village would designate the Property (as described herein) as a business district pursuant to the

Business District Development and Redevelopment Law (the "Act") (65 ILCS 5/11-74.3-1, et

seq.), impose an additional sales tax of up to one percent (1%) on sales within the business

district pursuant to the Act, and agree to a further rebate of a portion of the net incremental sales

tax revenues received by the Village, as an incentive for and to facilitate the Property Owner

undertaking the further redevelopment and demalling of Deerbrook Mall, all as described herein.

The proposed terms and conditions are as follows:

        1.         The Property: The property that will be studied and considered for designation

as a business district pursuant to the Act is the property commonly known as the Deerbrook Mall

shopping center, as more fully described in Village of Deerfield Ordinance O-01-39, which shall

include abutting highways, but exclude the property and improvements known as the Great

Indoors/Wonder property, (the "Property").

        2.         The Redevelopment Project:          Property Owner proposes to redevelop the

Property in two phases ("Phase I" and "Phase II") over a period of not more than six (6) years

with the redevelopment and demalling projects described on Exhibit B to this LOI (the

"Redevelopment Projects").

        3.         Business District and Sales Tax Incentive Request:         Property Owner has

represented that a large amount of the indoor mall space of the Property is now functionally and

financially obsolete and that the Redevelopment Projects which are estimated to cost

EAST\48392294.2                                  -1-
approximately $6 million for Phase I and $20 million for Phase II are necessary to prevent

further deterioration and eventual obsolescence of the Property and to make the Property a viable

retail shopping center. Property Owner requests phased municipal support from the Village to

reimburse Redevelopment Project costs as described herein to make Property Owner's proposed

redevelopment of the Property viable.

        4.        Village Analysis of Business District and Economic Incentive Request:

Property Owner shall promptly provide Village and Village's consultants with financial

information including, but not limited to, estimated Redevelopment Project costs, pro formas,

prevailing rents and expenses for the Property and such other information as is reasonably

required by the Village to analyze the feasibility of Property Owner undertaking the

Redevelopment Projects, with and without the requested Business District Sales Tax incentive

described in Paragraphs 6-9 of this LOI and the further Economic Incentive described in

Paragraph 11 of this LOI.

        5.        Village's Due Diligence: Village agrees to review, evaluate and perform all

studies, economic or otherwise, as it may require to determine whether the Business District

Sales Tax incentive and the further Economic Incentive described are reasonably required for

implementation of the Redevelopment Projects and would be in the best interests of the Village

of Deerfield. Property Owner agrees to reimburse the Village up to Fifteen Thousand Dollars

($15,000.00) for the cost of the financial analysis required by the Village (the "Due Diligence

Expenses"). Property Owner agrees to reimburse the Village for such cost within fifteen (15)

days after receipt of an invoice reasonably itemizing the fees and costs incurred by the Village

for such financial analysis.




EAST\48392294.2                                -2-
        6.        Business District Sales Tax Incentive: Property Owner has requested that the

Village impose an additional retailer's occupation tax and a service occupation tax on the

business of selling tangible personal property at retail, other than an item of tangible personal

property titled or registered with an agency of this state's government, at the rate of one percent

(1%) within the Property designated as a business district pursuant to Section 11-74.3-3(10) of

the Act ("Business District Sales Tax") to pay for business district redevelopment costs. The

parties acknowledge that the Business District Sales Tax may not be imposed unless the Village

determines that the Property qualifies for designation as a blighted area under the Act.

        7.        Blighted Area Determination: The Village shall consider reports and studies

provided by Property Owner's planning and economic development consultant in determining

whether the Property constitutes a "blighted area" within the meaning of the Act. The Village

may also, as part of the Due Diligence Expenses, engage a qualified urban planning or economic

development consultant to study the Property and to review the reports and studies provided by

Property Owner's planning and economic development consultant to determine whether the area

constitutes a "blighted area" within the meaning of the Act (the "Blight Study"). The cost of the

Blight Study shall be reimbursed to the Village as Due Diligence Expenses; provided, however,

to the extent that costs of the Blight Study result in Due Diligence Expenses to exceed Fifteen

Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00), such excess costs shall only be reimbursed to the Village from

the Business District Fund, if any, established by the Village.

        8.        Business District Designation and Approval of Business District Plan and

Sales Tax: Provided that the Village determines that the Property qualifies for designation as a

blighted area under the Act, and that it is in the public interest of the Village of Deerfield to

designate the Property as a business district under the Act and to impose a Business District


EAST\48392294.2                                 -3-
Sales Tax in the business district to pay for Phase I Redevelopment Project costs, the Village

agrees to adopt ordinances approving and designating the Property as a business district under

the Act, determining that the business district is a blighted area under the Act, approving a

business district plan for the Property, imposing a Business District Sales Tax within the

designated business district for a maximum of twenty-three (23) years to pay for business district

redevelopment project costs associated with the Phase I Redevelopment Projects as set forth in

the approved business district plan, and to issue to Property Owner a non-recourse, interest

bearing taxable note in the amount of $6 million, secured only by a first lien on Business District

Sales Taxes generated in the business district, to pay for business district redevelopment project

costs associated with said Phase I Redevelopment Projects.

        9.        Timing of Business District Designation and Approval of Business District

Plan and Sales Tax: Provided that the Village determines that the Property is a blighted area

that may be designated as a business district under the Act, and that it is in the public interest of

the Village of Deerfield to impose a Business District Sales Tax in the business district to pay for

Phase I Redevelopment Project costs, the parties intend that an ordinance designating a business

district, approving a business district plan and imposing a Business District Sales Tax within the

Property on the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, other than an item of

tangible personal property titled or registered with an agency of this state's government, shall be

approved before October 1, 2012. It is the intent of the parties that such Business District Sales

Tax should be imposed effective January 1, 2013.

        10.       Business District Tax Allocation Fund.      Business District Sales Tax receipts

shall be held by the Village in the Deerbrook Mall Business District Tax Allocation Fund (the

"Business District Fund").


EAST\48392294.2                                 -4-
        11.       Further Economic Incentive: Village and Property Owner further agree to enter

into an agreement ("Sales Tax Sharing Agreement") for the Village to share up to Seventy-Five

percent (75%) percent of incremental sales tax revenues received by the Village from taxes

levied under the Service Occupation Tax Act (35 ILCS 115), the Retailers Occupation Tax Act

(35 ILCS 120) and the Home Rule Municipal Retailers' Occupation Tax Act (65 ILCS 5/8-11-1)

(collectively, "Sales Taxes") from retail sales generated by the Property that are in excess of the

total Sales Taxes revenue amount ("Base Sales Tax Amount") received by the Village from

businesses located in the Property for the twelve (12) month period commencing May 1, 2011

and ending April 30, 2012 (the "Base Sales Tax Year"), but excluding from the Base Sales Tax

Amount the Sales Tax revenues, if any, attributable to the tenants identified on the letter from

Mid-America Asset Management, Inc. dated May 30, 2012 to Village Manager Kent Street

which is attached hereto as Exhibit C for the Base Sales Tax Year. The Sales Tax Sharing

Agreement shall have a term of not more than 30 years, and shall provide that, after receiving the

Base Sales Tax Amount in each Sales Tax Year, the Village shall deposit the agreed percentage

of Incremental Sales Taxes generated by the Property for that Sales Tax Year in a restricted

Village account designated in the Sales Tax Sharing Agreement for reimbursement of Property

Owner's Phase II Redevelopment Project costs. Once the Property Owner has received the

present value of $10,000,000 of Incremental Sales Tax, which shall be determined in the Sales

Tax Sharing Agreement, then the Property Owner's right to receive further Incremental Sales

Tax shall terminate. "Sales Tax Year" shall mean the initial twelve (12) month period beginning

at 12:00 a.m. on the first day of the month (the "Commencement Date") immediately following

TO: Mayor and Board of Trustees

FROM: Plan Commission

DATE: May 24, 2012

RE: Request for Approval of a Special Use to permit the establishment of photography
studio (CRM Properties and Lifetouch Portrait Studios, Inc.).

We transmit for your consideration a recommendation adopted by the Plan Commission
of the Village of Deerfield on the request of the petitioners for approval of a Special Use
to permit the establishment of a photography studio. The Plan Commission held a
public hearing on May 24, 2012. At that public hearing, the petitioners presented
testimony and documentary evidence in support of the request. A copy of the public
hearing and workshop minutes are attached.

In support of its request, the Plan Commission makes the following findings of fact and
conclusions:

                                   FINDINGS OF FACT

Subject Property

The subject property consists of the Deerfield Square Development which is bounded
by Deerfield Road to the north, Waukegan Road to the east, Osterman Avenue to the
south and the railroad tracks to the west; specifically 720 Waukegan Road, Unit M. The
property is zoned C-1 Village Center District and was approved as a commercial PUD.
Ten buildings make up the Deerfield Square development. Vehicular access to the
subject property is at three signalized intersections (two on Deerfield Road and one on
Waukegan Road) and at the Robert York Avenue and Osterman Avenue intersection,
and at secondary access points along Osterman Avenue. The setbacks, access points,
lot coverage, open space, site landscaping, parking lot lighting, sign criteria, and storm
water management for this Planned Unit Development were previously approved.

Proposed Plan

The petitioners are proposing to establish a business known as Lifetouch Portrait Studio
on the first floor of the 720 Waukegan Road building, unit M (former Bath & Body Works
space, east of Barnes & Noble bookstore). The proposed tenant space is highlighted
on the petitioner's site plan for Deerfield Square (Exhibit A in the petitioner's materials)
and a floor plan of the tenant space is provided in Exhibit B in the petitioner's materials.
The proposed Lifetouch Portrait Studio will specialize in high-end portraiture of children,
families, weddings, high school seniors and other special events. The proposed space
will be 2,500 square feet in area. Approximately 6 employees and 12 customers will be
on the site at the peak times. The business is appointment based and will be open
Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The peak times are weekday evenings and weekends.

Village staff has asked the petitioners for a detailed written description of the proposed
use at this location, and the petitioners have provided this written description in their
materials. Staff has looked at the petitioner's materials and believes their proposal is
clearly written, detailed, and thorough. In order to avoid repetition by including a
detailed description of the proposed facility operations in the staff memo, for more
detailed information on the proposed plans for photography studio, please see the
petitioner's written materials.

Zoning Conformance

The petitioners are seeking approval of a Class A Special Use. A Class A Special Use
is a Special Use on the ground floor level in the C-1 Village Center District. When the
Village created the first floor retail ordinance many years ago, the uses in the C-1
Village Center zoning district were divided up into: 1) Permitted Uses on the first floor
which are retail uses; 2) Class A Special Uses which are are a Special Use on the first
floor of the C-1 Village Center District, but are allowed above the first floor as a
Permitted Use, and; 3) Class B Special Uses which are Special Uses in all locations in
the C-1 Village Center District, even if located above the first floor. The proposed use is
a Special Use on the ground floor in the C-1 Village Center District pursuant to Article
5.01-C,1,n. The use is located on the ground floor of the shopping center and requires
a Special Use.

Parking

Parking for the Deerfield Square Planned Unit Development was approved at 5 spaces
per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area for retail uses (i.e., 1 parking space per 200
s.f.), and 4 spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area for office uses (i.e., 1
parking space per 250 s.f.) with a 15 percent reduction for storage areas in the building
(Ordinance 0-98-34 granted a variation for parking in the development). A total of 1,000
spaces (including 100 underground spaces) are provided for Deerfield Square.

When Deerfield Square was approved, the various uses in the development were to
share the parking within the development. The amount of parking for the different mix
of uses in the development will vary throughout the day. In other words, the different
uses in this development have varying peak parking times. As part of the approval
process of a Special Use for the proposed use, the petitioners must demonstrate that
adequate parking will be provided.

The Zoning Ordinance does not have a specific parking requirement for a photography
studio. When the retail use requirement of 1 parking space for each 200 square feet is
used for parking, then 13 parking spaces are required (2,500/200 = 12.5 = 13). The
Parking Analysis section on page 2 of the petitioner's booklet indicates a maximum of



                                             2
18 people (6 staff and 12 clients) at one time. The petitioners anticipate that due to the
nature of their business, clients will travel to the photography studio together with more
than one person per vehicle.

The petitioner's booklets include the July 2011 KLOA parking study (Exhibit C in the
petitioner's materials) that was conducted for the Lindamood-Bell tutoring center last
year. The petitioners believe the 2011 parking study is representative of current
conditions and uses in the shopping center and they believe the study shows there is
sufficient parking available at the peak times for the proposed photography studio. The
2011 report shows excess capacity of 170 parking spaces was observed during the
shopping center's peak time of a Friday afternoon and after accounting for Lindamood-
Bell's peak parking load of 40 spaces there is an excess capacity of 130 spaces.

The photography studio's peak parking load is estimated at 18 vehicles (6 employees
and 12 customers). The petitioners have indicated they anticipate the photography
studio clients will usually come to the property with more than one occupant per vehicle.
The petitioners have indicated the proposed photography studio's peak times are
evenings and weekends when the office tenants at the shopping center are not busy.

The parking areas that are most adjacent to the proposed photography studio are areas
6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 as shown on the parking study map. According to the petitioner's
parking study, lot 6 (the main lot) had 70 available spaces at the peak parking demand
time (12:00 p.m. on a Friday afternoon), and lots 8, 9, 10, and 11 had available parking
spaces at the peak parking demand time. The petitioners have indicated that their
busiest times will be evenings and weekends, when the office space is mostly
unoccupied.

The owners of Deerfield Square have implemented a parking plan that requires all
Deerfield Square employees to park in designated areas to the west of Biaggi's
Restaurant (former Stoney River Restaurant) and the middle portion of the main parking
lot of the shopping center. The office building employees currently park in the
underground garage to allow as much surface parking for customers as possible.

Wall Signage

Deerfield Square has an approved set of sign criteria that the petitioners are required to
follow. The petitioners have indicated the proposed photography studio will follow the
sign criteria for Deerfield Square. The Appearance Review Commission (ARC) will
have to approve the exterior wall signs.

                                     CONCLUSIONS

Compatible with Existing Development

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed photography studio will be compatible
with existing development and should not impede the orderly development and
improvement of surrounding properties. The Plan Commission believes that the use
will be an amenity to the shopping center and will bring people into the Village Center.
They believe the photography studio is a good and appropriate use of the property and
will be compatible with the existing development in the area. The Plan Commission
believes the photography studio will not have an adverse impact on surrounding
properties and is a welcome addition to the Village Center. The Plan Commission does
not believe traffic and parking will be adversely impacted by the proposed use.

Lot of Sufficient Size

The Plan Commission believes the subject property is of sufficient size for the proposed
use. The Plan Commission believes the property is suitable for the proposed use and
will not create a negative impact on surrounding properties.

Traffic

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed use should not create traffic problems
on the subject property and should not have an adverse impact on surrounding
properties. They believe the traffic generated by the proposed use will not have an
adverse impact on traffic in the area. The proposed use should not significantly
increase traffic volumes in the area. No changes to the parking lot layout will be made
for the proposed photography studio.

Parking and Access

The Plan Commission believes that parking will be adequate for the proposed use and
they believe the business should not create a parking problem in the area. The
petitioners have submitted a recent parking study that demonstrates there is adequate
parking available at Deerfield Square at the peak time.

The access points to the existing parking lots at Deerfield Square will not be changed
for the proposed photograph studio.

Effect on Neighborhood

The Plan Commission believes the proposed use should not be significantly or
materially detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the public or injurious to the
other property or improvements in the neighborhood nor should it diminish or impair
property values in the surrounding area. The Plan Commission believes the proposed



                                             4
use will not have an adverse impact on surrounding properties. The Plan Commission
believes that the proposed photography studio will be a good use for this vacant space
and will be an asset to the shopping center and the Village.

Adequate Facilities

Adequate facilities (utilities, access roads) will be provided on the subject property.

Adequate Buffering

The Plan Commission believes that the existing buffering on the subject property is
adequate.

Not Injurious to the Character of the C-1 Village Center District as a Retail Center

The Plan Commission believes the proposed photography studio should not be injurious
to the character of the C-1 Village Center District as retail center. There will be some
retail sales generated by the proposed use. The Plan Commission believes the use fits
well in this location.

                                  RECOMMENDATION

Accordingly, it is the recommendation of the Plan Commission that Lifetouch Portrait
Studio's request for a Class A Special Use to permit the establishment a photography
studio at 720 Waukegan Road, Unit M, in the Deerfield Square development be
approved.

                               VILLAGE OF DEERFIELD

The Plan Commission of the Village of Deerfield held a Public Hearing at 7:30 P.M. on
May 24, 2012 at the Village Hall, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.

Chairman Shapiro called the hearing to order.

Present were:        Dan Shapiro, Chairman
                     Larry Berg
                     Alan Bromberg
                     Jim Moyer
                     Robert Nadler
                     Stuart Shayman

Absent:              Elaine Jacoby

Also present:        Jeff Ryckaert, Principal Planner
                     Kathleen LéVeque, Associate Planner

Change to the Agenda

Chairman Shapiro moved the first agenda item pertaining to the continued public
hearing for Briarwood Country Club to be second on the agenda. Chairman Shapiro
anticipates the public hearing for the portrait studio to be a more straightforward process
while the continued public hearing for Briarwood is more involved.

Public Comment on a Non-Agenda Item

Chairman Shapiro asked if anyone in the audience had a comment on a non-agenda
item. There were no comments.

Public hearing on the request for a Special Use for Lifetouch Portrait Studio in Deerfield
Square, 720 Waukegan Road, Unit M

Chris Siavelis, CRM Properties, was joined by Kurt Scheckman and Deanne Money
both of Lifetouch. Mr. Siavelis is seeking a favorable recommendation to open a 2,500
square foot photography studio in the shops at Deerfield Square. Lifetouch would be
located in Unit M (former Bath & Body Works space). Lifetouch currently operates as
Flash Portraits in Northbrook Court and would like upgrade this concept and rename the
studio Cilento Photography. The studio will operate Monday through Friday from
10:00am-7:00pm, Saturdays from 9:00am-5:00pm; and Sundays from 10:00am-5:00pm.
Lifetouch is an appointment based operation and generates sale tax revenue.

The estimated maximum peak time will have 6 employees and 12 patrons. A parking
analysis was based on the peak operation of 18 vehicles assuming the 6 employees
Public Hearing: Lifetouch Photo Studio

and 12 patrons all drive a vehicle. Based on 18 vehicles, the parking allotment would
pass the Village retail parking ordinance by 5 spaces. A parking study conducted in
June 2011 illustrated that there was excess capacity of 170 parking spaces at the peak
time for the shopping center. Mr. Siavelis stated that with the subject use there is an
excess capacity of 130 spaces. Mr. Siavelis stated that there is more than ample
parking for the proposed use. CRM Properties believes the 2011 study is still accurate
since there have been no use changes since the study was conducted.

CRM Properties believes that this high-end photography studio will be a positive
addition to Deerfield Square and the Village Center.

Commissioner Berg wanted to know the hours of operation. Mr. Siavelis reiterated that
the studio will operate Monday through Friday from 10:00am-7:00pm; Saturday from
9:00am-5:00pm; and Sunday from 10:00am-5:00pm.

Commissioner Bromberg asked if the Northbrook Court location would be closed. Mr.
Siavelis confirmed that the Northbrook Court location will be closed.

Chairman Shapiro then opened up the hearing for public comment.

Sue Bruns, 351 Kelburn Road, wanted to know how many parking spaces would be
occupied for this use. Mr. Siavelis stated 18 spaces. Mr. Siavelis commented that the
parking study was done on a Friday during lunch hour which is Deerfield Square's peak
parking time. Ms. Brunz commented that Biaggi's restaurant opened in November 2011
and they occupy a lot of parking spaces. Ms. Brunz took pictures of the parking
situation before Biaggi's opened and doesn't feel that there is enough parking.
However, Ms. Brunz did state that the proposed use probably won't need a lot of
parking spaces.

A motion made and seconded to close the public hearing.

Respectfully submitted,
Daniel Nakahara

 The Shops at Deerfield Square



Lifetouch Portrait Studios, Inc.
   d/b/a Cilento Photography



      Village of Deerfield
 Plan Commission Presentation
         May 24,2012
Introduction

The Shops at Deerfield Square is a 255,000 square foot high-end retail/office development
located in the C-1 Village Center District and completed in 2000. Since the Center's opening,
we've maintained a stable and high occupancy ratio through prudent tenant selection, aggressive
marketing and "hands-on" management.

Despite these challenging times, the Center enjoys above-market occupancy rates and continues
to maintain attractive tenancies.


Special Use Request

The petitioner is seeking the Plan Commission's favorable recommendation for a Class A Special
Use in connection with an appointment-based photography studio known as Lifetouch Portrait
Studios, Inc. d/b/a Cilento Photography consisting of approximately 2,500 rentable square feet to
be located at 720 Waukegan Road, Unit M, in The Shops at Deerfield Square (former Bath and
Body Works). Please see enclosed site plan (Exhibit A) and enclosed proposed floor plan
(Exhibit B).

Lifetouch is relocating from its current Northbrook Court location where it operates under the
trade name Flash Portraits.


Tenant's Operation

Lifetouch is upgrading its Flash Portraits concept into Cilento Photography, a high-end
photography studio specializing in portraiture of children, family, weddings, high school seniors
and other special events. Cilento draws upon 50 years of photographic experience from master
photographer Tony Cilento, one of the most well respected family and celebrity photographers in
the industry. As a member of the most elite photographic organization in the world, Camera
Craftsmen of America, Tony was one of the official photographers for the United States visit of
Pope Jolm Paul II, and was the first ever recipient of the United Nations International
Photographic Council A ward.

Every Cilento photographer undergoes extensive training in order to deliver images worthy of
the Cilento name. The training and mentorship that each team member receives allows the
studio to deliver the first class service and one of a kind timeless photography that will last for
generations.

Cilento offers award-winning photographs, unparalleled service and community partne1ing.
Please see attached for photos of the store's interior and samples of Cilento's services.

Cilento's hours of operation are Monday through Friday 10:00a.m.-7:00p.m., Saturday 9:00a.m.-
5:00p.m. and Sunday 10:00a.m.-5:00p.m. Approximately six (6) individuals will make up
Cilento's core team at the subject location. The studio is appointment-based and its peale times
are evenings and weekends. Please see Parking Analysis section for more information on
occupant loads.
Parking Analysis

The petitioner engaged KLOA to conduct a parking study at Deerfield Square in June, 2011,
please see enclosed study. Based on the fact that the study factors in recent major use changes at
Deerfield Square and indicates more than ample parking to accmmnodate the subject tenant, both
staff and petitioner feel the attached study is sufficient for the subject request. Moreover, the
study indicates excess capacity of 170 parking spaces during the Center's peak times of a Friday
afternoon. Adding for the then subject tenant's (Lindamood Bell) worst case parking load of 40
spaces results in excess capacity of 130 spaces. Cilento, at its peale times, expects up to 18
individuals (6 staff members and 12 customers) at the subject location. Applying the Village's
retail parking code of five spaces per I ,000 square feet of space, Cilento exceeds this load by a
mere six spaces. However, with the aforementioned 130 excess spaces, the Center can easily
accommodate the subject request.

It's also important to note that Cilento is an appointment-based concept and will have, more
often than not, more than one occupant in each visiting vehicle. In addition, Cilento's peak times
are evening and weekends, at which times few, if any, office tenants are at the Center.

Based on the foregoing, the petitioner feels that ample parking exists at the Center to
accommodate the subject request


Special Use Criteria

I)   Compatible with Existing Development. The subject use is clearly compatible with the
     Development and should benefit the Village and existing retailers by generating sales tax
     revenue and increasing overall numbers of patrons visiting the Center.

2)   Lot of Sufficient Size. The subject propetiy is a PUD and lot size is sufficient.

The petitioner is of the opinion that the subject use is appropriate for the Center and the space.
We do not believe that the subject use will be injurious in any way to the character of the C-1
Village Center. We respectfully ask for the Plan Commission's favorable recommendation.

SUBJECT:                       Parking Demand for the Proposed Lindamood-Bell Facility
                               at Deerfield Square
                               Deerfield, Illinois


        At your request, Kenig, Lindgren, O'Hara, Aboona, Inc. (KLOA, Inc.) evaluated the

proposed addition of a Lindamood-Bell facility at the Deerfield Square Shops and its impact on

the cmTent parking demand. The facility will occupy 3,334 square feet of currently vacant space

on the second floor of the office/retail building.

        In order to assess the impact of this use on cuuent parking conditions, KLOA, Inc.

conducted the following studies as well as reviewing past studies at the center.

I.      Conducted parking occupancy counts of all the individual parking lots serving

        Deerfield Square.    The survey did include the underground parking area serving the

        office building.

        These surveys were conducted hourly between II :00 A.M. and 2:00 P.M. on a

        Friday (June 17, 2011).

2.      Reviewed previous studies indicating analyses of future parking needs and parking

        occupancies at the center.

        The following results were obtained from these observations and counts. Table 1 and the

attached figure indicate the number of cars parked throughout Deerfield Square at various times

on the surveyed Friday.

 Note:   At I 0:49 A.M. parking occupancy in the 740 Waukegan Road office building underground garage was 61
         vehicles. The garage capacity is 92 spaces.

         As indicated, parking peaked at 12:00 P.M. Friday. The peak parking occupancy was

709 occupied spaces or approximately 81 percent of the available supply not including the

underground office parking facility. Based on previous occupancy studies, the figures clearly

indicate that evenings and Saturdays are not as high as midday Friday. This is primarily due to

the large amount of office space at Deerfield Square which peaks middays on Monday through

Friday and decreases substantially in the evenings and on Satmday allowing other retail and

restaurant use to share this excess space. Previous counts conducted in January 2008 indicated a

peak demand of 702 parked cars or 78 percent occupancy. The last survey in 2010 indicated a

peak occupancy of 615 or 70 percent.

         Of importance is the usage of the primary parking areas immediately northeast and

behind the proposed facility. Lot 6 has 70 available spaces and Lots 11, 12 and 13 currently

have 10 spaces. These four lots alone have 80 vacant spaces at the 12:00 P.M. peak time period.

In addition, Lindamood-Bell will have access to the underground garage which had 31 available

spaces at 10:45 A.M.

Lindamood-Bell's Parking Demand

         The Deerfield zoning code has no parking requirements for this patiicular use.

The parking requirement for the currently vacant space is 14 spaces and therefore should be

credited towards the new Lindamood-Bell facility.

         Lindamood-Bell will occupy 3,334 square feet of space. As an aside, we evaluated a

worst case condition. The peak demand will be 15 staff, 15 clients, 5 administrators and 5

parents. If all drive one per car, the peak demand would he 40 spaces less 14 currently provided.

Staff is allowed to park in the garage. Therefore, the remaining demand for II spaces can be

accommodated in the available vacant spaces on site.

         The projected additional demands can readily be accommodated by the existing Deerfield

Square parking areas based on the number of available spaces during the center's peak hours of

operation.

Conclusion

          The current studies have clearly indicated that there is more than adequate parking space

available at Deerfield Square to accommodate the future demands of the Lindamood-Bell

facility. These figures were based on actual on-site counts and observations. Previous studies

utilized shared parking analyses for the mixed-use development to justify the I ,000 parking

spaces which were provided. This updated study verities the availability of parking to support

the Lindamood-Bell facility.

RE: Request for Approval of a Special Use to permit the establishment of photography
studio (CRM Properties and Lifetouch Portrait Studios, Inc.).

We transmit for your consideration a recommendation adopted by the Village Center
Development Commission on a request for approval of a Special Use for a photography
studio in Deerfield Square. The Village Center Development Commission held a
workshop meeting on June 6, 2012. A copy of the workshop minutes is attached.

In order to avoid repetition, please refer to the Plan Commission's report for information
regarding the proposed photography studio in Deerfield Square.

                                    CONCLUSIONS

The VCDC believes the proposed photography studio business is appropriate for this
location. They believe the proposed use will not have an adverse impact on the
surrounding properties. The VCDC believes the 2011 parking analysis and the current
parking situation demonstrate that adequate parking is available in the shopping center
for the proposed photography studio. The VCDC believes the parking will work and the
proposed use will not have a negative impact on the area. The VCDC believes the
proposed use will work well with the other uses on the property. The VCDC is pleased
that some sales tax revenue will be generated by the proposed photography studio.

                                  RECOMMENDATION

Accordingly, it is the recommendation of the Village Center Development Commission
that Lifetouch Portrait Studio's request for a Special Use to permit the establishment of
a photography studio at 720 Waukegan Road, Unit M in Deerfield Square be approved.

Business:

1. Lifetouch Portrait Studio request for a Special Use at 720 Waukegan Road, Unit M
(former Bath & Body Works space)

Chris Siavelis from CRM Properties Management stated he is looking for a favorable
recommendation for a Special Use for Lifetouch Photography Studio to occupy the
former Bath & Body Works space at 720 Waukegan Road, Unit M. They currently

operate as Flash Photography in Northbrook Court, but will operate under Cilento
Photography if approved in Deerfield Square.

Mr. Siavelis stated that a 2011 parking study indicated there are 170 parking spaces
available at the peak time in the shopping center. He does not believe parking would be
an issue for this use. Mr. Siavelis believes this will be a great addition to the Village.

Ms. Zobus asked if the business would be selling photo frames and other items that
generate sales tax. Mr. Siavelis explained the photo studio would be a sales tax
generating business. Ms. Shaw noted Lifetouch Portrait Studios takes school
photographs. Mr. Siavelis said that is correct and explained that Cilento Photography
would be the upscale retail division of the company, offering a high-end, full service
photography studio. He noted they would be doing a top notch build out of the tenant
space. Ms. Shaw asked if Cilento would do class photographs as well. Mr. Siavelis
explained this would be a family portrait studio as well as general photography services.
Mr. Kaufmann questioned whether this would be a seasonal business. Mr. Siavelis
noted the business will peak for holidays, springtime for graduation, etc. There will be
some seasonality with this use. Dr. Emerzian and Ms. Reed are in favor of this use.

Ch. Garfield asked if this would be the first Cilento Photography Studio in the country.
Mr. Siavelis explained this would be the first in the Chicago area. Ch. Garfield asked
why they are leaving Northbrook Court. Mr. Siavelis explained that regional malls are
having difficulties all over. Ch. Garfield asked how the sales tax would be generated.
Mr. Siavelis explained sales tax will be generated through the photo shoot packages as
well as the sales of frames and other items.

Dr. Emerzian made a motion to approve the request for a Special Use for Lifetouch
Portrait Studios in Deerfield Square. Ms. Zobus seconded the motion. The motion
passed by the following vote:

AYES: Emerzian, Kaufmann, Reed, Shaw, Zobus, Garfield (6)
NAYS: None (0)

The Commissioners agreed to approve the documents for this item via email so that it
may get to the Board of Trustees on June 18, 2012.

                                   RECOMMENDATION

TO: Mayor and Board of Trustees

FROM: Plan Commission

DATE: May 24, 2012

RE: Request for an amendment to a Special Use for Briarwood Country Club to permit
changes to the clubhouse area and to install paddle tennis facilities.

We transmit for your consideration a recommendation adopted by the Plan Commission of
the Village of Deerfield on the request of the petitioners for an amendment to a Special
Use for Briarwood Country Club to permit changes to the clubhouse area and to install
paddle tennis facilities. The Plan Commission held a public hearing on April 26 that was
continued to May 24, 2012. At that public hearing, the petitioners presented testimony and
documentary evidence in support of the request. A copy of the public hearing and
workshop minutes are attached.

In support of its request, the Plan Commission makes the following findings of fact and
conclusions:

                                   FINDINGS OF FACT

Subject Property

The subject property consists of the Briarwood County Club which is located at 355
Deerfield Road. The Briarwood County Club property lies within three single family zoning
districts (R-1, R-2, and R-3). A country club is a Special Use in the single family residential
districts. Over the years, the country club has amended their Special Use with the most
recent amendment in 2006 for the golf ball netting structure at the northeast corner of the
property. The current membership at Briarwood Country Club is 257 families.

Surrounding Land Use and Zoning

North (across Deerfield Road): R-3 Single Family Residential District ­ residences
South: R-3 Single Family Residential District ­ residences
East: R-1, R-2, and R-3 Single Family Residential District ­ residences
West (across Waukegan Road): P-1 Public Lands District, R-5 General Residence
 District and C-2 Outlying Commercial District ­ Fire Station, Coromandel, Whitehall,
 and Carson's Ribs Restaurant.
Proposed Plan

The petitioners are proposing to amend their Special Use in order to provide upgrades to
the property. The petitioners have submitted a summary of their proposal dated April 9,
2012 in their submittals.

Changes to the clubhouse area include:

      Changes to clubhouse entry and auto court entry to the north of the clubhouse
      building. These six changes to the clubhouse area are listed out as item # 1 on the
      summary sheet (see sheet dated April 9, 2012, 1.1 through 1.6, in the petitioner's
      materials for these upgrades in order to avoid repetition in this memo).

      Enlarging the outside dining area and casual seating areas on the south side of the
      clubhouse by 3,707 square feet.

      A 450 square foot addition to the clubhouse to expand locker rooms and men's
      lounge area. The maximum height of this area will be 21'4" from grade.

Changes to the Waukegan Road area of the country club include:

      The addition of paddle tennis for the country club. Paddle tennis is a game similar
      to tennis that can be played year-round, including in the winter on a heated court.
      There will be 4 paddle courts. The first phase will be the paddle hut and the 2
      western courts and the second phase will be the 2 eastern courts. The western
      paddle courts will be located 44.8' from the west property line (the paddle courts
      have been moved further from the property than the petitioners proposed at their
      March 22, 2012 Plan Commission prefiling conference). The height of the screens
      (fencing) around the courts will be 17' in height from grade. The paddle courts will
      be lit (24 foot high poles with 400 watt metal halide floodlights, with 8 light poles per
      court.) A new 1,000 square foot paddle warming hut and deck are proposed. The
      paddle hut will be 20'6" in height from grade. The paddle hut will be located 111.8'
      from the west property line. The petitioners have indicated the existing vegetation
      along Waukegan Road will remain.

      The petitioners have provided a cross section sight line drawing in their materials to
      show what the view of the new paddle facility would be from both the first floor and
      the second floor of the closest Coromandel home. Sheet A-200 in the petitioner's
      materials shows the elevation drawings and details the proposed exterior building
      materials for the warming hut.

      An expanded parking lot to the north of the proposed paddle courts and warming
      hut with 28 parking spaces.



                                              2
       A widened curb cut on Waukegan Road to 24 feet wide (the curb cut will remain in
       the same location, but will be widened). Waukegan Road is under the jurisdiction of
       IDOT. The existing curb cut serves the maintenance buildings and will also serve
       the paddle tennis courts. A new gate to match the existing fence will be installed
       across the driveway. The existing fence is a chain link metal nylon coated black
       fence with vertical screening. The petitioner's plans indicate they will replace the
       existing 6' chain link fence along Waukegan Road and push it back to meet IDOT's
       sight line standards.

       The petitioners have provided information on the existing light levels and the
       existing noise levels in the area. Their materials indicate the existing light levels are
       1.4 foot-candles at the entrance to the paddle facility driveway and at the
       Coromandel berm. The proposed new paddle court lights will produce 30 foot-
       candles at on the courts and will be zero at the lot line. The petitioners took sound
       levels measurements at Waukegan Road and found the noise level ranged from 53
       decibels (dB) to 85 dB. The petitioner's noise level measurements taken on the
       west side of the Coromandel berm ranged from 55 dB to 60 dB. The petitioners
       have indicated that paddle tennis sound levels range from 55 dB to 60 dB and
       therefore they believe there will not be an increase in noise level on the Coromandel
       property as a result of the paddle tennis facility because the traffic on Waukegan
       Road is louder.

Traffic Impact Analysis

The petitioners have retained KLOA to conduct a traffic impact analysis of the plans for the
proposed new paddle facility. The petitioner's consultant conducted existing traffic counts
on Waukegan Road in vicinity of the proposed paddle facility site during the weekday
evening and Saturday midday peak periods (4 to 7 p.m. on weekdays and 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. on Saturdays). The petitioners have indicated that the paddle facility will be open no
earlier than 8 a.m. and no later than 11 p.m. The peak (busiest) times for the paddle
facility's use will be weekdays from 9 a.m. to noon and from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., and on
Saturdays from 8 a.m. to noon.

Table 2 on page 6 of the petitioner's traffic impact study indicates the estimated paddle
court peak traffic volumes. During the weekday and Saturday peak times, they anticipate
all four courts will be in use with a maximum of 16 vehicles going in and 16 vehicles
leaving the site, for a total of 32 vehicles per hour. Figure 3 on page 7 of the petitioner's
study indicates the projected peak hour traffic volumes including the traffic from the
proposed new paddle facilities. The petitioner's consultant performed a Waukegan Road
gap study to determine if there are sufficient gaps in traffic to accommodate left turns into
the paddle facility and left turns out of the paddle facility. Table 5 on page 9 of the analysis
shows the results of the gap study. The petitioner's traffic study indicates the results show
there are more than a sufficient number of gaps to accommodate left turning vehicle
movements in and out of the facility.


                                               3
Deerfield Road Reconstruction Project (Village of Deerfield)

The Village of Deerfield is proposing to reconstruct Deerfield Road from Rosemary Terrace
to Carriage Way in 2014. The scope of the Village project consists of full reconstruction of
the roadway, sidewalks, water main, and traffic signals. The reconstruction of the existing
sidewalk on the south side of Deerfield Road (which is currently located immediately
adjacent to the curb) will provide safer passage for pedestrians. The south side of
Deerfield Road is designated an east/west bike route in the Village's Comprehensive Plan.
The new design will provide a four foot wide buffer/parkway between the Deerfield Road
curb and the new sidewalk (that is, a four foot wide buffer between vehicular traffic and
pedestrians.) In order to provide adequate room for the sidewalk, property will need to be
acquired from Briarwood Country Club and other property owners along Deerfield Road.
Along the Briarwood County Club property, a strip of land five feet wide is needed for the
Deerfield Road reconstruction project. The landscaping improvement along the Deerfield
Road parking lot will be completed after the Deerfield Road reconstruction project. The
existing vegetation will remain in place until the Deerfield Road reconstruction project is
complete.

Zoning Conformance

Country clubs are a Special Use in the residential districts. The petitioners are seeking to
amend their Special Use in order to allow the proposed facilities.

Setbacks

The petitioner's plans do not encroach into the required minimum yards. In the R-3
District, which is the zoning district in which the paddle courts and paddle hut are proposed
to be located, the front yard (Waukegan Road) requirement is 25 feet, but for Special Use,
minimum yards of greater dimension may be required as a condition of authorization.

The petitioner's plans indicate the western paddle courts will be setback 44.80' from the
property line and the warming hut will be setback 111.8' from the property line.

The proposed renovations to the clubhouse building do not encroach into any required
minimum yards.

Parking

Deerfield Road Parking Lot

The petitioner's plans show the existing right-of-way line and the new right-of-way line after
the 5 foot wide strip of land needed along Deerfield Road is taken to accommodate the
Village's Deerfield Road improvement project. The parking will be changed from angled
parking to perpendicular parking. The number of parking spaces in the redesigned parking
lot will be increased from 156 to 171, an increase of 15 parking spaces in this parking lot,

                                              4
and valet parking will still be provided. Six handicapped spaces will be provided in the
Deerfield Road parking lot. The parking lot will maintain its two current vehicular access
points from Deerfield Road. The size of the parking spaces will be 9 feet wide by 19 feet
deep with a 24 foot wide drive aisle as required by the Zoning Ordinance.

The parking lot is currently screened as shown on the aerial photo, and the new parking lot
will be screened along Deerfield Road in a three (3) foot wide area as shown on the
petitioner's landscape plan. The required screening of front yard of a parking lot is a four
(4) foot high screen of evergreen shrubs or trees, a planted earth berm or a combination of
the two.

Waukegan Road Parking Lot

The Waukegan Road parking lot will contain a total of 28 parking spaces including 2
handicapped spaces as required. The spaces will be 9 feet wide by 19 feet deep and the
parking aisle will exceed the 24 foot minimum required with 35.73 feet. There is no
specific requirement in the Zoning Ordinance for a paddle facility parking lot. Parking
spaces for uses not listed in the Zoning Ordinance are provided as recommended by the
Plan Commission and approved by the Board of Trustees. The petitioner's materials
indicate the proposed amount of parking is adequate based on other clubs that have
similar facilities. An asphalt paved six foot wide path will be provided south of the parking
lot. A future conceptual parking lot area to the south of the 28 space parking lot is shown
on the plans.

Lighting

The Zoning Ordinance requires that illumination of off-street parking areas shall be
arranged so as not to project direct rays of light onto adjacent properties (lighting cannot
spill over the property lines) or into street right-of-way so as not to produce excessive
glare.

The petitioners have provided a detailed lighting plan in their materials that shows the
lighting output in foot-candles. The petitioners have indicated that the lighting will be zero
foot-candles at the property line. The petitioners plan shows a luminaire schedule of the
different lights to be used and they are labeled A, B, and C on the petitioner's plans. The
luminaire schedule provides all the details the proposed A, B, and C lights shown on the
plans. Cut sheets for the lights have been provided in the petitioner's materials. The
petitioners have indicated the paddle court lights and the parking lot lights for the paddle
facility will be on timers so they are only on when the courts are in use to minimize the
impact on the surrounding properties.

Building/Structure Height

The maximum height allowed in a residential zoning district (zoning district of the subject
property) is 35 feet. All of the structures are below this maximum (the paddle hut will be

                                               5
20'6" from grade, the screen around the paddle courts is 17 feet high, and the light poles
(box style ­ see cut sheet in petitioner's materials) are 24 feet high from grade. The new
addition to the clubhouse is 21'4" from grade at its maximum height.

Stormwater Drainage and Utilities

Final engineering plans will need to be approved by the Engineering Department prior to
the issuing of a building permit. The petitioners are working with the Village's Engineering
Department for stormwater and sanitary sewer. The stormwater will be handled in the
same pond as the clubhouse project, as they both drain in the same direction. Sanitary
sewer will be handled by a holding tank that will be pumped out.

Fire Department Review

The petitioners have indicated the Fire Department has approved the site plan for
emergency vehicle accessibility. Approval letters from the Fire Marshal have been
received.

Tree Preservation Ordinance

The Village has a tree preservation ordinance which applies to residentially zoned
properties. Any tree over 8 inches in diameter at 4 ½ feet above the ground is considered
to be a protected tree. The country club would be required to replace (mitigate) the
protected trees they remove. The amount of replacement is dependent upon the species
and condition of the trees to be removed as outlined in the tree manual. The petitioners
have indicated that their plans meet the requirements of the tree ordinance and that any
trees to be removed will be replaced as required.

Signage

The petitioners are proposing ground signage at the main entrance to the country club on
Deerfield Road and a small sign at the paddle facility entrance on Waukegan Road. At the
main entrance on Deerfield Road, the sign will consist of a logo and stainless steel letters
on pins mounted on freestanding walls (the freestanding walls will be wood with ½"
horizontal slots and concrete caps) with in-ground low voltage LED external lighting. At
the Waukegan Road entrance, the petitioners are proposing to relocate the existing
Deerfield Road club entrance sign with its existing lights. Added to this sign will "Members
Only" and "455 N. Waukegan Road". (The petitioners revised their Waukegan Road sign
plans based on the Plan Commission's comments at the May 24 continued public hearing
that this sign should have good visibility and should be illuminated.)

Currently, there are no specific provisions in the Zoning Ordinance for signage for a
country club in a residential zoning district. In the past several years, the Village has
amended the text of the Zoning Ordinance for signage requests in residential districts as
requests have come forward (the most recent examples are for Starland and Deerfield

                                             6
Community Nursery School). The petitioners must seek a Text Amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance to allow this category of sign. In order for a Text Amendment to be approved, it
must be in the public interest. The proposed Text Amendment for the signage on Deerfield
Road for the Country Club, and Waukegan Road for the paddle facility is below.

Add h. to Article 9.02-A,1,

h. Main Ground Identification Signage for a Country Club in a Residential District.

The public hearing did not conclude on April 26 and it was continued to May 24.
For the continued May 24 public hearing, the petitioners made the following
changes to their plans since the April 26 public hearing:

Landscape Screening

The petitioners have revised their plans to provide a screen where a non-residential
property (Briarwood paddle tennis facility) abuts a residential property (Coromandel).

Required: The Zoning Ordinance requires where a non-residential use (the proposed
paddle tennis facility) abuts property in a residential district (Coromandel) at a side or rear
lot line, such non-residential use shall be effectively screened along such lot line(s) by a
screening fence or landscaped screening as defined in the ordinance not less than seven
(7) feet in height. A landscaped screen is defined as a dense non-deciduous planting of a
thickness sufficient to form a visual barrier between the properties. Abutting includes
property across a street according to the definition in the Zoning Ordinance.

Proposed: A 10 foot high stockade fence is proposed along the west side of the paddle
courts to screen the paddle courts and for noise reduction. The petitioner's elevation
drawings show what this fence will look like and the plans show the location of the fence
along the west side of the courts. The new stockade fence is also shown on the revised
street section drawing. A 7 foot tall non-deciduous landscape screen (nigra arborvitae) is
proposed to screen the expanded parking lot as shown on the plans.

Relocated Fence and Gate

The fence and gate will be moved back further as shown on the site plan, and a new turn-
around area outside the gate will be provided as shown on the plan. The turn around
space outside of the gate will be useful to the occasional vehicle that will turn into the
driveway by mistake when the gate is closed.




                                               8
Sound Study

The petitioners have provided a summary of their sound study in a memorandum from
Brian Homans dated May 9, 2012. Mr. Homans has also summarized the impact of the 10
foot high board on board fence on page 3 of his memo. He estimates that the fence can
provide additional attenuation of 4 to 5 dBA to Coromandel residences across the street.

Deerfield Road Parking Lot Screen

The Deerfield Road parking lot landscape screen has been revised to provide a 4 foot high
evergreen screen as required instead of the deciduous plantings previously proposed.

                                      CONCLUSIONS

Proposed Paddle Tennis Facility Along Waukegan Road

Compatible with Existing Development

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed paddle tennis facility is planned so that it
will be compatible with existing development in the area and will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding properties. The Plan
Commission believes that the proposed paddle tennis facility will have minimal impact on
surrounding properties. The Plan Commission believes the proposed paddle tennis facility
is an appropriate use of the property. The Plan Commission believes the proposed
building and improvements will not have an adverse impact on surrounding properties.
The Plan Commission heard much testimony from the petitioner's sound expert as well as
the opposition's sound expert (see Plan Commission minutes) regarding noise generated
by the proposed paddle facility and they believe the facility will not have an adverse impact
on the existing development in the area.

The Plan Commission believes the proposed paddle tennis facility is not obtrusive and will
not have an adverse impact on surrounding properties. The Plan Commission believes the
size and location of the facility is appropriate. The Plan Commission believes the changes
made from the April 26 public hearing to the continued May 24 public hearing (as outlined
above) are appropriate and helped to improve the design and lessen the potential impact
on the neighbors. The Plan Commission is pleased that the petitioner has added
screening - to the plan for the new paddle tennis facility. The screening consists of a 10
foot high solid stockade fence that wraps around the west side of the courts and 7 foot
high landscaped screening of the expanded parking lot.

Lot of Sufficient Size

The Plan Commission believes the lot is of sufficient size for the proposed paddle tennis
facility. The Plan Commission believes the proposed plans for the property are
appropriate and reasonable, and the property is of sufficient size for the proposed

                                              9
renovations. The proposed paddle tennis facility does not encroach into the required
setbacks. The Plan Commission believes the proposed plans for the property are
appropriate and reasonable, and the property is of sufficient size for the proposed
renovations.

Traffic

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed paddle tennis facility will not have an
adverse impact on the surrounding properties. They do not believe that the proposed use
should significantly increase traffic volumes in the area as the facility will be a low
generator of traffic. The petitioners have undertaken a traffic study that indicates that the
new paddle tennis facility will not have a significant impact on Waukegan Road traffic. The
applicant's traffic and parking study indicates there are an adequate number of gaps in
Waukegan Road traffic to allow traffic to enter and exit the site without problems at the
unsignalized driveway which will be widened to accommodate the new paddle tennis
facility. The Plan Commission believes the traffic generated by the proposed paddle tennis
facility will be minimal and will not have an adverse impact on the area and that the new
traffic can be safely accommodated. The Plan Commission recommended added a lit
ground sign for the Waukegan Road driveway to help the paddle court patrons find the
entrance more easily.

Parking and Access

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed number of parking spaces for the
proposed paddle tennis facility will be adequate. The facility is not open to the general
public but is a private facility. The Plan Commission believes that the proposed expanded
parking lot with 28 parking spaces will be able to accommodate the parking needs
generated by the new paddle tennis facility.

The Plan Commission believes the proposed changes to the Waukegan Road driveway
are appropriate to accommodate the new tennis facility. They believe the widened access
point will function well for the small amount of traffic that will utilize this access point. The
petitioners have adjusted their plans so the fence and gate is moved back to help improve
the line of sight (resulting in only minor changes to existing vegetation in this area), and a
new turn around area at the Waukegan Road gate was added as shown on the plan. The
Plan Commission recommended a more prominent lit ground sign at the Waukegan Road
entrance to better identify the this entrance for patrons of the paddle tennis facility.

Effect on the Neighborhood

The Plan Commission believes the proposed paddle tennis facility will not be significantly
or materially detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the public or injurious to other
property or improvements in the neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values
in the surrounding areas. The Plan Commission believes the proposed paddle tennis
facility will have minimal impact on neighborhood. The Plan Commission believes that the

                                               10
proposed renovations will fit in with the existing surrounding area and will not have a
deleterious effect on the neighborhood. Briarwood County Club made revisions to their
plans since the first public hearing in response to concerns by the neighbors. The Plan
Commission believes the 10 foot high solid board fence will help to as a sound barrier.

In order to lessen the impact on the neighbors, the Plan Commission recommends that the
hours of operation of the paddle tennis facility be limited to 10 p.m. instead of 11 p.m. as
requested by Briarwood. The petitioners agreed to the 10 p.m. cut off time, therefore the
hours of the proposed paddle tennis facility would be from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Adequate Facilities

Adequate facilities (utilities, access road, drainage) will be proposed for the proposed
paddle tennis.

Adequate Buffering

The Plan Commission believes the proposed new 10 foot high screening fence on the west
side of the new tennis courts and the 7 foot high landscape screen of the expanding
parking lot will provide an adequate screen for the new facility. The petitioners have
revised their plans since the April 26 public hearing to increase the setback of the paddle
tennis courts further away from Waukegan Road. Buffering is defined in the Zoning
Ordinance as any means of protecting abutting properties from the visual or auditory
effects of a different or more intense use. Buffering may include, but is not limited to,
berming, fencing, landscaping, providing greater setbacks or providing open spaces.

Text Amendment for Proposed Signage:

The Plan Commission is in favor of amending the text of the Zoning Ordinance to add
signage for a country club in a residential district. The Plan Commission believes the
proposed Text Amendment is appropriate and in the public interest.

Renovations to Club House and Parking Lot Along Deerfield Road

Compatible with Existing Development

The Plan Commission believes the proposed renovations will be compatible with existing
residential development in the area. The proposed renovations should not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvements of the surrounding properties. The
Plan Commission believes the proposed improvements will not have an adverse impact on
surrounding properties. The proposed renovations and addition will be built to be
compatible with the surrounding developments in the area. The Plan Commission believes
the proposed renovations are not obtrusive and will not have an adverse impact on
surrounding properties. The Plan Commission believes the renovations will be
aesthetically pleasing and are needed to keep the country club modern. The renovations

                                             11
to Briarwood's Deerfield Road parking lot are in coordination with the Village's future
improvements to Deerfield Road.

Lot of Sufficient Size

The Plan Commission believes the lot is of sufficient size for the proposed improvements.
The proposed facility does not encroach into the required setbacks. The Plan Commission
believes the proposed plans for the property are appropriate and reasonable, and the
property is of sufficient size for the proposed renovations. The building lot coverage is low.

Traffic

The Plan Commission believes that the proposed renovations will not have an adverse
traffic impact in the area. There will be little increase in the level of activity as result of the
renovations to the club house.

Parking and Access

The Plan Commission believes that the renovations will not have an impact on parking.
The Plan Commission believes that the proposed parking will be adequate. More parking
spaces will be added in the lot as result of the renovations.

The existing access points on Deerfield Road will not be changed. The Plan Commission
believes the existing access points are laid out in a safe and efficient manner.

Effect on the Neighborhood

The Plan Commission believes that the approval of the proposed renovations will not be
significantly or materially detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the public or
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood, nor will it diminish or
impair property values in the surrounding areas. The Plan Commission believes that the
renovations fit in well with the existing surrounding neighborhood and will not have a
negative effect on the neighborhood. The Plan Commission believes there is a need for
the proposed improvements and they are well planned.

Adequate Facilities

Adequate facilities will be available to service the proposed renovations. The vehicular
access to the country club on Deerfield Road already exists. The Plan Commission
believes that the storm water drainage is addressed and will work for the subject property.
The Plan Commission believes the proposed renovations will not create storm water
problems in the area.




                                                12
Adequate Buffering

The Plan Commission believes that the existing landscaping currently in place and the
additional landscaping provided as part of the renovations will provide an adequate buffer.
New landscape screening of the parking lot will be provided as part of the renovations.
The existing trees on the subject property will be preserved to the extent possible. Those
trees that need to be removed for the proposed renovations to the property will be
mitigated according to the Village's tree ordinance.

                                   RECOMMENDATION

Accordingly, it is the recommendation of the Plan Commission that Briarwood Country
Club's request for an amendment to a Special Use to permit changes to the clubhouse
area and to install paddle tennis facilities as shown on the applicant's plans be approved
subject to the restriction of ceasing paddle tennis play by 10 p.m. and the paddle tennis
facility lights be extinguished by 10 p.m.

Public hearing on the request for an amendment to a Special Use for Briarwood Country
Club to permit changes to the clubhouse area and to install paddle tennis facilities.

Mr. Lawrence Freedman, Attorney with Ash, Anos, Freedman and Logan, representing
the petitioner, Briarwood Country Club, presented proof of notification. Staff confirmed
legal notice was published in the Deerfield Review on April 5, 2012.

Mr. Freedman stated that Briarwood Country Club is requesting an amendment to its
existing Special Use to permit changes to its clubhouse area and to permit the
installation of a paddle tennis facility. Mr. Freedman referred to an excerpt in the
Deerfield Comprehensive Plan that the Village strongly supports the continued use of
this property as a golf course. The petitioner agrees. A few years ago the petitioner
was offered to sell the property for redevelopment but rejected the offer. Briarwood
prefers to continue its use as a country club at this location. In order to implement this
intent and to make the Briarwood more attractive to present and future members, the
Club needs to upgrade its facilities. Briarwood proposes to modify the clubhouse and
the auto court entry, enlarge the outside dining and the casual seating area on the south
elevation of the clubhouse, expand the men's locker room and lounge area, and to add
a paddle tennis facility.

One of the primary changes from Briarwood's original plan is to change the operation
hours of the paddle tennis courts to 8:00am to 11:00pm on any given day. The number
of courts has also been reduced from 6 to 4 and the courts have been moved an
additional 20' east from the west property line on Waukegan Road. Lastly, a chiller at
the northwest corner of the club will be moved from its original location at 30 feet from
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 2

the west property line to be 100 feet from the property line. This move was to
accommodate neighboring properties in that area.

Brad Glass, President of Briarwood Country Club, said he is a resident of Highland Park
although his children attend Deerfield public schools. Mr. Glass noted that Briarwood is
a private country club and a vibrant organization seeking to invest in their future by
building amenities that will grow their membership and remain a healthy organization
that supports the Deerfield community. Briarwood employs nearly 120 people as well
as resident teenagers working as cadies and lifeguards. With over 160 acres,
Briarwood remains an integral part of the open land in Deerfield and serves as the
emergency shelter and staging ground for Kipling elementary school. Briarwood is an
active organization within the community and their investment in their proposed
enhancements and additions to their facilities will keep Briarwood in Deerfield for many
years to come.

Mr. Peter Witmer, Architect, Witmer & Associates indicated he will review the proposal
and highlighted the changes since the March 22, 2012 prefiling conference meeting.
Mr. Witmer noted in the site plan the existing clubhouse in the northwest corner and the
proposed paddle tennis courts along Waukegan Road. Mr. Witmer stated that the
landscaping plan is intended to enhance the Club along Deerfield Road as well as when
one proceeds up the Club's main drive. Mr. Witmer noted the two turnarounds in the
auto court area to better serve the Club. One turnaround would be for the golf bag drop
off area and other for the main area of the clubhouse. The turnarounds will facilitate
circulation of safety vehicles while still maintaining a safety lane across the front of the
clubhouse.

Mr. Witmer stated that the landscaping is an important piece of this proposal especially
how the proposed trees will fit into their exiting site. A double row of trees will line the
main drive while trees surrounding the courtyard will act as a buffer between the pool
area and the clubhouse. Briarwood is also being preemptive by incorporating in this
proposal the loss of 5' of land that will be lost in the future widening of Deerfield Road.
Briarwood is proposing a parking lot addition with additional landscaping and deciduous
trees along Deerfield Road. Parking spaces in the lot will change from angled to
perpendicular spaces. Mr. Witmer commented that the maple trees that will line
Deerfield Road were chosen not only for their foliage but for their cone shape which will
better facilitate the existing power lines.

Briarwood is proposing new signage on both sides of the main entryway. The main
signage will be poured in place concrete with form liners and stainless steel lettering. A
higher element will be behind each main sign.

In the auto court area, Briarwood is proposing to raise the existing canopy to the same
height of its main entrance to be in line with the existing roof line. The addition of
skylights to the roof will add natural light and enhance this area. Wood elements to the
front entrance and wood cladding to the columns will also be added. The entrance area
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012

will be upgraded to meet current ADA requirements. The pool area will be enhanced
with shade trees, a wood deck and additional dining space in the northeast corner.

Mr. Witmer wanted to note that the original chiller location has been changed. The
chiller location houses the mechanical system for the building that is being upgraded.
The original location, approximately 30 feet from the property line, has been moved to
321 feet from the property line near the loading dock east of the front door. The chillers
will be below the building window line and screened with additional landscaping.

The lighting plan calls for uplighting for the trees that will line the main drive as well as
the trees in the turning circle. The existing elm tree that will remain in the grass island
will continue to be lit from an existing down lights. The entry signage will be illuminated
with low voltage LED lighting at the front. Mr. Witmer also noted the rear building and
lower terrace area will add new tree and path lighting.

The parking lot expansion will change the parking configuration from angled to
perpendicular and add 26 new parking spaces. There proposed parking lot expansion
will have 181 parking spaces and 6 handicapped parking spaces for a total of 187
spaces.

Mr. Witmer stated that they have talked with the Village regarding tree replacement and
meet all replacement requirements for the trees that will be removed as a result of the
proposed modifications.

The 450 square foot building addition on the south elevation will increase the size of the
men's locker room and lounge area. The lower terrace addition, on the south elevation
will be enhanced with additional landscaping and trees. The lower terrace addition will
be situated below the existing upper terrace and have a wheelchair accessible ramp. A
stairway is being added to the upper dining terrace for emergency egress as well as
providing another option for members to access the upper level.

Mr. Witmer reviewed the proposed paddle tennis courts location and site plan. The
initial proposal had the courts at 20' off the west property line. Briarwood felt that this
location was too close to existing vegetation that acts as a barrier between the courts
and Waukegan Road. The new proposal calls for the courts to be moved to 44 feet
from the property line. The existing curb cut at the proposed paddle tennis court will be
widened approximately 4-1/2'. The existing fence at the paddle court entrance will be
pushed back a few feet and change its angle to provide better visual site lines for
vehicles exiting the property. The proposed gate that will allow access into the parking
lot will remain in the same location and the parking lot will have a total of 28 spaces.
Mr. Witmer said paddle tennis is played in a doubles configuration and with all 4 courts
fully occupied, 16 players would be playing at one time. Briarwood feels that the 26
parking spaces and 2 handicap spaces will adequately serve the 16 players. Typically
paddle tennis is played in a league type play where clubs play other clubs. A series
play would consist of 8 players. Matches are scored and played in the same format as
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012

tennis with best of out of three winning a match with matches ranging from 45 minutes
to 2 hours. Series play is usually played from Tuesday through Thursday with men's
matches beginning at 7 pm.

The warming hut facility is located in the center of the 4 courts and will be 111 feet from
the property line. The one room warming hut is 1,000 square feet and is typically used
for viewing. Paddle tennis does not usually have a lot of spectators besides the players
themselves. Staffing for the warming facility is one or two people who will serve
beverages to players during match play. Mr. Witmer commented that the four courts will
not be conducive to tournaments nor does Briarwood want to have tournaments at this
facility.

Mr. Witmer commented that the existing parking lot is used for an existing maintenance
storage facility and a wash station. This building has infrequent use but it does provide
material storage. Briarwood will use the existing parking lot and curb cut for the paddle
tennis facility.

Mr. Witmer displayed a cross section image that showed the relationship of distances
between the paddle tennis courts, warming hut, existing vegetation, Waukegan Road,
existing berm and the neighbors to the west. The distance from edge of the paddle
courts to the residential buildings to the west is approximately 234'. Mr. Witmer pointed
out that the lower landscaped screening will screen the courts while the taller trees will
be taller than the proposed court lighting and screens.

The exterior elevations of the paddle tennis facility are intended to be darker so that it
would recede through the trees. The court screening and lights will be black and the
warming hut will be a darker color. Mr. Witmer passed out physical samples of the
exterior materials that are proposed for the paddle tennis facility and warming hut.
Briarwood is proposing a very discreet 2'X1' green metal sign that will indicate "Club"
and for "Members Only". The gate will have with inserts which will not allow anyone to
look into the gate. The gate will be opened and closed by staff on a daily basis and
remain locked at all other times.

To minimize any impact of the lighting to the surrounding neighbors, Briarwood is
proposing court lighting with 8 box style lights around each court. Soffit or can lighting
will be used around the deck so that there will not be any exposed bulbs. The parking
lot will have 2 box style lights. The lights will be on timers so that they will be shut off at
designated times. Mr. Witmer stated that there is a zero cutoff at their property line with
the lighting design. The court lighting poles will be 24' high from grade and the screens
will be 16' high from ground level. The playing surface sits 4' from the ground and the
screen will be 12' high from the playing surface.

Mr. Witmer realizes that there are sound considerations involved with the playing
surface and said the inserts will be put into the seams of the playing surface panels to
cut down on court noise.

Mr. Freedman corrected his earlier testimony that the chiller location will be moved back
100 yards from the property line and not 100 feet from the property line. Mr. Freedman
introduced the traffic consultant to summarize the traffic study.

Luay Aboona, Traffic Engineer and Principal with KLOA, conducted a traffic study to
look at the impact at the gated access of the proposed paddle court facility on
Waukegan Road. The gated access is approximately 1,000 feet north of a signalized
intersection at Kates Road and approximately 1/3 of a mile south of the signalized
intersection at Osterman Avenue. The two signals on either side of the gate access are
important because they regulate traffic on Waukegan Road creating a platoon flow of
traffic rather than random arrivals. This was noted because it creates gaps in the traffic
stream which allow vehicles to enter and exit the paddle tennis facility. The peak
operation for the paddle tennis facility will be after 7:00pm on weekdays.

Based on traffic counts done by KLOA, peak traffic on Waukegan Road occurs at
5:00pm. Mr. Aboona commented that Waukegan Road traffic drops off after 6:00pm
and 7:00pm. Mr. Aboona stated that the peak operation of the paddle tennis facility is
well beyond the peak hours of traffic on Waukegan Road. To better understand the
traffic impact, KLOA used the traffic from the peak operation of the facility and overlayed
it onto the peak traffic period for Waukegan Road. The study was further conservative
by assuming that the courts would be fully occupied by 16 players and there would be
turnover by all for paddle tennis courts during the same period. Mr. Aboona concluded
that traffic making a left turn into the facility would be able to do so without considerable
delay. He also concluded that existing traffic movements turning left onto Waukegan
Road would be able to do so with an average wait time of 30 seconds.

A gap study was conducted for the facility on Waukegan Road. A gap study measures
the number of gaps or interruptions in a traffic stream. The study measures the amount
of cars that could turn left into the facility and turn left out of the facility. The gap study
indicated that for vehicles entering the facility, there are more than 20 times the amount
of gaps needed to allow for the left turns to occur. Vehicles exiting the facility will have
more than 5 times the needed amount of gaps to make those left turns. Mr. Aboona
stated that under the worst case scenario under peak hour conditions, there are still
available gaps to allow for turns in and out of the facility. Mr. Aboona commented
further that the perception that there is a lot of traffic on Waukegan Road is true but at
the same time traffic is regulated by the signals and that there are gaps in the traffic
stream that will allow vehicles to safely enter and exit the facility.

Mr. Aboona noted that the gated access driveway will be widened to allow for one lane
in and one lane out and the exiting movements will by regulated by a stop sign. Mr.
Aboona reiterated that they worked with Mr. Witmer to check the site lines according to
their plan for the safe exit of vehicle traffic. Mr. Aboona indicated that moving the fence
back at the gated access will allow for proper site distance while exiting the facility.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012

Mr. Brian Homans, Acoustical Engineer and President of Shiner and Associates Inc,
conducted a sound impact study on the Briarwood proposal. Since 1973, Shiner and
Associates have served as a registered engineering design firm in Illinois. Mr. Homans
has been with the firm for 30 years.

Mr. Homans study was based on analyzing the noise of the proposed paddle tennis
facility and the effect it would have on the residents across the street. To analyze the
proposal, a base line was established at three locations across the street from the
proposed paddle tennis facility. The locations were at the crest of a landscaped berm
located across the street from the proposed facility, opposite the first building south of
the pond; the second building was south of the fire station; and at the pond. Mr.
Homans conducted his measurements and observations on Wednesday, April 18, 2012
between 9:30-10:00pm. The evening rain influenced the acoustic readings with the wet
pavement. The reading influenced by tire noise from the wet pavement were not used.
Mr. Homans came back the following evening, Thursday, April 19, 2012 between 8:30-
9:45pm to measure sound levels at the stated locations.

Mr. Homans observed cars passing by and took sound readings during those periods.
Mr. Homans did stop the sound meter during aircraft overflights and during a train
passing through. The general ambient noise was influenced by the traffic activity on
Waukegan Road.

The next step was to measure noise from a paddle tennis facility. Currently there is no
literature on these types of facilities. Mr. Homan was able to measure noise at the Lake
Forest Country Club paddle tennis facility. The facility had 4 paddle tennis courts
operating at the time but the surrounding area was noisy which made it difficult conduct
the measurements. Northmoor Country Club in Highland Park was also used to
conduct the measurements. Mr. Homans conducted the Northmoor measurements on
a Sunday during the hours of 8:25-8:45am. Two of the four courts were in operation.
The measurements were conducted very close to the courts and only when paddle
tennis was being played.

In the case of the measurements at the Lake Forest Country Club, the noisy area made
it hard to determine if the noise was coming from the paddle tennis play or from the
surrounding area. The readings at both facilities were short in nature and the main
source of noise at these facilities came from the balls hitting the fences or screens and
the players' voices, and foot fall. In the Lake Forest facility, a source of noise came
from heater system in operation. Mr. Homans noted that the noise control measures
such as the gasket inserts that were mentioned to reduce noise in the playing courts
were not in place at either facility location.

For his analysis, Mr. Homans took his readings from Waukegan Road and the two
paddle tennis facilities and normalized them to a common distance of 175' from the
edge of the paddle tennis facility. Therefore, the analysis simulated the noise that
would be heard 175' from the edge of the proposed paddle tennis courts. This distance
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012

was used because it is an area outside the residential units that could be enjoyed by
residents. Mr. Homans also corrected or normalized the paddle tennis measurements
for the effect of the ambient environment. This was difficult to do for the Lake Forest
facility because it was very noisy. The readings for this facility fell in the high side of
readings. The Northmoor facility did have cars passing by but sound readings were not
taken during these times. Mr. Homans compared the results of the paddle tennis
measurements and the ambient level measurements.

Mr. Homans stated that Deerfield has a noise ordinance but it is primarily a nuisance
ordinance so the criteria for evaluating the results were based on the numeric noise
standards from the State of Illinois. The Illinois Noise regulations are governed by the
Policing Control Board and are very stringent and complex as far as noise ordinance
are concerned particularly compared to other cities and states.

The Illinois Noise regulations state that during the daytime (7:00am ­ 10:00pm) one is
permitted to generate sound levels across a property line to residential property of 55
decibels (dBa). The permitted sound level at night (10:00pm -7:00am) is 44dBa.
Readings are taken at the residential property line and all readings are energy averaged
for a period of one hour to show compliance. Mr. Homans commented that for his study
he did not conduct measurements for an hour. Also readings are taken in separate
frequency bands or 9 octave frequency bands. Mr. Homans stated that the State
Regulations are both complex and restrictive.

Mr. Homans stated that when the measurements were normalized from a distance of
175' from the edge of the proposed paddle tennis courts, the sound measurements from
Waukegan Road ranged from 59dBa ­ 62dBa due to traffic noise. The Lake Forest
measurements were 51dBa, and the Northmoor measurements were 46dBa. Mr.
Homans attributed the difference in the two paddle tennis measurements to the number
of players at Lake Forest and noisier conditions that could not be completely corrected.

In summary, Mr. Homans stated that at the edge of the parking pad, which is across the
street from the paddle tennis facility, the sound levels will be in full compliance with the
Illinois Daytime and Nighttime Noise Regulations. Standing outside, one will be able to
hear paddle tennis noise during breaks in traffic, however the sound level of paddle
tennis play will be significantly less than the sound level of cars passing by on
Waukegan Road. From inside the first row of residential units across the street from the
proposed paddle tennis courts with their windows open, one may be able to hear low
levels of paddle tennis play during breaks in traffic. During winter months when the
windows are closed, Mr. Homans seriously doubted that any noise would be heard from
the paddle tennis facility. Mr. Homans stated that from the second row of residential
units, with its greater distance from the proposed paddle tennis facility, no paddle tennis
play will be heard from either inside or outside the unit.

Due to the technical nature of Mr. Homans' testimony, Mr. Freedman filed Mr. Homans'
credentials for the record.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012

Mr. Freedman discussed the standards of the Special Use that are applicable to this
application in terms of the documentation and the testimony filed.

The first standard states the proposal must be compatible with the existing development
and the nature and intensity of the activities involved and the size, placement and
design of the structures proposed will be so planned that the Special Use will be
compatible with the existing development and will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of surrounding property.

Mr. Freedman said the proposal seeks to change the clubhouse area and to install a
paddle tennis facility at Waukegan Road. Mr. Freedman said the clubhouse changes
are almost all internal and he suggested that there is no arguable impact on surrounding
property except perhaps the landscape modification along Deerfield Road. Mr.
Freedman referred to Mr. Witmer's testimony that that screening would be replaced
when the sidewalk widening is completed. More significantly as to Waukegan Road,
Mr. Witmer testified the plans provide light fixtures that will have zero foot candles at the
property line. Mr. Aboona testified the addition of new traffic generated by these paddle
tennis courts is projected to have a limited impact on the operation of the roadway
system. Mr. Aboona's report also concluded that the proposed widened access drive
will be adequate to serve the total traffic generated by the paddle courts. He also stated
that left turns in and out of the widened access drive will adequately function without
any new traffic improvements being recommended or required. Mr. Homans testified
that the sound levels emanating from the paddle tennis courts facility will comply with all
legal requirements and will not have a significant impact on the residential units closest
to Waukegan Road and no impact on any of the units behind the first tier of units. He
testified that the sound outside of the first tier of units would only be heard through gaps
in traffic with the sound readings of traffic having a higher decibel level than that coming
from the paddle courts. Mr. Homan further indicated that if one is inside the first tier of
units with the windows open you may not hear paddle tennis noise and if it is heard, it
would be minimal. If the windows were closed, Mr. Homan indicated that the noise
would not be heard. Mr. Freedman reiterated that paddle tennis is normally played in
the winter although not exclusively.

Mr. Freedman stated that the testimony establishes that the nature and intensity of the
proposed modifications including size, placement and design of the modified structures
will be compatible with existing development and will not impede orderly development or
surrounding properties.

The second standard states that the lot has to be of sufficient size for the proposed use.
Mr. Freedman suggests that it is self evident that Briarwood is of sufficient in size to
accommodate the proposed modification.

The third standard deals with traffic which states that the location of the Special Use
within the Village will be such that adverse effects on surrounding properties will be
minimal particularly with the traffic generated from the Use. Without repeating Mr.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 9

Aboona's testimony, Mr. Freedman wanted to reiterated Mr. Aboona's comments in
regards to traffic noting that gaps in traffic created by the signalization both north and
south at the paddle tennis entrance will result in no effect, maybe minimal, if any, on
surrounding properties.

The fourth standard deals with parking and access. Mr. Witmer testified that the parking
areas around the clubhouse will be expanded somewhat in size and with respect to the
proposed parking at the paddle tennis facility, the 28 parking spaces will be more than
sufficient to serve the anticipated number of participants and the minimal number of
employees. Mr. Aboona testified that the proposed widening of the access drive will be
adequate to service all traffic even the left turns in and the left turns out. The parking
areas will also be adequate and the drives will be laid out to prevent hazards and
nuisances.

The fifth standard deals with the effect on the neighborhood. The standard reads that in
all respects, the Special Use would not be specifically or materially detrimental to the
health, safety, and welfare of the public or injurious to other property or improvements to
the neighborhood nor will it diminish or impair property values in the surrounding area.
Mr. Freedman stated that in order for the changes to impact surrounding properties or
affect their values there would have to be some impact that would be created in the
nature of traffic, light, sound or use of the utilities. Mr. Freedman commented that it is
clear from the documentation filed and preliminarily reviewed by the Village engineer
that adequate utilities already service the Club and can be extended through the Club's
property to service these new facilities. Therefore utilities are not an issue. Traffic, light
and sound had all been addressed as part of Mr. Freedman's previous comments.

Standard six dealt with adequate facilities. Mr. Freedman stated that adequate utilities,
access roads, drainage and or other necessary facilities have been or will be provided.
As stated previously, Mr. Freedman noted that there is sufficient testimony as well as
the preliminary review by the Village Engineering Department to support compliance
with these standards.

Lastly, Mr. Freedman addressed standard seven which dealt with adequate buffering.
Adequate fencing and/or screening will be provided to ensure enjoyment of surrounding
properties to provide for the public safety or to screen parking areas and visually
incompatible uses. Also as indicated by Mr. Witmer's testimony there are already
sufficient berming and other landscaping on the west side of Waukegan Road and the
landscaping along Deerfield Road will be replaced once the sidewalk is moved. Mr.
Witmer also testified that the existing vegetation along Waukegan Road will continue to
be maintained and not be removed.

Chairman Shapiro opened the Public Hearing to public comment or questions for the
petitioner. Mr. Shapiro noted that public comment would be heard first followed by any
public opposition presentations.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 10

Norton Wasserman, 412 Kelburn Road, Unit 213, will be speaking in length in
opposition but had a few questions. Mr. Wasserman wanted to know how much
additional square footage is being devoted to this project on the Deerfield Road side.

Mr. Witmer referenced a visual of a site plan. He clarified that the Deerfield Road
expansion will result in the Village requesting 5' of additional Briarwood property along
Waukegan Road. Mr. Wasserman wants to know how much square footage is being
requested by Briarwood to be improved. Mr. Witmer stated that the proposed building
addition is 450 square feet, the terrace addition is 3,707 square feet, additional parking
area of approximately 14' X 300' or 4,200 square feet. The other modifications to the
site are the turnarounds which are a reconfiguration of the existing spaces. Mr.
Wasserman asked if there is at least 3,700 square feet being added, could the entire
paddle tennis facility be built in the 3,700 square feet? Mr. Witmer calculated that the
paddle tennis facility would exceed 3,700 square feet noting that the warming hut is
1,000 square feet, each court is 1,800 square feet and then the space allocated for the
walkways and the handicap ramp.

Lawrence Jutovsky, 474 Taupo Lane, questioned the sound measurements especially
the readings taken at the Northmoor facility where only two courts were being used. Mr.
Jutovsky lives across the street in the second tier of residential units and commented
that the sound carries down where the pond is located. If the sound is measured for
four courts the measurements will be significantly higher.

Mr. Homans stated that the orientation of the court will affect the readings. In this case
two courts are closer to the Coromandel units and two courts are farther away. Mr.
Homan stated that if you double the number of players you add 3 decibels to the sound
level results. The Northmoor measurements which were taken with two courts had a
measurement of 46dBa. This measurement was increased to 49dBa which is still
consistent with the 51dBa measured at the Lake Forest facility for 4 courts being used.

Lila George, 411 Kelburn Road, commented that Mr. Glass stated that they are making
these improvements to increase their membership. Ms. George stated that she was
told that this was not the reason for improvements. Ms. George also stated that the
Northmoor paddle tennis facility is located off of Clavey Road which is a two lane street.
On either side of that street, where the paddle courts are located, is a golf course which
absorbs the sound compared to the proposed Briarwood paddle facility where sound
would be absorbed by buildings. She would like to understand how Northmoor can be
equated to Briarwood on Waukegan Road. Ms. George does not understand how it can
be stated that the sound will be drowned out by the traffic on Waukegan Road and then
be stated that there is very little traffic at certain hours.

Mr. Glass commented that membership at Briarwood has been inconsistent over the
years. Current membership is around 248 members and has seen highs in the 270
range. Mr. Glass stated that Briarwood is always trying to get new members to support
their facility. Chairman Shapiro rephrased the question for the petitioner that Ms.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 11

George was referencing some representation that there would not be an increase in
membership. Mr. Glass hopes there would be an increase in membership stating that
Briarwood is currently at a low membership level. Mr. Freedman believes the reference
is to a meeting that he attended with Ms. George and the two other presidents of
Coromandel. Mr. Freedman commented that Mr. Glass was not at this meeting. Mr.
Freedman proceed to state that a question was raised at this meeting on the impact the
proposal would have if the membership increased substantially. Mr. Freedman stated
that they indicated that membership was relatively constant, there are gains and losses
and although there could be increases Briarwood does not anticipate anything that
would be of such a size that would make this unrealistic.

Mr. Homans stated that Northmoor was a good location for sound measurement
because there was not a lot of roadway noise. Measurements were conducted close to
the courts and extrapolated out so that for every doubling of distance, 4.5dB was
subtracted from the measurement. Mr. Homans stated that for soft sound such as in
this case it is not uncommon to subtract 6dB for doubling of distance. Mr. Homan chose
to be conservative in his calculations by saying that the noise would not be extenuated
as quickly. Mr. Homans also stated that even though a car may not be in front of the
residential units, vehicles can still be heard down the street. The sounds from the
vehicles in the area are still louder than the noise generated from the paddle tennis
measurements. Ms. George reiterated how a two lane road (referring to the roadway at
the Northmoor facility) can be compared to a four lane road when comparing traffic and
sound. Mr. Homan stated that Clavey Road was not a factor in his calculations.

Irving Sandack, 522 Milford Road, is concerned with the noise, lights and traffic and that
it is inevitable that these issues will have a negative impact on property values. Mr.
Sandack commented Deerfield is a uniquely desirable area and any change like the one
being proposed can't be positive for the area's residents. Mr. Sandack doesn't think
that hurting the environment is not Briarwood's intention but he does think that there
could be a better location for the paddle tennis facility that will serve their patrons well
and not hurt the residents. Mr. Sandack also wondered if the Fire Department has any
concerns with the noise from the facility at night.

Naomi Jaffe, 361 Kelburn Road, commented that sound measurements were only taken
in the evening. Ms. Jaffe wonders why measurements were not taken during the
morning or daylight hours. She also questions why this location was chosen for the
paddle tennis facility rather than a location closer to the clubhouse.

Mr. Homans stated traffic is heavier in the morning and therefore noise from the traffic
would be at an even higher level. Mr. Witmer stated that they studied the entire site for
the paddle facility. One area was the northeast corner where the existing driving range
is located. The scale for the parking requirement and the paddle facility would not
provide enough space in this area and would require relocating the driving range. This
was not a viable option. Other locations were the north border or the south end where a
maintenance facility is located. The north border was not viable option because of the
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 12

location of the golf holes and the south end was not a good location because the facility
would not fit. The current proposed location was chosen because it was the biggest
piece of property that wasn't used for the golf course or existing clubhouse area. This
area made the most sense because it is the most unused real estate within their 160
acres.

Donald Jaffe, 361Kelburn Road, commented that in the submitted material, there was
mention of more paddle courts in the future. Mr. Freedman stated that they have no
plans now or in the future to expand the paddle tennis courts. Mr. Freedman can't say
that they won't change their mind in the future and want to expand but this project is not
designed as a phased project with an eye toward the future expansion. Mr. Freedman
confirmed that they would have to come before the Plan Commission for any expansion
but they do not anticipate an expansion to the paddle court facility.

Alan Polikoff, 407 Milford Road, said he lives in the first tier of buildings that will be most
directly affected by this project. Mr. Polikoff is very familiar with the diminution of traffic
and traffic noise at 7:00pm and thereafter when peak operation of the paddle facility
would take place. He wonders if they will be constantly be subjected to the paddle
tennis noise since it was stated that paddle tennis noise will be heard during breaks in
traffic. Mr. Polikoff stated that noise impact was not addressed for second floor
residents living in the first tier of units with their windows open. Mr. Polikoff believes the
measurement study is flawed because it failed to comply with Illinois law which states
that noise studies are required to be taken for an hour. Testimony stated that readings
were taken for less than an hour period.

Mr. Homans stated that the sound measurements that were taken pertain to the first
and second floor units. Commissioner Nadler asked with second floor windows open
and little traffic, would the paddle tennis noise level be less than normal traffic sound.
Mr. Homans commented that paddle tennis noise will be heard but will be much lower
than noise levels from the traffic. Mr. Homans stated that his readings were taken for
30-45 minutes for each measurement. Mr. Homans also stated that to quantify ambient
sound, Illinois regulations require only 10 minutes of data. To establish a noise
violation, Illinois regulations require 1 hour of data.

Peter Whitaker, 388 Milford Road, lives within 250' of the paddle courts in the second
tier of residential units. Mr. Whitaker wonders why residents speaking here tonight that
live on Kelburn Road and live a half a mile from the paddle courts are so concerned
about the noise. Mr. Whitaker believes residents in the first and second tier of buildings
should be more concerned about the noise. Mr. Whitaker commented that Coromandel
has a lot of noise particularly with the trains going by. Mr. Whitaker addressed the
traffic consultant regarding concerns for southbound vehicles waiting to turn left into the
paddle facility and the stacking that will occur while waiting to make the turn. He is also
concerned with vehicles turning directly across the northbound fast lane.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 13

Mr. Aboona indicated that it will be approximately 8 vehicles that will make this turn in a
1 hour period. Mr. Aboona explained that the expected maximum trips in an hour is
expected to be 16 vehicles in which half (8) would come from the north and the other
half (8) would come from the south. This distribution would be 1 vehicle turning from
either direction at approximately every 7 minutes. The gap study taken between 6:00-
7:00pm indicated that there are 149 gaps available or 149 vehicles could turn left during
this period. Mr. Aboona noted that peak use for the facility would be after 7:00pm so
this was a conservative study. He also commented that there will be an instance where
a vehicle will have to wait to make a left but the frequency of that happening is very low.
From a traffic standpoint this is a low impact and off peak operation where traffic will
continue to drop during the paddle tennis evening peak hours.

Mr. Whitaker does not feel that this study is accurate because of the many assumptions
and the averaging of vehicles and trips over a 1 hour period. Mr. Whitaker feels that
players don't come over a 1 hour period; they usually arrive at the same time. Mr.
Aboona stated that the matches may take an hour or two hours so players will arrive
and exit at different times. He does not discount that players may all arrive within a
shorter time span but in either case there will not be an influx of traffic because there
are enough natural gaps in the traffic stream as well as gaps due to the traffic signals on
either side of the entrance.

Michael Smilg, 508 Milford Road, questioned the petitioner meeting the legal
compliance criteria for the Special Use. Mr. Smilg believes that it is not only about
being legally compliant but how the proposal affects the enjoyment and value of the
residential area. Mr. Smilg noted that southbound traffic turning left may pose a safety
issue of cars being rear-ended when approaching vehicles in the fast lane may not
expect a stopped vehicle at this location. If there are no backup and traffic is
intermittent then rear-ending collisions become more of an issue. Mr. Smilg would like
clarification on zero light at the lot line. Does this mean that people from the west side
of Waukegan Road will not see a light at the facility or does it mean that there will be no
illumination at the actual lot line? Mr. Smilg would also like clarification as to how much
volume is a decibel. He also wondered if the berm in front of the residential units will
funnel and direct the sound to the second floor units and if the building may reverberate
and reinforce the sound. Mr. Smilg also feels that there is a distinction between the
hum of traffic or a train compared to the constant banging of balls.

Mr. Witmer commented that photometrics of a fixture is put into a computer to calculate
foot-candles at the surface. Mr. Witmer took foot-candle readings at night on the street
and at the berm. The foot-candle readings ranged from 1.4 to 1.0 to 0.8 and the light
came from the ambient light created by the street lights along Waukegan Road. Mr.
Witmer noted that with a zero foot-candle reading there is still a possibility of seeing the
light source. The box lights used for this project were chosen to reduce the visibility of
the light source but it can still be visible depending on the angle taken while looking up
to the light. Commissioner Shayman asked if the paddle tennis light would be visible
from the second floor units. Mr. Witmer referred to a visual image of the lighting and
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 14

stated that there is a possibility that the light source will be visible. The output of the
paddle tennis lights will be approximately a ¼ the output of a street light.

Mr. Homan noted IDOT regulations when describing how decibels equate to sound
volume. Mr. Homan described that the change in 10 decibels is perceived as a doubling
in sound level, a change in 5 decibels is noticeable by everyone, a change in 3 decibel
is perceptible, and a change in 1 decibel is generally imperceptible.

Mr. Homan commented that berms do not reinforce sound. The grassy berm on the
Coromandel property will not funnel sound to the second floor. As for the character of
sound, at 175' Mr. Homans does not think the sound from the paddle tennis courts will
be impulsive at all.

Nevin Forkos, 361 Kelburn, commented that it would make more sense for Briarwood to
have their paddle courts near all of their other facilities. Mr. Forkos feels like there is
adequate space to put courts near the clubhouse. He also noted that the traffic speed
on Deerfield Road would be more conducive for that use as well. Mr. Forkos also noted
that if paddle tennis is played on Saturdays during the day, it will pose problems on
Waukegan Road.

S. Chester, 402 Kelburn, asked if adjustments could be made to put the courts in the
northeast corner. Ms. Chester wonders if that location was not chosen as to not disturb
the residents on Brierhill Road.

Mr. Witmer commented that with setbacks and the proximity of the driving range there
was not enough space to put the courts in the northeast location. Mr. Witmer also
commented that balls from the driving range would probably come into the courts. Mrs.
Chester asked if the driving range could be relocated. Mr. Witmer noted that moving
the driving range was not a practical solution.

Jim Landaker, 382 Milford Road, commented that the proposed paddle courts could be
moved north and east to address sound and light issues. Mr. Landaker does not see
proper screening or any attention to make the proposed location friendly to the
neighborhood. He feels that the lighting will be disturbing to the neighbors and the
southbound left turn will pose a safety problem with rear end collisions. Mr. Landaker
doesn't feel that there is enough distance for cars if the gate is closed and need to get
back onto Waukegan Road. Commissioner Bromberg asked when the gate will be
opened and closed. Mr. Witmer stated Briarwood staff will open the gate in the morning
and close the gate at night. Commissioner Nadler asked what happens if a vehicle
turns into the driveway and the gate is closed, does the vehicle have room to turn
around facing forward. Mr. Witmer commented that people will be able to tell visually
from Waukegan Road that the gate is closed otherwise the vehicle would have to back
up onto Waukegan Road. Commissioner Nadler asked if the gate could be moved in to
accommodate a turnaround so that a vehicle can turn around to get back onto
Waukegan Road facing forward.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 15

Mr. Landaker asked if the sound measurements would be different if the readings were
taken in the winter when there is less landscaping and landscaping buffer. Mr.
Landaker also feels that the entire paddle facility would be visible from second floor
units.

Mr. Homans readings at the paddle tennis facilities were taken at relatively close range
of 50 feet or less so there would not be an appreciable difference for the winter time.
Mr. Homans' readings for paddle tennis play would not change over what he predicted.
He also stated that readings taken in the winter would record higher traffic noise due to
wet pavement, lack of leaves on trees, etc.

Regarding sight line issues from the second floor, Mr. Witmer commented that the
courts were moved back an additional 40 feet to address shielding issues.

Jolene Fain, 422 Kelburn, is concerned that people will use the access driveway and
parking lot as a turnaround. Ms. Fain asked if the gate will be manned and if this will
cause traffic issues or concerns for the Fire Department. Mr. Aboona does not see this
as a major concern.

Olympia Onesto, 431 Kelburn, asked if alcohol will be served because this will increase
the noise level. Mrs. Onesto also sees the potential for crazy traffic behavior. Lee
Rabman, representing the petitioner, stated that the Club does serve alcohol with an
attendant on duty which would be the case at the paddle facility.

Mary Dahl, 526 Milford Road, realizes that paddle tennis is mostly played in the winter
and asked if evergreens will be planted to shield the facility during winter months. Ms.
Dahl noted that the change in speed limit along Waukegan Road will cause safety
issues. Mr. Freedman commented that when Briarwood met with a representative
group of the homeowners, there was talk about landscape screening. Mr. Freedman
noted that additional screening on the Briarwood property would not be effective in
adding additional screening. Briarwood, did offer, at their cost to consider the possibility
of providing landscaping on the west side of Waukegan Road. Mr. Freedman feels that
to the extent that it is something that needs to be addressed, they feel that this would be
a more effective way of addressing screening. Mr. Freedman is not closed to putting
additional screening on Briarwood's side of Waukegan Road but it probably wouldn't
accomplish anything.

Elliot Schencker, of Michael Kim Associates, representing the three Coromadel
associations, commented that regarding vegetation being added, it was his
understanding that approval would have to go through Briarwood Board of Directors.
Mr. Schencker stated that there was not any agreement that Briarwood would pay for
anything from that meeting. Mr. Schencker also raised their concerns with vegetation
on the Coromandel side as opposed to vegetation on the Briarwood side. To confirm,
Mr. Schencker wanted to make it clear that there was never a formal offer to paying for
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 16

vegetation on the Coromandel side. Mr. Freedman agrees that there was no agreement
and there was no offer but it was something that Briarwood would consider.

Eddie Levine, 503 Kelburn Road, disagreed with Mr. Aboona that there will not be a
problem with the paddle tennis parking lot being used as a turnaround on Waukegan
Road. Mr. Levine believes that the parking lot would be used frequently as a
turnaround and increase traffic and creates a hazard on Waukegan Road.

Jeff Goldberg, Coromandel resident, believes that the speed limit will not be observed
on Waukegan Road. In addition, people don't use their turn signals and they sneak out
into traffic to make left turns which poses a safety issues. Mr. Goldberg feels that these
issues are not accounted for in the traffic study. Mr. Goldberg asked that assuming
there is no traffic, he does not believe that the sound will not be heard, and thinks that
the sound will be a nuisance for hours at a time.

Mr. Homan noted that from 175' there will be noise heard from the paddle courts during
breaks in traffic but it will not be a nuisance. Inside the units it will be a lot less and with
the windows closed you will not be able to hear the noise.

Jackie Alpert, 403 Milford Road, received a certified letter that there were going to be 6
courts. She would like clarification because she is now hearing 4 courts will be built.
Mr. Freedman stated that the letter was an earlier plan but there are no plans to expand
to 6 courts.

Bonnie Maraca, 431 Kelburn Road, asked if the Fire Department approved of this
project. Staff confirmed that the Fire Department has sent an approval letter. Ms.
Maraca also asked if members could enter through Deerfield Road and proceed south
on their property to access the paddle courts. Mr. Witmer stated that there is no
existing road but a cart path. If a road were created it would impede into the golf course
considerably. Ms. Maraca asked if there will be spectators. Mr. Witmer commented
that typically there are no spectators in league play. Commissioner Bromberg asked if it
is possible for a member to get dressed at the club and take a golf cart down to the
courts. Mr. Witmer noted that the game is typically played from October through March
and it wouldn't be typical of a player getting dressed at the club and taking a golf cart to
the courts. It is not unusual for the courts to be in remote areas in other clubs. Mr.
Witmer commented that there will be two restroom/dressing rooms in the warming hut.

Myron Berger, 422 Kelburn, Unit 126, asked if the sound measurements were taken
from the balls hitting the screen/fence. Mr. Homans confirmed that the noise from the
balls hitting the fence was included in his measurements.

An audience member commented on the alcoholic beverages that will be served and
the unsafe conditions that poses for those people driving in Deerfield at night.
Chairman Shapiro commented that this issue will be addressed at the continuation of
this Public Hearing.
Public Hearing & Workshop Meeting
April 26, 2012
Page 17

Lila George had a question regarding the number of courts that was requested in the
prefiling conference stating that the Plan Commission recommended 4 courts from the
proposed 2 courts at that time. Chairman Shapiro asked Ms. George to look at the
minutes from that meeting and it may be discussed at the continuation of the Public
Hearing.

Chairman Shapiro entertained a motion to continue the Public Hearing until May 24,
2012. Commissioner Bromberg made a motion to continue the public hearing to
Thursday, May 24 at 7:30 p.m. Commissioner Berg seconded and the motion passed.

There being no further discussion, motion to adjourn was made and seconded.

Respectfully submitted,
Daniel Nakahara

                               VILLAGE OF DEERFIELD

The Plan Commission of the Village of Deerfield held a Public Hearing at 7:30 P.M. on
May 24, 2012 at the Village Hall, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.

Chairman Shapiro called the hearing to order.

Continued public hearing on the request for an amendment to a Special Use for
Briarwood Country Club to permit changes to the clubhouse area and to install paddle
tennis facilities - Continued from April 26, 2012

Chairman Shapiro stated that since the April 26, 2012 meeting, Briarwood Country Club
has submitted revised plans and a summary of the sound report. Chairman Shapiro
noted that the petitioner will briefly summarize these revisions.

Mr. Peter Witmer, Architect, Witmer & Associates highlighted the changes to the plans
based on the input received at the April 26, 2012 public hearing. The first change was
relocating the paddle facility gate further from Waukegan Road and changing it from a
swing-style fence to a slide-style fence. Briarwood also added a turnaround space
outside of the gate in the unlikely event that a vehicle turned into the driveway by
mistake. The turnaround space would allow a vehicle to make a three-point turn in
order to turn around and head back out onto Waukegan Road. Mr. Witmer noted
additional landscaping (7' Arbor Vitaes) on either side to screen the parking area from
Waukegan Road. The last change is a 10' tall, solid stockade style fence that would
wrap around and be as close to the west courts as possible. The fence barrier will
reduce the sound levels coming from court play. Working with their sound consultant,
the fence will be 3-1/2' below the court surface and 6-1/2' above the court surface and
designed specifically to reduce sound.

Mr. Lawrence Freedman, Attorney with Ash, Anos, Freedman and Logan, representing
the petitioner, Briarwood Country Club, commented that the only change to the sound
report summary is the comments on the additional fence around the courts to minimize
sound.

Elliot Schencker, attorney, Michael Kim & Associates, represents Coromandel
Townhouse, Condominium and Umbrella association. Mr. Schencker recognized the
three association presidents that were in attendance. Mr. Schencker formally
expressed Coromandel's opposition to Briarwood Country Club's request to the Village
for the amendment to their Special Use for the construction of a paddle tennis facility on
the west side of Briarwood's property on Waukegan Road. Located directly west of the
proposed paddle tennis facility, they believe Coromandel is directly impacted by this
portion of the proposal. The Coromandel associations passed a resolution authorizing
Mr. Schencker and Michael Kim & Associates to voice their opposition to the proposed
paddle facility. Coromandel represents the interests of more than 400 families.
Coromandel is not impacted and take no position on the portion of Briarwood's request
on the amendment to their Special Use as to their clubhouse located on the north side
of the property on Deerfield Road. Coromandel has no objection to that part of the
proposal.

The Coromandel Association is particularly concerned with the planned installation of
the four paddle tennis courts, the installation of the 1,000 square foot warming hut and
deck, the installation of lighting poles and high intensity lamps mounted thereon to
illuminate the paddle tennis courts for night use and to illuminate an expanded parking
lot adjacent to the courts, the expansion of Briarwood's existing driveway to
accommodate additional traffic and the proposed hours of use of court play. Mr.
Schencker noted 15 hours of scheduled use per day. Mr. Schencker is an avid tennis
player and has played paddle tennis and is indeed familiar with the sound of the court
play.

Mr. Schencker referred to Village of Deerfield Zoning Ordinance Article 13; Section
13.11 D-2 which authorizes a Special Use by the Plan Commission only after the seven
standards have been met. Mr. Schencker addressed these standards as follows:

   1. Compatible with existing development. Currently, there is virtually no traffic
      coming in and out of the west access along Waukegan Road. A locked gate
      provides access to the maintenance facility and sod farm. If the paddle tennis
      courts, warming hut and parking lot are approved as located, there will be an
      expanded driveway and significantly more traffic directly across the street from
      the Coromandel Associations. Mr. Schencker noted that paddle tennis is an
      active sport and the pounding noise made from the ball hitting the hard metal
      court surface maybe considered irritating, loud and unrelenting. In addition the
      size, placement and design of the warming hut and redesigned entryway will
      disrupt the surrounding area adding a significant amount of traffic.

   2. A lot of sufficient size. While the Briarwood site is approximately 160 acres in
      size, by virtue of having limited itself to a small acreage that is voluntarily
      selected as the sole proposed site for the paddle tennis courts, warming hut and
      parking lot, Briarwood has effectively established a lot of insufficient size. The
      proposed site was selected by Briarwood for their exclusive use and benefit.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 3

      Briarwood inexplicitly chose a site located in closest proximity to the Coromandel
      Association's properties thereby increasing the probability of disruption to the
      quiet use and enjoyment of the Coromandel properties. Briarwood did this
      without consulting the residents of the Coromandel Associations before
      submitting their proposal to the Village or considering the effects of that decision.

   3. Traffic. The construction of the proposed paddle tennis facility and the expansion
      of the existing driveway will cause an increase in traffic flow to the area. Traffic
      flow during the construction period will increase when the courts are being built
      and driveway widened. The facility can accommodate 16 players and as many
      as 32 players if a second group of 16 players are waiting to play. Once
      considered a winter sport, paddle tennis can be and is played all year round with
      the hours of operations being in the early morning until late at night translating
      into a likely increase in traffic to and from the courts.

   4. Parking and Access. The proposed parking lot is to accommodate 32 players
      with 28 parking spaces. The game can be played throughout the year so regular
      traffic to and from the facility is likely to be year round. In addition, Briarwood has
      indicated that the proposed parking lot can be used for employee overflow
      parking during the summer which will also increase traffic flow into the area.
      Lighting for the parking lot will cause the area to be illuminated late at night.

   5. Effect on the Neighborhood. The proposed paddle tennis facility will have a
      detrimental effect on the surrounding community. Coromandel residents will
      have to endure noise nuisance from the sound of the ball during court play as
      well as the sound of the players themselves. These sounds are an inherent and
      unavoidable part of the paddle tennis game. Mr. Schencker noted that
      Coromandel Associations have retained sound expert David Larson of S&V
      Solutions to review testimony from acoustical engineer Brian Homans on his
      noise measurements. Mr. Larson provided a report critiquing Mr. Homans'
      findings and conclusions. This report has been submitted to the Plan
      Commission. It is Mr. Larson's expert opinion that Mr. Homans traffic
      measurements on Waukegan Road are an unjustifiably high estimate of the
      traffic noise during the peak paddle tennis hours of 7:00pm ­ 10:00pm. This is
      further supported by Mr. Alan Polikoff who testified in the April 26th meeting that
      traffic is extremely light during the 7:00pm-10:00pm period. Mr. Polikoff lives
      directly across the proposed paddle tennis facility and is the Coromandel Town
      Home Association president.

      Mr. Larson will also testify that the sound level from the paddle tennis courts has
      a high degree of uncertainty by as much as 10 decibels (dBs). Mr. Larson will
      testify that Mr. Homans noise impact due to paddle tennis activity is too low and
      that the sound will actually dissipate less than what Mr. Homans assumes. Mr.
      Larson will testify that the noise from the paddle tennis play is an inherently
      impulsive noise and will add negatively to the character of the noise intrusion of
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 4

      the Coromandel properties. Mr. Larson will also point out that Mr. Homans
      concedes that when traffic is light, the noise from the paddle tennis play will be
      even more audible from the Coromandel property.

      Mr. Schencker adds that the Coromandel Associations will have to tolerate the
      nuisance from 36 lights on 24' poles that are proposed to be installed for the
      paddle tennis facility. The Coromandel Association will be subjected to the
      unacceptable hours of operation. The original plan proposes the hours to be
      from 7:00am-10:30pm, Monday-Thursday; 7:00am-12:00 midnight, Fridays; and
      7:00am-11:00pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Proposed peak usage hours
      would be 9:00am-12:00pm and 7:00pm-10:00pm on weekdays and 8:00am-
      12:00pm on weekends. While seasonal hours are from October through March,
      Briarwood intends to use the facilities year-round.

      During the April 26th meeting, Briarwood has indicated a reduction in the hours
      from 8:00am-11:00pm each day. The Coromandel Associations still find the 15-
      hour operational periods unacceptable. The Coromandel Associations
      expressed safety hazards for adjacent properties and passing motorists with
      regard to the consumption of alcohol on the premises. Mr. Schencker noted that
      the consumption of alcohol is an integral in the social aspect of paddle tennis
      play. Mr. Schencker added that members will have keys to the facilities and
      access to the beverages during off hours when an attendant is not present.

      The Coromandel Associations also expressed safety concerns for motorists
      leaving the facility and crossing two lanes of oncoming traffic to go southbound
      on Waukegan Road. The 40mph speed limit on Waukegan Road poses a risk for
      northbound and southbound motorists looking for the entrance and slowing down
      on the busy roadway. Briarwood has attempted to deal with these safety risks
      and hazards but the Coromandel Associations feels that this has not been
      adequately addressed.

   6. Adequate facilities. Briarwood will have to connect the gas and electric from
      Waukegan Road and electric will be fed from the existing storage building
      located north of the proposed paddle tennis facility. It would seem easier to
      provide gas and electric to an area closer to the main clubhouse rather than this
      far southwest area of the Briarwood property.

   7. Adequate buffering. Briarwood's current plan is to use existing overgrown
      buckthorn and other existing vegetation to shield the facility. The Coromandel
      Associations view this buffering as inadequate and unsightly and during the
      winter months there is not enough vegetation to shield the Coromandel
      properties from the noise or the lights of the paddle tennis facility. Briarwood's
      recent supplemental plans for additional landscaping around the parking lot and
      a fence to dampen sound from the courts will not lessen the noise impact
      according to Mr. Larson.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 5

In summary, Mr. Schencker stated that the scheduled hours of operation, noise and
light nuisance and increased traffic hazards which will result from Briarwood's proposed
paddle tennis facility will have a serious detrimental effect on Coromandel Associations'
families and directly interfere with their uses and enjoyment of their property. If
Briarwood is granted the amendment to their Special Use, it will be significantly and
seriously detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the public, injurious to other
properties in the neighborhood and will diminish and impair the values of Coromandel
Association properties. The Coromandel Association families currently live across the
street from a golf course that is quiet and peaceful especially at night. They should not
have to tolerate and suffer through the sounds that Briarwood's own sound expert
concedes will be heard from across the street. The failure for Briarwood to meet the
standards set forth in the Village of Deerfield Zoning Ordinance Article 13, Section
13.11 D-2, it is the Association's position that the Briarwood Special Use must be
rejected as a matter of law. As a result, the Coromandel Associations respectfully
request that the Board of Trustees and the Plan Commission deny Briarwood's Special
Use request to the proposed improvements to the west side of its property for the
construction of paddle tennis courts, warming hut and parking lot.

Mr. Schencker called upon acoustical engineer, Mr. David Larson to formally report his
findings and testify before the Commission.

David Larson of S&V Solutions, Sycamore, Illinois refuted 5 key items from Mr. Homans
testimony at the April 26th meeting. Mr. Larson was not present at the April 26th meeting
but reviewed video of Mr. Homans' testimony and his sound report summary.

   1. Mr. Larson believes Mr. Homans estimate of traffic noise is high based on his
      assumptions of what the traffic volumes will be. During the 7:00pm-10:00pm
      hours, traffic may be lighter than his estimate. Traffic noise is not stable during
      periods of light traffic noise so it is hard to put a number on what the traffic noise
      will be at any given time.
   2. The calculated and corrected noise levels of 46 and 51dBs for the two paddle
      tennis facilities that Mr. Homans visited have a high degree of uncertainty and
      are too low. Mr. Larson believes it could be as high as 10 additional decibels.
      Mr. Larson explained that when one measures sound that is contaminated by
      background noise one introduces errors of uncertainty when unwanted
      background noise is subtracted out. The larger amount of background noise
      being subtracted, the greater the degree of uncertainty becomes.
   3. Mr. Homans' predicted noise impacts on the subject property due to paddle
      tennis activity are also too low. Mr. Homans' assumption that the sound will
      radiate freely and his rate of using 4.5-5.0 dBs of dispersion per doubling of
      distance from his memo are too high. Mr. Larson believes a more reasonable
      rate is 3-4 dBs and that sound will not dissipate as much as Mr. Homans claims.
      Free field dissipation of sound assumes a clear and open area for sound to
      travel. Hard surfaces in the sound field such as roadways or building surfaces do
      not allow the sound to dissipate but rather reflect sound causing it to continue to
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 6

      travel. The assumption of 4.5-5.0 dBs is based upon open and free radiating
      sound and Mr. Larson does not believe this is accurate based on the layout of
      the roadways and buildings.
   4. Mr. Homans testified that at times, the paddle tennis noise will be audible during
      breaks in traffic or when traffic is lighter. Mr. Larson reiterated that the traffic
      varies considerably during paddle tennis play operation hours and the sound will
      be more audible during light traffic periods.
   5. Paddle tennis noise is inherently an impulsive sound and its impulsive
      characteristic will add negatively as a noise intrusion to the subject property. The
      annoyance caused by a given noise intrusion depends primarily on the volume
      and the character of the sound. Mr. Larson used the example of a roaring
      waterfall and the sound of a police siren. Both can have the same decibel level
      and degree of loudness but a police siren is a more annoying noise. Mr. Larson
      noted the impulsive character of paddle tennis noise will increase in annoyance
      as it increases in volume.

Mr. Schencker asked Mr. Larson to describe the effect that a 10' fence sound barrier will
have on the sound coming from paddle tennis play. Mr. Larson said that a certain
amount of sound will be reflected and a certain amount of sound will flank over the
fence. Mr. Larson has experience with barrier walls especially in case of interstates and
toll way highways. It is hard to predict the effectiveness of the10' fence but factors that
help to reduce sound are the thickness of the wall, the surface material and the
frequency content of the sound that the wall is intended to screen. A proper estimation
of noise mitigation will include these characteristics as well as the distance from the
noise source and the distance from the recipients of the noise. Mr. Larson stated that
paddle tennis noise will still be audible with the installation of this wall.

Mr. Alan Polikoff, 407 Milford Road, lives across the street from the proposed paddle
tennis courts. Mr. Polikoff testified at the last meeting and just wanted to reiterate that
the traffic conditions are light along Waukegan Road during the anticipated peak hours
night hours of the paddle tennis operation.

Mr. Norton Wasserman, 412 Kelburn, Unit 213, has deep concerns for the institutional
integrity of the Plan Commission and the Board of Trustees, having served on both. His
concerns in this instance result from the proposed entry and exit way on a state
highway with a 40mph speed limit in a highly unusual location which is half a block from
a location where young children have been killed from traffic accidents. Mr. Wasserman
does not think that Briarwood's traffic expert has any regard for the principal safety of
the people who live in this community. It is Mr. Wasserman's opinion that the traffic
consultant is only interested in having the petition approved. Mr. Wasserman does not
believe that the Plan Commission could recommend this petition in good conscience
without concrete evidence that this petition is safe. He stated that the Plan Commission
has the power to hire an independent traffic consultant at the expense of the petitioner
to advise them on the safety of this petition. Mr. Wasserman implored the Commission
to exercise this right otherwise the people of this community are at risk.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club

Mr. Wasserman does not represent the Coromandel Associations but feels that his
anxieties and concerns regarding this petition does reflect the vast majority of the
Coromandel residents. Mr. Wasserman is not testifying as an expert but he has done
extensive research on paddle tennis. Mr. Wasserman has visited many sites where
paddle tennis is being played and proposed. Mr. Wasserman has no problem with the
sport or the game but does have an issue on the location on where this game is to be
played according to the Briarwood proposal.

Mr. Wasserman visited and viewed paddle tennis play at Northmoor, Lake Shore and
Lake Forest Country Club. Mr. Wasserman commented that the noise was deafening
from the court play while vocal noise was both loud and rowdy. In each instance no
more than two courts were in use at each facility. Mr. Wasserman also visited
Tennequa but paddle tennis was not being played while he was there.

Mr. Wasserman played an audio clip purchased from the internet for the Commission so
they could witness the noise emanating from paddle tennis courts. Mr. Wasserman
provided paddle tennis ball to some Commissioners and asked them to bounce the balls
to get an idea of the annoying sound that it gives off. Mr. Wasserman noted that both
the wood or metal surfaces that paddle tennis is played upon gives off a loud sound.
The ball reverberating off the metal fencing, the grunting from play and the carousing
also add the noise levels. Mr. Wasserman commented that Mr. Homans stated that the
loudest noises come from the ball reverberating off the metal fencing that surrounds the
courts.

Mr. Wasserman pointed out Briarwood testimony which stated that there was not going
to be any paddle tennis tournaments although the traffic study report states that there
will be tournaments at the facility. Tournament play will bring many spectators who will
be served drinks and will be noisy. In addition the length of the matches and the length
of the rallies give off a constant annoying noise. Mr. Wasserman compared the paddle
tennis hours of operation with the noise ordinance and sees an inconsistency on how
construction noise is handled and wonders how paddle tennis noise should be handled.
The sound ordinance does not allow construction noise after 7:00pm on weekdays and
5:00pm on Saturdays. No construction noise is allowed on Sundays and legal holidays.
Mr. Wasserman commented that these hours are a good rule of thumb. Mr.
Wasserman also doesn't want to dismiss the alcohol issue.

Mr. Wasserman believes the impact of the 10' stockade fence will have minimal effect
on noise and noted that there was no real explanation on how it was supposed to work.
Mr. Wasserman also noted that if train noise is being taken into consideration as noted
by Mr. Homans, then sound measurements should also be taken for thunder and rain as
well. The impulsive noise from paddle tennis play is an artificial intrusion that he should
not have to live with.

Mr. Wasserman displayed photos taken in March by Village Staff of the buckthorn and
other vegetation that currently screen the proposed paddle tennis facility location. The
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 8

image is taken directly across the street on Coromandel property that is not bermed Mr.
Wasserman explained that the importance of this photograph is that it shows how bare
the buckthorn gets in the winter months and at a time when paddle tennis is being
played. The image displayed the ability to see through the buckthorn and into the
Briarwood property resulting in no visual buffering. Mr. Wasserman asked the
Commission to imagine this image at night with artificial light shining through the
buckthorn and the distraction it would cause on Waukegan Road.

Mr. Wasserman commented that Briarwood has distorted this proposal by building a 10'
sound barrier fence that only screens the two west ends of the two west courts while
leaving the other two courts completely exposed.

Briarwood is also widening their driveway which opens their property to the unbermed
portion of the Coromandel property. Mr. Wasserman commented that the cross-section,
prepared at the request of the Plan Commission, did not have any measurements and
does not accurately depict the location. The cross-section is irrelevant and a diversion.
Mr. Wasserman also commented that the assumption that the sound from paddle tennis
play will not be heard because of the ambient noise of traffic is not true. There is large
difference between averaging ambient noise and impulsive noise as Mr. Larson
testified. Mr. Wasserman used different examples to highlight this point.

Mr. Wasserman also stated that when he served on the Plan Commission, he recalled
the Carson's restaurant wanting approval to have outdoor seating. The issue came up
that the noise from Waukegan Road would be offensive to their customers and the
restaurant refuted that there is no traffic after 7:00pm. Mr. Wasserman reminded the
Commission that peak paddle tennis play begins at 7:00pm and there will not be traffic
to block out the noise from the paddle tennis courts. Mr. Wasserman noted that the
sound report and the traffic study stated that traffic would not be steady during peak
hours and that it is fair to assume that traffic will not block out paddle tennis noise.

Mr. Wasserman noted Mr. Witmer's original submission that paddle tennis foot noise
and play is in the range of 55-60 dBs. This is a direct contradiction from Mr. Homans
testimony in which he states that there are no literature on paddle tennis noise.

Mr. Wasserman called into question Briarwood's noise study which was done after
Briarwood had a meeting with Coromandel representatives in which Briarwood realized
that the residents were concerned about the noise from paddle tennis. Mr. Wasserman
noted that Mr. Homans measurement of paddle tennis play at 46 dB level at night (after
10pm) based on two courts at Northmoor is in direct violation of the state law limit of 44
dBs at night.

It is hard to predict where sound will go and Mr. Wasserman believes that it is
reasonable to assume that the sound may be deflected from the proposed sound barrier
fence and be displaced further into the Coromandel property.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012

Mr. Wasserman stressed that an independent traffic analysis is needed in this case to
address the apparent safety issues in this location especially the entry and exiting out of
the widened driveway.

Mr. Wasserman reported on his research of paddle tennis courts in other communities.
He mentioned the Green Acres community that wanted to construct paddle tennis
courts on a two residential lots but was rejected because it made the adjacent property
unsaleable. This did not get approved even though the adjacent property owner signed
off and approved of the construction.

The Northmoor and Lake Shore Country Club constructed their paddle tennis facilities
away from residential districts. The Lake Forest Country Club paddle tennis courts are
approximately a half mile from an apartment building. The courts are surrounded by
berms with evergreens. The courts are not visible from the apartment complex nor are
the apartment building visible from the courts.

Glenview is pending an application to construct paddle tennis courts on park district
property. The courts are mostly surrounded by public lands except for one area which
has multi-family residential units. At a public hearing, 14 residents voiced their concern
on noise and visual pollution. The Glenview Park District responsibly submitted a plan
with 3-5' berms surrounding the courts and a double row of evergreens on top of the
berms.

Hinsdale built paddle tennis courts in a public park that borders Burr Ridge. The Burr
Ridge neighbors complained to Hinsdale about the noise from the paddle tennis courts
and the two communities fought this issue for a year and a half. The issue turned
political and has resulted in a formal intergovernmental agreement.

Mr. Wasserman commented on an informal poll taken by the Deerfield Review on the
construction of Briarwoods paddle tennis courts and its results as of 5:00pm, May 24,
2013. The breakdown of the four possible answers as reported by Mr. Wasserman:

195 people replied:   Don't want the courts
16 people replied:    Can't wait to play.
1 person replied:     More protections are needed.
6 people replied:     Don't have a strong opinion.

Mr. Wasserman displayed video of paddle tennis play. Due to time constraints Mr.
Wasserman was not able to comment on the Special Use criteria.

Mr. Wasserman's closed his presentation with an emotional comment on how the noise
from the paddle tennis courts will deny him the peace and serenity of the special
religious rituals he shares with his wife.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 10

Andrew Marwick, 442 Kelburn, put into perspective that this pales in comparison to the
types of issues he has dealt with in his life. Mr. Marwick faces Brickyards Park and the
light poles that illuminate the park's soccer fields. These light towers are taller and
higher intensity. He does not know what time the lights are turned off but they have
never bothered him. Mr. Marwick commented that approximately 7 town home units are
within 400 feet of the proposed paddle tennis courts. Mr. Marwick lives less than 400
feet from the Coromandel tennis courts and in the three years that he has lived there he
has never heard the sound of the ball, the racquet or the spectators from the courts.
Mr. Marwick has heard a lot of trains and train whistles but it is just part of living in
Deerfield. He believes that no matter where you go, one cannot escape noise. Mr.
Marwick believes that light shielding can be improved in this case. The only real issue
that Mr. Marwick sees is in the southbound vehicles stopping on Waukegan Road to
turn left into the Briarwood entryway. The 40 mph speed limit does pose a safety
hazard. An easy solution to this would be to not allow left turns into the entryway.

Peter Whitaker, 388 Milford Road, lives within 500' of the proposed paddle tennis
courts. Mr. Whitaker is concerned about the traffic safety and noted that the fatalities
that took place in the immediate area were motorists waiting to turn across traffic at a
signaled intersection. The combination of motorists turning across traffic to go into the
Briarwood entryway without traffic signals and the increase in speed limit in this section
of Waukegan Road provide a strong probability for an accident to occur.

Mr. Freedman commented on Mr. Larson's report. Mr. Freedman noted that he did not
seen any sound measurement taken by Mr. Larson and therefore the only scientific
evidence on the ambient conditions and the paddle tennis sound remains in Mr.
Homans report.

Mr. Freedman also refuted Mr. Larson's first point that it was not clear from Mr. Homans
testimony what the traffic levels were during the test. Mr. Larson also referred to Mr.
Aboona's report that peak traffic time was 7:00pm. Mr. Freedman clarified that Mr.
Homans' background measurements were taken at specific times after 7:00pm. Mr.
Homans took measurements between 8:25pm-8:45pm on Thursday, April 19, 2012 and
measured higher traffic measurements on the previous night between 9:30pm-10:00pm
on Wednesday, April 18, 2012.

In respect to Mr. Larson's second point, Mr. Larson states that Mr. Homans testified that
there was considerable traffic at both Lake Forest Country Club and Northmoor Country
Club. This was not accurate; traffic noise only existed at the Lake Forest courts
because of its proximity to US-41. Mr. Homans also commented that at Northmoor
measurements could be conducted between passing cars. Further Mr. Homans
testified that the readings were corrected to separate the sound generated from paddle
tennis activity from the ambient traffic sound. Mr. Larson states that corrected
measurements have a high degree of uncertainty especially when the background noise
is higher than the noise of interest. Mr. Freedman again commented that Mr. Homans
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 11

concluded that in periods of traffic noise the sound from paddle tennis will be less
audible or, depending on the position of the listener, perhaps inaudible.

Mr. Larson stated that 5 dB per doubling of distance is an inappropriate standard
because it assumes a free field or simple field of sound which Mr. Larson stated may
not be the case. Mr. Larson also testified that a free field is not achieved when dealing
with roads and buildings. Mr. Freedman commented that with the exception of the
roadways there is a clear field, there are no other buildings, the condominiums are the
buildings. Mr. Freedman also noted that the addition of the sound barrier fence is in
response to sound concerns. Mr. Freedman also noted that Mr. Homans testified a
factor of 4.5 bB of doubling of distance and not 5.0 dB as stated by Mr. Larson.

The fourth point that Mr. Larson submitted was that the Illinois Pollution Control Board
Standard is not appropriate to use when evaluating whether or not there will be a noise
impact. Mr. Homans never stated that the Illinois Pollution Control Board was
determinative of whether there was an impact. Mr. Homans testified that Deerfield did
not have a numerical standard of what constitutes a legally impermissible level of sound
and Deerfield under its ordinances relied on the nuisance factor. Mr. Homans cited the
state standard to give a numerical reference point to show that Briarwood would not be
in violation of the law but never suggested the sound would be inaudible. Mr. Larson
also states that it is not clear to him that the paddle tennis noise levels will violate the
state standard. Mr. Larson did not take any sound measurements that would indicate
that Mr. Homans sound measurements were incorrect.

In Mr. Larson's fifth point he cited statements taken from Mr. Homans testimony that
were taken out of context and not accurate. Mr. Freedman states Mr. Homans never
suggested that there wouldn't be sound that would be heard but did point out that there
would be a diminishing level of sound that would be heard depending on one's distance
and location from the paddle courts.

Mr. Freedman closed his comments by citing the Deerfield Comprehensive Plan that a
continued use of the Briarwood property as a golf course is a strong goal of the Village.
Mr. Freedman stated that for Briarwood to carry on as a golf course it needs to continue
to evolve and remain relevant to its current and future members. Mr. Freedman
commented that Briarwood has addressed the criteria for a Special Use and essentially
that standards are judged as to whether or not the use of the proposed property as
balanced against the right of the petitioner and the right of neighbors is reasonable.
Briarwood has continued to modify its plan to address these issues. Mr. Freedman
stated that the testimony from the last meeting supplemented by tonight's testimony
establishes:
     There are sufficient utilities on the site to serve this proposed use.
     All lighting will be zero foot-candles at the property line.
     The widened access drive will function appropriately and that the traffic
       generated from this use will be exceedingly light.
     That the parking lot will be sufficient to accommodate this use.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012

       Briarwood takes the position that the sound generated from the paddle tennis
       courts will be in the permissible legal standard during the day and nighttime use.
       This was the case before the sound fence was added to the plan. The sound will
       only be heard in the yards by the closest homes during breaks in traffic and less
       or inaudible in those homes if the windows are closed. The sound will also be
       inaudible in the homes farther away with their windows closed.
       The Special Use standards deal with the impact on the neighborhood. Mr.
       Freedman noted that the neighborhood is surrounded by a number of non-
       residential uses each producing significant intrusions of light and sound;
       Waukegan Road, Rosebud Restaurant, soccer fields, the fire station and the
       train. Mr. Freedman believes that as sincere the concerns of the neighbors are,
       it is not overcome by the expert testimony Briarwood has presented which
       conclusively supports Briarwood's position that they have met all of the required
       standards for the Special Use.

Chairman Shapiro asked the Commission if there were any questions for the petitioner
or Coromandel.

Commissioner Bromberg asked if children or teenagers are going to be using the courts
and are they going to be supervised.

Leigh Rabman, member of Briarwood Country Club, stated that there is not a defined
program for children as of yet, but children will be encouraged to play and will be
accompanied by their parents, other adults or a professional. Alcohol will be served
only under the supervision of an attendant and will be locked up at all times. Mr.
Freedman noted a plan for minors has not been formulated yet but he envisions a
separate program will be offered to minors.

Commissioner Bromberg asked if Coromandel representatives have talked to residents
living near the Tennaqua paddle tennis courts about their experiences with those courts.
There was no comment.

Commissioner Berg asked Mr. Aboona if he had traffic counts for Waukegan Road
during the weekdays and weekends. Mr. Aboona stated that Waukegan Road carries
approximately 30,000 vehicles on a daily basis. Data gathered for this traffic study
calculated 2,000 peak hour trips in each direction. Commissioner Berg asked Mr.
Aboona if he was able to address the traffic concerns of motorists crossing oncoming
lanes of traffic to enter into or exit out of the widened driveway. Mr. Aboona noted that
vehicles turning into the driveway by mistake have been addressed with the gate being
pushed back and allowing vehicles to make a three point turn to exit. Mr. Aboona
reiterated that this is a low impact facility in regards to traffic and most of the activities
would occur after 6:00pm or 7:00pm when traffic is reduced. Mr. Aboona's analysis
shows that there will be adequate gaps for vehicles to make the turns and does not see
conflict for the traffic on Waukegan Road.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 13

Commissioner Shayman asked if there will be a light or illuminated sign at the driveway
to identify the site at night since paddle tennis will be played at night. Mr. Freedman
noted that if this is a concern they put in a lit sign.

Chairman Shapiro asked if the proposed sign is visible from the street with the gate
being pushed back from Waukegan Road. Mr. Witmer stated that the sign is in its
original location and is parallel to Waukegan Road. Mr. Freedman said the sign can be
reoriented or perpendicular to Waukegan Road and lit to make it more visible.

Chairman Shapiro asked Mr. Aboona if landscaping will have to be removed to provide
proper sight lines with the new driveway and if so will this take away from the vegetation
that acts as screening. Mr. Aboona confirmed that some vegetation will have to be
moved but it will not take away from the screening because the sight lines are closer to
Waukegan Road. Chairman Shapiro was still concerned because the landscaping
closest to Waukegan Road also provides a natural buffering to Briarwood, and if this is
removed he questioned if the buffering will be compromised. Briarwood displayed an
image of the site plan to illustrate the minor changes to the vegetation to provide proper
sight lines.

Commissioner Moyer asked if a berm was considered. Mr. Witmer stated that the lack
of space to make the berm effective in the area made it difficult to consider. The
addition of the sound fence became a more meaningful solution. Commissioner Moyer
asked Mr. Witmer if Briarwood is willing to modify their plan. Mr. Freedman commented
that they can look at it again if this proposal is approved.

Chairman Shapiro asked about the tournaments. Mr. Freedman corrected Mr.
Aboona's report and the use of the term tournaments. Mr. Freedman clarified that
matches with other clubs will be played and not tournaments. Chairman Shapiro asked
if the matches will be within their normal paddle tennis hours. Mr. Witmer stated that
match or series play will be on set days and times within their normal paddle tennis
hours. There will not be any bleachers at the facility.

Chairman Shapiro wanted clarification on the hours of operation and how it compares to
the Park District hours. Mr. Freedman stated that hours are 8:00am ­ 11:00pm.
Commissioner Bromberg commented that the lights at Jewett Park stay on until
11:00pm.

Commissioner Shayman asked the acoustical engineers how the sound from paddle
tennis compares to regular tennis. Mr. Homans' experience is that paddle tennis sound
is less impulsive than regular tennis because the paddle tennis ball is softer and paddle
tennis does not use a solid surface. Commissioner Shayman asked if the proposed
stockade fence is the best way to mitigate the sound. Mr. Homans commented that the
chief concern when building a fence is wind loading. Once the fence is above 2 or 3
lbs. per square foot it will not make a difference as far as stability. Mr. Larson concurred
that up to a certain point, adding additional mass does not improve the performance of
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012
Page 14

the fence. Mr. Larson noted that if a sound barrier fence is built it creates a shadow
zone which will reduce noise near the barrier but then shifts the noise farther out.
Commissioner Shayman asked if there is any benefit to increasing the height of the
fence. Mr. Larson noted that increasing the height of the fence will increase the length
of the shadow zone. Mr. Larson reiterated that to make the barrier effective the
distance of the noise source from the barrier and the distance of the receiving properties
from the barrier have to be taken into account. Mr. Larson doesn't believe the fence
barrier is the solution because the condo buildings are too far and the noise source is to
close. The only thing that will be protected from the sound is Waukegan Road. Mr.
Homans commented that the fence is very close to the noise source which is the
optimal situation. Mr. Larson agreed that this will increase the effectiveness but
questioned the proximity of the barrier to the noise source. Both Mr. Larson and Mr.
Homan noted that there are computer-based programs to calculate the effectiveness
based on this geometry. Commissioner Shayman asked if there is a practical way to
simulate the noise with the wall and hear the effectiveness on the Coromandel
properties. Mr. Homans stated that the best way is to listen in at a quiet area and stand
175' away from paddle tennis play which is what he did at Northmoor.

Commissioner Moyer asked the acoustical engineers if a fence barrier or a berm was
more effective. Mr. Larson stated that his preference would be a berm with vegetation
based on his experience with traffic noise. Mr. Larson strongly suggests running a
computer simulation to determine the effectiveness the proposed fence barrier.

Commissioner Nadler asked Mr. Larson if the measured paddle tennis sound is within
the legal standard. Mr. Larson does not believe it is within the legal standard because
state guidelines dictate that at 10:00pm, 44 dBs is allowed to impinge on a residential
property line and Mr. Homans' testimony is that the sound will be between 46­51 dBs.

Mr. Homans stated that his measurements are within the legal limits because the noise
at the source due to traffic will exceed the noise from paddle tennis play. Commissioner
Nadler asked what was the noise level that will be emitted from the paddle tennis play in
decibels and how does that apply to the legal standard. Mr. Homans stated the noise
level would be between 46-51dBs. The legal standard during the day is 55 dBs and at
night it is 44 dBs. Commissioner Nadler asked Mr. Homans if the tested sound is within
the legal limits at night. Mr. Homans stated that it would be over the legal limits at night
if there were no other noises in the area. Mr. Homans further stated that it is within the
legal limits because there are other noises in the area. Commissioner Nadler just
wanted to confirm that after 10:00pm the sound would be over the legal standard if
there were no other noises in the area. Mr. Homans confirmed this statement.

Commissioner Berg asked the acoustic experts if there were other data on other noise
intrusions in the area such as fire trucks, trains, etc. Mr. Larson commented it depends
on the proximity to the noise source.
Continued Public Hearing: Briarwood Country Club
May 24, 2012

Commissioner Nadler asked the petitioner if they would be willing to reduce their hours
of operation from 11:00pm to 10:00pm. Mr. Freedman thinks the minimum would be
10:30pm but if the Commission makes this a condition, Briarwood would take it to it
Board of Trustees. Commissioner Moyer noted that Tennaqua is open until 10:00pm.
Commissioner Nadler voiced his concern with the ambiguity of Briarwood meeting the
legal standards for sound.

Chairman Shapiro said that a condition can be attached to the Plan Commission
recommendation if a vote is to be taken this evening but any use must comply with
Village ordinances. Mr. Ryckaert confirmed that any use must comply with Village
ordinances and state law.

A motion was made to close the public hearing at 10:10pm. The motion was seconded.

Respectfully submitted,
Daniel Nakahara
Workshop Meeting

Discussion of recommendation for Briarwood Country Club

Commissioner Moyer believes a berm should be a consideration and the hours of
operation should be reduced to 8:00am ­ 10:00pm. Commissioner Moyer is also
concerned about the traffic safety and believes that there should be a right in and right
out only at the driveway.

Commissioner Shayman sees main three issues; lighting, traffic and noise.
Commissioner Shayman does not have a problem with the lighting. Commissioner
Shayman feels the shielding at the paddle tennis facility will decrease any spillover in
comparison to the street lights on Waukegan Road with no shielding. The traffic is a
concern especially turning left out of the driveway. Commissioner Shayman's biggest
concern is noise and does not want to introduce an additional nuisance. The conflicting
testimony on the impact of sound is unsettling and there is concern for noise during
early morning play. The reduction of operational hours will help this issue.

Commissioner Bromberg has two friends that live very close to the Tennaqua paddle
tennis courts. Commissioner Bromberg commented that these residents do not have
any issue with the noise and felt so strongly about it that they mentioned that they would
testify if need be. Commissioner Bromberg did not have any concerns about lighting.
Commissioner Bromberg pointed out that this driveway is not unique, that there are
numerous driveways similar to this on Waukegan Road. Commissioner Bromberg does
not have any issues with the proposal.

Commissioner Nadler commented that personal opinions about sound and light should
be put aside and it is the Commission's job to look at this objectively by going through
the standards that need to be met for a Special Use.

Commissioner Nadler struggles with the effect on the neighborhood and the detrimental
affect it may or may not have on home values. In terms of compatibility, lot of sufficient
size, parking and access Commissioner Nadler has no issues. In terms of traffic, the
driveway is a legal drive and if anything it will be improved in its width and visibility.
Commissioner Nadler agrees with Commissioner Bromberg that this driveway access is
not unique on Waukegan Road. It is Commissioner Nadler's opinion that there is no
other choice but to recommend as long as the sound is within the legal limits. There is
an inherit risk to owning property on a major thoroughfare even though this was not
foreseen. Commissioner Nadler does believe that Briarwood explored other areas on
their property to put these courts. In terms of visibility, Commissioner Nadler does
believe that some of the glow from the lights will be visible but does not see a reason to
deny the petition if the requirements have been met. Commissioner Nadler stated that
he recommends that the hours of operation should be reduced to 10:00pm.

Mr. Freedman stated Briarwood will reduce their paddle tennis hours to 10:00pm.
Workshop Meeting

At the risk of being repetitive, Commissioner Berg commented that Commissioner
Nadler's comments were of the same nature as his. Commissioner Berg respects the
passion exhibited during this process. Commissioner Berg noted that we live in an
established community and is troubled that people lose sight of this reality.
Commissioner Berg noted that paddle tennis is a sport and sports should be
encouraged by the community. This seems to be consistent with the Coromandel
property in that they have a tennis court, basketball court, volleyball court, playground
and a swimming pool that all produce noise. Commissioner Berg assumes these
fixtures are acceptable because they have not been removed since its inception.

Commissioner Berg noted that the use is compatible and is on a lot of sufficient size.
Commissioner Berg does not see a conflict with traffic, parking or access.
Commissioner Berg believes people will adjust to the entry and exit driveway as they
have with other businesses along Waukegan Road. Commissioner Berg does not see a
detrimental effect on the health, safety or welfare to the general public or a drain on the
facilities for this proposed use. Commissioner Berg believes that the petitioner has
made a good faith effort by modifying their plan to screen the facilities. Commissioner
Berg believes that the petitioner has satisfied the requirements for a Special Use.

Chairman Shapiro commented on the area of the proposed Special Use and believes
that everyone must look at the bigger picture and the context of the community that we
live in. Deerfield is a mature built out community and not in the woods.

Chairman Shapiro would like to see the signage be more prominent because it is
currently tucked in. Chairman Shapiro would also like to see additional landscaping
especially for the winter time when the trees are barren and the players are out playing.
Chairman Shapiro made this a suggestion and not a condition but believes this would
go a long way. Chairman Shapiro would like Briarwood to consider reducing the hours
to 10:00 pm. He feels this is important because it would meet the sound state statute
for noise and for the neighbors across the street. Chairman Shapiro also believes it
would be consistent with some of the Park District hours. Overall this 1 hour operational
reduction should not be disruptive to the Briarwood plan.

Chairman Shapiro applauded everyone who came out and spoke over the last two
meetings but he reiterated they must go by the standards and Chairman Shapiro
believes that the standards have been met. Chairman Shapiro noted that this
Commission does not rule by polling but rather they rule by standards and the context in
which a petition is given to the Commission. Chairman Shapiro commented that this
institution is strong and it will stay strong with the talented individuals that make up this
Commission. The integrity of this Commission has not been called into question and he
applauded the Commissioner for their thoughtfulness.

Commissioner Berg made a motion to approve the amendment to a Special Use for
Briarwood Country Club to permit changes to the clubhouse area and to install paddle
tennis facilities as further described in the petition subject to the additional restriction of

ceasing play with lights out at 10:00pm. Commissioner Bromberg seconded the motion
and the vote was as follows:

Yes: (6) Berg, Bromberg, Moyer, Nadler Shayman, Shapiro
Nays: (0) None

The next Plan Commission meeting will be June 14, 2012 at 7:30pm.

There being no further discussion, motion to adjourn was made and seconded.

The Plan Commission of the Village of Deerfield held a Workshop Meeting at 7:30 P.M.
on March 22, 2012 at the Village Hall, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois.

In the absence of the Chairman, Mr. Ryckaert explained that the Commissioners must
appoint a Chairman Pro Tem. A motion to elect Commissioner Nadler as Chairman Pro
Tem was made and seconded. The motion was passed on a voice vote. Chairman Pro
Tem Nadler called the meeting to order.

Present were:       Robert Nadler, Chairman Pro Tem
                    Larry Berg

Public Comment on a Non-Agenda Item

Chairman Pro Tem Nadler asked if anyone in the audience would like to comment on a
non-agenda item. There was no comment from the audience.

Prefiling conference on the request for an amendment to a Special Use for Briarwood
Country Club.

Mr. Larry Freedman, Attorney with Ash, Anos Freedman and Logan, explained
Briarwood Country Club's goal is to improve the facility and become more relevant in
the community. He said they want to upgrade the exterior of the club house and add a
paddle facility.

Mr. Peter Witmer, Architect, Witmer & Associates, reviewed each of the proposed
improvements. He explained they are proposing to enhance the existing Deerfield
Road entrance with new 4' high illuminated ground signs on either side of the driveway.
They do not have signage details at this time, but they anticipate architectural concrete
signs with stainless steel letters. Along Deerfield Road Briarwood is proposing a hedge
row of landscaping. Their plans show fencing along Deerfield Road, but they are no
longer planning on installing fencing as it will not be seen behind the hedge row. Mr.
Witmer noted the Village will be making major improvements to Deerfield Road in 2014
and to the public sidewalk in 2013. The applicants prefer to install the landscaping after
the Village completes the Deerfield Road improvements in 2014. Briarwood's entrance
Workshop Meeting
March 22, 2012
Page 2

driveway will be improved by a row of trees and a hedge row on both sides of the
driveway. There will be a reworked drop-off area including a golf bag drop-off in front of
the club house which will also provide adequate room for emergency vehicle access.
On the north side of the club house, they will maintain the existing canopy and extend a
handicapped ramp. Around the pool they are proposing new landscaping, a new deck,
and a new dining area.

Mr. Witmer said they want to install a cooling tower to the northwest of the club house.
The 8' tall cooling tower would be located about 30' from the west property line and
would be enclosed by a fence. Commissioner Shayman asked if it will be noisy and
asked how the petitioners decided on a 30' setback. Mr. Witmer said the enclosure will
help lessen the noise impacts on the neighboring property owner. He said the proposed
30' foot setback is beyond the greatest residential side yard setback requirements in
Deerfield, so they felt it was sufficient. He said there may be room to move it a little
further from the lot line. Mr. Witmer said he will find out what the decibel level of the
cooling tower would be at the lot line.

Mr. Witmer explained the two proposed additions to the club house. They are creating a
450 square foot addition to men's lounge area and a 3,707 square foot addition to the
terrace. The existing upper terrace will be extended and a lower terrace will be added.
He presented the building elevations and some renderings showing the massing of the
proposed new additions. Some existing windows and doors on club house building will
be replaced.

A new paddle facility is proposed to be located south of the existing maintenance facility
off Waukegan Road. The existing parking area for the maintenance facility will be
reconfigured and expanded to provide parking for the paddle facility. Currently a sod
farm is located where the paddle facility will be. They intend to keep the existing brush
and buckthorn along Waukegan Road to provide screening. He said they are proposing
two paddle courts and a warming hut, and in the future they may seek approval of four
additional paddle courts. The two paddle courts they are seeking approval for at this
time are set back 25' from the west property line. The warming hut is set back 92' from
the west property line. Mr. Witmer explained they have chosen this location for the
paddle facility because they believe it will have the least impact on the neighboring
properties, the location works well for the club and it allows them room for future
expansion.

Mr. Witmer explained paddle tennis is a doubles game, so there would be a maximum
of four people per court. The game is typically played from late morning through
evening. There will be eight box lights for each court. The light output will be 30 foot-
candles on the court and will be zero at the lot line. He said they will have a
photometrics plan for the public hearing.

Mr. Witmer explained the paddle hut will be one room with a kitchenette and two
handicapped accessible bathrooms. The hut will have a hipped roof with asphalt
Workshop Meeting
March 22, 2012
Page 3

shingles and overhangs. The hut will be wood frame with siding and large windows to
provide viewing of the courts. The floor of the building will be raised up about 1' from
the deck to allow for better viewing.

Commissioner Shayman asked the petitioners to review the Deerfield Road screening.
Mr. Witmer said they will provide a landscape screen and no fencing. Commissioner
Berg asked if the existing Deerfield Road landscape screening will be removed. Mr.
Witmer said they will leave the current landscaping of brush and buckthorn in place until
the Village's Deerfield Road improvements are complete in 2014. Once the roadway
and sidewalk improvements are finished, Briarwood will remove the existing
landscaping and install a hedge row as shown on the plan. Commissioner Shayman
asked if there will be landscaping changes along Deerfield Road, east of the parking lot.
Mr. Witmer said the existing brush landscape screening will remain in that area.

Commissioner Shayman asked if the petitioners must comply with the tree ordinance.
Mr. Ryckaert and Ms. LéVeque said that because the property is zoned residentially,
Briarwood must comply with the tree ordinance. Mr. Witmer said they are removing
some trees, but they are planting many new trees too, so they believe they will be in
compliance with the tree ordinance. Chairman Pro Tem Nadler asked if they will be
losing any trees by the paddle facility. Mr. Witmer said one tree will be lost by the
paddle facility.

Chairman Pro Tem Nadler asked how much the Waukegan Road driveway will be
expanded. Mr. Witmer said at the curb cut, the driveway will be widened about 3' to 4'.
Chairman Pro Tem Nadler asked if it is legal to make a left turn into the facility from
Waukegan Road, since the road is marked with a double yellow stripe. Mr. Witmer said
the left turn is legal. He said currently the parking lot is used for the maintenance facility
and staff and it is occasionally used for tractor-trailer loading.

Chairman Pro Tem Nadler asked the petitioners if they could install the first two paddle
courts on the east side of the warming hut, rather than the west side, so in the event
Briarwood only installs two courts, the courts will be further from the neighbors. Mr.
Witmer said it is quite likely Briarwood will seek approval for a total of four paddle
courts, and he doubts they will seek approval for all six. Commissioner Moyer asked
the petitioners why they are not seeking approval for four courts at this time, if they
believe they will ultimately want approval for four. Mr. Freedman suggested that
Briarwood request approval for all four paddle courts at this time, and agree to install
the east two courts first and the west two courts later when the country club is ready for
them. Commissioner Berg said his concerns with the paddle facility are the light and
sound impacts on the neighbors. Mr. Freedman said they will be prepared to address
that at the public hearing.

Commissioner Berg asked if the courts will be lit all the time or only when in use. Mr.
Witmer said the courts will only be lit when in use. Each court will have lights on a
timer. Chairman Pro Tem Nadler believes it would make sense for the petitioners to ask
Workshop Meeting
March 22, 2012
Page 4

for four paddle courts at this time, since they know they will want at least four of them.
Commissioner Shayman asked the petitioners to examine the buffer that is provided to
the west and how the lighting from the fixtures will impact the neighbors. Commissioner
Berg asked if the screening is mostly buckthorn and asked if there are any substantial
trees. Mr. Witmer said the screening is mostly buckthorn and he believes there is one
substantial tree, which they will try to save. He said they can provide a cross section
drawing showing the view of the new paddle facility with the screening in place.
Commissioner Shayman suggested they provide a cross section drawing showing the
view from the second story of a Coromandel home. Chairman Pro Tem Nadler asked if
the brush will be thinned at all for the paddle facility; the petitioners said it will largely
remain in place.

Commissioner Shayman asked if there will be parking lot lighting at the paddle facility.
Mr. Witmer said they will need to install two lights in the parking lot and they will provide
the lighting details at the public hearing. Chairman Pro Tem Nadler asked if there will
be any signage at the Waukegan Road entrance. The petitioners said there will not be
signage except possibly "Private Club" or similar type of sign; the entrance will be low
key. Commissioner Berg asked if there will be gates at the Waukegan Road entrance;
the petitioners said there will not.

Commissioner Berg asked if the petitioners will have information at the public hearing
indicating how many vehicles are expected to come and go from the paddle facility. Mr.
Freedman said they have retained KLOA. Mr. Witmer noted they will base their traffic
and parking data on having four paddle courts and they would like to base the study on
the times they expect the paddle courts to be used, which is after the morning rush hour
through evening.

For the public hearing, Commissioner Berg said the traffic study and the cross section
showing the view from Coromandel should be addressed. Chairman Pro Tem Nadler
suggested the petitioners provide an aerial image with the proposed new paddle
facilities superimposed on it so the Plan Commission and the public can visualize
exactly where the paddle courts and hut will be located. He noted some concern about
cars on Waukegan Road making a left turn into the paddle facility, but noted it will not
be a high traffic use. Chairman Pro Tem Nadler agreed a depiction of the view from
Coromandel will be important and he asked if the petitioners could include something
showing the view at night when the courts are lit.

Commissioner Shayman commented that with four paddle courts, providing only 26
parking spaces may not be sufficient. He noted the parking lot needs to accommodate
up to 16 players at one time (4 players on a court x 4 courts = 16 players), plus during
the turnover period, 16 new players may arrive on-site to await their turns, and
employees will be parking for the maintenance facility. Mr. Witmer said they will make
sure the parking works and he noted no large paddle tournaments will be held at the
facility.

Commissioner Berg asked about fire and police review. Mr. Ryckaert explained the Fire
Department will need to review and approve the plans and the Planning staff will share
the plans with the Police Department.

A public hearing date for this petition has not been scheduled.

There being no further discussion, motion to adjourn was made and seconded.

Comprehensive Plan

PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE WAYS

Bicycles and other non-motorized modes of transportation
are used for transportation to schools, parks, shopping, jobs,
and the train station, as well as for recreation and exercise.
In addition, bicycles are non-polluting and take very little
room to park. However, the routes traveled by cyclists are
essentially the same as those traveled by automobiles and
resulting conflicts are very inconvenient and often
dangerous. Walking has increased as a pleasurable activity
pursued by an increasing number of Village residents,
thereby intensifying the dual use of sidewalks. The Village
should encourage the dual use of the Village's sidewalks by
pedestrians and cyclists by eliminating dangers and
inconveniences as much as possible while protecting the
rights and safety of pedestrians. Existing and proposed
bicycle paths are shown in Figure 3.7: Bicycle Plan.

Goal: Encourage and provide a safe and convenient
environment for the pedestrian and bicyclist.

                                              possible while protecting the rights and safety
                                              of pedestrians; The highest priority is the
                                              sidewalk/bike path along the south side of
                                              Deerfield Road from Waukegan Road to the
                                              east border of Deerfield.

                                              Consider installation of separate bike paths
                                              along heavily traveled routes whenever
                                              conditions and finances permit.

                                              Install dual function sidewalks if separate
                                              bike paths are not possible; the highest
                                              priority is the sidewalk/bike path along the
                                              south side of Deerfield Road from Waukegan
                                              Road to the east border of Deerfield.

                                              Work to install sidewalks on the north side of
                                              Lake Cook Road from Waukegan Road to
                                              Carlisle Avenue and on the east side of
                                              Waukegan Road from Lake Cook Road to
                                              Longfellow.

                                          Work to connect Deerfield's dual function
                                          sidewalks to the pedestrian and bicycle ways of
                                          adjacent communities, and to provide dual
                                          function sidewalks, where appropriate, into all
                                          parks and school grounds.

                                          Install sidewalks in all instances along
                                          Waukegan Road where the sidewalk does not
                                          extend across the parkway to provide access to
                                          the street pavement.

                                          Encourage Metra to keep all crossings in safe
                                          condition, including the pedestrian and bicycle
                                          crossing at Telegraph Road.


 Maintain sidewalks in a safe condition   Require that bushes and trees adjacent to
 for use by cyclists and pedestrians.     sidewalks are kept trimmed so that they do not
                                          extend across the public right-of-way or hang so
                                          low over the right-of-way so as to be a potential
                                          hazard.

                                          Replace carriage walks with full width sidewalks
                                          located away from the curb, where possible.

                                          Work to remove fire hydrants, utility poles, and
                                          directional signs from those sidewalks directly
                                          adjacent to major thoroughfares which do not
                                          allow sufficient and safe maneuvering room.


 Provide pedestrian-friendly crossings    Work with IDOT and other agencies to ensure
 at major intersections.                  that the timing of cross walk lights is adequate to
                                          facilitate pedestrian crossings.


 Provide storage facilities and other     Require all commercial, residential, and public
 amenities that encourage bicycle use.    developments to provide for: a) bicycle storage
                                          facilities if appropriate, b) ease of bicycle ingress
                                          and egress, c) connections to adjacent bike
                                          paths and other developments, where
                                          appropriate, and d) the safe and smooth
                                          circulation of bicycle traffic throughout the
                                          development itself and in the design of any
                                          significant transportation improvements.

   Comprehensive Plan

    4.6          BRIARWOOD COUNTRY CLUB




Figure 4.6: Briarwood Country Club

The Village strongly supports the continued use of this
property as a golf course. Development proposals will be
considered which are consistent with the following and all
other applicable recommendations included in the Plan.

    1. Limited Uses. Commercial, office or industrial use of
       any portion of this property is not recommended.
       Residential use of the property is strongly preferred
       due to the nature of the site, its location among
       several residential areas and the low impact that
       residential development would have on Waukegan and
       Deerfield Roads. Land required for schools, recreation
       areas or other public uses should be reserved.

    2. Low Impact Development. The overall development
       should be of a low density. The design and planning
       of the development should be consistent with the
       nature of the site and the small scale of existing
       development in the Village.

    3. Environmental Sensitivity. The existing topography,
       forestation and ponds should be retained and
       increased in as many areas as possible. This is
       particularly true with respect to the lines of trees and
       shrubbery along Waukegan and Deerfield Roads,
       which have a high aesthetic value for the entire



                                                              76
   community and also effectively buffer the interior
   areas of this property from the noise, pollution, and
   visual effects of those roads.

4. Circulation. Access should be provided to both
   Waukegan Road and Deerfield Road. Efforts should be
   made to provide as many connections as possible to
   adjacent residential developments in this quadrant of
   the Village including pedestrian and bicycle path
   connections, where appropriate.

5. Sidewalks and Bikeways. The existing sidewalk along
   the northern boundary of this property is narrow.
   There is little or no separation for pedestrians from
   vehicles on one side and the often over-grown bushes
   on the other. This makes conditions very difficult for
   bicyclists who are not permitted on Deerfield Road.
   There is no sidewalk at all along the Waukegan Road
   frontage. Regardless of whether or not the Briarwood
   Country Club property is ever redeveloped, the Village
   should endeavor to secure sufficient additional right-
   of-way to allow the installation of sidewalks of
   appropriate widths along Deerfield and Waukegan
   Roads.

6. Creative Development. The Village strongly
   encourages innovative and creative development of
   this property.

RE: Site Plan Review- Briarwood Country Club

Dear Mr. Fischer:

The Fire Prevention Bureau has completed the preliminary site plan review for
the proposed premises, under the International Fire Code (2000 Edition)
guidelines listed in Section 503, "Fire Apparatus Access Roads."

The following should answer any questions or concerns regarding emergency
vehicle access:

      1. The fire department does not foresee any emergency vehicle access
         issues for the proposed addition of the new Paddle Tennis Facility or for
         the Clubhouse renovation.
      2. Only site access was reviewed at this time. A complete life safety plan
         review will be done when construction documents are submitted.

A complete life safety plan review will be done when complete construction plans
and documents have been submitted to the fire department.


Have a safe day .

Chris,

Jeff and I were wondering if the Fire Department has any concerns about the possible noise generated
from Briarwood's proposed paddle tennis facility? The issue of noise came up at the April 26 Plan
Commission public hearing and someone from the public questioned if the Fire Department will have
objections about the potential noise impacts. Attached are the minutes from the April 26 public hearing
and attached is a memo from Briarwood's sound expert about the potential noise impacts. The Plan
Commission public hearing was continued to May 24.

3. Information on the Issue of Buckthorn

Nort Wasserman has expressed concerns about the buckthorn on Briarwood's property.
(Please see the attached chain of correspondence on this issue.) Nort is concerned
that Briarwood's existing buckthorn, which is to remain on the property, is in conflict with
the Illinois Exotic Weed Act, 525 ILCS 10. Staff checked with the Village Attorney on
this issue and the Village Attorney believes the Exotic Weed Act prohibits the intentional
planting or propagation of exotic weeds, including several varieties of buckthorn. He
does not believe the Act makes it unlawful to keep existing buckthorn and he does not
believe the Act requires that a property owner eradicate existing buckthorn.

Hi, Kathy,
With respect, I am not in agreement with The Village Attorney. That is of little consequence. I am appalled
that Briarwood would deliberately attempt to hide behind a legally condemned weed to furnish the visual
and noise protection our ordinance requires and my neighbors and I deserve. The blatant insult trumps
(but does not eliminate) the legal disagreement.

Kathy and Jeff,

Thanks once again for your efforts in searching for buckthorns which I thought might be hiding in our
ordinances.

Briarwood (and Deerfield!) have a significant problem regarding Briarwood's buckthorns. They are an
illegal
noxious weed as defined in the statute I quoted (Illinois Exotic Weed Act, 525 ILCS 10), and those
responsible for planting them are guilty of a Class B misdemeanor ; each day they are allowed to exist
constitutes a separate violation carrying very substantial possible cumulative fines.

It is the height of unmitigated chutzpah to offer an illegal noxious weed as the principal noise and sound
barrier to shield and protect the closest neighboring residents. This objection is applicable to both the
paddle ball and clubhouse aspects of Briarwood's pending petition.

Do I believe that Briarwood is obligated to remove its' buckthorns? Probably - but at the least, it is
certainly prohibited from relying on them as a tool to abuse its' neighbors.

I am deadly serious about this objection.

Nort

Hello Nort,

We did a word search in both the Municipal Code and also in the Village's Tree Preservation Ordinance
for buckthorn and nothing came up in the search. We also checked with Clint Case, Code Enforcement
Supervisor and he is not aware of any Village regulations for buckthorn.

Are you able to share with us what your specific concern or question is regarding buckthorn? Do you
believe that Briarwood must remove any buckthorn they have?

          1.1. Enhance the landscape and site lighting of the entry drive, and street scape signage at the club entry.

          1.2. Create a separate Golf Bag drop area that will act as a fire truck and ambulance turnaround.

          1.3. Allow for a ADA ramp at the front door and raising the existing drive canopy 2'-9" to match the existing roof soffit.

          1.4. Modify the existing pool deck area to accommodate new auto court design and enhance the pool area.

          1.5. Provide for the additional 5' of property along the north parking lot edge and landscape. Increase parking lot to allow for
          straight parking with 19'x9' spaces and 24' isles.

                      1.5.1.The Landscape improvements along the parking lot expansion will be completed at the conclusion of the Deerfield

3. Paddle Facility

          3.1. New Paddle Hut 1,000 sq. ft. with a , 4 paddle courts, with lighting and Parking Lot. The project will be completed in two
          phases with the first phase being the hut and the two Western courts and the 2nd phase the 2 eastern courts. The existing curb

          3.2. Height of the Paddle Hut will be 20'-6" from the existing grade and 111.8' from the west property line.

                The courts will be located 44.8' from the west property line. This allow the existing vegetation screening to remain. The height
                of the screens (fencing) around the court are 17' high from the grade and the box style lights are 24' high from the grade.

                The lights produce 30' candle at the playing surface with a zero cut off at the property line. Light measurements were taken at 9
                pm and the following were reported 1.4 fc at the road and the berm area.

                Sound measurements were taken at Waukegan Road and they vary from a low point of 53db to a high of 85db. The reduction
                at the other side of the berm next to the residence was a constant 55-60db. The conversation and foot noise of a typical
                paddle play is in the range of 55-60db. Therefore there will not be an increase in the noise level at the residence due to the
                louder traffic noise from Waukegan Road.

          Special Use Criteria

1.   Compatible with Existing Development:

     ·    The club has been in existed since 1957 and has various additions over the years our remodeling and paddle facility keep in the
          spirt of the club and do not over crowd or the existing neighbors. The membership is not being increased with these modification.
          The improvements are to keep existing members and attract new members. The proposed modifications to the clubhouse will not
          adversely affect the neighbors and will allow the existing residential areas to enjoy the open space provided by the clubs use.

     ·    The Paddle Facility is located next to a four-lane highway that has considerable traffic. It's location is consistent with the
          commercial uses that are located along the main artery that goes through the village.

2.   Lot of Sufficient Size:

     ·    This existing site is 180 Acres with the majority of it being open space for the golf course. The amount of building to land far
          exceeds the typical requirement development requirement.

     ·    The paddle facility well exceeds all required set-backs needed for any building located in a commercial or residential district.
          Therefore we feel that the proposed project is of a scale that is well with-in the guide lines of being proposed for the use.

3.   Traffic

     ·    The project does not increase membership. Therefore there will be no change to the amount of traffic created at the clubhouse.

     ·    The paddle facility is relatively small use numbers and is addressed in the parking and traffic study which shows minimal impact to
          the street traffic. Waukegan Road is a major north-south arterial road with 30,600 average daily traffic counts. Our proposed use
          has a total need of 32 uses per day and has a peek use during the off peek times of travel on Waukegan road. This makes the use
          have minimal impact on the the traffic patterns created on Waukegan Road.

4.   Parking and Access:

     ·    The clubhouse parking lot and site plan changes allows for an increase of 26 spaces with 6 of them dedicated for handicapped.
          During large events the club will continue to use it current driving range for overflow parking. The Club has not had any parking
          problems in the past and the changes proposed does not impact in the parking and access.

     ·    The Paddle parking lot is sized for twice the number of players that can be on the courts. This has proven to be adequate in other
          clubs that have similar size facilities. Paddle Parking can also be used for overflow employee parking during summer use when
          there is minimal use of the paddle facility.

5.   Effect on the Neighborhood: The existing use enhances the existing neighbors by being open space. By these improvements it will
     allow for the open space to remain by having a strong membership to the club.

     ·    The changes to the clubhouse will enhance the visual presents from Deerfield Road. There is a major upgrade to the landscape
          and hardscape for the neighborhood to enjoy. There is an impact on the to the adjacent neighbors currently and will continue to be
          with the current special use. The location of the chiller unit in the current service yard will have an minimal effect on the the
          adjacent neighbors due to the fact that a strict sound attenuation will be required on the unit which will deaden the noise to a level.
          This level of sound is equal to the sound put out by a typical residential condensing air-conditioning equipment.

     ·    The Paddle Facility will be a change to the existing site. It minimal use will have a minimal effect on the surrounding
          Neighborhood. The location which keeps the existing large landscape buffer. The 4-lane Waukegan Road and the existing berm
          all mitigate the the impact of the new use. The lighting is designed to have zero cut-off at the property line. The traffic will not be
          significant to the current number on Waukegan Road and the sound is minimal in comparison to the noise created by the car and
          truck traffic on Waukegan Road. Therefore the effect with be minimal to the adjacent Neighborhood.

6.   Adequate Facilities:

     ·    Existing Water, Gas, and Electricity are adequate for the proposed alterations to the Clubhouse. The slight increase in impervious
          area will be accommodated on site in the existing pond which is used for irrigating the golf course.

     ·    The Paddle Facility will connect to the gas and electric from Waukegan road and the electric will be fed from the existing service at
          the storage building to the north. The storm water will be addressed in the same pond as the clubhouse project uses as this area
          drains into the same direction.

7.   Adequate Buffering:

     ·   The Clubhouse parking area will be buffered with the landscape as described in the the landscape plan. The other areas of
         renovation are hidden by the existing building and existing vegetation.

     ·   The Paddle Facility is located so the existing vegetation buffer will create a visual screen. The location next to Waukegan Road also
         provides a noise buffer from the surrounding neighbors. The design of the lighting and the switching of the lighting on timers that
         are only on when the court is in use will also minimize the impact of the need for buffering from the surrounding property.

                  Planning Commission Submittal Amending the Existing Special Use
                                                                       For
                                                      Briarwood Country Club
                                      355 Deerfield Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015
The Briarwood Country Club was established in 1958. It's membership is currently 257 families.

The club has studied its existing facilities and is proposing the following modifications in three areas of the club

1. Clubhouse entry drive and Auto Court area:

          1.1. Enhance the landscape and site lighting of the entry drive, and street scape signage at the club entry.

          1.2. Create a separate Golf Bag drop area that will act as a fire truck and ambulance turnaround.

          1.3. Allow for a ADA ramp at the front door and raising the existing drive canopy 2'-9" to match the existing roof soffit.

          1.4. Modify the existing pool deck area to accommodate new auto court design and enhance the pool area.

          1.5. Provide for the additional 5' of property along the north parking lot edge and landscape. Increase parking lot to allow for
          straight parking with 19'x9' spaces and 24' isles.

                      1.5.1.The Landscape improvements along the parking lot expansion will be completed at the conclusion of the Deerfield
                      Road expansion. The existing vegetation will remain until the expansion project takes place.

          1.6. Provide area for Air Cooled Chiller at the Northwest service area for the building that is 30' from the property line. With a DB
          rating of 67 30' from the unit at the end that faces the west neighboring property. This is equivalent to the requirement for a
          residential style outside condensing unit for noise at the property line.

2. Rear Terrace addition and Building Addition

          2.1. Enlarge the existing outside dining and casual seating areas. The area of the terrace addition is 3,707 Square Feet.

          2.2. Provide a 450 Square foot addition to the existing building to allow for an expanded locker rooms and Mens lounge area. It's
          maximum height is 21'-4" from grade

3. Paddle Facility

          3.1. New Paddle Hut 1,000 sq. ft. with a , 4 paddle courts, with lighting and Parking Lot. The project will be completed in two
          phases with the first phase being the hut and the two Western courts and the 2nd phase the 2 eastern courts. The existing curb
          cut will be enlarged with the drive entrance will be enlarged 4'-4" at the property line and 11'-5" at the widest point of the entry.

          3.2. Height of the Paddle Hut will be 20'-6" from the existing grade and 111.8' from the west property line.

                The courts will be located 44.8' from the west property line. This allow the existing vegetation screening to remain. The height
                of the screens (fencing) around the court are 17' high from the grade and the box style lights are 24' high from the grade.

                The lights produce 30' candle at the playing surface with a zero cut off at the property line. Light measurements were taken at 9
                pm and the following were reported 1.4 fc at the road and the berm area.

                Sound measurements were taken at Waukegan Road and they vary from a low point of 53db to a high of 85db. The reduction
                at the other side of the berm next to the residence was a constant 55-60db. The conversation and foot noise of a typical
                paddle play is in the range of 55-60db. Therefore there will not be an increase in the noise level at the residence due to the
                louder traffic noise from Waukegan Road.

          Special Use Criteria

1.   Compatible with Existing Development:

     ·    The club has been in existed since 1957 and has various additions over the years our remodeling and paddle facility keep in the
          spirt of the club and do not over crowd or the existing neighbors. The membership is not being increased with these modification.
          The improvements are to keep existing members and attract new members. The proposed modifications to the clubhouse will not
          adversely affect the neighbors and will allow the existing residential areas to enjoy the open space provided by the clubs use.

     ·    The Paddle Facility is located next to a four-lane highway that has considerable traffic. It's location is consistent with the
          commercial uses that are located along the main artery that goes through the village.

2.   Lot of Sufficient Size:

     ·    This existing site is 180 Acres with the majority of it being open space for the golf course. The amount of building to land far
          exceeds the typical requirement development requirement.

     ·    The paddle facility well exceeds all required set-backs needed for any building located in a commercial or residential district.
          Therefore we feel that the proposed project is of a scale that is well with-in the guide lines of being proposed for the use.

3.   Traffic

     ·    The project does not increase membership. Therefore there will be no change to the amount of traffic created at the clubhouse.

     ·    The paddle facility is relatively small use numbers and is addressed in the parking and traffic study which shows minimal impact to
          the street traffic. Waukegan Road is a major north-south arterial road with 30,600 average daily traffic counts. Our proposed use
          has a total need of 32 uses per day and has a peek use during the off peek times of travel on Waukegan road. This makes the use
          have minimal impact on the the traffic patterns created on Waukegan Road.

4.   Parking and Access:

     ·    The clubhouse parking lot and site plan changes allows for an increase of 26 spaces with 6 of them dedicated for handicapped.
          During large events the club will continue to use it current driving range for overflow parking. The Club has not had any parking
          problems in the past and the changes proposed does not impact in the parking and access.

     ·    The Paddle parking lot is sized for twice the number of players that can be on the courts. This has proven to be adequate in other
          clubs that have similar size facilities. Paddle Parking can also be used for overflow employee parking during summer use when
          there is minimal use of the paddle facility.

5.   Effect on the Neighborhood: The existing use enhances the existing neighbors by being open space. By these improvements it will
     allow for the open space to remain by having a strong membership to the club.

     ·    The changes to the clubhouse will enhance the visual presents from Deerfield Road. There is a major upgrade to the landscape
          and hardscape for the neighborhood to enjoy. There is an impact on the to the adjacent neighbors currently and will continue to be
          with the current special use. The location of the chiller unit in the current service yard will have an minimal effect on the the
          adjacent neighbors due to the fact that a strict sound attenuation will be required on the unit which will deaden the noise to a level.
          This level of sound is equal to the sound put out by a typical residential condensing air-conditioning equipment.

     ·    The Paddle Facility will be a change to the existing site. It minimal use will have a minimal effect on the surrounding
          Neighborhood. The location which keeps the existing large landscape buffer. The 4-lane Waukegan Road and the existing berm
          all mitigate the the impact of the new use. The lighting is designed to have zero cut-off at the property line. The traffic will not be
          significant to the current number on Waukegan Road and the sound is minimal in comparison to the noise created by the car and
          truck traffic on Waukegan Road. Therefore the effect with be minimal to the adjacent Neighborhood.

6.   Adequate Facilities:

     ·    Existing Water, Gas, and Electricity are adequate for the proposed alterations to the Clubhouse. The slight increase in impervious
          area will be accommodated on site in the existing pond which is used for irrigating the golf course.

     ·    The Paddle Facility will connect to the gas and electric from Waukegan road and the electric will be fed from the existing service at
          the storage building to the north. The storm water will be addressed in the same pond as the clubhouse project uses as this area
          drains into the same direction.

7.   Adequate Buffering:

     ·   The Clubhouse parking area will be buffered with the landscape as described in the the landscape plan. The other areas of
         renovation are hidden by the existing building and existing vegetation.

     ·   The Paddle Facility is located so the existing vegetation buffer will create a visual screen. The location next to Waukegan Road also
         provides a noise buffer from the surrounding neighbors. The design of the lighting and the switching of the lighting on timers that
         are only on when the court is in use will also minimize the impact of the need for buffering from the surrounding property.

                              Proposed Paddle Courts
                              Deerfield, Illinois


This memorandum summarizes the methodologies, results, and findings of a traffic impact
study conducted by Kenig, Lindgren, O'Hara, Aboona, Inc. (KLOA, Inc.) for the proposed paddle
courts to be located within the Briarwood Country Club in Deerfield, Illinois. The site, which
currently contains the golf course maintenance facility entrance and a grass seeding area for the
golf course, is located off Waukegan Road approximately 1,000 feet north of Kates Road and is
proposed to contain four paddle courts, a warming hut, and a parking lot with 28 spaces.
Access to the site will continue to be provided via the existing access drive to the maintenance
facility.

Figure 1 shows the location of the site in relation to the area roadway system. Figure 2 shows and
aerial view of the site area.

The purpose of this study was to examine background traffic conditions, assess the impact
the proposed development will have on traffic conditions in the area, and determine if any roadway
or access improvements are necessary to accommodate traffic generated by development.

The sections of this report present the following.

·       Existing roadway conditions
·       A description of the site development
·       Directional distribution of the development generated traffic
·       Vehicle trip generation for the development
·       Future traffic conditions including access to the site
·       Traffic analyses for the weekday evening and Saturday morning peak hours
·       Recommendations with respect to adequacy of the site access system, adjacent roadway
        network, and internal circulation

Existing Conditions

Existing transportation conditions in the vicinity of the site were documented based on
a field visit conducted by KLOA, Inc. in order to obtain a database for projecting future conditions.
The following provides a description of the geographical location of the site, physical characteristics
of the area roadway system including lane usage and traffic control devices and existing peak hour
traffic volumes.

Site Location

The site, which currently contains the golf course maintenance facility entrance and a grass seeding
area for the golf course, is located off Waukegan Road approximately 1,000 feet north of
Kates Road. It should be noted the current access drive off Waukegan Road to the golf course
maintenance facility is gated. Area land uses include a mixture of residential, office, and commercial,
land uses.

Existing Roadway System Characteristics

The characteristics of the existing roadways near the site are described below.

Waukegan Road (Illinois Route 43) is a north-south arterial road that provides two lanes in each
direction within the vicinity of the site. No parking is allowed on either side of the road. Waukegan
Road is under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and is classified
as a strategic regional arterial (SRA). Within the vicinity of the site, Waukegan Road has a posted
speed limit of 40 mph and carries an average daily traffic (ADT) volume of 30,600 vehicles.
The nearest traffic signals on Waukegan Road are located at Osterman Avenue approximately
0.3 miles to the north and at Kates Road approximately 0.2 miles to the south.

Existing Traffic Volumes

In order to determine current traffic conditions in the vicinity of the site, KLOA, Inc. conducted
peak period traffic counts at the intersection of Waukegan Road with the access drive. The traffic
counts were conducted on Tuesday, March 13, 2012 during the weekday evening
(4:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M.) peak period and on Saturday, March 17, 2012 during the Saturday midday
(11:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M.) peak period. It should be noted that the gate to the access drive was
closed during the counts for both peak periods.


Traffic Characteristics of the Proposed Development

In order to properly evaluate future traffic conditions in the surrounding area, it was necessary
to determine the traffic characteristics of the proposed development, including the directional
distribution and volumes of traffic that it will generate.
Proposed Development Plan

                                                  4
As proposed, the plans call for developing the site with four paddle courts, a warming hut, and a
parking lot with 28 spaces. Access to the site will continue to be provided via the existing access
drive to the maintenance facility off Waukegan Road located approximately 1,000 feet north of
Kates Road. The access drive will be widened to 24-feet to provide one inbound and one outbound
lane with outbound movements under stop sign control. The access drive will continue to be gated
when it is not in use.

Characteristics of the Proposed Development

The paddle courts will be in use year round, however the peak season occurs from the beginning of
October to the second week of March. The proposed hours of operation for the paddle courts are
from 7:00 A.M. to 10:30 P.M. (Fridays from 7:00 A.M. to 12:00 Midnight) and weekends from
7:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M., with the peak hours of operation occurring during the following periods.

·      Weekdays from 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M.
·      Weekdays from 7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.
·      Weekends from 8:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M.

All matches are played as doubles matches (four per court), typically occur over a two hour period,
and are self officiated. Tournaments are held a couple of times per season which will double the
number of people using each court.

Directional Distribution of Site Traffic

The directional distribution of future site-generated trips on the roadway system is a function of
several variables including the operational characteristics of the roadway system and the ease
with which drivers can travel over various sections of the roadway system without encountering
congestion. The directions from which players will approach and depart the site were estimated
based on the existing travel patterns, as determined from the traffic counts, and the residential areas
within proximity of the site. Table 1 illustrates the directional distribution of traffic.

Estimated Site Traffic Generation

The estimated volume of traffic generated by the proposed paddle courts was estimated based on the
expected usage and size of the proposed facility. The volume of traffic generated by the paddle courts is
based on the assumption of four people per court with no carpooling, no additional spectators, and no
referees or officials. It was assumed that the peak hour for the facility will occur during a changeover of
matches when players will be arriving and departing within the same hour. Table 2 illustrates the peak
hour traffic estimated to be generated by the development.

Projected Traffic Volumes

The estimated weekday evening and Saturday midday peak hour traffic volumes that will be
generated by the proposed development were assigned to the roadway system in accordance with the
previously described directional distribution. The peak hours of traffic utilized in the study were
6:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. on weekdays and 11:00 A.M. to 12:00 Noon on Saturday to coincide with
the peak hours of operation of the paddle courts. Figure 3 illustrates the projected peak hour traffic
volumes including the traffic for the proposed development.


Traffic Analysis

Traffic analyses were performed for the intersection of Waukegan Road with the paddle court access
drive to evaluate the impact of the proposed site, and determine the ability of the existing roadway
system to accommodate projected traffic demands. Analyses were performed for the weekday
evening and Saturday midday hours only for the projected traffic volumes because the current access
drive's gate was closed at the time of the traffic counts for both peak periods.

The traffic analyses were performed using HCS+ computer software, which is based on the
methodologies outlined in the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual (HCM),
2000. The ability of an intersection to accommodate traffic flow is expressed in terms of level of
service, which is assigned a letter grade from A to F based on the average control delay experienced
by vehicles passing through the intersection. Control delay is that portion of the total delay
attributed to the traffic signal or stop sign control operation and includes initial deceleration delay,
queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Level of Service A is the highest
grade (best traffic flow and least delay), Level of Service E represents saturated or at-capacity
conditions, and Level of Service F is the lowest grade (oversaturated conditions, extensive delays).

For two-way stop controlled (TWSC) intersections, levels of service are only calculated for the
approaches controlled by a stop sign (not for the intersection as a whole).

The Highway Capacity Manual definitions for levels of service and the corresponding control delay
for unsignalized intersections is shown in Table 3. The results of the capacity analysis are

Traffic Evaluation

The results of the capacity analysis indicate that the intersection of Waukegan Road with Access
Drive will operate at acceptable levels of service in the evening peak hour and in the Saturday
midday peak hour. This indicates that site traffic will not have a significant impact on the operation
of the intersection and that the access drive is adequate in accommodating the site traffic.

Waukegan Road Gap Study

To further analyze the ability of site traffic to enter and exit the access drive off Waukegan Road, a
gap study was conducted on Waukegan Road on Tuesday, March 13, 2012 during the evening
(4:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M.) peak period and Saturday midday (11:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M.) peak period.
The gap study was conducted to determine the number and length of gaps or interruptions in the
traffic stream that are available for exiting left-turning vehicles from the access drive onto
Waukegan Road and for entering left-turning vehicles from Waukegan Road onto the access drive.
Table 5 summarizes the gap study results during the evening peak hour of traffic for the site
(6:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M.) and during the Saturday midday peak hour of traffic for the site
(11:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M) for the exiting and entering left-turns.

 Access Drive

As shown in Table 5, there are more than adequate number of gaps available in the flow of traffic on
Waukegan Road of sufficient length to allow up to 49 and 43 exiting vehicles to turn left from the
Access Drive onto Waukegan Road during the weekday evening and Saturday midday peak hours
respectively. For entering left-turns from Waukegan Road onto the Access Drive, up to 149 vehicles
can turn left during the evening and Saturday midday peak hours. Based on this information, there
are sufficient traffic gaps on Waukegan Road to accommodate the estimated left turns (8 inbound
and 8 outbound in the evening peak hour and 8 inbound and 8 outbound in the Saturday midday
peak hour) from the Access Drive.




                                                  9
Site Access

As mentioned previously, access to the site will continue to be provided via the existing access drive
to the maintenance facility off Waukegan Road approximately 1,000 feet north of Kates Road,
however the drive will be widened to 24-feet to provide one inbound and one outbound lane with
outbound movements under stop sign control. The access drive will continue to be gated when it is
not in use. Based on the results of the capacity analyses and gap study, the low volume of
site-generated traffic in the Waukegan Road traffic stream and the configuration of other
nearby minor access driveways along Waukegan Road, widening Waukegan Road to provide a
southbound left-turn lane or a northbound right-turn lane will not be necessary.


Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the proposed development plans and the preceding traffic impact study, the following
conclusions and recommendations are made.

·         The addition of the new traffic generated by the paddle courts is projected to have limited
          impact on the operation of the roadway system. As a result, no roadway improvements
          and/or traffic control modifications are required.

·         The site access drive will be widened to 24-feet to provide one inbound and one outbound
          lane with outbound movements under stop sign control.

·         The site access drive will be adequate to serve the total traffic that will be generated by the
          paddle courts.

·         Adequate gaps exist in the Waukegan Road traffic stream to accommodate the entering and
          exiting left-turn movements from the access drive.

                           Proposed Paddle Tennis Courts
                      Briarwood Country Club ­ Deerfield, Illinois
                                                                                    May 9, 2012

On the evening of April 26, 2012, we provided testimony to the Deerfield Plan Commission
regarding the proposed Briarwood Country Club Paddle Tennis Courts on Waukegan Road.
During this testimony, we summarized acoustical measurements, applicable criteria and
provided conclusions.

Acoustical Criteria

Deerfield has a nuisance noise ordinance which does not contain numerical standards. As a
point of reference, we used the Illinois Noise Regulations which are administered by the Illinois
Pollution Control Board. Between commercial and residential land uses, Illinois permits the
equivalent of 55 dBA during the day (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and 44 dBA during the night. The
regulations are enforced at the residential property line, require readings energy-averaged over
a one hour time period and call for sound level readings in each of nine octave frequency
bands. The ambient (or background) sound level must be established through measurement at
the site.

Acoustical Measurements

In order to predict noise impact from the proposed Paddle Tennis courts, we conducted sound
level readings at two Paddle Tennis clubs and background readings on the Coromandel berm,
across the street from the proposed facility.

Paddle Tennis Measurements

Measurements at Paddle Courts during play were conducted on April 19, 2012 (Lake Forest
Club) and April 22, 2012 (Northmoor Country Club). Lake Forest Club readings were
conducted during the evening of April 19, 2012 between approximately 7:15 and 7:55 p.m.
Four courts were in use during our measurements. Because the Paddle Tennis Courts are
located close to Skokie Highway (U.S. Highway 41), background sound levels were quite high
and measurements near the courts (within 10 to 15 ft) were required. Differentiation between
Paddle Tennis play and the background levels were difficult during data analysis (the resulting
Paddle Tennis levels include some car and truck noise).

Because of the difficulties with the Lake Forest analysis, Northmoor Country Club was utilized
for additional measurements on the morning of April 22, 2012 between approximately 8:30 and
9:10 a.m. The Northmoor courts are located about 85 ft north of Clavey Road and readings
could be taken between passing cars on Clavey Road. Two out of four courts were in use
during our measurements.

Sound level readings at both clubs were conducted for several second intervals only during
                                                                                        May 9, 2012

play, not while players were idle. Thus the averaged readings reflect constant play.

Sound level readings for both clubs were corrected for ambient conditions and normalized to a
distance of 175 ft from the edge of the nearest Paddle Tennis court. This distance is at the
edge of the driveway pad at the residential building across the street from the proposed facility.

Whenever a sound level reading is taken, the sound level meter measures noise from the
source (Paddle Tennis play) and the ambient environment (traffic and other noises). Ambient
correction is a mathematical process that attempts to determine the source noise in the
absence of the ambient environment. Distance normalization is also a mathematical procedure
that accounts for the attenuation of sound with distance. A conservative factor of 4.5 dB per
doubling of distance was used.

When corrected for ambient conditions and normalized for distance, time-average
measurements were equivalent to 51 dBA for the Lake Forest Club and 46 dBA for the
Northmoor Country Club.

Background Sound Level Measurements

Background sound level measurements at the edge of the Coromandel development and
across the street from the proposed Briarwood courts were taken between approximately 9:30
and 10:00 p.m. on April 18, 2012 and between 8:25 and 8:45 p.m. on the following evening of
April 19, 2012. Readings from the April 18 visit were discarded due to wet pavement, which
resulted in excessive tire noise. Measurements were conducted on top of the berm, directly
across the street from the proposed Paddle Tennis courts and near the pond which is south of
the fire station. It is noteworthy that traffic volumes were observed to be higher between 9:30
and 10:00 p.m. than at 8:25 and 8:45 p.m.

When averaged and normalized for distance, April 19 , 2012 background sound level
measurements were equivalent to 62 dBA for readings taken on top of the Coromandel berm
and 59 dBA for readings near the pond.

Results

The table below compares normalized readings from the Lake Forest Club and Northmoor
Country Club with the Illinois standards and normalized ambient readings at locations at the
Coromandel development.

Comments on Proposed Modifications

As a result of community concern about noise and appearance of the Paddle Tennis Courts,
the petitioner has proposed a ten foot high board fence to be located on the west side of the
two closest Paddle Tennis courts and returning on the north and south sides by 12 feet. We
have evaluated the design and estimate that the fence can provide additional attenuation of 4 to
5 dBA to Coromandel residences across the street. This will result in a noticeable reduction in
noise from Paddle Tennis Play.

Conclusions

As concluded at the April 26, 2012 plan commission hearing, based on sound level
measurements of Paddle Tennis play at the Lake Forest Club and Northmoor Country Club and
measurements of ambient noise at the Coromandel development, compliance is predicted with
the Illinois Noise Regulations.

Compliance with noise regulations does not necessarily ensure inaudibility of noise sources.
Although the level of traffic noise from Waukegan Road will exceed that from Paddle Tennis
play by about 11 to 16 dBA near the closest building, Paddle Tennis sounds may still be heard
outside during breaks in traffic. Inside the closest building on the second floor with windows
open, we expect Paddle Tennis noise to only be heard at times. Inside with windows closed,
we do not expect Paddle Tennis noise is likely to be heard.

With construction of the proposed fence, noise from Paddle Tennis play will be reduced further.
Outside the closest building, Paddle Tennis sounds may still be heard during breaks in traffic,
but at a reduced level. Inside the closest building on the second floor with windows open,
Paddle Tennis noise is expected to be heard at a low level during long breaks in traffic. Inside
with windows closed, we do not expect that Paddle Tennis noise will be heard.

In either case, we do not expect Paddle Tennis noise to be heard outside beyond the first row
of homes that border Waukegan Road.

Howdy and greetings, Distinguished Members of the Deerfield Plan Commission,
   On April 26th I hope to have the pleasure of addressing you during the public hearing involving
Briarwood Country Club. I will be speaking in opposition to that portion of Briarwood's petition seeking
leave to erect a paddle tennis complex directly across from, and in close proximity to, the Coromandel
community in which I have resided for over 15 years.
   In my oral presentation to you, I plan to address each element of the Special Use standards you will be
applying pursuant to Section 13.11-D (2) of the Deerfield Zoning Ordinance. Some of those elements
relate to the issues of noise from and visual impact of the requested use. In my presentation to you, I
intend to highlight these noise and visual issues by use of You Tube videos.
   In order to enable you to prepare for the hearing, it has been suggested that I furnish you with links to
the videos in advance of the hearing, so that you may watch and evaluate them in the same manner that
you study the petitioner's submissions. To that end, I ask you to consider:
                                        (1)

   This video depicts four women playing paddle tennis on a single court. Listen very carefully to the noise
(the ball sounds, voices, shouts, grunts,etc.) and multiply it by four in your mind, since four courts are
being requested. Further, imagine some of the players with male voices and grunts (as heard on the other
videos), together with the noise emanating from the sixteen people waiting their turns to play. This
cacophony takes place a mere 235 feet (petitioner's calculation!) from Coromandel homes. It is not
buffered in any manner whatever - the deciduous boundary buckthorns are totally bare during the cold
seasons when paddle tennis is played, and Waukegan Road traffic noise is virtually non-existent during
the evening and night hours the courts would be most heavily used [How road noise could mitigate paddle
tennis noise totally mystifies me; two loud orchestras are certainly louder than one, and two misbehaving
grandchildren are twice as loud as one].

   For some rather light-hearted comparison, here are four men playing. Could they be slightly inebriated,
a not unusual occurrence in the sport of paddle tennis? Note night-time play at a country club, and the
very large crowd. Note also that Briarwood anticipates holding paddle ball tournaments (Traffic Study,
p.5).

  The "macho" nature of paddle tennis seems to breed a form of looniness. Why play on the very coldest
and snowiest night of the year, when you more conveniently could exercise at the Sachs Recreation
Center, or more comfortably in Florida or Arizona?

                       ----------------------------
   I look forward to seeing all of you next Thursday, and as in the past, sharing my strongly felt thoughts
with my friends.

When I returned briefly to Deerfield over last weekend, I was surprised to see flyers all over Coromandel
complaining that some new paddle ball courts at Briarwood Country Club would have a detrimental effect
on property values at Coromandel. The primary complaints involved noise, lights and traffic, as well as
the extended hours that the facility would be used.

My observations are as follows; only 8 Coromandel town homes are within 400 feet of the location for the
proposed paddle ball court and have a direct line of sight. Traffic on Waukegan Road is far noisier, and
disruptive than the paddle ball courts could possibly be. Fire trucks and ambulances depart the nearby
fire station at all hours of the day and night almost immediately across Waukegan Road from the paddle
ball courts. The Coromandel tennis court is directly outside my bedroom window, and I have never heard
noise coming from the tennis court. The same cannot be said for the noise and vibration generated by
Metra and CN trains, immediately behind the tennis courts. This appears to be a case of NIMBYs to the
extreme, and I consider most of the complaints to be without merit. The only possible concern that I have
is with left turns, primarily from southbound Waukegan Road into the facility, where cars would have to
stop in the left traffic lane, holding up traffic and creating the risk of an accident at a location where the
speed limit increases to 40 MPH.

Hi, Judy-- thanks for checking in and letting me know your thoughts on this subject. First, let me make a
few clarifications here. At this point, the matter is not before the Village Board, but at the Plan
Commission. The Plan Commission is the public hearing entity for the Village on matters of land use,
rezoning, new ordinances and more (and I served on that Commission for twelve years, seven as a
Commissioner and five as Chair). Their public hearings are the best places for citizens and residents to
present their views as the Commission researches the issues and listens to advocates on all sides of the
issue. It is a recommending body for the Village Board, and after hearing all the evidence and opinions,
deliberates and comes up with their recommendation. Their rationales are public and you can thus
understand how they feel and why. Once they have made their recommendation, a date is scheduled for
the matter to come to the Board and we then can vote to accept, reject or amend their recommendation
(or even to send it back to them for further consideration). If we vote to accept, an ordinance is then
drawn up and gets two readings at regular Village Board meetings, and anyone can attend and speak at
those meetings. It is better, however, due to time limitations, to appear at the Plan Commission as their
fact-finding continues. That group is always the best source of facts.

We have not yet gotten any of the data on this matter, so I can't really make any kind of reasoned
judgements until Plan Commission has done their work and all of the minutes of their sessions,
participants' testimony and other relevant material has come to us. I can tell you, however, concerning
your comment on the lights, that our ordinances require that NO light can spill over the boundaries of the
property concerned. So, if this is a parking lot or a paddle tennis court, no light can go on neighbors'
properties or any non-concerned parcel. In the Plan Commission meeting, you will see (and the
documents are available to the public) a lighting chart that will measure the amount of light all the way to
and beyond the boundaries of the property and at the ends, it must be at zero or it will not pass.

I'm copying your note to Jeff Rykaert, who is the Village Staff person for the Plan Commission and asking
him to add it to the documents presented to the Commissioners for the public hearing on this matter. It
will be in the record for that Commission and also in the material presented to us once they've reached
their recommendation. I would also suggest that you attend the hearing (at 7:30 P.M. at Village Hall on
the Thursday night it's scheduled) to get the full testimony on the court, the lighting, the traffic, the number
of people expected to use it and more. The public is always welcome and you may even want to present
your opinions. You can certainly attend our meeting when the matter reaches us. Our agendas (and
those of the Plan Commission) are always available on the Village website (and our meetings are also
televised on the Village cable channel and streamed on your computer).

Again, thanks for letting us know your feelings. I hope you continue to participate.

Subject: paddleball courts

Dear Bob
It has come to my attention that the proposed paddle ball courts at Briarwood Country Club will have a
very large impact on the property values of Coromandel. It i\seems as though the bright lights will be on
until midnight and be visible to our development. It has also been mentioned that there will be a great deal
more traffic congestion on Waukegan Road exactly where we need to turn to get on to Waukegan. I hope
that you will give careful consideration before approving this development. Thank you

           land use request for Briarwood Country Club
           Audrey Pam to: kvonohlen@deerfield.il.us           04/27/2012 11:33 AM
           Please respond to Audrey Pam


Please forward to Mr. Michael Swartz. Thank you!
Dear Mr. Swartz,

We live at 619 Byron Court and border the Briarwood Country Club. Due
to our son's concert at the high school last night, we were unable to attend
yesterday's meeting regarding the land use request for Briarwood.

In reading through the proposed plans, our concern is that of noise from
the club. We currently are awoken frequently at the hour of 5:30 a.m. on
weekends during the golf season by loud mowers and other course
machinery and maintenance. We are concerned as to what noise the
expanded terrace of the clubhouse will bring for the evening hours. At the
present, when there are musical bands or disc jockeys at parties at the
clubhouse, we are able to hear them. If there are parties and music
outside on the proposed terrace expansion, we are hoping that the club will
be respectful of its neighbors and curtail evening noise.

We hope that this is an issue already addressed; regardless, we would like
our voices to be heard and we look forward to a response from Briarwood
or the Village.

Thanks so much,

Audrey Pam and Michael Yellen

             Briarwood Paddle Ball Court Public Hearing

Since I will not be able to attend the Briarwood Paddle Court public hearing, I was
advised by Jeff Reichardt of the Deerfield Zoning Department to e mail my concern
over traffic disruption created by cars travelling southbound on Waukegan Road
wishing to turn left into the proposed Briarwood entrance. The traffic consultant has
reported this should not be a problem because of "gaps in traffic flow caused by the
signal at Kates Road." This only addresses the ability to turn left, is does not address
the greater likelihood of rearend accidents caused by distracted, high speed drivers not
accustomed to cars turning left on that stretch of Waukegan Road. As a longtime
resident of Deerfield, I have witnessed far too many similar accidents on northbound
Waukegan Road with cars turning left onto Central Avenue. I would urge that this
legitimate concern be communicated to IDOT.

Sincerely,

Summary of Background and Reason for Request

In November, 2011 the Village Board of Trustees referred this matter to the Safety Council for full
consideration after the recent pedestrian/vehicle accident. Gewalt Hamilton traffic engineers reviewed
and considered their previous recommendation and determined there is no material effect on the warrant
studies previously issued to the Village (attached).

At its meeting on May 22, 2012, the Safety Council voted 5-0 to recommend a four-way stop at this
intersection. Safety Council Chairman Bill Keefe is scheduled to be present to review their report and
respond to questions from the Board.

Bob,
Per our discussion earlier, I have reviewed the crash history at the
above referenced intersection as summarized in our previous report
dated October 2011. Of the 9 crashes reported between 2007 and April
20i1 only three were considered correctable by installation of an
All-Way Stop and they did not meet the frequency standards. While
tragic, the recent pedestrian I vehicle collision does not indicate a
change in pattern, or an increase in collisions that are correctable
by installation of Stop Signs on Osterman. Unless there have been
additional crashes since April 2011, GHA's findings remain that the
MUTCD warrant conditions for installation of Stop Signs at this
location are not met.

A meeting of the Safety Commission was held on Tuesday May 22, 2012 at 7:30 p.m. at the
Police Department Conference Room, 850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois. Chairman Bill
Keefe called the meeting to order at 7:30 p.m.

Bill Keefe, Chairman
Mark Brown
Dorothy Collins
Frank Karkazis

Absent was:
Phil York

Also Present:
Jeri Cotton, Secretary

Public Comment:

There was no Public Comment.

Business:

1. Consideration of a four-way stop sign at Robert York and Osterman

Don Davis, 721 Hermitage Drive, requested the four-way stop sign that was installed during
construction be continued after the construction ended. He noted that at the last meeting two
other residents came forth in favor of the stop sign as well. Mr. Davis stated there were 51
signatures on a petition from residents of South Commons who are also in favor of a four-way
stop sign. Mr. Davis noted that the residents of One Deerfield cross at the intersection,
children from Shepherd crossing at the intersection and people from South Commons crossing
at the intersection.

Ch. Keefe stated that Alan Chandler originally brought the petition to the Commission. Ms.
Collins read a statement regarding round about intersections in the area. She does not believe
there is room for a roundabout in the area. She also believes a roundabout is dangerous for
pedestrians. Ms. Collins would recommend installing signage requesting vehicles stop for
pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Mr. Karkazis noted that the pedestrian counts were probably low, because it was not done
when college kids were home and during nice weather. Mr. Brown and Mr. Karkazis both
believe a stop sign would be appropriate for the intersection. Ch. Keefe believes a roundabout
could be considered when an intersection is being constructed initially.

Ch. Keefe stated that the Commission's original concern was the traffic backing up to the
railroad. The Gewalt Hamilton report dated February 27, 2012 determined there was room for
10 vehicles to stack between the railroad tracks and the intersection. The 95th percentile
would have approximately three vehicles stacking. Therefore, the Commission's concern has
been addressed. Ch. Keefe noted that in order to have a four-way stop sign, the report
requires at least 200 vehicles in an hour on the less traveled street. The average number of
vehicles is 185. Ch. Keefe believes that combining the average number with the obstructed
view from Il Forno would warrant the four-way stop sign.

Ch. Keefe noted that in the past four years, there have been nine traffic accidents at the
intersection. In that time, the Commission has received at least two requests for a traffic
control device in the intersection. Ch. Keefe stated there is a school bus that puts out a stop
sign every day and there has not been an issue.

Mr. Karkazis made a motion to recommend a four-way stop sign at Robert York and Osterman
Road. Mr. Brown seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.

Mr. Karkazis suggested monitoring the intersection for a few weeks after the stop signs are
installed, to ensure vehicles are not stacking up to the train. Ms. Collins would also
recommend a pedestrian count be done at peak times, on a Thursday and a Saturday.

2. Consideration of recommending a Pedestrian Ordinance for streets with full sidewalks

Ch. Keefe noted the Village already has an Ordinance regarding pedestrians walking on
thoroughfares. Mr. Brown received a phone call from a resident complaining about a runner in
the middle of the street, when there is a sidewalk on both sides. Ch. Keefe read the
Ordinance, which prohibits pedestrians from walking in the street when there is a full sidewalk.
Ch. Keefe suggested putting a friendly reminder in D-Tails regarding section 22-56 of the
Village Code.

Items from the Commission

There were no additional items from the Commission.

Adjournment:

There being no further business or discussion, the meeting was adjourned at 8:00 pm.

The next regular meeting of the Safety Council will take place on June 26, 2012.

MEMORANDUM
To:         Mr. Robert Phillips
            Assistant Village Engineer ­ Village of Deerfield

From:       Daniel P. Brinkman, P.E., PTOE
Date:       February 27 2012
Subject: Safety Commission Concerns
         Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
         Deerfield, IL


Per your request, GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. (GHA) reviewed the comments and requests for
clarification and additional information made by the Village's Safety Commission and reported in the
November 29, 2011 Meeting Minutes. Specifically, the following will review and provide comments to
address the following concerns:

      Pedestrian Volumes during the September traffic counts conducted by GHA for the Warrant Study.
      Potential for eastbound traffic to queue back to the railroad tracks should an All-Way Stop be
      installed.
      Viability or potential to construct a roundabout or traffic circle.
      Potential to install supplemental pedestrian warning signs and their effectiveness.

Pedestrian Data

Recall that GHA conducted a 12-hour traffic count at the subject Robert York / Osterman Avenue
intersection during September 2011. A summary of the data was provided to the Village as part of our
Traffic Warrant Study. The pedestrian data was inadvertently omitted from the initial report printouts,
but subsequently provided to the Village's Engineering department. A revised Exhibit 3A summarizing
the traffic volumes as well as the pedestrian data is attached.

Adding the pedestrian volumes crossing Osterman Avenue raises the number of hours where the minor
approach (Robert York) has an entering volume of 200 (vehicles and pedestrians) from one hour to two
hours, still well short of the 8 required per the MUTCD All Way stop warrant.

Traffic Queues

To estimate the traffic queue for eastbound traffic should an All Way Stop be installed, GHA conducted
an All Way Stop Controlled (AWSC) analysis based on the observed traffic volumes in accordance with
the process outlined in the Transportation Research Board's 2010 Highway Capacity Manual and
calculated the estimated 95% queue based on the results. Should an All-Way Stop be installed at the
subject intersection, the anticipated maximum vehicle queue or stack back towards the railroad tracks
would be approximate 3 vehicles or 75 feet given the current traffic volumes.
The distance between the RR Right of Way and the approximate location of a Stop bar on Osterman
Avenue (if an All Way Stop were to be installed) is approximately 260 feet. Using the vehicle distance
prescribed by IDOT of 25 feet per vehicle, approximately 10 vehicles could queue between the RR
                                                                               Traffic Commission Response
                                                                    Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                                              Deerfield, IL

tracks and the intersection before the potential to have a vehicle queued on the tracks would occur. GHA
conducted a "sensitivity analysis" and determined that if the through volumes on each approach
doubled, the eastbound queue for an All Way Stop condition would be estimated at 11.3 vehicles, which
would extend to the RR crossing. Understanding that there may be occasions throughout the year (e.g.
parades using Deerfield Road, over-height vehicles that get stuck under the viaduct) where volume at the
intersection of Osterman and Robert York could potentially double, could suggest that if an All Way
Stop were posted, there could be instances when a queue would extend to the crossing. At times like
that, it may be beneficial for the Village to consider a traffic control officer at the intersection which
would serve to allow Robert York traffic to enter the intersection, permit the safe and efficient crossing
of pedestrians and monitor the queuing of eastbound vehicles for short periods of time in lieu of a
permanent All Way Stop installation.

Traffic Circle / Modern Roundabout

It is first critical to understand the difference between traffic circles and modern roundabouts. A traffic
circle is smaller, has not significant approach and departure geometrics, is not normally installed on
roadways other than local / residential streets, has a minimal diameter (10-25 feet) that fits within the
existing intersection curbs and is intended primarily as a traffic calming device to slow travel speeds or
deter unwanted (e.g. cut through) traffic. An example of a local street traffic circle design criteria is
attached.

A modern roundabout, has standard design components, specific geometric design criteria for approach
and departure roadways, typically have intersection diameters between 85-130 feet, and are intended to
function at locations where it is desirable to keep traffic moving at all times. An example of a single lane
roundabout design is also attached

As we understand the primary concerns of residents desiring an All-Way Stop installation, it is related to
safety of pedestrians needing to cross Osterman Avenue. Roundabouts are designed specifically to keep
traffic moving at all times (albeit at a lower speed) but present numerous other challenges for
accommodating pedestrians.

We would not recommend the installation of either a traffic circle or a modern roundabout at the subject
intersection.

Supplemental Pedestrian Crossing Signage

One of the final recommendations that came from the Safety Commission was to consider the use of
additional pedestrian warning signs. Signage alone is rarely sufficient to change driver, however
anything that can increase driver attention has been shown to improve safety results. At other locations
the Village has installed pedestrian crossing signs with push-button activated flashing lights. Studies
have shown increased compliance with these types of devised over unmarked crossings, painted
markings only and signage without supplemental lighting.

There is no specific warrant for the installation of pedestrian warning signs contained in the MUTCD.
The Village could install pedestrian warning signs with or without supplemental flashers, but should
follow the guidance presented in the MUTCD with respect to the location and placement of signs and
supplemental plaques. Should the village place the warning sign in advance of the crossing on Osterman
                                                             GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. ­ Page 2

                                                                   Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                                             Deerfield, IL

it should be supplemented with a plaque indicating the distance to the crossing. Similarly, if the Village
posts a sign at the crossing, the sign should be supplemented with an arrow plaque pointing to the
crossing location.

The Village could also choose to place "Stop Here for Pedestrian" signage in advance of the marked
crossings on Osterman.

I hope that you find these comments helpful. Should you have any additional questions, please do not

WARRANT STUDY
To:         Mr. Robert Phillips
            Assistant Village Engineer ­ Village of Deerfield

From:       Daniel P. Brinkman, P.E., PTOE
Date:       October 17, 2011
Subject: Traffic Control Warrant / Review
         Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
         Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
         Deerfield, IL


                                      PART I. PROJECT CONTEXT
GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. (GHA) received a request from the Village of Deerfield to review
the existing traffic control at the above referenced intersections to determine if the current posting of
Stop signs was warranted in conformance with the standards as published in the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and to provide recommendations if changes were necessary.

                                PART II BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Exhibit 1 ­ Location Maps

      Exhibits 1A and 1B provide location maps of the subject intersections:

      The Robert York Avenue / Osterman Avenue intersection is located southwest of downtown
      Deerfield and the Deerfield Square shopping center.

      The Meadowbrook Lane / Margate Terrace intersection is located northeast of downtown Deerfield
      and near the northwest corner of Deerspring Park just west of Lions Drive.

Exhibit 2 ­ Photo Inventory

      Exhibits 2A and 2B provide a photo inventory of current traffic operations at each intersection.
      Pertinent comments include:

      2A ­ Robert York Ave at Osterman Ave

         This four ­ legged intersection is currently signed as a two-way stop controlled (TWSC)
         intersection with Stop signs for the north and south Robert York Avenue approaches.
                                                                              Traffic Control Warrant / Review
                                                                       Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                        Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
                                                                                                 Deerfield, IL

       The surrounding area is a shopping center on the north side and mixed residential / commercial
       on the south side.
       An existing commercial building at the northeast corner of the intersection restricts sight lines to
       the east along Osterman from the north approach as does a heavily landscaped area on the
       southeast corner.
       The posted speed limit on Osterman Avenue is 25-mph. There is no posted limit on Robert York
       Ave.

   2B ­ Meadowbrook Lane at Margate Terrace

       This "T" intersection is currently signed as a two-way stop controlled (TWSC) intersection with
       Stop signs for the north and Meadowbrook and east (westbound) Margate Terrace approaches.
       The surrounding area is a variety of single family residential developments, varying from
       traditional city lots to more rural larger lots.
       Margate Terrace provides an approximately 22 ­foot wide curb and gutter section and is posted
       25-mph.
       Meadowbrook Lane is posted as a private road north of the intersection. It provides a narrow
       (20-foot) pavement section and is a rural (no curb and gutter) roadway section. The posted speed
       limit on Meadowbrook is 15-mph.

Exhibit 3 ­ Existing Traffic

   Exhibits 3A and 3B summarize the existing traffic counts conducted by GHA. 12 Hour (6 am to 6
   pm) counts were conducted at each intersection using the video based Miovision technology. Data
   was collected at the Robert York / Osterman and Meadowbrook / Margate intersections in
   September 2011. Hourly volumes are summarized, and complete data collection results in 15-minute
   intervals are provided in Appendix I.

                         PART III TRAFFIC CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
Background

The Illinois Vehicle Code incorporates by reference the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) which standardizes and governs the posting of traffic control devices (e.g. traffic signals, stop
signs, roadway information signs, etc...). Sections 2B.06 and 2B.07 discuss the installation of Stop
Signs and Multi-Way Stop applications respectively (see Appendix II).

The MUTCD establishes criteria which should be considered prior to installing traffic control signage.
Data to be considered includes traffic volumes, crash history, sight lines and an allowance is also made
for engineering judgment in some cases. The following paraphrases the MUTCD language

Typical Stop applications (or TWSC) require the minor street to Stop for the major street. This is the
most common type of Stop application and has fairly limited requirements for posting, including:
    Guidance to consider a Yield sign prior to installation of a Stop sign
    Vehicular volume on the through street of 6,000 vehicles per day (vpd)
                                                          GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. ­ Page 2
                                                                               Traffic Control Warrant / Review
                                                                        Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                         Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
                                                                                                  Deerfield, IL
       Restricted view considerations
       Crash history of collisions subject to correction by posting Stop Control (not all collisions are
       correctable).

Due to the greater impacts on overall intersection operations, the criteria for installation of Multi-Way or
All Way Stop control (AWSC) are more stringent and more detailed and suggest that an engineering
study is necessary:

       Should be based on an engineering study
       When traffic signals are warranted
       Crash history (5 or more correctable crashes in a 12 month period)
       Minimum vehicular volumes
       o Total entering volume of 300 vph for 8 hours on major approach and
       o Minor approach volume (including pedestrians and bikes) of 200 per hour and average delay
          of 30 seconds per vehicle during highest hour
       o Adjustments for traveled speed


                                        PART IV EVALUATION
In addition to the volume counts tabulated in Exhibits 3A and 3B, GHA reviewed the crash data
provided by the Village of Deerfield for the intersections and conducted field visits to observe
operations.

Robert York Ave at Osterman Ave

       Minimum volume not met for AWSC. Major street volume is greater than 300 for most observed
       hours, but minor street volume only exceeded 200 vph for one observed hour.
       GHA was provided with 9 crash reports dating from April 2011 to September 2007. Of the 9
       reported crashes in the vicinity of the intersection there were three Angle collisions, a correctable
       type of crash. However, the number and frequency do not meet the criteria.
       There are sight limitations for the north and south approaches; however the Osterman approaches
       are generally obstruction free and provide the minimum stopping sight distance.

It is our opinion that the existing TWSC posting is appropriate and that AWSC at this intersection is not
warranted.

Meadowbrook Lane at Margate Terrace

       Traffic volume at this location is minimal and does not meet the suggested criteria for either
       TWSC or AWSC, as only two hours out of the 12 counted exceed 100 vph of total entering
       volume.
       There were no crashes at this location that resulted in crash reports filed by the Village of
       Deerfield police department.



                                                             GEWALT HAMILTON ASSOCIATES, INC. ­ Page 3
                                                                                Traffic Control Warrant / Review
                                                                         Robert York Avenue @ Osterman Avenue
                                                                          Meadowbrook Lane @ Margate Terrace
                                                                                                   Deerfield, IL
         The lack of any intersection light and limited sight lines for traffic approaching from the east and
         for vehicles looking east along Margate from Meadowbrook are likely the reason for the
         somewhat unconventional two way posting (i.e. northbound and westbound traffic only).

It is our opinion that the existing TWSC posting is appropriate for the traffic volume, roadway geometry
and sight lines at the intersection. The MUTCD suggests and we recommend that the Village install
supplemental plaques on the existing Stop sign posts to clarify that ONCOMING (for westbound traffic)
and TRAFFIC FROM THE RIGHT (for southbound traffic) DOES NOT STOP.

                                               PART VI CONCLUSION
GHA has reviewed the traffic volumes, operations, sight lines and when available traffic crash history at
the two subject intersections. At this time, we see no reason to change either intersection to an All Way
or Multi Way Stop sign. We would recommend that the Robert York / Osterman intersection remain as
posted. Consideration could be given to a review of crash data again should a pattern develop or the
Village receive additional complaints. We feel that the current posting at the Meadowbrook / Margate
intersection, while somewhat unconventional, is appropriate and recommend that supplemental signage
be installed to clarify for motorists who may not be familiar with the area that the intersection is not an
All Way Stop.

History:              This message has been forwarded.


Dear Mayor,and the board of trustees,
    My name is Laura Lisitza I was the witness and first on the scene to the recent horrific accident where
an elderly woman was hit by a car at the troubled intersection of osterman and robert york rd.
what about installing the same flashing pedxing sign that is on deerfield rd with the bright white crosswalk
with thick white stripes on it to help alert drivers to possible pedestrians. also the word SLOW painted
on the road just like turn only words are used. this would not involve the possible cars backed up on the
train tracks that the four way stop seemed to have caused. there are so many middle school students
who also
use these crosswalks and my child is one of them .Please make sure we do Something to change this
dangerous situation.
                                                           sincerely,

                                                    Laura Lisitza

Subject:     OPINION: Four way stop signs at Robt. York and Central are not necessary




As a long-time resident, I understand that the Village Safety Commission recently voted to
recommend that four way stop signs be placed on Central (there are already stops at Robt, York.)
These are unnecessary!

I had the un-nerving experience last year when Deerfield Road was closed of using Central while
the pedestrian tunnel was being built and experiencing a vehicle backup on Central that extended
from the temporary stop signs on Robt. York west to the Metra tracks. I was the last vehicle in a
line of traffic and nearly escaped from being trapped on the Metra tracks.

I understand that the village traffic consultant recommended earlier against 4-way stops on this
stretch, and I fully agree since pedestrian foot traffic is minimal throughout the day, partularly
she Shephard School is in session. A yield sign would certainly be more than appropriate on
Central, both east and west, over the Safety Commission's proposed 4-way stop signs. Recalling
my experience, I'm convinced this could potentially create a serious accident - with serious legal
ramifications for the Village - should traffic back up westward to the Metra tracks as did happen
to me last year. In my opinion, stop signs are overkill on a busy traffic artery that us residents
living in the southwest quadrant frequently use to reach the Post Office, the shops in Deerfield
Square, banks, and other downtown destinations. My suggestion is to overrule the falacious
Safety Commission decision (there are only 4 or 5 people on this Commission that seldom meets
I understand - hardly arriving at a community consensus) and either leave the intersection as is
with stop signs only at Robt. York, or additionally add yield signs on Central to safeguard any
limited pedestrian traffic. Your consideration would be appreciated when the Board discusses
this issue. I would be happy to expound further by phone at (847) 945-5661. Sincerely, Edward
Collins, 617 Indian Hill Rd., Deerfield

Subject                Ordinance Amending Article 9 of Chapter 10 of the Municipal Code of the Village of
                       Deerfield to Establish Standards for the Construction of Facilities in the Public Right-of
                       Way

Action Requested:      First Reading

Originated By:         Village Manager's Office

Referred To:           Village President and Board of Trustees

Summary of Background and Reason for Request

While working on the renewal of the Village's franchise agreement with Comcast, staff determined it
would be in the best interest of the Village to update our right-of-way construction standards. Though the
State and Federal regulations for cable and telecommunications companies have eliminated at a lot of the
local authority over these companies, the Village still maintains full control and authority of its right-of-
way.

The Illinois Municipal League worked on a set of standards that could be used as a model ordinance for
municipalities. Not only does this make it easier for municipalities to adopt stricter right-of-way controls, it
gives the cable and telecommunications a more consistent set of regulations from municipality to municipality.

The attached ordinance is the IML model with some minor modifications to reflect Deerfield's needs. It is
staff's intention to have the new standards in place prior to approving a new franchise agreement with
Comcast. Staff anticipates having the new franchise agreement before the board for consideration either the
second meeting in July or the first meeting in August.

Jennifer Maltas, Assistant to the Village Manager and Village Attorney Cobletnz will be available at the
meeting to answer any questions.

RE:               Ordinance Establishing Construction Standards and
                  Regulations for Utilities Within the Public Rights-of-Way

DATE:             June 12, 2012


        We have provided an ordinance that amends Article 9 of Chapter 9 ofthe Village Code to
establish standards for the construction of utility facilities in public rights-of-way in the Village. The
purpose of the ordinance is to establish generally applicable regulations that will accommodate·and
control the location of utility facilities in Village rights-of-way, consistent with several significant
changes in the law that occurred since 1999.

        The proposed ordinance is derived from a model ordinance that was originally drafted by a
committee of municipal attorneys working under the auspices of the Illinois Municipal League. The
need for the ordinance was created by the adoption of the Telecommunications Municipal
Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act, 35 ILCS 635/1, et seq. (the "IMF Act"). The IMF Act
substantially eliminated the ability of municipalities to require that telecommunications retailers
enter into municipal franchise or license agreements, and to pay negotiated franchise fees, as a
condition for the right to use public streets and rights-of-way. At the same time, the IMF Act
allowed municipalities to establish a regulatory scheme for the use of public rights-of-way by
telecommunications carriers. This is when the initial model right-of-way construction standards
ordinance ("R-0- W Ordinance") was developed.

       The wireless telecommunications industry subsequently challenged the constitutionality of
the IMF Act in 2006. That resulted in the adoption ofthe Simplified Municipal Telecommunications
Tax Act (35 ILCS 636/5-1, et seq.) which replaced the IMF fee with the Simplified Municipal ·
Telecommunications Tax. The Village has adopted the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications
Tax.

Jennifer Maltas
Re: R-0-W Construction Standards Ordinance
June 12, 2012



        The Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-100, et seq.) was
subsequently adopted. It further impacted municipal authority over public rights-of-way by
establishing a statewide authorization process for cable and video service providers to use public
rights-of-way, and granting those providers the right to use public rights-of-way. However, the
Cable and Video Competition Law also required such cable and video users to comply with local
right-of-way regulations, provided those regulations were generally applicable to all right-of-way
users.

         The Illinois Municipal League reacted to the 2007legislation by reconstituting the lawyer's
committee who revisited the 1999 model ordinance and recommended further modifications to R-O-
W ordinance to make it applicable to cable providers and video service providers such as the AT&T
U-Verse service. The enclosed ordinance includes the modifications recommended in 2007 by the
Illinois Municipal League.

There are several aspects of the ordinance that I would specifically draw your attention to.

       ·       Section 19-64(c) of the ordinance which describes the facilities are regulated under
               the ordinance. As you will see, this ordinance is generally applicable to any utility
               facility that is currently located or may be constructed in the future within Village
               rights-of-way, except as may otherwise be provided by an applicable franchise,
               license or similar agreement. As you know, the Village does have franchise
               agreements with several utility providers, including Comcast, and these agreements
               will prevail over any contrary regulations.

       ·       The Village Engineer is made responsible in the ordinance for administering the
               regulations and issuing permits.

       ·       Section 19-66 of the ordinance requires that utilities that occupy Village rights-of-
               way must be registered with the Village. Because the prior ordinance also required
               registration, I believe that all utility-type companies with facilities in the Village are
               currently registered with the Village.

       ·       Please note that Section 19-67(f) provides that the application fee for any permits
               issued pursuant to this article must be accompanied by a fee in the amount
               established in the annual fee resolution of the Village. There is no fee structure in

Re: R-0-W Construction Standards Ordinance

             the ordinance. Generally speaking, these fees are set a fairly low, fixed dollar
             amounts to approximate the cost of engineering review.

      ·      There are several exceptions to the general obligation to pay permit fees under the
             ordinance. No permit fees are required of any utility which operates pursuant to a
             franchise or license agreement, including the cable company. Electric utilities that
             pay the electricity infrastructure maintenance fee are also exempt from paying any
             permit fees; however, only electricity "deliverers" are subject to paying the electric
             infrastructure maintenance fee, and there are no such entities currently delivering
             electricity in the Village.

      ·       Sections 19-67 and 19-68 describe the permit process. This is particularly important
             -with respect to telecommunications companies which have the right under the
              Telephone Company Act to have an expedited determination of whether their
              proposed location for a telecommunications facility is acceptable or not. For
              facilities that do not require any excavation work, a telecommunications retailer must
              give the Village 10 days' prior written notice consisting of plans, specifications and
              other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of any proposed
              new facility. See Section 19-68(b). If the proposed installation involves excavation,
              the telecommunications retailer must give at least 30 days' notice to the Village. The
              Village is required to respond within these time frames, or approval is granted by
              default.

      ·      Please note that video service providers have a similar right (see Section 19-68(c))
             to have the Village grant or deny their permit applications within 45 days.

      ·      Whenever the Village receives a notice under the Telephone Company Act, the
             Village Engineer should specify in writing that portion of the Village right-of-way
             where the new facility may be placed, used or constructed. This is most important,
             obviously, in the case of underground facilities where excavation work would
             normally be anticipated.

      ·      The ordinance requires that utility companies within Village rights-of-way must
             maintain liability insurance naming the Village as an additional insured, and that they
             indemnify and hold the Village harmless against any liability arising out of any
             wrongful acts or omissions by the utility or its agents. See Sections 19-71 and 19-72.

Jennifer Maltas
Re: R-0-W Construction Standards Ordinance
June 12, 2012

       ·       The ordinance authorizes the revocation or suspension of a permit issued for a utility
               facility. See Section 19-74.
       ·       Section 19-7 6 is very important because it sets forth a number of rules and
               regulations that utilities must comply with when constructing or operating utility
               facilities within public rights-of-way.

       ·       Section 19-77 sets forth traffic control regulations.

       ·       Section 19-78 establishes generally applicable regulations controlling where utility
               facilities may be located.

       ·       Section 19-79 establishes what types of construction methods may be employed
               when doing utility work in public rights-of-way, including directional boring,
               trenching and backfilling.

       ·       Section   19~80   sets forth requirements for tree-trimming and vegetation control.

       ·       Section 19-81 is important because it establishes rules for when the Village may
               require a utility to remove or relocate a facility within the right of way.

       ·       Sections. 19-82 and 19-83 establish maintenance and restoration requirements.

Conclusion:

       It is my recommendation that the Village Board adopt the right-of-way construction standards
ordinance.

       Sec. 19-64.    Purpose and Scope.

       (a)     Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to establish policies and procedures for
       constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the Village's jurisdiction, which will
       provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and
       visual qualities of the Village rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.

       (b)     Intent. In enacting this Article, the Village of Deerfield intends to exercise its
       authority over the rights-of-way in the Village of Deerfield and, in particular, the use of
       the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address
       issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:

              (1)     prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways
                      and other public ways and places;

              (2)     prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
                      conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;

              (3)     prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the Village of
                      Deerfield's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way
                      or public property;

       (4)     protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the
               installation of utility facilities;

       (5)     protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
               materials that increase impermeable surfaces;

       (6)     preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
               installed;

       (7)     preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that characterize
               the Village of Deerfield's residential neighborhoods;

       (8)     prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-
               way; and

       (9)     assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent
               to utility facilities locations.

(c)     Facilities Subject to This Article. This Article applies to all facilities on, over,
above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public rights-of-way within the
jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of
this Article may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as
presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable
franchise, license or similar agreement. This Article shall not apply to any facilities
constructed by others to be owned by the Village.

(d)     Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The Village, in its discretion and as
limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement
for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within the Village rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such
an agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
Article.

(e)    Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.

       (1)     Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
       inconsistency between, the provisions of this Article and the provisions of any
       franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any

       (2)      Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers. In the event that a
       utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar
       agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall
       govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or
       extension thereof.

(f)     Conflicts with Other Ordinances. This Article supersedes all ordinances or parts
of ordinances adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith to the extent of such
conflict.

       (6)    Drawings, plans and specifications showing the work proposed, including
       the certification of an engineer that such drawings, plans, and specifications
       comply with applicable codes, rules, and regulations;

       (7)     Evidence of insurance as required in Section 19-71 of this Article;

       (8)     Evidence of posting of the security fund as required in Section 19-73 of
       this Article;

       (9)    Any request for a variance from one or more provisions of this Article
       (See Section 19-84); and

       (10)    Such additional information as may be reasonably required by the Village.

(d)    Supplemental Application Requirements for Specific Types of Utilities. In
addition to the requirements of Subsection (c) of this Section, the permit application shall
include the following items as applicable to the specific utility that is the subject of the
permit application:



                                  Page 12 of 39                                   June 12, 2012
       (1)     In the case of the installation of a new electric power, communications,
       telecommunications, cable service, video service or natural gas distribution
       system installation, evidence that any "Certificate of Public Convenience and
       Necessity" or other regulatory authorization that the applicant is required by law
       to obtain, or that applicant has elected to obtain, has been issued by the ICC or
       other jurisdictional authority;

       (2)    In the case of natural gas systems, state the proposed pipe size, design,
       construction class, and operating pressures;

       (3)     In the case of water lines, indicate that all requirements of the Illinois
       Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Public Water Supplies, have been
       satisfied and provide copies of IEPA permits;

       (4)     In the case of sewer line installations, indicate that the land and water
       pollution requirements of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Division
       of Water Pollution Control and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District
       (where applicable) or other local or state entities with jurisdiction, have been
       satisfied; or

       (5)    In the case of petroleum products pipelines, state the type or types of
       petroleum products, pipe size, maximum working pressure, and the design
       standard to be followed.

(e)      Applicant's Duty to Update Information.           Throughout the entire permit
application review period and the construction period authorized by the permit, any
amendments to information contained in a permit application shall be submitted by the
utility in writing to the Village within thirty (30) days after the change necessitating the
amendment.

(f)     Application Fees. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, all applications for permits pursuant to this Article shall be accompanied by a
fee in the amount established in the annual fee resolution of the Village of Deerfield. No
application fee is required to be paid by any electric utility that is paying the municipal
electricity infrastructure maintenance fee pursuant to the Electricity Infrastructure
Maintenance Fee Act.

Sec. 19-68.    Action on Permit Applications.

(a)     Village Review of Permit Applications.         Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of Public
Works and Engineering within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Director of Public Works and Engineering shall reject such application in

                                  Page 13 of 39                                   June 12, 2012
writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Director of Public Works and Engineering are
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Article and all
applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director shall issue a
permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant
to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works and Engineering, that
the construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this Article.

(b)    Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications Retailers.

       (1)      Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
       telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to commence
       work governed by this Article for facilities for the provision of
       telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications,
       and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
       facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the Village
       not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
       excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of work
       requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works and Engineering shall specify
       the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and
       constructed.

       (2)     In the event that the Director of Public Works and Engineering fails to
       provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within
       either (i) ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village by the
       telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new
       construction or (ii) twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the
       telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
       construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
       obtaining a permit under this Article. For purposes of determining when the ten
       or twenty-five day period specified in this sub-section begins, service of notice to
       the Village shall be considered to have occurred on the date that the Village has
       received all of the documentation required to be submitted under Section 19-
       68(b)(1).

       (3)      Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a permit is
       required for work pursuant to Section 19-67 of this Article the
       telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village an application for a permit
       and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available regarding the
       facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of
       Subsection (a) of this Section.

(c)    Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State Authorization
under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications by a utility that is a

                                   Page 14 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of
2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five (45) days after the submission to the Village,
unless otherwise acted upon the Village, provided the holder has complied with all
applicable Village codes, ordinances and regulations.

Sec. 19-69.    Effect of Permit.

(a)      Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit from
the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with
this Article on Village rights-of-way, and does not create a property right or grant
authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest
in the rights-of-way.

(b)     Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the Village
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and
all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.

Sec. 19-70.    Revised Permit Drawings.

In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from
the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the
permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the
Village within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this Article, it shall be treated as a request for variance
in accordance with Section 19-84 of this Article. If the Village denies the request for a
variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or
modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.

Sec. 19-71.    Insurance.

(a)      Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license,
or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies
insuring the utility as named insured and naming the Village, and its elected and
appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies
listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) below:

       (1)     Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations,
       explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as "X", "C",
       and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with limits not
       less than:

                                   Page 15 of 39                                   June 12, 2012
               (i) Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to each
               person;

               (ii) Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting from
               any one accident; and

               (iii) Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of liability;

       (2)    Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
       combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury and
       property damage for each accident;

       (3)     Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and

       (4) Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one million dollars
           ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.

If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors
performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this
Section.

(b)    Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section may be in
any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella
policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis
such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the
primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.

(c)     Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required
by this Section to the Village within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request
therefor from the Village. In lieu of a copy of the policy, a certificate indicating that the
insurance policies required by this Section have been obtained and are in force, may be
submitted with the approval of the Director of Public Works and Engineering.

(d)    Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:

       "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
       nor the intention not to renew be stated until ten (10)) days after receipt by
       the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
       a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel
       or not to renew."



                                  Page 16 of 39                                      June 12, 2012
Within seven days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event later than
three days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village
evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this Section.

(e)      Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirements required by Subsection (a) of this Section. A utility that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the
requirement for the naming of additional insureds under Subsection (a), or the
requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this Section. A utility that elects to self-
insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability
to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under Subsection a)
of this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the
Workers Compensation Act.

(f)     Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The legal liability of
the utility to the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self-insurance required by this Section shall not be limited by such
insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.

Sec. 19-72.    Indemnification.

By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be deemed to
agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials
and officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including
reasonable attorney's fees, and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions,
failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-
of-way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Article or by a franchise, license,
or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations
hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or
expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Article by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.

Sec. 19-73.    Security.

(a)     Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an
amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained
in accordance with this Section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the
completion of the work authorized under the permit. The Security Fund shall serve as
security for:


                                  Page 17 of 39                                    June 12, 2012
       (1)     The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this
       Article;

       (2)    Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by
       the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
       permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this Article; and

       (3)     The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or
       expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-
       performance by permittee in violation of this Article including, without limitation,
       any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this
       Article to perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as a
       consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other
       payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this Article or any other
       applicable law.

(b)      Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at
the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an
unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or
letter of credit provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:

       (1)    Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and
       the permittee;

       (2)    Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the
       Village of any amounts covered by it; and

       (3)    Shall provide a location within Cook, McHenry, Lake, Kane, or DuPage
       Counties, Illinois at which it can be drawn.

(c)      Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for
the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as
that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Village, and
may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to
be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in
the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a
related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases,
the Village may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this Subsection c)
for any single phase.

                                  Page 18 of 39                                   June 12, 2012
(d)     Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this
Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the permittee
has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice
period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

       (1)    Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
       hereunder;

       (2)     Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;

       (3)    Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses
       which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or
       non-performance by the permittee; or

       (4)    Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that the Village
       determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.

(e)     Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the
Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall
restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in Subsection c) of this Section.

(f)    Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the
amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written
request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not
reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required in Subsection c) of this
Section.

(g)     Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized
under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such
portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for
all offsets necessary to compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with
any provisions of this Article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of
the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or
damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts
in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.

(h)     Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the
Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this
Article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with
respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the Village may have.


                                  Page 19 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary
recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

Sec. 19-74.   Permit Suspension and Revocation.

(a)    Village Right to Revoke Permit. The Village may revoke or suspend a permit
issued pursuant to this Article for one or more of the following reasons:

       (1)    Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete statements in
       the permit application;

       (2)    Non-compliance with this Article;

       (3)     Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities on, over,
       above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public rights-of-way presents a
       direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare; or

       (4)    Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in accordance
       with the permit and approved plans.

(b)     Notice of Revocation or Suspension. The Village shall send written notice of its
intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this Article stating the reason or
reasons for the revocation or suspension and the alternatives available to permittee under
this Section.

(c)    Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of Revocation or Suspension.
Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from the Village, the
permittee shall have the following options:

       (1)    Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no cause exists for the
       revocation or suspension;

       (2)     Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the deficiencies
       stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such correction to the
       Village within five (5) working days after receipt of the written notice of
       revocation;

       (3)     Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along, upon,
       under, across, or within the public rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way to
       the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof of such removal to the
       Village within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.

The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time periods
provided in this Subsection; or

                                 Page 20 of 39                                    June 12, 2012
(d)     Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation or
suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery of any
of the reasons for revocation set forth within Subsection (a) of this Section.

(e)     Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails to comply
with the provisions of Subsection (c) of this Section, the Village or its designee may, at
the option of the Village: (1) correct the deficiencies; (2) upon not less than twenty (20)
days notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or equipment; or (3) after not
less than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of failure to cure the non-compliance,
deem them abandoned and property of the Village. The permittee shall be liable in all
events to the Village for all costs of removal.

Sec. 19-75.    Change of Ownership or Owner's Identity or Legal Status.

(a)     Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village no less than thirty (30)
days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-of-way or change in
identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or the facility shall have all the
obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former owner under the permit, if any, and all
applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including this Article, with respect to
the work and facilities in the right-of-way.

(b)     Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be amended
to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or amended permit
issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have accepted, and agreed to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if the new owner uses the facility or
allows it to remain on the Village's right-of-way.

(c)   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must be
changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

Sec. 19-76.    General Construction Standards.

(a)     Standards and Principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall be consistent
with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations, and commonly recognized
and accepted traffic control and construction principles, sound engineering judgment and,
where applicable, the principles and standards set forth in any applicable ordinances,
rules, regulations or manuals of the Village and in the following IDOT publications, as
amended from time to time:

       (1)     Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction;

       (2)     Supplemental Specifications and Recurring Special Provisions;


                                 Page 21 of 39                                   June 12, 2012
       (3)     Highway Design Manual;

       (4)     Highway Standards Manual;

       (5)     Standard Specifications for Traffic Control Items;

       (6)     Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (92 Ill. Adm. Code §
               545);

       (7)     Flagger's Handbook; and

       (8)     Work Site Protection Manual for Daylight Maintenance Operations.

(b)     Interpretation of Municipal Standards and Principles. If a discrepancy exists
between or among differing principles and standards required by this Article, the Village
Engineer shall determine, in the exercise of sound engineering judgment, which
principles apply and such decision shall be final. If requested, the Village Engineer shall
state which standard or principle will apply to the construction, maintenance, or operation
of a facility in the future.

Sec. 19-77.    Traffic Control.

(a)     Minimum Requirements. The Village's minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in IDOT's Illinois Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
and this Code. The Village Director of Public Works and Engineering may require that
additional traffic protection measures be taken, if because of the location where the work
is to be performed or because of anticipated high traffic volumes, he determines
additional traffic protection measures are warranted.

(b)    Warning Signs, Protective Devices, and Flaggers. The utility is responsible for
providing and installing warning signs, protective devices and flaggers, when necessary,
meeting all applicable federal, state, and local requirements for protection of the public
and the utility's workers when performing any work on the public rights-of-way.

(c)     Interference with Traffic. All work shall be phased so that there is minimum
interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The Director of Public Works and
Engineering may prohibit work from being performed at specified hours or on specified
days where higher than usual traffic volumes are anticipated.

(d)      Notice When Access is Blocked. At least forty-eight (48) hours prior to beginning
work that will partially or completely block access to any residence, business or
institution, the utility shall notify the resident, business or institution of the approximate
beginning time and duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving


                                  Page 22 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
emergency repairs pursuant to Section 19-83 of this Article, the utility shall provide such
notice as is practicable under the circumstances.

(e)      Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any deficiencies in

types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of type, shall be subject to the
general location requirements of this subsection.

       (1)     No Interference with Village Facilities. No utility facilities shall be placed
               in any location if the Director of Public Works and Engineering
               determines that the proposed location will require the relocation or
               displacement of any of the Village of Deerfield's utility facilities or will
               otherwise interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the Village
               of Deerfield's utility facilities.

       (2)     Minimum Interference and Impact. The proposed location shall cause
               only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way
               and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference
               with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin
               said right-of-way.

       (3)     No Interference with Travel. No utility facility shall be placed in any
               location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.

       (4)     No Limitations on Visibility. No utility facility shall be placed in any
               location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.

       (5)     Size of Utility Facilities. The proposed installation shall use the smallest
               suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
               cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
               particular application.

(b)    Parallel Facilities Located Within Rights-of-Way.

       (1)     Overhead Parallel Facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be located
       within the right-of-way only if overhead utility facilities already exist in the area
       of the right-of-way where the overhead parallel facility is proposed to be located
       and if:



                                   Page 23 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
                    (i)     Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
             line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
             alignment will permit;

                     (ii)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as
             practicable from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m)
             behind the face of the curb, where available;

                    (iii) Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from
             pavement edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m)
             outside the outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear
             zone;

                     (iv)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and

                     (v)    Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one
             foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way or as near as possible to the right-of-way
             line.

      (2)    Underground Parallel Facilities. An underground parallel facility may be
      located within the right-of-way only if approved by the Director of Public Works
      and Engineering and:

             practicable and not more than eight (8) feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to
             the right-of-way line, and five (5) feet (1.5 m) from any water main;

                    (ii)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
             roadway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with
             sound engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing
             conduit without disrupting the pavement); and

                     (ii)    In the case of an underground power or communications
             line, the facility shall be located as approved by the Director of Public
             Works and Engineering and any above-grounded appurtenance shall be
             located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as
             practicable.

(c)   Facilities Crossing Roadways.

      (1)     No Future Disruption. The construction and design of crossing facilities
      installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village roadways may require the
      incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or additional
      cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadway resulting from the
      installation of such crossing facilities.


                                Page 24 of 39                                  June 12, 2012
       (2)     Culverts or Drainage Facilities. Crossing facilities shall not be located in
       culverts, or drainage facilities.

       (3)    90 Degree Crossing Required. Crossing facilities shall cross at or as near
       to a ninety (90) degree angle to the centerline as practicable, unless otherwise
       approved by the Village Engineer.

       (4)  Overhead Power or Communication Facility. An overhead power or
       communication facility may cross a right-of-way only if:

                      (i)      It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by
               ICC's rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and Communication
               Lines" (83 Ill. Adm. Code 305);

                      (ii)   Poles are located within one (1) foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-
               way line and outside of the clear zone; and

                       (iii)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.

       (5)   Underground Power or Communication Facility. An underground power
       or communication facility may cross a right-of-way only if:

                    (i)   The design materials and construction methods will provide
               maximum maintenance-free service life; and

                       (ii)    Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs
               is provided in the initial installation.

       (6)      Markers. The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at each
       right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
       communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type of
       facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
       eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. 192.707).

(d)     Facilities to be Located Within Particular Rights-of-Way. The Village may
require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way (a public utility easement,
for example) that are not highways, rather than within particular highways.

(e)    Freestanding Facilities.

       (1)    The Village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding facility
       located within a right-of-way.




                                  Page 25 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
      (2)    All freestanding facilities located within a right-of-way shall be located
      underground to the greatest extent possible, as determined by the Village
      Engineer, and to the extent that the Village Engineer determines that it is not
      technically possible to install any such facilities underground, such facilities shall
      be substantially screened from view by landscaping pursuant to a landscaping plan
      which shall be approved in advance by the Village Engineer and the Village
      Manager.

      (3)      All freestanding facilities within any right-of-way shall be so located so as
      to cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of such right-of-way
      and so as to cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with
      the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-
      of-way. No freestanding facilities shall be placed within any right-of-way in such
      a manner to interfere with the usual travel on such right-of-way, nor shall such
      facilities limit the visibility of vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic within such
      right-of-way.

(f)   Facilities Installed Above Ground. Above ground facilities may be installed only
if:

      (1)    No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;

      (2)    New underground installation is not technically feasible as determined by
      the Director of Public Works and Engineering; and

      (3)     The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will employ
      suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of aesthetic
      qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting safety. Suitable
      designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting, armless, single-pole
      construction with vertical configuration of conductors and cable and shall, in any
      event, include screening by landscaping pursuant to a landscape plan approved in
      advance by the Director of Public Works and Engineering. Existing utility poles
      and light standards shall be used wherever practicable ­ the installation of
      additional utility poles is strongly discouraged.

      (4)      The above ground facilities installed are located so as to cause only
      minimal interference with the use of any right-of-way within which the
      facilities are installed and with the rights and reasonable convenience of
      property owners who adjoin said right-of-way.

      (5)    The smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power
      pedestals, and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner for the type of
      above ground facility shall be used.




                                Page 26 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
      (6)     For purposes of this Article, a facility shall be considered above ground if
      more than ten percent of the overall height of the facility measured from the base
      or bottom support of the facility is located above ground.

(g)   Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.

      (1)     Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway structures
      only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of accommodating the
      facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but are not limited to,
      underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports and tower supports,
      all of which are completely separated from the bridge or roadway structure.
      Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile, flammable, corrosive, or
      energized, especially those under significant pressure or potential, present high
      degrees of risk and such installations are not permitted.

      (2)     A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility installation
      on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
      impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an application
      for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be based upon the
      following considerations:

                    (i)      The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to
             be transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and
             property in the event of damage to or failure of the facility;

                   (ii)    The type, length, value, and relative importance of the
             roadway structure in the transportation system;

                   (iii) The alternative routings available to the utility and their
             comparative practicability;

                     (iv)    The proposed method of attachment;

                    (v)     The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
             proposed facility;

                    (vi)     The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and
             painting;

                     (vii)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and

                   (viii) The public benefit expected from the utility service as
             compared to the risk involved.




                                Page 27 of 39                                    June 12, 2012
                      (ix)    Village may have an independent investigation done by a
              structural engineer with the cost of the investigation born by the applicant.

                      (x)    Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures may
              require a review by IDOT.

(h)    Appearance Standards.

       (1)    The Village may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular locations
              in order to preserve visual quality.

       (2)    A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require
              extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the
              right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
              does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.

Sec. 19-79.   Construction Methods and Materials.

(a)    Standards and Requirements for Particular Types of Construction Methods.

       (1)    Boring or Jacking.

                      (i)    Pits and Shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way
              shall be accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified
              by the Director of Public Works and Engineering from the edge of the
              pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall be excavated no more than 48
              hours in advance of boring or jacking operations and backfilled within 48
              hours after boring or jacking operations are completed. While pits are
              open, they shall be clearly marked and protected by barricades. Shoring
              shall be designed, erected, supported, braced, and maintained so that it will
              safely support all vertical and lateral loads that may be imposed upon it
              during the boring or jacking operation.

                     (ii)   Wet Boring or Jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
              permitted under the roadway.

                     (iii) Borings with Diameters Greater Than 6 Inches. Borings
              over six inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger
              and following pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the
              outside diameter of the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).

                     (iv)    Borings with Diameters 6 Inches or Less. Borings of six
              inches or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, guided
              with auger, or auger and following pipe method.



                                 Page 28 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
               (v)    Tree Preservation. Any facility located within the drip line
       of any tree designated by the Village to be preserved or protected shall be
       bored under or around the root system.

rights-of-way shall be done in accord with any applicable ordinances, rules,
regulations or manuals of the Village and the applicable portions of Section 603
of IDOT's "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction."

               (i)    Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the
       practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing.
       Only one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time
       unless special permission is obtained from the Director of Public Works
       and Engineering.

               (ii)    Open Trench and Excavated Material. Open trench and
       windrowed excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6
       of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where
       practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between the roadway
       and the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be
       allowed to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-
       way width does not allow for windrowing excavated material off the paved
       portion of the roadway, excavated material shall be hauled to an off-road
       location.

               (iii)   Drip Line. The utility shall not trench within the drip line
       of any tree.

(3)    Backfilling.

               (i)     Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the
       installation of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and
       length using methods and materials in accordance with any applicable
       ordinances, rules, regulations or manuals of the Village and with IDOT's
       "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction." When
       excavated material is hauled away or is unsuitable for backfill, suitable
       granular backfill shall be used.

                (ii)    For a period of three years from the date construction of a
       facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
       any backfill area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
       ordered by the Director of Public Works and Engineering, the utility, at its
       expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the
       installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and



                          Page 29 of 39                                   June 12, 2012
       restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper
       grades, as determined by the Director of Public Works and Engineering.

(4)    Pavement Cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair shall be
permitted on a roadway only if that portion of the roadway is closed to traffic. If a
variance to the limitation set forth in this paragraph is permitted under Section 19-
121, the following requirements shall apply:

              (i)     Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and
       compacted as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6, FA-6, or
       flowable fill, as designated by the Director of Public Works and
       Engineering.

               (ii)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as
       soon as practicable and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be
       provided immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary
       repair or the restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the Village.
       Pavement restoration shall meet material requirements as specified in the
       Standard Specifications.

               (iii)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.

               (iv)    For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
       concrete surface/base in the last seven (7) years, or resurfaced in the last
       four (4) years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined
       to be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary and
       unforeseen before the time of the reconstruction or resurfacing or unless a
       pavement cut is necessary for a J.U.L.I.E. locate.

(5)    Encasement.

               (i)     Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
       roadway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be
       continuous either by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed
       installation approved by the Village. Casing pipes shall be installed where
       required and approved by the Director of Public Works and Engineering.

               (ii)    The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within
       one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes
       shall be located in the area established as clear zone for that particular
       section of the roadway.

             (iii) In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement
       may be eliminated.



                          Page 30 of 39                                    June 12, 2012
                                (vi)    In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
                        with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated
                        only if: (1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
                        repair and (2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;

                               (v)     If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
                        pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction
                        does not disrupt the right-of-way.

                                  Page 33 of 39                                June 12, 2012
       (1)    Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of the
       Village, be required to be discontinued when such operations would create
       hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and welfare. Such operations may
       also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such that
       construction would result in extensive damage to the right-of-way or other
       property.

       (2)   These restrictions may be waived by the Director of Public Works and
       Engineering when emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.

       (3)     Works hours are as specified in the municipal code.

(e)      Location of Existing Facilities. Any utility proposing to construct facilities in the
Village shall contact J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain the presence and location of existing above-

facilities. The Village will make its permit records available to a utility for the purpose of
identifying possible facilities. When notified of an excavation or when requested by the
Village or by J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and physically mark its underground
facilities within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in accordance with the
Illinois Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.)

Sec. 19-80.    Vegetation Control.

(a)      Electric Utilities ­ Compliance with State Laws and Regulations. An electric
utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control activities in the right-of-way
in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and regulations, and additionally, with such
local franchise or other agreement with the Village of Deerfield as permitted by law.

(b)    Other Utilities ­ Tree Trimming Permit Required. Tree trimming that is done by
any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to
applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically governing same, shall not be
considered a normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this Article.

       (1)     Application for Tree Trimming Permit. Applications for tree trimming
       permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
       workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning practices.
       Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring
       that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.

       (2)     Damage to Trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
       misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the
       tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will require
       compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without


                                  Page 34 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
       authorization.    The formula developed by the International Society of
       Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
       damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
       removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave them
       in an unacceptable condition.

(c)     Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The Village may require that
special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special significance. The
required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other
means.

(d)    Chemical Use.

       (1)    Except as provided in the following paragraph, no utility shall spray, inject
       or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation in the Village for
       any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or disease.

       (2)    Spraying of any type of vegetation controlling chemicals will not be
       permitted on rights-of-way unless approved by the Director of Public Works and
       Engineering.

(a)      Notice. Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the Village, a
utility shall, at is own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect,
remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-
way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal, relocation,
change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or
installation of any Village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or
upon, the rights-of-way.

(b)      Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following written
notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized
facility or related appurtenances within the public rights-of-way shall, at its own expense,
remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the public rights-of-way.
A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:

       (1)    Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise,
       unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;

       (2)     If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a
       license or franchise, if required;

       (3)    If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a
       required permit in violation of this Article; or


                                  Page 35 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
       (4)    If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the
       permittee's license or franchise.

(c)      Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the right and
privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the Village, as
the Village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public
health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to
notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the
utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.

(d)     Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the public
rights-of-way of the Village, the utility shall notify the Village within ninety (90) days.
Following receipt of such notice the Village may direct the utility to remove all or any
portion of the facility if the Director of Public Works and Engineering determines that
such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the
event that the Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it,
by giving notice of abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to
consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person.

Sec. 19-82.    Cleanup and Restoration.

The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other
property within 10 days after any portion of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or
destroyed by the utility, to the satisfaction of the Village. This includes restoration of all
disturbed areas. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and
methods approved by the Director of Public Works and Engineering. Such cleanup and
repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, replacing
or replanting of flowers and shrubs or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to
a condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of
the project. The time period may be extended by the Village Manager for good cause
shown.



Sec. 19-83.    Maintenance and Emergency Maintenance.

(a)     General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights-
of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the Village

with normal procedures for securing a permit:



                                  Page 36 of 39                                     June 12, 2012
       (1)      If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-
       way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for
       traffic on the roadway or the public on the right-of-way including the use of signs,
       lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but
       the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of
       equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be
       provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted
       when no other means of access to the facility is available.

       (2)      In an emergency, the utility shall, immediately, notify the Village Police
       Department of the situation. This notification shall include a description of the
       problem, work being undertaken, and what steps have been taken for protection of
       the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
       the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
       traffic, the Village Police Department shall be notified immediately.

       (3)     In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs
       as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public.

(c)    Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the Director of Public
Works and Engineering a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within
48 hours after an emergency repair.

Sec. 19-84.   Variances.

(a)     Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the
provisions of this Article must do so in writing to the Director of Public Works and
Engineering as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision
of this Article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should
be granted.

(b)    Authority to Grant Variances. The Village Board shall decide whether a variance
is authorized for each provision of this Article identified in the variance request on an
individual basis.

(c)      Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Village Board may authorize a variance
only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:

       (1)     One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain
       features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would
       make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be
       achieved by the provision; and




                                 Page 37 of 39                                   June 12, 2012
       (2)      All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would
       conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable
       in relation to the requested approach.

(d)     Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for authorizing
a variance, the Village Board may require the utility requesting the variance to meet
reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within
this Article but which carry out the purposes of this Article.

(e)    Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or
determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Village Engineer under the
provisions of this Article shall have the right to appeal to the Village Manager of the
Village of Deerfield. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The Village Manager shall commence his or her consideration of the
appeal within not more than fifteen (15) days after the filing of the appeal. The Village
Manager shall timely decide the appeal.


Sec. 19-85.    Penalties.

Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the
provisions of this Article shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty
provisions of this Code. There may be times when the Village will incur delay or other
costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties
under its permit and this Article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the
cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the Village's
costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or
commission may review or overrule a permit related cost appointment of the Village.
Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility who does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

Sec. 19-86.    Enforcement.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies
that the Village may have for enforcement of this Article.

Sec. 19-86.    Severability.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Article is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

       SECTION 3: That this Ordinance, and each of its terms, shall be the effective legislative

act of a home rule municipality without regard to whether such Ordinance should: (a) contain

terms contrary to the provisions of current or subsequent non-preemptive state law; or, (b)

legislate in a manner or regarding a matter not delegated to municipalities by state law. It is the

intent of the corporate authorities of the Village of Deerfield that to the extent that the terms of

this Ordinance should be inconsistent with any non-preemptive state law, this Ordinance shall

supersede state law in that regard within its jurisdiction.

       SECTION 4: That this Ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its

passage, approval and publication in pamphlet form as provided by law.

Summary of Background and Reason for Request
General Manager, Jym Antoneule of 303 Taxi Services, L.L.C. will be present to request an amendment
to their Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for six (6) additional licenses. 303 Taxi currently

                                          Please accept this letter in response to your e-mail correspondence dated
                                  March 26, 201 2. As you are aware, 303 Taxi has requested additional vehicle
                                  licenses from the Village of Deerfield. To address your concern, the need for
                                  additional licenses relates to satisfying corporate demand, primarily that of Kraft.

                                  Senior Taxi Program has been a great success. For 2011, our affiliates provided 5248
                                  rides to seniors residing in Deerfield . We look forward to continuing our positive
                                  relationship with the Village ofDeerfield .



                                                                                      Very truly yours,

Subject:       Authorization to Award Bid for Three New 2012 Vacuum Leaf Loaders                _
Action Requested:       Award Bid to Standard Equipment Company (NTE $97,606.00)                    _
Originated By: Public Works Department                                                 ___          _
Referred To:       Mayor and Board of Trustees                                                      _

Background and Reason for Request

The Village solicited bids for three new 2012 replacement vacuum leaf loaders. Two sealed bids were
received, publicly opened and read aloud at 10:00 a.m. on May 23, 2012. The result of the bid opening
is as follows:

Budget:        $113,500.00
Bidders:                                                  Base Bid          Trade-In*        Net
 Standard Equipment Company ­ Chicago, IL                 $110,106.00     $12,500.00     $97,606.00
 R.G. Smith ­ Des Plaines, IL                            $105,540.00        $8,000.00 $97,540.00

*Trade-In: Three 2001 Giant Vac 6600JDTR, Vacuum Leaf Loader, Fleet # LF-2 #LF-3 #LF-4

Nether bid meets Village specifications in all categories. However, the leaf loader specified by
Standard Equipment Company meets all but axle capacity. The RG Smith bid did not meet
specifications in engine (alternator), axle capacity, or vacuum hose diameter size. Additionally,
R.G. Smith can not meet the delivery date provided in the specifications. Therefore staff
recommends awarding the bid to Standard Equipment Company.

The Village has been purchasing equipment and parts from Standard Equipment for over twenty
years, including three street sweepers and sewer cleaning equipment.

The Director of Public Works and Engineering requests the Board of Trustees award the bid for
three new replacement vacuum leaf loaders to Standard Equipment Company in an amount not to
exceed $97,606.00.

RE:                Madonna Long Term Care Facility,
                   1533 &1541 St. Joseph Blvd, Ottawa ON
                   Transportation Statement
                   Our File No. : 112040


City staff have confirmed that a transportation memo is required in support of a site plan
application for a proposed expansion of the existing Madonna Long Term Care Facility located
at 1533 & 1541 St. Joseph Blvd. This memo outlines our findings and conclusions with respect
to the likely traffic impact associated with the proposed expansion.


1.0      Proposed Expansion

The existing facility has 160 dwelling units, and the proposed development will add another 95
dwelling units. Access to the site is currently provided by four right-in, right-out driveways. Left
turns are prevented by a curbed median on St. Joseph Blvd. The median on St. Joseph
Boulevard is depressed across the clear throat width of the main access driveway, but this is
only to provide direct access in case of emergency. Left turns across the depressed median are
prohibited. The existing accesses currently tie into a paved shoulder that has an average width
of approximately 2.5 m across the site frontage. This paved shoulder also serves as an informal
bus bay for OC Transpo Bus Stop #2536, and is identified as an existing cycling facility in the
Ottawa Cycling Plan.

The previous site plan approved in 2005, as well as the revised site plan is shown in Appendix
A.

2.0      Site Traffic

Novatech (NECL) conducted a weekday PM peak hour traffic count at each of the existing
driveway accesses on Tuesday May 8th 2012, between 4:30 pm and 5:30 pm. NECL conducted
a Saturday count on Saturday May 26th 2012, between 11:00 am and 4:00 pm. The results of
the weekday and Saturday traffic counts can be found in Appendix B.

The weekday data indicates that across all four entrances, a total of 20 vehicles entered the
site, which is equivalent to a PM peak hour trip generation rate of 0.125 vph/unit. Assuming that
the 95 units proposed as part of this development will have the same rate of trip generation, it is
anticipated that they will generate a total of 12 additional arrivals during the weekday PM peak
hour.

The Saturday count shows that during the site's peak hour of trip generation (2 ­ 3 pm) a total
of 29 vehicles make the right turn movement into the site across all accesses. Based on the 160
existing units this translates to a rate of 0.181 vph/unit. If this rate is applied to the 95 additional
units, then an additional 17 vehicles may be expected during the site's Saturday peak hour.


3.0      Collision History

The recent collision history for this section of St. Joseph Boulevard is provided in Appendix C.
The collision history for this section indicates that 12 collisions have occurred in the last three
years, and only one of those collisions could be attributable to the existing access configuration
and/or the traffic generated by the existing development (angle collision between a SB vehicle
turning right, and a WB vehicle going ahead). This would suggest that there are no significant
safety concerns associated with the existing access configuration, which is to remain
unchanged following completion of the proposed development. The addition of the site traffic
volumes likely to be generated by additional 95 units is unlikely to compromise the safety of the
existing access configuration.


4.0      Roadway Modifications

City staff have previously identified a need to provide a right turn taper and/or deceleration lane
on St. Joseph Boulevard as part of the proposed development.

It is our position that addition of a right turn taper and/or lane is not required based on existing
or projected turning traffic volumes at any of the access driveways, and there are no current
M:\2012\112040\DATA\CORRESPONDENCE\MEMOS\2012JUN18-TRANSPORTATION STATEMENT.DOCX
problems regarding the operational safety of the turning movements generated by the existing
development. The addition of a right turn taper and/or lane will likely require significant
modifications to the existing accesses (including the adjacent ditches and culverts), and is
unlikely to produce any measurable safety benefits (e.g. reduced collision rates).


5.0      Conclusions

Based on the foregoing, NECL do not recommend the provision of a right-turn lane or taper for
the existing access driveways. The current access configuration is considered to be fit for the
purpose of accommodating any additional traffic that may be generated by the proposed
addition of 95 units.

We trust this memo provides an adequate assessment of the traffic impact associated with the
proposed expansion. Please call if there are any questions or comments.

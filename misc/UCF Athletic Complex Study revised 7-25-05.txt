EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction


The University of Central Florida (UCF), located in eastern Orange County near the intersection of
Alafaya Trail (SR 434) and University Boulevard, is currently the second largest university in Florida and
the ninth largest in the nation with an enrollment of over 42,000 students. UCF completed its 2005
Campus Master Plan (CMP) Update in November 2004. As a part of the update, several capital projects
on the campus were approved including the Wayne Densch Athletic Complex. A 45,000-seat football
stadium to be located within the Complex is currently proposed as an amendment to the 2005 CMP.


Study Purpose


The purpose of the study is to evaluate the traffic impacts of a proposed 45,000-seat stadium on the
UCF campus and surrounding roadway networks, including an evaluation of parking demands. Because
the stadium is a "special generator," the normal weekday a.m./p.m. peak hour analysis is not
applicable. Thus, this analysis will compare two scenarios, i.e., Saturday traffic with and without the
football stadium.


Study Area


The study area for the analysis is the same one used for UCF's 2005 CMP Update. Referred to in that
document as the "Context Area," it is bounded by Colonial Drive (SR 50) to the south, Chapman Road
to the north, Rouse Road to the west, and Lake Pickett Road to the east.


Existing Conditions


The results of the 2005 existing weekday conditions analyses show that the majority of roadway
segments within the study area are currently operating above the adopted Level of Service (LOS) during
weekday conditions. However, the following segments are currently operating at levels below the
adopted LOS:


    ·   Colonial Drive (SR 50) from Rouse Road to Alafaya Trail (SR 434);
    ·   Colonial Drive (SR 50) from Alafaya Trail (SR 434) to Woodbury Road;
    ·   Discovery Drive from Research Parkway to Gemini Boulevard;
    ·   Lake Pickett Road from Colonial Drive (SR 50) to Percival Road;
    ·   Rouse Road from Colonial Drive (SR 50) to Lokonatosa Trail; and
    ·   University Boulevard from Dean Road to Rouse Road.




                                                    i
The results of the 2005 existing weekend conditions analyses show that no roadway segments within
the study area operate below the adopted LOS.


In addition to the evaluation of roadway LOS, the existing conditions assessment also determined that
UCF currently has 13,614 on-campus parking spaces in both surface and structured facilities. These
facilities are near capacity during normal business hours during weekdays.          There is significant
available capacity on the weekend.


Future Conditions


Once all of the data had been collected, and the trips associated with the football stadium had been
generated and assigned, roadway capacity analyses were performed for the two scenarios:


    ·   2007 Saturday Conditions without Football Stadium
    ·   2007 Saturday Conditions with Football Stadium


As currently planned, the football stadium would hold six to seven football games per year,
predominantly on Saturdays during the fall semester.        Most games are expected to start in the
afternoon or early evening, generally between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.


2007 Saturday Conditions without Football Stadium

This scenario examined weekend conditions without the football stadium.            Saturday traffic was
collected on seven roadway links. Using this data, the ratio of the Saturday to weekday traffic (i.e.,
approximately 47 percent) was then used to calculate the Saturday traffic volumes on all remaining
segments within the study area. Under this evaluation scenario, most of the surrounding roadway
segments within the study area will operate at a LOS similar to the 2005 levels. No roadways were
projected to operate below their respective adopted LOS.


2007 Saturday Conditions with Football Stadium

In order to assess the worst-case conditions, the inbound peak that occurs approximately three hours
before the game was used for the inbound traffic flow, and the outbound peak that occurs two hours
after the end of the game was used for the outbound traffic flow. Based on previous studies of special
generators such as football games, these time periods have the highest traffic flow. It should be noted
that these two peaks are separated in time by approximately eight hours with a three-hour game
intervening. During the two to three hours before the game, the inbound traffic will comprise almost
all of the traffic being generated by the campus as the majority of vehicles leaving the campus will be
from buses (shuttle and charter), taxis or other vehicles dropping off patrons. Similarly, during the one



                                                   ii
to two hours after the end of the game almost all of the traffic will be outbound. This approach
therefore yields a very conservative analysis.


Utilizing projected Saturday traffic conditions, and adding the trips that will be generated by the
stadium, the following two off-campus roadway segments would exceed the adopted LOS during the
inbound and outbound peak hours: Alafaya Trail (SR 434), from Colonial Drive (SR 50) to Science Drive,
and University Boulevard, from Rouse Road to Alafaya Trail.       On-campus, Gemini Boulevard from
University Boulevard to Libra Drive, University Boulevard from Alafaya Trail (SR 434) to Gemini
Boulevard and Libra Drive from Research Parkway to Gemini Boulevard, would exceed the adopted LOS
during the inbound and outbound peak hours.


Future Parking Assessment


The primary scenario analyzed for future parking demand is a sold-out UCF home football game with
45,000 attendees. Utilizing the mode split, and average auto occupancy percentages developed in the
trip generation estimates for the stadium, just over 11,400 parking spaces are estimated to be required
for a sold-out football game. When this demand of 11,400 spaces is compared to the projected 14,831
parking spaces that will be available no later than the Fall 2007, there is an overall surplus of
approximately 3,431 spaces. The majority of these spaces will be within a 10-minute walk of the
football stadium.


Conclusions/Recommendations


A review of the trip generation and LOS evaluations for the Saturday football scenario shows that the
projected impacts from a sold-out, 45,000-attendee game would exceed the adopted LOS for two
constrained roadways off-campus and several on-campus roadway segments. Given that the stadium is
a special generator, creating traffic six or seven times throughout the year and given that many
roadway facilities within the study area are constrained and thus are not likely to be widened any
further, typical physical roadway improvements such as road widening, are neither justifiable nor
possible.   Rather, alternative means of mitigating transportation impacts must be implemented to
address the impacts from this special generator.


It is therefore recommended that a Traffic Management Program (TMP) be developed that includes
several Traffic Demand Management (TDM) strategies for football game conditions. It should be noted
that while several of these recommendations do not result in easily quantifiable capacity gains on the
surrounding roadway system as is the case with widening projects, they have significant tangible
benefits. As an example, the implementation of advanced signal control systems such as the SCOOT
system, has been shown to increase the effective capacity on existing (i.e., non-widened) roadways by



                                                   iii
10-25 percent. This is a significant traffic improvement that will occur not only during games times,
but also throughout the year and will benefit local residents and businesses as well. The recommended
measures will address both on-campus and off-campus roadway deficiencies.


The specific measures that should be a part of the TMP include, but are not limited to:


   ·   Implement SCOOT system
   ·   Implement Parking Management Program
   ·   Implement Game Day Traffic Management Techniques
   ·   Increase the Public Transit/Park-N-Ride Mode Share
   ·   Implement Pre-Trip Traveler Information Techniques
   ·   Improve Bicycle Accommodation
   ·   Implement Guide Signing Program
   ·   Implement One-Way Reversible Travel Lanes on Campus

   ·   Establish Post Game Activities
   ·   Create a Local Traffic Stakeholder Group


Implementation of these types of measures have shown that the traffic from a special generator such
as a stadium can be managed to significantly reduce impacts on the surrounding roadway network in
the study area. Although each of the measures will add to the overall improvement of the roadway
conditions, two specific measures, the SCOOT system (off-campus) and the one-way reversible travel
lanes (on-campus) could significantly alleviate roadway conditions on the deficient segments.


Finally, UCF should also continue to meet its obligations to address traffic impacts through the
application of Campus Development Agreements (CDA) that will provide resources to implement
mitigation measures.

1.0      INTRODUCTION

The University of Central Florida (UCF), located in eastern Orange County near the intersection of
Alafaya Trail (SR 434) and University Boulevard, is currently the second largest university in Florida and
the ninth largest in the nation with an enrollment of over 42,000 students. It is also one of the fastest
growing universities in the U.S. with a projected total student population of approximately 50,000
students in 2015. UCF completed its 2005 Campus Master Plan (CMP) Update in November 2004. As a
part of the update, several capital projects on the campus were approved including the Wayne Densch
Athletic Complex.


UCF is the also the home of the Golden Knights National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
Division I football team. The Knights recently joined the Mid-American College Football Conference. In
order to improve the standing of UCF's athletics program, the University has embarked on a major
investment in athletic facilities on-campus. As a part of the Wayne Densch Athletic Sports Complex, a
new 45,000-seat stadium is planned as an amendment to the 2005 CMP for the northern end of the UCF
Orlando Main Campus. This project is part of UCF's plan to remain competitive at the highest level of
the NCAA Division I. UCF's Athletics Department has identified the provision of top-notch facilities to
the student athletes as one of the key factors in recruiting and retaining top athletic talent. The
inclusion of these facilities on UCF's Campus is also important to non-athletes as they are a key aspect
of the overall "college experience" and provide entertainment and social opportunities.


The stadium is envisioned to initially include 45,000 seats with an option to expand to 65,000 seats at a
future date. The planned softball practice fields would be moved south of North Orion Boulevard near
the football practice fields to make room for the stadium.


Currently, UCF's Knights play all of their home football games at the Citrus Bowl, located on the
western side of downtown Orlando, just north of East-West Expressway (SR 408). The Citrus Bowl hosts
all six of the Knight's home games with an average attendance during the 2004 football season of just
fewer than 20,000 attendees. As it currently stands, almost everyone attending the games has to drive
to the Citrus Bowl ­ a one-way distance of over 17 miles for UCF students, faculty, staff, and football
team. UCF is one of only 20 out of a total of 117 NCAA Division I-A universities that do not have a
stadium on-campus. Building a stadium on-campus would bring over 10,000 students within walking
distance of UCF football games. Figure 1-1 shows the location of the Citrus Bowl as it relates to UCF's
Campus




                                                   1-1
1.1     STUDY PURPOSE


The purpose of the study is to, first of all, evaluate the impacts of the proposed football stadium on
the UCF and surrounding roadway network, including an evaluation of parking demands. Because the
stadium is a "special generator," the normal weekday a.m./p.m. peak hour analysis is not applicable.
Thus, this analysis will compare two scenarios, i.e., Saturday traffic with and without the football
stadium.


The second part of the study will determine the parking demands that will be created by attendees and
employees of the stadium. This part of the study will also examine the existing and projected supply of
parking facilities in the area that will be available to meet the needs of both existing facilities and the
planned football stadium. Figure 1-2 is an overall map of the UCF Campus. Figure 1-3 shows a detailed
rendering of the Northern section of the UCF Campus focusing on the proposed football stadium.


1.2     STUDY AREA


The study area for the analysis was defined as the same one used for UCF's 2005 CMP Update.
Referred to in that document as the "Context Area", it is bounded by Colonial Drive (SR 50) to the
south, Chapman Road to the north, Rouse Road to the west, and Lake Pickett Road to the east.

2.0       EXISTING CONDITIONS

As noted in the introduction, UCF currently has over 42,000 students and has recently completed the
2005 CMP Update. As a part of that update, numerous capital projects were approved including the
entire development program for the Wayne Densch Athletic Complex except for the newly proposed
football stadium that was recently added as a proposed amendment to the 2005 CMP.


The study area for the analysis was defined as the same one used for UCF's CMP. Referred to in that
document as the "Context Area", it is bounded by Colonial Drive (SR 50) to the south, Chapman Road
to the north, Rouse Road to the west, and Lake Pickett Road to the east. Figure 2-1 shows the study
area.


2.1       DATA COLLECTION


In order to evaluate current weekday and Saturday operating conditions, roadway link and intersection
traffic data was collected. Existing background roadway link data was taken from several sources
including:


      ·   2003 Orange County Traffic Count Program;
      ·   2004 Seminole County Count program;
      ·   2003 FDOT Count Program;
      ·   2003 UCF Traffic Impact Analysis performed by GMB Engineers and Planners for Seminole
          County; and
      ·   2005 Saturday Traffic Counts collected by PBS&J.

T-Plan-UCF Stad-Stad Art 7/20/05
As noted above, existing traffic data was collected from Orange and Seminole Counties and
Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Additional counts were also performed on Saturday,
January 15, 2005, in order to be able to evaluate existing and project conditions for those scenarios
occurring on Saturdays. The Saturday traffic data that was collected for a 24-hour period at the
following locations:


    1. University Boulevard west of Alafaya Trail (SR 434)
    2. Alafaya Trail (SR 434) south of University Boulevard
    3. Alafaya Trail (SR 434) north of University Boulevard
    4. McCulloch Road between Alafaya Trail (SR 434) and Orion Boulevard
    5. Gemini Boulevard North, east of Alafaya Trail (SR 434)
    6. Gemini Boulevard North, between Greek Park Drive and North Orion Boulevard
    7. North Orion Boulevard, north of Gemini Boulevard
    8. Gemini Boulevard between Libra Drive and N. Orion Boulevard
    9. University Boulevard between Alafaya Trail (SR 434) and Gemini Boulevard


These locations were selected as they represent many of the key roadway segments that will be used
by attendees coming to either the Convocation Center or the football stadium, the two main venues
expected to have Saturday events.


It should be noted that Saturday traffic decreased an average of over 40 percent when compared to the
2003 weekday traffic counts. The decreases ranged from a low of 31 percent to a high of 75 percent.
Only one road, McCulloch Road increased by approximately 2 percent. This appears to be an anomaly
and was likely due to a local special event. All roadways operated at a high Level of Service (LOS), and
were at, or above their adopted LOS standards.


In addition to the link data that was collected, weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour intersection turning
movement counts were also collected at the following intersections:


    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Colonial Drive (SR 50)
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Challenger Parkway
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Research Parkway
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/University Boulevard
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/McCulloch Road
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Chapman Road
    ·   University Boulevard/Rouse Road
    ·   University Boulevard/Dean Road




                                                  2-3
      ·   McCulloch Road/Orion Boulevard/Lockwood Boulevard
      ·   University Blvd/ East-West Expressway (SR 408) ramps


Copies of the Orange and Seminole County traffic information, the GMB Study data, the Saturday
traffic counts and all of the turning movement counts are included in the Appendix A.


2.2       EXISTING CONDITIONS LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSES


The first step in evaluating the impacts of stadium is to determine the existing operating conditions so
that the net impact from the planned projects can be calculated. This is determined by collecting
recent traffic data and comparing it to the existing number of lanes, the type of roadway (i.e., arterial
vs. collector), and the maintaining agency's adopted LOS Standard. In general, the LOS service volumes
adopted by the FDOT are used as a starting point by most agencies, although many modify them to take
into account local conditions. A copy of Table 4-7 from the FDOT 2002 Quality/Level of Service
Handbook is shown below as Figure 2-2.


This table serves as the basis for the service volumes used in this analysis. Since the available roadway
segment data that was collected ranged from 2003 to 2004, it was decided to grow all raw counts to
2005 and adjust for seasonal adjustment factors per the FDOT Quality/LOS Manual. All counts were
adjusted using an annual growth rate of 2.44 percent that was calculated from permanent FDOT Count
stations in the vicinity of the UCF Campus.


Intersections were evaluated using the existing laneage and the traffic volumes collected as noted
above. In order to establish the most conservative future conditions evaluations, existing signalized
intersections had their signal timing plans optimized by using SYNCHRO, v. 6.0. This methodology will
show the highest LOS conditions that are currently achievable at the study intersections.


2.2.1     Roadway Segment Level of Service Evaluations


Table 2-1 shows the primary roadway network near the UCF campus and inventories significant
information such as roadway segment data, number of lanes, the LOS adopted by the maintaining
agency, and the name of the agency having jurisdiction over the roadway. Table 2-1 includes recent
widening projects such as the 6-laning of Alafaya Trail (SR 434) from University Boulevard to Mitchell
Hammock Boulevard.


The collected weekday and Saturday traffic volumes were then evaluated against a variety of
parameters as noted above.      Table 2-2, 2005 Weekday Roadway Conditions, and Table 2-3, 2005
Saturday Roadway Conditions, show the 2005 existing roadway operating conditions for weekdays and




                                                  2-4
Saturdays, respectively. The weekday conditions analysis is presented for comparison purposes and so
that weekend volumes could be developed for roadway segments where no data is currently available.

A review of Table 2-2 shows that the majority of roadway segments within the study area are currently
operating above the adopted LOS during weekday conditions, with the exception of the following:


   ·    Colonial Drive (SR 50) from Rouse Road to Alafaya Trail (SR 434)
   ·    Colonial Drive (SR 50) from Alafaya Trail (SR 434) to Woodbury Road
   ·    Discovery Drive from Research Parkway to Gemini Boulevard
   ·    Lake Pickett Road from Colonial Drive (SR 50) to Percival Road
   ·    Rouse Road from Colonial Drive (SR 50)) to Lokonatosa Trail
   ·    University Boulevard from Dean Road to Rouse Road


2.2.2   Intersection Level of Service Evaluations


As noted above, turning movement counts were performed in 2005 at key intersections within the
study and surrounding the UCF Campus. These counts were collected from 7-9 a.m. in the morning and
4-6 p.m. in the evening to coincide with generally accepted peak analysis periods. Intersection
analyses were performed using the Synchro v. 6.0 traffic analysis software.


Although Synchro offers three independent methods to analyze signalized intersections: Synchro
Percentile Delays, Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) Signalized Method, and Intersection Capacity
Utilization (ICU), the most generally accepted methodology was used. Specifically, the standard HCM
control delay was used instead of Synchro's optional methodologies. The following intersections were
evaluated for weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour conditions:


    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Colonial Drive (SR 50)
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Challenger Parkway
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Research Parkway
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/University Boulevard
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/McCulloch Road
    ·   Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Chapman Road
    ·   University Boulevard/ Rouse Road
    ·   University Boulevard/ Dean Road
    ·   McCulloch Road/Orion Boulevard/Lockwood Boulevard
    ·   University Boulevard/East-West Expressway (SR 408) ramps




                                                  2-9
The results of these analyses for the a.m. and p.m. peak periods are shown below in Table 2-4. A
review of Table 2-4 shows that only one intersection, Colonial Drive (SR 50) and Alafaya Trail (SR 434)
is currently failing with a LOS of "F". However, several others are currently at LOS "E", with two,
Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/Research Parkway and Alafaya Trail (SR 434)/McCulloch Road nearing failure.
These levels of service are for weekday conditions. Weekend conditions are substantially better due
to substantially reduced background traffic volumes.

2.3     EXISTING PARKING CONDITIONS ANALYSIS


The UCF Campus already has a significant supply of parking spaces in both surface and structured
facilities. Many of the current surface lots are termed "temporary" as it is understood that the
University will eventually convert some of these surface facilities to either structured parking or new
buildings.


Based on the most recent parking occupancy study performed by UCF staff, the Campus has a total of
13,614 parking spaces broken out by use as shown in Table 2-5. In general, most of these are near


                                                   2-10
capacity during standard work/school hours during the week, with occupancy rates ranging from a low
of 45 percent to highs approaching 100 percent. On Fridays and weekends most of the parking spaces
are empty except for those lots attached to on-campus housing. Figure 2-3 shows the location of
existing campus parking facilities and their maximum capacities. A copy of the most recent UCF Parking
Occupancy Study, dated September 2004, is included in Appendix C.

3.0       FUTURE CONDITIONS ANALYSES

This future conditions section is divided into two parts; the first part covers the methodology for the
analyzing the traffic related impacts from the football stadium and the proposed football stadium, and
the second portion covers the methodology for the analysis of future parking demands.


3.1       TRAFFIC STUDY METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW


As currently planned, the football stadium would hold six to seven football games per year,
predominantly on Saturdays during the fall semester. Most games are expected to start in the
afternoon or early evening, generally between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.


In general, the stadium analysis will closely conform to the methodologies outlined in two key
publications, "Managing Travel for Planned Special Events", by Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), published in 2003; and, "Transportation Planning and Management for Special Events",
Synthesis 309 by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP). The synthesis,
published in 2003 surveyed several large venues around the United States and has several case studies.
The FHWA Handbook has a detailed structure that outlines the approach to preparing a feasibility study
for planned special events. The steps as outlined in the handbook that will be followed in this study are
as follows:


      1. Travel Forecast (Trip Generation)
      2. Market Area Analysis (Distribution of Traffic ­ origin)
      3. Parking Demand Analysis (Distribution of Traffic ­ destination)
      4. Traffic Demand Analysis (Trip Assignment)
      5. Roadway Capacity Analysis (Impact Assessment)
      6. Mitigation of Impacts (Traffic Management Plan)


For ease of understanding, the more commonly used terms shown in parentheses (i.e., "Trip
Generation") will be used throughout the balance of the study instead of the more generic header
terms from the FHWA Handbook.


As noted above, when analyzing the football stadium it is important to recognize that this is a "special
generator" that will not be impacting the surrounding roadway system during peak periods generally
analyzed under standard practices. As such, the standard methodologies are not appropriate, as they
will not address the actual impacts of the stadium. If the standard, weekday peak periods (7-9 a.m.,
and 4-6 p.m.) were analyzed, the stadium would show essentially no impacts as it would not be in use.
As such, a different analysis period needed to be selected that would more appropriately evaluate the



                                                     3-1
overall impacts of the stadium. Yearly, semester and weekly analysis periods were considered for the
evaluation of the stadium traffic impacts. After reviewing other related studies, the available traffic
data and the projected operating characteristics of the stadium, a weekly analysis period was selected.


Under this methodology, the projected impacts from the stadium football traffic were compared to the
overall weekly traffic currently generated by the Campus. The weekly campus traffic was estimated
using the following actual data:


      ·   Weekday UCF driveway traffic counts collected by GMB Engineers and Planners in October 2003
          for a separate study for Seminole County;
      ·   Saturday UCF driveway traffic counts collected by PBS&J in January 2005 for this study; and
      ·   Sunday UCF driveway traffic counts estimated as being equal to 25 percent of the Saturday
          counts.


It should be noted that the use of the actual counts results in a more accurate analysis when compared
to the results calculated when using Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) "Trip Generation", the
national standard for estimating trip generation for development projects. Specifically the actual
counts showed total weekday daily traffic being generated by the UCF Campus in 2003 being equal to
78,846 for approximately 42,000 full time equivalent (FTE) students, versus ITE's projected trip
generation volume of 108,653 daily trips.


This study will focus primarily on steps one through five as Step Six ­ Mitigation, will require significant
coordination with UCF staff and faculty, as well as staff from Orange County, Seminole County, the City
of Oviedo, the FDOT, the Orlando Orange County Expressway Authority (OOCEA), as well as other
stakeholders such as other agencies and local residents. This mitigation effort will culminate in a
"Transportation Management Program" (TMP) that will address specific operational issues that will seek
to minimize the impact of the stadium on the surrounding roadway system. The proposed TMP will be
discussed in greater detail in Section 7.0, Conclusions and Recommendations.


3.2       TRIP GENERATION


3.2.1     Introduction


As noted in FHWA's handbook for special events, the first step in the study process is the generation of
traffic associated with the proposed land uses. For the purposes of this study, the football stadium is
referred to as "Recurring Events at a Permanent Venue. "




                                                      3-2
3.2.2   Planned Special Events Trip Generation


The trip generation and parking generation for the football stadium was based on several sources
including preliminary information received from the UCF Facilities Planning Department.            This
consisted of the revised site plan showing the stadium's location and modifications to the surrounding
area, as well as the stated goal of an initial 45,000-seat capacity with an ability to expand to 65,000
seats at a future date. For the purposes of this study, the 45,000-seat capacity was the only option
analyzed, as that is the program that is currently seeking approval.


In addition to the data provided by UCF Facilities Planning, a significant amount of research into these
types of sporting venues was also performed. This research consisted primarily of accessing the ITE
database, a thorough search of Internet resources and interviews with 35 NCAA Division I-A schools that
have football stadiums equal to, or greater in size than UCF's proposed stadium.


In particular, FHWA's Special Events Management Handbook, Chapter 11, is an excellent resource on
these types of venues and notes several key considerations that should be evaluated when studying
recurring, planned special events (those most directly applicable/important to UCF are shown in bold):


Special Considerations


In light of the characteristics of a discrete/recurring event at a permanent venue, special
considerations when planning such an event include:


    ·   Permanent venues located in urban areas usually have exclusive off-street parking to
        accommodate capacity events, and good access exists between venue parking areas and
        freeway/arterial corridor traffic flow routes serving the venue.
    ·   In metropolitan areas, permanent venues often feature high-capacity connections (e.g.,
        transit) to the transportation system serving the region.
    ·   Parking areas at many permanent venues exist immediately adjacent to the venue, creating
        a more self-contained site traffic circulation and pedestrian access environment similar to
        other major, permanent traffic generators (e.g., airports and regional shopping centers).
    ·   These events generate high peak arrival rates because of event patrons': (1) urgency to arrive
        at the venue by a specific start time and (2) possession of a reserved seat ticket that does not
        require early arrival.
    ·   Special events that have general admission seating or permit tailgating have lower, yet
        pronounced, peak arrival rates.
    ·   Discrete/recurring events at a permanent venue end abruptly, thus creating high peak
        pedestrian and traffic departure rates.



                                                   3-3
    ·   The travel demand rate profile, over time, represents a distinguishing characteristic that
        warrants special consideration during advanced planning and day-of-event travel management.
    ·   Event characteristics, such as known venue capacity and advance ticket sales, afford
        practitioners the opportunity to perform travel demand forecasts with greater precision and
        accuracy.
    ·   Discrete/recurring events at a permanent venue allow the collection of transferable
        historical data that improves predictability in feasibility study traffic and parking analyses
        for future events held at a particular venue.
    ·   Experience gained from each planned special event can be used to further improve the
        identification and mitigation of roadway capacity deficiencies.
    ·   Weekday events place a high priority on prediction and stakeholder preparation because of
        potential impacts on commuter traffic and transit operations.


As noted above, some of the key considerations noted by FHWA that are most applicable to the UCF
Football Stadium include those bullets that are bolded above and that deal with tail-gaiting, general
admission tickets, parking location, and the ability to improve mitigation of traffic and parking impacts
over time as event data is gathered by staff. This information is also relevant to events held at the
Convocation Center, although not as directly applicable as the Center will hold a wide variety of events
whereas the stadium will host primarily college football games.


One of the key aspects to take away from the FHWA data is that predicting and mitigating impacts
from the stadium will improve over time as staff and local agencies/authorities better understand the
magnitude of the impacts and "iron out the wrinkles" in their mitigation plans. The results of this first,
preliminary study should be considered the first iteration in what will be an on-going process as UCF
seeks to find the best methods of planning for future events at the stadium and Convocation Center.


3.2.3   Trip Generation Methodology and Alternatives Analysis


As previously noted, the football stadium will be primarily active on the weekends, although there is a
possibility of the occasional weekday game. Based on recent game schedules, UCF appears to average
one weekday game every other year.


Saturday Conditions with Football Stadium: This alternative evaluated the projected impacts from
the currently proposed 45,000 seat UCF Football Stadium. This analysis also assumed that the
Convocation Center would not be hosting an event at the same time as the football game.


Football games at a fixed location such as the proposed UCF Stadium, are usually referred to as
"recurring special events at a permanent venue." This unique type of venue has many traffic and



                                                   3-4
transportation variables and factors that must be considered when planning for the six home games
currently envisioned. As noted in Joseph Guyton's technical paper from the ITE library, some of the
most critical factors that must be considered include:


    ·   Auto occupancy factors;
    ·   Potential transit usage;
    ·   Acceptable exit time following the event;
    ·   Acceptable walking distances;
    ·   Distribution of arrivals over time and by direction; and
    ·   Acceptable entry/exit rates for on-site parking.


As noted in FHWA's "Managing Travel for Planned Special Events Handbook", there are a wide variety
of other factors that also need to be evaluated when considering these types of repetitive special
events. Event time and duration defines whether the event features a specific main event start time,
likely to condense event patron arrival, or operates continuously throughout the day where patrons
may freely come and go.


    ·   Event location: defines the characteristics of the venue(s) location and connection to the
        existing transportation infrastructure.
        o   Typically, fixed venues, such as stadiums or arenas, feature high-capacity parking areas
            adjacent to the venue and good access to/from adjacent freeways and principal arterial
            streets.
        o   Temporary venues may lack these features, thus requiring the development of a detailed
            site access and parking plan.
    ·   Area type:     defines the scope of available transportation services, the characteristics of
        background traffic traversing the area, and the various stakeholders that may become involved
        in event planning and management. These characteristics influence the event operations
        planning process and day-of-event travel management, yet significantly vary across rural,
        urban, and metropolitan areas.
    ·   Event market area: defines the area from where event patrons originate and the scope of
        event exposure.
        o   For example, the Summerfest music festival in downtown Milwaukee drew over one million
            in attendance over eleven days in 2002. Demographic surveys indicated 56 percent of
            Summerfest patrons lived in the four counties comprising the greater metropolitan
            Milwaukee area, 22 percent of patrons lived in other areas of Wisconsin, and 22 percent of
            patrons lived outside Wisconsin. The event clearly had a regional/statewide market area.
    ·   Expected attendance: defines the maximum, estimated number of event patrons.



                                                    3-5
        o   Attendance estimates may include the anticipated number of VIPs, advance ticket holders,
            patrons with an assigned parking pass, and patrons requiring special assistance.
        o   With regard to sporting events, key components in estimating attendance involve home
            team performance and visiting team attraction.
        o   Games involving high-profile visiting teams or performers may sell-out far in advance of the
            event, allowing stakeholders sufficient notice to take appropriate measures.
        o   Attendance impacts traffic operations in the immediate vicinity of the event venue
            depending on the access and parking capacity furnished at the venue.
    ·   Audience accommodation: defines the potential to predict the number and origins of event-
        generated trips in addition to the type of trip patrons may make to the venue.
        o   Attendance at free events is hard to predict and may vary considerably based on weather
            conditions and other factors on the day-of-event.
        o   Events featuring advance ticket sales and reserved seating may decrease the number of
            event patrons making a spur-of-the-moment decision to attend an event.
    ·   Event type: defines the type of event that may be subject to special regulations and permit
        requirements. The event type includes many of the previously defined characteristics of
        planned special events that influence event-generated travel demand and level of impact on
        the transportation system. Event planners may refer to event type when researching impacts
        on travel caused by similar events.


These factors are graphically depicted in Figure 3-1.

Trip generation for the football stadium was therefore developed independently of the other standard
uses, was based on a review of the literature for stadium studies, the previously mentioned University
Football Stadium Survey, and included the following assumptions regarding transportation planning
factors:


    ·      Average Vehicle Occupancy: An average of 2.5-3.5 passengers/auto was determined based on
           review of several collegiate and professional sporting venues.
           o   An average vehicle occupancy of 3.0 passengers/auto was assumed for the UCF Stadium in
               order to be conservative. Table 3-1 details all of the average occupancy rates assumed for
               this analysis.
    ·      Mode Split: Mode split was found to vary widely among sporting venues ranging from 45-99
           percent of attendees arriving via automobile. The mode splits shown below were based on a
           review of studies from other collegiate and professional sporting venues, and took into
           consideration the location of UCF's Campus, the size of the surrounding metropolitan area, the
           existing public transit system service in the area, the size of the current alumni base, the
           proximity of off-campus student housing, and the existence of a very successful UCF Shuttle

system. Table 3-2 lists all of the modes assumed to be used for traveling to and from the games
as well as their respective percentages.

   ·    Arrival/Departure Times: Based on a review of collegiate and professional sporting venues it
        is apparent that many spectators arrive well before game time, and often stay well after the
        game is over in order to "tailgate." Based on a review of other studies and venues, the
        following percentages were assumed for arrival and departure patterns:


                                                Arrival

Based on all of the previously discussed trip generation factors, trip generation was estimated for the
45,000-seat and the 65,000-seat stadium configurations.         Both analyses assumed sold-out, full
attendance games.


It is important to remember that at this time, average home game attendance for UCF is slightly below
20,000 attendees. The feasibility study developed for the UCF Board of Trustees projected average
attendance for several years at approximately 26,000 attendees per game. In other words, it will likely
take several years for attendance to grow to the point where there are several sold out games in a
given year.


Tables 3-3 and 3-4 shows the results of the trip generation analysis for the football stadium including
mode split, average occupancy, arrival time and daily and peak hour trip generation, for the
45,000-seat and 65,000-seat stadiums, respectively.

4.0     TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

This section discusses the methodology used to distribute the stadium traffic onto the UCF and
surrounding roadway network.


4.1     STADIUM TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

Initially, several attempts were made to distribute the stadium traffic using the Orlando Urban Area
Transportation Study (OUATS) model treating the stadium as a "special generator". However, it was
felt that the results did not accurately reflect the routes that patrons would likely use to arrive at the
football games. Specifically, the distribution and assignment pattern did not differ enough from the
assignment pattern for a standard land use.


The travel behavior of local drivers who come to the UCF Campus everyday versus those of a driver who
is making a special trip to attend a concert or football game are significantly different. As most people
who are coming to football games are coming to, at most, six events per year, and since many of the
season ticket holders are not in the immediate vicinity of the campus, most drivers will utilize higher
classification highways and freeways as they will be driving longer distances than their usual daily
commute. Drivers traveling to special events are generally more willing to pay tolls on tollways such as
SR 417 (the Greeneway) and East-West Expressway (SR 408) so as to avoid local arterial traffic.


It was therefore decided to assign football trips to the surrounding roadway network based on the
current origins of the 2004 season ticket holders. The number of season tickets per zip code was
provided in a tabular format for this purpose by the UCF Athletics Department. No personal information
was attached to the zip code dataset. This zip code data was then geo-coded using Federal 2000
Census zip code geo-databases and Arcview GIS software, v. 8.3, to visually illustrate the zip code
boundaries.


Figure 4-1 shows the results of the geo-coding in a graphical format. Figure 4-2 shows the actual
assignment of football traffic to the roadway network. A copy of the tabular zip code data that was
provided by UCF is included in Appendix A.

5.0     TRAFFIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT

The section will focus on the projected impacts of the proposed 45,000-seat football stadium. The first
step was to determine what the projected 2007 Saturday conditions will be on UCF and surrounding
roadways. This will form the baseline for the impact assessment.


Once background conditions had been determined, impacts due to the projected stadium impacts will
be assessed as previously described.


As previously noted, the study area for the analysis was defined as the same one used for UCF's 2005
CMP Update. Referred to in that document as the "Context Area", it is bounded by Colonial Drive (SR
50) to the south, Chapman Road to the north, Rouse Road to the west, and Lake Pickett Road to the
east. Figure 5-1 shows the study area.


As the earliest opening date for the UCF Football Stadium is 2007, it was decided to perform all
capacity evaluations for that horizon year. This entailed growing background traffic volumes from the
current period to the horizon year. In this case it entailed growing 2003, 2004, or 2005 data to 2007.
This was performed based on FDOT historic growth rates in the area that show that the traffic on
nearby state facilities is projected to grow on the order of 2.44 percent per year.


5.1     PLANNED AND PROGRAMMED IMPROVEMENTS


When evaluating future conditions of roadway facilities it is necessary to include any planned or
programmed improvements that may affect the results of the analysis. A review of the work programs
of Orange and Seminole Counties, and FDOT shows several improvements and is summarized in
Table 5-1, specifically:

While most of these improvements are not in the immediate vicinity of the UCF Campus, they all
represent significant capacity improvements and will have impacts to the overall roadway network in
terms of the regional distribution of traffic and resulting LOS. Most of the listed improvements would
have at least started construction within three years of the projected opening of the UCF Football
Stadium, and are therefore eligible for consideration from a concurrency management standpoint.


A copy of the FDOT's Tentative 2005-2010 Work Program and Orange County's Public Works Roadway
Program showing the improvements listed above is included in Appendix A.


5.2       FUTURE CONDITIONS TRAFFIC CAPACITY ANALYSES


Once all of the data had been collected, and the trips associated with all of the projects included in
the football stadium had been generated and assigned, roadway capacity analyses were performed for
the two scenarios:


      ·   2007 Saturday Conditions without Football Stadium
      ·   2006 Saturday Conditions with Football Stadium


5.2.1     2007 Saturday Conditions without Football Stadium


This scenario examined weekend conditions without the football stadium.           Saturday traffic was
collected on seven roadway links. Using this data, the ratio of the Saturday to weekday traffic (i.e.,
approximately 47 percent) was then used to calculate the Saturday traffic volumes on all remaining
segments within the study area. Under this evaluation scenario, most of the surrounding roadway
segments within the study area will operate at a LOS similar to the 2005 levels. No roadways were
projected to operate below their respective adopted LOS.


The results of the 2007 conditions without the stadium traffic are shown in Table 5-2.


As shown Table 5-2, under this scenario most of the surrounding roadway segments within the study
area will operate at a LOS similar to the 2005 levels. No roadways are projected to operate below their
respective adopted LOS.


5.2.2     2007 Saturday Conditions with Football Stadium


This analysis uses the project trips calculated in Table 3-5, "45,000-Seat Football Stadium Trip
Generation", and the assignment pattern shown in Figure 4-2, "Football Stadium Traffic Assignment."

LOS service volumes based on Orange County's and Seminole County's Comprehensive
Plans and the 2002 FDOT Quality/Level of Service Manual.

2003 traffic volumes taken from FDOT, Orange and Seminole Counties, UCF traffic counts as well as
UCF Traffic Impact Study prepared by GMB, 10/03, and UCF Traffic Study prepared by UCF Staff, 7/8/03.
In order to assess the worst-case conditions, the inbound peak that occurs approximately three hours
before the game was used for the inbound traffic flow, and the outbound peak that occurs two hours
after the end of the game was used for the outbound traffic flow. It should be noted that these two
peaks are separated in time by approximately eight hours when you include a three-hour game in the
middle. During the three to four hours before the game the inbound traffic will comprise almost all of
the traffic being generated by the site as the only vehicles leaving the campus will be either from
buses (shuttle and charter), taxis or other vehicles dropping off patrons. Similarly, during the two to
three hours after the end of the game almost all of the traffic will be outbound. This approach
therefore yields a very conservative analysis.


Utilizing projected Saturday traffic conditions and adding the trips that will be generated by the
stadium, the following two off-campus roadway segments would exceed the adopted LOS during the
inbound and outbound peak hours: Alafaya Trail (SR 434), from Colonial Drive (SR 50) to Science Drive,
and University Boulevard, from Rouse Road to Alafaya Trail (SR 434). On-campus, Gemini Boulevard
from University Boulevard to Libra Drive, University Boulevard from Alafaya Trail (SR 434) to Gemini
Boulevard, and Libra Drive from Research Parkway to Gemini Boulevard, would exceed the adopted LOS
during the inbound and outbound peak hours.


The results of the Saturday analysis with the football stadium are shown in Table 5-3.

6.0       FUTURE PARKING ANALYSIS

For the purposes of this study, it was assumed that any parking needs for the standard uses (such as the
Athletic Administration Building) and the smaller athletic venues (such as the softball stadium) would
be accommodated with surface parking facilities located immediately adjacent to the respective
buildings. The new Building Program for the Wayne Densch Athletic Complex included as Appendix B
details parking to be provided with each building.


6.1       PLANNED PARKING FACILITIES


As part of the Athletic Complex, new high-rise student housing, athletic facilities and associated
parking facilities, parking garages, and surface lots will be built in the area north of Gemini Boulevard,
and north and west of North Orion Boulevard. Two, dedicated, 700-space each parking garages (shown
as letter M on Figure 1-3) will be constructed to accommodate the approximate 2,000 students housed
in the new dormitories. In addition, a parking garage with space for approximately 1,600 vehicles will
be built for use by the proposed Convocation Center and surrounding facilities, including the football
stadium. There will also be general use (i.e., not attached to a particular building or venue) surface
parking lots built in conjunction with the athletic facilities north and east of the proposed Convocation
Center. A final determination of the number of surface parking spaces has not yet been made,
however, it is estimated that as many as 750 additional surface parking spaces can be provided in that
area. Finally, a new 700-space parking garage is adjacent to an existing 1,200-space lot next to the
arboretum.


In addition to the new parking facilities planned for in conjunction with the Athletic Complex, a new
garage, Garage Five, was recently approved as a part of the 2005 CMP. This garage, currently planned
for approximately 1,600 structured spaces will be constructed on top of temporary lot G7, displacing
approximately 400 surface parking spaces. This garage, currently scheduled for completion by 2006,
will add a net 1,200 parking spaces to the Campus total.


6.2       STADIUM-RELATED PARKING FACILITIES


As a part of the facilities being evaluated for the stadium, football related parking facilities are also
being planned.    Currently these consist of approximately 350 "tailgating" parking spaces located
adjacent to Orion Boulevard and running from McCulloch Road south to Gemini Boulevard. In addition,
another approximate 400 spaces are planned for the area immediately north and east of the stadium
itself.




                                                     6-1
6.3         TOTAL ON-CAMPUS FUTURE PARKING SUPPLY


The total parking supply projected to be available for the 2006 football season includes the following
facilities:


      ·     2004 Existing Parking (surface and structured)                  13,614
      ·     Wayne Densch Athletic Complex Planned Parking                    3,700
      ·     General Use Planned Parking (Garage V)                           1,400
      ·     New Parking Garage Near Arboretum                                  700
      ·     Football Related Parking (includes tail-gaiting parking)           750




      Total 2006 Projected Parking Supply                                   20,164 spaces maximum


From this gross total, spaces that are either reserved or will be occupied must be subtracted to arrive
at an estimate of the actual available parking supply. This includes spaces reserved for on-campus
housing as well as several of the "Specialty Parking" categories such as disabled parking. This
calculation is shown below:

                 Net Available Parking (sub-total)                           15,612


An additional amount of parking will need to be deleted as some spaces will be occupied even on a
Saturday with a football game. Based on discussions with UCF Parking Staff, there is no data currently
collected on weekends, but anecdotal evidence indicates that most of the lots are completely empty
on the weekends. In order to ensure a conservative analysis, the net available spaces calculated above




                                                       6-2
was further reduced by 5 percent, or 781 spaces, to account a nominal amount of occupied parking for
staff, students, etc.   This yields the final available space count of approximately 14,831 spaces
available for either football games or Convocation Center events.   Table 6-1 shows the results of
parking supply calculations.

6.4      PARKING DEMAND ANALYSIS


Based on a review of the New Building Program, it appears that the other planned building or venues
will have a sufficient, dedicated supply of parking. The demand analysis for this study will therefore
focus only on the football stadium.


6.4.1    UCF Football Stadium Parking Demand Analysis


The primary scenario to be analyzed for parking demand is a sold-out UCF home football game with
45,000 attendees. This equates to approximately 50,000 attendees, the majority of whom will arrive
approximately one hour before kick-off based on a review of other venues experiences.


Utilizing the mode split, and average auto occupancy percentages developed in Section 2.0 for trip
generation, an estimate of the number of vehicles by type was calculated. Table 6-2 shows the results
of the calculation.


                                                Table 6-2

Table 6-2 shows that just over 11,400 parking spaces are estimated to be required for a sold-out
football game.


When this demand of 11,400 spaces is compared to the projected 14,681 parking spaces calculated in
the previous section, it appears that there is an overall surplus of approximately 3,200 spaces. The
majority of these spaces will be within a 10-minute walk of the football stadium.        Those parking
facilities that are not will be serviced by a UCF Shuttle System with short headways most likely in the
5-minute range.

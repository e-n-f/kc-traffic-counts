Subject:              Transportation Study for 2580 El Camino Real Housing DeVelopment in
                      Redwood City, California
                                                                                    SJl1-1236

Fehr & Peers prepared a focused transportation study for the 2580 El Camino Real project in
Redwood City, California. The project consists of a 141-unit (99 1-bedroom, 41 2-bedroom, and
one studio) apartment development that will replace an existing bowling alley and its associated
surface parking.. The project includes new apartment buildings, courtyards, and a parking
structure. The conceptual site plan is presented on Figure 1. The crosswalk across El Camino
Real will be relocated and enhanced as part of the project.
The purpose of the study is to conduct field observations and to address transportation issues
associated with the proposed project including:

          ¯   Project trip estimates,
          ¯   Project driveway operations,
          ¯   Site plan review, and
          ¯   Project connectivity to the surrounding multi-modal transportation network (i.e.,
              pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities).

The proposed project is consistent with the New General Plan certified by Redwood City in
October 2010. Based on general knowledge of the project vicinity, preliminary project trip
distribution, and discussions with City staff, the project is expected to add through traffic and
some U-turning vehicles to the two adjacent signalized intersections:
      ¯       El Camino Real and Center Street
      ¯       El Camino Real and Dumbarton Avenue
These two intersections are operating at level of service (LOS) C during both peak periods based
on field observations. These are acceptable operations according to City of Redwood City
standards. Both intersections have sufficient capacity to accommodate the net-added traffic
generated by the project and maintain acceptable operations. Therefore, a detailed intersection
operations analysis is not required.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Field observations were conducted during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 am) and evening (4:00 to
6:00 pm) peak periods in January 2011. The purpose of these field visits was to observe vehicle,
bicycle, and pedestrian travel patterns, interactions, and travel behavior near the project site. For

example, how motorists behave around pedestrians, and how pedestrians behave, especially at
the unsignalized crosswalk across El Camino Real and Northumberland Avenue, were observed.

The crosswalk is currently striped at an angle across El Camino Real. It appears that there are
physical constraints on the west side of El Camino Real that preclude a more direct (90 degree)
crossing:
    ¯   an existing catch basin,
    ¯   insufficient Right of Way (ROVV) for an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant
        curb ramp due to the existing restaurant, and
    ¯   a PG&E power pole.

Low pedestrian and bicycle activity levels were observed at the crosswalk during the morning and
evening commute periods. Pedestrians were observed waiting to cross until there was a gap in
the traffic flow. In the afternoon pedestrians waited up to 45 seconds to cross. A few pedestrians
were observed crossing El Camino Real illegally.

A greater number of bicyclists were observed along El Camino Real during the evening period
than the morning period.

Vehicle traffic on El Camino Real was in platoons, or groups of vehicles with breaks between the
groups, as opposed to a constant stream of vehicles during both peak hours. A slightly greater
number of vehicles was observed during the evening period than the morning.

Two bus stops are located on El Camino Real near the project site. The stop for the northbound
direction is located directly across from the site. The southbound direction stop is located
approximately 350 feet north of the site. The bus routes that serve these stops are described
under "Transit Connectivity."

PROJECT TRIP ESTIMATION
The proposed project consists of replacing an existing bowling alley with 141 apartment units.
The amount of traffic added to the surrounding roadway system by the proposed project was
estimated by first esti,rnating the amount of traffic generated by the apartment development and
then subtracting the amount of traffic generated by the bowling alley based on driveway counts.
The corresponding count sheets are included in Attachment A. The apartment traffic was
estimated by applying trip generation rates for the apartment land use from the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 8th Edition (2008). The rates were calculated
using the ITE fitted curve equation and the project size - 141 dwelling units. The apartment
development is expected to generate approximately 978 daily trips, 73 AM peak hour trips (15
inbound/58 outbound), and 95 PM peak hour trips (62 inbound/33 outbound). The bowling alley is
currently in operation and generates 2 AM peak hour trips (2 inbound/0 outbound), and 32 PM
peak hour trips (17 inbound/15 outbound). Table 1 summarizes the ITE trip generation rates and
trip estimates. The apartment development is expected add approximately 71 net new AM peak
hour vehicle trips (13 inbound/58 outbound) and 63 net new PM peak hour vehicle trips (45
inbound/18 outbound) to the roadway system.

These are conservative estimates and were developed to assess driveway operations. They do
not include reductions due to Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures described
below nor take into consideration future changes in the project area including planned land use
changes and the Grand Boulevard Initiative. The project is located in a planned mixed-use area
of the City creating more destinations within walking distance of the site (supported by the
sidewalk and pedestrian environment improvements provided by the project). Plus El Camino
Real will be transformed as part of the Grand Boulevard Initiative:
       El Camino Real will achieve its full potential as a place for residents to work, live, shop and
       play, creating links between communities that promote walking and transit and an improved
       and meaningful quality of life.

The corresponding enhanced pedestrian facilities, bicycle facilities, and transit service and
increased number of nearby destinations will encourage more trips to use these modes along the
El Camino Real corridor (including those generated by the project).

Transportation Demand Management

Transportation Demand Management (TDM) refers to strategies, measures and incentives to
encourage people to walk, bicycle, use public transportation, carpool or use other alternatives to
driving alone. TDM measures can reduce the amount of traffic generated by a land use
development and its associated impacts.

The project is proposing the following TDM measures:
     ¯    Tenant web portals to facilitate carpool matching
     ¯     Secure bicycle parking
     ¯     Provisions for a carsharing vendor such as Zipcar
These measures alone will reduce site-generated traffic but by a modest amount (less than 5
percent). The project will also enhance the pedestrian environment along its frontage on El
Camino Real by providing a widened sidewalk, street trees, and pedestrian level lighting and
improved the El Camino Real crosswalk as incentives to encourage walking trips. The associated
trip reductions were not included in the trip generation table nor in the LOS calculations discussed
below to provide conservative results. Charging stations for electric vehicles will also be provided.
While electric vehicles will not reduce project vehicle trips, they will reduce emissions.

PROJECT DRIVEWAY OPERATIONS
The operations of the proposed right-in-right-out project driveway were evaluated with level of
service (LOS) calculations using TRAFFIX 8.0 intersection analysis software. LOS is a qualitative
description of intersection operations from the driver's perspective and ranges from LOS A (free
flow operations and little or no delay) to LOS F (stop-and-go operations and excessive delays).
The relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections is summarized in
Attachment B. Driveway operations were evaluated with existing volumes on El Camino Real
plus project traffic at the driveway. The project driveway is expected to operate at a good level
with low delays at LOS B for both peak periods (14.2 sec/veh for the morning peak hour and 12.6
sec/veh for the evening peak hour). The results of the LOS analysis are summarized in Table 2
and the corresponding LOS calculation sheets are included in Attachment B.

SITE PLAN REVIEW
The site plan was reviewed to evaluate site access and on-site circulation for pedestrians,
bicyclists, and vehicles. The project site plan is shown on Figure 1. The project will widen the

existing sidewalk along the site's frontage and maintain the existing on-street parking on the west
side of El Camino Real. Vehicles will enter the site from El Camino Real and access the parking
garage via the internal roadway along the southern edge of the project site. Emergency vehicles
will enter through the same driveway and use an emergency vehicle route to traverse the
perimeter of three sides of the project site (with a turnaround in near the courtyard, as shown on
Figure 2).

The proposed parking garage will provide two-way 24-foot wide double-loaded parking aisles and
parking stalls that are 9 feet wide by 18 feet deep. The minimum stall and circulation aisle
dimensions for 90 degree angled parking based on Chapter 30 section 6 of the City Zoning
Ordinance are summarized in Table 3. While the proposed dimensions do not meet the City's
requirements, they meet parking industry standard dimensions1 and are acceptable.

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) parking spaces are accessible and conveniently located in
the parking garage near the building entrance.

A vehicle turnaround area (striped out space) is located at the end of the circulation aisle on the
lowest level. It is recommend that the turnaround space be relocated to the right side of the aisle
near the utility room to facilitate vehicle maneuvers.

PARKING ANALYSIS

The project will provide 232 parking spaces. As defined in Chapter 30 section 4 of the City Zoning
Ordinance, parking requirements for the project located within five hundred (500) feet of the right
of way of El Camino Real between Alameda de las Pulgas and Highway 101 are:

       ¯      two (2) spaces per unit for two (2) bedroom or larger units,
       ¯      one and one-half (1½) spaces per unit for studio or one (1) bedroom units, and
       ¯      one (1) space for every four (4) units for guest or visitor.

Based on the above rates, the proposed project would be required to provide 232 resident
parking spaces and 35 guest parking spaces for a total of 267 spaces. The parking requirement
by unit type is summarized in Table 4.

The Zoning Ordinance further states that the Zoning Administrator can reduce or eliminate the
required number of guest or visitor spaces if: (1) adequate street parking is available, and/or (2) if
only one parking space is reserved per unit for residents, and/or (3) if the site is in close proximity
to retail shopping facilities. The proposed project meets these criteria as follows:

    1. On-street parking is available along the west side of El Camino Real (approximately 5
       spaces),

   2. Each unit will be assigned one parking space (leaving 91 spaces available for residents
      and guests), and

   3. Future residents are approximately 1,000 feet away from a shopping center that includes
      Target, Marshalls, a grocery store and other retail stores.

Therefore, there is justification for the Zoning Administrator to eliminate the visitor parking
requirement reducing the requirement to 232 spaces. With the approval from the Zoning
Administrator, the proposed parking supply and program complies with City requirements.

TRANSPORTATION NETWORK CONNECTIVITY

Bicycle Connectivity

Based on the New General Plan, El Camino Real is expected to be a future designated bicycle
route. The bicycle route connects the project site with Woodside Road (also a proposed bicycle
route) and Downtown Redwood City. In addition, a bicycle/recreational path is proposed along the
Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct easement from Middlefield Road to Edgewood Road in Redwood City,
including the segment adjacent to the site. The project's design supports these proposed future
bicycle facilities. The site's location adjacent to these bicycle facilities and its provision of secure
on-site bicycle parking will encourage bicycle use by its tenants thus reducing vehicle trips and
parking demand.

Transit Connectivity
The San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) currently operates two bus routes (KX and
390) along El Camino Real with bus stops near the project site. Route KX operates on 60-minute
headways between 5:40 am to 10:30 pm on weekdays and between 6:15 am to 9:15 pm on
weekends near the project site. Route KX travels between the City of Palo Alto (Caltrain Station)

and City of San Francisco (Transbay Terminal). Route 390 operates on 30-minute headways
between 5:40 am to 12:50 am on weekdays and on 40-minute headways between 6:10 am to
2:20 am on weekends near the project site. Route 390 travels between the City of Palo Alto
(Caltrain Station) and Daly City (BART Station).

Connections to the stops are provided via the sidewalk for the southbound direction and the
relocated unsignalized crosswalk across El Camino Real for the northbound direction. Both
routes have stops that are within short walking distance to the Redwood City Caltrain Station
approximately 1.2 miles north of the project site. Increased transit service is planned on El
Camino Real as part of the Grand Boulevard Initiative. Plus Caltrain has plans to increase service
(provided there is available funding). The proposed project site is expected to generate a low
transit demand initially due to the limited service near the site; the existing transit facilities will
likely be able to accommodate the increase in transit trips. The transit demand will increase as
more frequent service is provided. Future service will be designed to accommodate the demand
increases.

Pedestrian Connectivity
El Camino Real currently has a continuous sidewalk along the project frontage for pedestrian
access. The project will widen the sidewalk along the project frontage and the adjacent Hetch
Hetchy Aqueduct right-of-way to 12 feet and install new street trees and pedestrian level lighting
to enhance the pedestrian environment. Pedestrians can cross El Camino Real using the
unsignalized crosswalk at Northumberland (provide by the project and described below) and at
the signalized intersections at Center Street and Dumbarton Avenue. Center Street also serves
as the main entrance into the shopping center mentioned above. Future residents can access the
existing pedestrian network through a paved walkway that surrounds the perimeter of the project.

The volume.of pedestrians crossing the existing unsignalized crosswalk is low, partly due to the
close proximity of the signalized crossing at Center Street. However, as the area around the site
redevelops, more pedestrian traffic will be generated increasing the number of pedestrians
crossing El Camino Real. In response of the increasing demand and with input from Redwood
City staff, the project will relocate the crosswalk to the southern leg of the intersection. The new
crosswalk provides a shorter crossing distance for pedestrians. It has been designed with the
following enhancements per Caltrans guidelines2 (contained in Attachment C):

            ADA compliant curb ramps at both ends of the crosswalk to provide easy access,
            High visibility crosswalk markings and signage at the crossing location to increase
            visibility,
            An extended and widened median island to create a pedestrian refuge area, and

            "Shark teeth" stop lines to indicate where vehicles should stop in advance of the
            crosswalk

The new crosswalk also provides a more direct connection to the bus stop for future project
residents. These modifications to the existing crosswalk configuration would require Caltrans
approval.

Caltrans also allows the installation of a pedestrian signal or in-roadway warning lights to
enhance pedestrian safety. However, a pedestrian warrant study is required to justify the use of
such devices. The pedestrian signal and in-roadway warning lights warrant requirements are
attached in Attachment C for reference. The current pedestrian use plus the proposed project
alone would not likely generate the pedestrian traffic to meet the warrants.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on this transportation study, the proposed 141-unit apartment development is expected to
add fewer than 100 (71 AM and 63 PM) vehicle trips to the surrounding roadway system during
both the AM and PM peak periods and will have no impacts to the surrounding transportation
networks. The project will widen the sidewalk along its frontage and the adjacent Hetch Hetchy
Aqueduct right-of-way to 12 feet and add street trees and pedestrian level lighting to enhance the
pedestrian environment. The project will relocate and enhance the existing crosswalk to
accommodate future pedestrian demands. The project driveway is expected to operate at LOS B,
a good operating level. The proposed parking supply of 232 spaces meets the city zoning
ordinance for resident parking. Each unit will have one assigned space and the remaining spaces
will be available for residents and guests. The project's TDM measures and location adjacent to
transit service on El Camino Real and future bicycle facilities will decrease its parking demand.

                                          MEMORANDUM


Date:            June 28, 2011

To:              Jonathan Fearn, Urban Housing Group

From:            Jane Bierstedt and Kevin Chen, Fehr & Peers

Subject:         Intersection Evaluations for 2580 El Camino Real in Redwood City,
                 California
                                                                                  SJl1-1236

Fehr & Peers prepared a focused transportation study, for the 2580 El Camino Real project in
Redwood City, California. The project consists of a 141-unit (99 1-bedroom, 41 2-bedroom, and
one studio) apartment development that will replace an existing bowling alley and its associated
surface parking.
The proposed project is consistent with the New General Plan certified by Redwood City in
October 2010. Therefore the General Plan EIR provides CEQA clearance for the project.
Based on knowledge of the project vicinity, project trip distribution, and discussions with City staff,
the project is expected to add through traffic and some U-turning vehicles to the two adjacent
signalized intersections:
      ¯   El Camino Real and Center Street
      ¯   El Camino Real and Dumbarton Avenue

Potential impacts of the project on the operations of these intersections are addressed by
comparing the amount of traffic added by the project to their current operations.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Field observations of the intersections were conducted during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 am) and
evening (4:00 to 6:00 pm) peak periods in January 2011 and supplemented with additional
observations in June 2011. The purpose of these field visits was to observe vehicle, bicycle, and
pedestrian travel patterns, interactions, and travel behavior near the project site. These field visits
also served as precursors to determine if a detailed intersection operations analysis is required.
Vehicle traffic on El Camino Real was in platoons, or groups of vehicles with breaks between the
groups, as opposed to a constant stream of vehicles during both peak hours. This observation
was likely the result of coordinated signals along El Camino Real near the project vicinity. Vehicle
queues in the through lanes at the two intersections cleared after one signal cycle length.
The 175-foot northbound left turn pocket (plus a 30-foot taper) at El Camino Real and Center
Street experienced minimal traffic during the morning peak hour. Evening queues used the full
pocket length twice during the peak hour, with capacity for one more vehicle due to the taper
length. Similarly, the 195-foot southbound left turn pocket (plus a 60-foot taper) at El Camino Real

and Dumbarton Avenue experienced minimal traffic during the morning peak hour and reached
approximately 80-90 percent of capacity during the evening peak hour. During other times of the
day, the traffic volumes are much lighter and the corresponding queues are shorter.
All queues at the two observed intersections cleared after one signal cycle length. This indicates
that the intersections are operating at level of service (LOS) C, good operating level, and have
more than sufficient capacity to accommodate the existing traffic volumes.

PROJECT TRIP ESTIMATION
The proposed project consists of replacing an existing bowling alley with 141 apartment units.
The amount of traffic added to the surrounding roadway system by the proposed project was
estimated by first estimating the amount of traffic generated by the apartment development and
then subtracting the amount of traffic generated by the bowling alley based on driveway counts.
The apartment traffic was estimated by applying trip generation rates for the apartment land use
from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation, 8th Edition (2008). The rates
were calculated using the ITE fitted curve equation and the project size - 141 dwelling units. The
apartment development is expected to generate approximately 978 daily trips, 73 AM peak hour
trips (15 inbound/58 outbound), and 95 PM peak hour trips (62 inbound/33 outbound). The
bowling alley is currently in operation and generates 2 AM peak hour trips (2 inbound/0
outbound), and 32 PM peak hour trips (17 inbound/15 outbound). Table 1 summarizes the ITE
trip generation rates and trip estimates. The apartment development is expected add
approximately 71 net new AM peak hour vehicle trips (13 inbound/58 outbound) and 63 net new
PM peak hour vehicle trips (45 inbound/18 outbound) to the roadway system.

Based on existing travel patterns in the vicinity of the site, relative locations of complementary
land uses in the area, and Journey to Work information provided in the Census Transportation
Planning Packet (CTPP), the major travel directions for the project trips at the site are expected to
be 70 percent to the north and 30 percent to the south on El Camino Real.

With a proposed restricted right-in/right out driveway access to the project site, the project will
add U-turning vehicles to the adjacent intersections. It is expected to add 4 northbound u-turn
vehicles during the morning peak hour and 13 northbound u-turn vehicles during the evening
peak hour at the intersection of El Camino Real/Center Street. While the project will increase the
pocket storage demand during the evening peak hour when it experiences its highest demand,
the additional 13 project trips will span over an hour, or approximately one vehicle every 4.5
minutes. Based on field observations, the existing northbound left turn pocket was fully utilized
only twice during a one hour window, with capacity for one more vehicle in the taper area.
Therefore, the existing plus project left turn vehicle queues are not expected to extend out of the
pocket and impact the adjacent through lanes.

Similarly, the project is projected to add 41 southbound u-turn vehicles during the morning peak
hour and 13 southbound u-turn vehicles during the evening peak hour at the intersection of El
Camino Real/Dumbarton Avenue. The project will increase the pocket storage demand by
approximately one vehicle every 1.5 minutes in the morning and one vehicle every 4.5 minutes in
the evening. Based on field observations, the existing southbound left turn pocket experienced
minimal queues during the morning peak hour and should sufficiently accommodate the added
demand. At times, the existing evening demand reached 90 percent of the capacity. The added
project demand of one vehicle every 4.5 minutes could potentially increase the maximum queue
to meet the storage capacity, but is not expected to cause the pocket to overflow.

CONCLUSIONS
These two intersections are operating at LOS C during both peak periods based on field
observations. These are acceptable operations according to City of Redwood City standards.
Both intersections have sufficient capacity to accommodate the net-added traffic generated by the
project and maintain acceptable operations. Additionally, turn pockets also have sufficient
capacity to accommodate the net-added U-turn traffic. Therefore, the project will not have a
significant impact on intersection operations and a detailed intersection operations analysis is not
required.

Subject:          Crosswalk Analysis for 2580 El Camino Real in Redwood City, California
                                                                                   SJl1-1236

Fehr & Peers prepared a focused transportation study for the 2580 El Camino Real project in
Redwood City, California. The project consists of a 141-unit (99 1-bedroom, 41 2-bedroom, and
one studio) apartment development that will replace an existing bowling alley and its associated
surface parking. The existing unsignalized crosswalk across the north leg of El Camino Real (SR
82) and Northumberland Avenue was addressed as part of that study.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Field observations were conducted during the morning (7:00 to 9:00 am) and evening (4:00 to
6:00 pm) peak periods in January 2011. The purpose of these field visits was to observe vehicle,
bicycle, and pedestrian travel patterns, interactions, and travel behavior near the project site. For
example, how motorists behave around pedestrians, and how pedestrians behave, especially at
the unsignalized crosswalk across El Camino Real and Northumberland Avenue, were observed.

The crosswalk is currently striped at an angle across El Camino Real. It appears that there are
physical constraints on the west side of El Camino Real that preclude a more direct (90 degree)
crossing:
      ¯   an existing catch basin,
      ¯   insufficient Right of Way (ROW) for an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant
          curb ramp due to the existing restaurant, and
      ¯   a PG&E power pole.

Low pedestrian and bicycle activity levels were observed at the crosswalk during the morning and
evening commute periods. Pedestrians were observed waiting to cross until there was a gap in
the traffic flow. In the afternoon pedestrians waited up to 45 seconds to cross. A few pedestrians
were observed crossing El Camino Real illegally.

PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIVITY
Currently, pedestrians can cross El Camino Real using the unsignalized crosswalk and at the
adjacent signalized intersections at Center Street and Dumbarton Avenue. Center Street also
serves as the main entrance into a shopping center.

The volume of pedestrians crossing the existing unsignalized crosswalk is low, partly due to the
close proximity of the signalized crossing at Center Street. However, as the area around the site
redevelops, more pedestrian traffic will be generated increasing the number of pedestrians
crossing El Camino Real. In response to the increasing demand and the existing constraints at
the northern leg, Redwood City staff requested the project study relocating the crosswalk to the
southern leg ot~ the intersection. After submittal of the proposed relocation design to Caltrans on
May 16, 2011, it was recommended by Caltrans to relocate the existing northbound bus stop from
the south leg of the El Camino Real/Northumberland Avenue intersection to the north leg. The
relocation of the bus stop will provide drivers an unobstructed view of pedestrians who wish to
use the new crosswalk. The new crosswalk provides a shorter crossing distance for pedestrians
and provides direct access for future residents to the northbound bus stop. The new crosswalk
will be designed with the following enhancements per Caltrans guidelines1:

        ¯   ADA compliant curb ramps at both ends of the crosswalk to provide easy access,
        ¯   High visibility crosswalk markings and signage at the crossing location to increase
            visibility,
        ¯   An extended and widened median island to create a pedestrian refuge area, and
        ¯   "Shark teeth" stop lines to indicate where vehicles should stop in advance of the
            crosswalk

Caltrans also allows the installation of a pedestrian signal or in-roadway warning lights to
enhance pedestrian safety. However, the current pedestrian use plus the proposed project alone
would not likely generate the pedestrian traffic to meet the warrants required to justify the use of
such devices.

It should be stated that although acceptable to Fehr & Peers, the relocation of this proposed
crosswalk would be contingent upon approvals from Caltrans, SamTrans, and the San Francisco
Public Utilities Commission.

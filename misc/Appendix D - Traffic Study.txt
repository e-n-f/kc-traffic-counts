     1. INTRODUCTION

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The La Bahia Hotel is a proposed four-star 165-room hotel to be built along Beach Street in Santa Cruz,
California. The hotel will feature a meeting room/conference space, 5,000 square-feet of retail and
restaurant space, and a 750 square-foot day spa facility. The project is being constructed at the existing La
Bahia Apartments across the street from the Santa Cruz Boardwalk.

The La Bahia site, in reference to the greater Monterey Bay region, is shown in Figure 1. Santa Cruz is
adjacent to Scott's Valley, the Santa Cruz Mountains to the north, and Monterey to the south. Highway 1
South (Cabrillo Highway / State Route 1) connects the city to numerous state parks and beaches in
Monterey Bay, Highway 17 (State Route 17) connects Santa Cruz to Silicon Valley and the San Francisco
Bay area, and Highway 1 North connects to Half Moon Bay, Pacifica and San Francisco. The proposed
project is to be located with the main entrance on Beach Street with parking garage access from
Westbrook Street and Main Street.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of work for this traffic study was developed in coordination with City staff. The purpose of the
study is to identify the potential traffic impacts that may be associated with the development of the
project. The traffic study includes a traffic impact analysis on intersection traffic operations during typical
weekday PM peak hour conditions. The analysis follows the City General Plan conditions.

Study Intersections
A total of 16 intersections were identified for analysis. The study intersections were determined to be
those where the majority of the traffic generated by development at the La Bahia site will be focused, and
where potential traffic impacts are most likely to occur. The City Traffic Impact Study guidelines require
"critical" intersections be included in the analysis that will experience a project traffic increase of 25 or
more peak hour trips to be analyzed. The addition of 25 or more PM peak hour trips at critical
intersections may change the level of service (LOS) by one level or more and cause a potential impact.
"Critical" intersections are included in the General Plan and in the City Traffic Impact Fee Program and
operating conditions are regarded as critical for efficient traffic flow (i.e. the addition of new project
traffic may result in congested traffic operations during the analysis peak hour and improvements may be
required). These study intersections are shown in Figure 2 and are listed below:

     1.    Highway 1 / Highway 9 --- [signalized]
     2.    Highway 17 / Ocean Street --- [signalized]
     3.    Bay Street / Mission Street (Highway 1) --- [signalized]

The City of Santa Cruz and Caltrans are jointly managing the traffic operations at the Highway 1 /
Highway 9, Highway 17 / Ocean Street and Bay Street / Mission Street (Highway 1) study intersections.

Study Highway Segments
Two highways were identified for capacity analysis in this study: Highways 1 and 17. The following four
highway segments are analyzed, and are graphically indicated in Figure 2:

     1.    Highway 1 ­ Highway 9-River Street to Highway 17 Junction
     2.    Highway 1 ­ Emeline Avenue to Morrissey Boulevard
     3.    Highway 1 ­ Morrissey Boulevard to Soquel Avenue
     4.    Highway 17 ­ Highway 1 Junction to Pasatiempo Drive

Analysis Scenarios
The study includes analysis of PM peak hour traffic conditions under the following development
scenarios:

           Existing Conditions ­ This scenario includes existing (2013) traffic volumes with existing
           roadway and intersection configurations and traffic control.
           Existing Plus Project ­ This scenario includes existing (2013) traffic volumes with the addition
           of Project trips distributed to the existing roadway network.
           Cumulative Conditions ­ This scenario includes future traffic volumes with cumulative
           development envisioned through buildout of the City of Santa Cruz 2030 General Plan, including
           project traffic distributed to the roadway network.


TRAFFIC TERMINOLOGY AND ASSESSMENT METHODS
This section defines key terminology and describes methodologies used for analyzing traffic operations at
study intersections and highway segments.

Intersection Level of Service (LOS) Methodology
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative term describing operating conditions a driver will experience
while traveling on a particular street or at an intersection during a specific time interval. It ranges from
LOS A (very little delay) to LOS F (long delays and congestion).

Signalized Intersections
For signalized intersections, level of service is measured as the average control delay in seconds per
vehicle. Control delay is the portion of the total delay experienced by drivers at intersections that is
attributable to traffic signal operation. It includes the delay for decelerating to a stop at a signal, moving
slowly in a queue of vehicles, stopped delay, and acceleration after the signal turns green. To evaluate
signalized intersections, the operations method of the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, Transportation
Research Board, National Research Council, 2010 (HCM) was utilized.

                                                                                              Traffic Impact Analysis Report
                                                                                             La Bahia Hotel ­ Santa Cruz, CA


Unsignalized Intersections
To evaluate unsignalized intersections, the operations method of the HCM was also utilized. This
methodology determines the LOS based on delay. The delay is reported for the worst approach when the
intersection is controlled with one- or two-way stop signs. The delay is an average for all approaches
when the intersection is controlled with all-way stop signs.

Table 1 provides definitions for each level of service category and summarizes the LOS criteria both
signalized and unsignalized intersections.

Highway Level of Service Methodology
Performance measures such as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and
comfort and convenience are used to describe highway operation conditions. These measures are directly
related to the density of traffic and LOS is a quality measure describing operation conditions within the
stream of traffic during peak hours. The HCM defines six LOS grades for each type of facility. LOS is
designated from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst. The
LOS for a basic freeway segment is based on density given in units of passenger cars per mile per lane.
Table 2 describes the relationship between density and freeway LOS.

Level of Service Standards
        As per the current City of Santa Cruz 2030 General Plan, the City has established LOS D as the
        minimum acceptable LOS for overall intersection operations. However, the existing General Plan
        2030 accepts a lower LOS at major regional intersections if necessary improvements would be
        too costly or result in significant environmental impacts (Policies-Actions M3.1.3, M3.1.4).

Caltrans has jurisdiction over state highways and hopes to maintain a target LOS between C and D.
However, Caltrans also acknowledges this may not always be feasible and recommends the lead agency
consult directly with Caltrans to determine the appropriate target LOS. For many Caltrans facilities,
Transportation Concept Reports (TCR) have been prepared. A TCR is a long-term planning document
that evaluates existing and future conditions along a highway or freeway corridor. The planning horizon is
twenty-years and the document recommends long-term improvements for the corridor.

According to the Transportation Concept Report for US Route 1 in Caltrans District 5 (April 2006),
"Historically, District 5 targeted a peak hour concept of LOS C or better for state highways. However, in
each county, current operations, existing development patterns, environmental values, local plans, and/or
projected growth are such that achieving even LOS D will require major improvements and concerted
efforts to manage demand." The proposed route concept for Highway 1 between Larkin Valley Road to
Highway 17, and from Highway 17 to the Santa Cruz City Limits, which includes all Highway 1
segments analyzed in this study, identifies a peak of LOS D or better. According to the Transportation
Concept Report for US Route 17 in Caltrans District 5 (January 2006), the proposed route concept for
Highway 17 between the Highway 1/Highway 17 junction north to Granite Creek Road identifies a peak
of LOS E or better.

Based on the TCR developed by Caltrans District 5, the analysis in this study is based on the assumption
of LOS D being the appropriate target level of service for the study segments of Highway 1, and LOS E
being the appropriate target level of service for study segments of Highway 17. If an existing State
highway facility is operating at less than the appropriate target LOS, the existing LOS should be
maintained (Caltrans, December 2002.).

SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA
In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), State CEQA Guidelines, City of
Santa Cruz plans and policies, Caltrans guidelines and agency and professional standards, a project
impact would be considered significant if:

           The project would conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance or policy establishing measures of
           effectiveness for the performance of the circulation system, taking into account all modes of
           transportation including mass transit and non-motorized travel and relevant components of the
           circulation system, including but not limited to intersections, streets, highways and freeways,
           pedestrian and bicycle paths, and mass transit OR the project traffic when added to existing
           conditions would result in the level of service deteriorating below the City standard or would
           substantially worsen an intersection operating below level of service D**. The City's current
           level of service standard is LOS D, although the General Plan policies consider accepting a LOS
           below "D" at major regional intersections where improvements would be prohibitively costly or
           result in significant, unacceptable environmental impacts;
           The project traffic would change the peak hour level of service of a State Highway roadway
           segment from acceptable operation to deficient operation with the addition of project-generated
           traffic;
           If the project substantially increases hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or
           dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment);
           The project results in inadequate emergency access;
           The project conflicts with adopted policies, plans or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or
           pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities); or

     **The City considers project traffic impacts to be significant if congestion at intersections operating
     below LOS D will measurably worsen at the intersection as a result of the project. "Measurably
     worsen" is considered to be a 3% increase in trips at the affected intersection. The City has used the
     3% significance criterion for project trip contribution at existing impacted intersections, in part based
     on directives in the City's General Plan to accept a certain level of congestion during peak hours at
     major intersections, as well as to reflect variations in daily traffic volumes. The 3% criterion has been
     used throughout the City, except at Caltrans-operated intersections, and is based upon the likelihood
     that a project will result in an observable increase in congestion and in part is based on information
     provided by Caltrans in the yearly "Traffic Volumes" reports that identifies the standard deviation
     expected with regards to reliability of traffic count data. The standard deviation ranges indicate a 12%
     deviation at 10,000 vehicle trips, meaning that if a traffic count totals 10,000 vehicles per day, then
     approximately 90% of the time, the actual traffic counts will lie within a range of 8,800 to 11,200
     vehicles. Thus, the 3% reflects this variation in daily traffic conditions.

STUDY AREA ROADWAY SYSTEM
The functional classifications of relevant Santa Cruz roads are as follows:

State Highways
State highways that go through the City of Santa Cruz are segments of Highways 1, 17, and 9; Caltrans
references them as state routes. These highways serve the purpose of providing inter-regional travel for
riders commuting to and from destinations in the Santa Clara Valley, Santa Cruz County and Monterey
Bay, including those who commute into Santa Cruz for recreational purposes.

Highway SR 1(Mission St) provides access to San Francisco to the north and Monterey to the south.
Though the highway is oriented in an east to west direction within Santa Cruz, it is primarily aligned as a
north to south direction for interregional travel. It is four-lanes along Mission Street from the west side of
Santa Cruz to the Chestnut Extension, a four lane expressway between the Chestnut Extension and River
Street, and a four lane freeway east of River Street. The speed limits for the corresponding sections are 25
miles per hour (mph), 45 mph, and between 55 and 65 mph, respectively.

Highway SR 17 provides access to the Santa Clara Valley and San Jose to the north and intersects Ocean
Street within the City of Santa Cruz to the south. It is a frequently traveled route for commuters to the
Santa Clara Valley and for recreational traffic coming into Santa Cruz. In the vicinity of the project, it is a
four-lane freeway with a speed limit of 55 mph just north of Highway 1, and 65 mph north of Pasatiempo
Drive.

Highway 9 provides access between the City of Santa Cruz and the San Lorenzo Valley. In the vicinity of
the project, Highway 9 is signed along River Street north of Highway 1. The speed limit on Highway 9 is
25 mph from Highway 1 to just north of Encinal Street, and 35 mph north of Encinal Street.

Arterials
The function of arterial roadways is to accommodate high traffic volumes and intra-city circulation. These
streets are used to travel to major activity centers, facilitate freeway access, and connect to other arterials.
They also serve adjacent residential land uses via arterial and collector connections.

Ocean Street is a four-lane north to south arterial that intersects Highway 17 to the north and E. Cliff
Drive to the south. On-street metered parking is available along most stretches of Ocean Street north of
Soquel Avenue. It is connected to many east-west arterials along its stretch and the posted speed limit is
30 mph.

Bay Street is a two-lane northwest to southeast arterial that intersects Mission Street (Highway 1) to the
north and W. Cliff Drive to the south. The posted speed limit is 25 mph. The major collectors of intersect
are California Street and California Avenue.

Water Street is a four-lane east to west arterial that intersects Mission and River Streets to the west and
Morrissey Boulevard and Soquel Avenue to the east. The posted speed limit is 30 mph and Ocean Street
and Front Street are the major north-south arterials of intersect.

Broadway Avenue & Soquel Avenue are east to west arterials that intersect Ocean Street and Seabright
Avenue; the western extents intersects Front Street. The -posted speed limit for both arterials is 25 mph.
Broadway is a two-lane arterial while Soquel is four-lanes.

Riverside Avenue, Front Street, & Pacific Avenue are north to south two-lane arterials with posted speed
limits of 25 mph. Their primary function is to serve the downtown and Boardwalk areas within the City of
Santa Cruz and intersect many local roads and a few east-west arterials. Riverside Avenue is a one-way
street southbound from 3rd to Beach Street. There is on-street metered parking on many stretches of these
roadways.

San Lorenzo Boulevard, E. Cliff Drive, Laurel Street, 2nd Street, & Leibrandt Avenue are two-lane east to
west arterials with posted speed limits of 25 mph. They are all shorter segments of roadway primarily
connecting to local streets, some major north-west arterials, in addition to serving the downtown and
Boardwalk areas. Both metered and unmetered local on-street parking spots are available and there are
many left or right-turn exclusive lanes on these arterials. 2nd Street is a one-way road heading west.

Beach Street is a two-lane east to west arterial that runs parallel to the coast line of Monterey Bay. It is a
one-way roadway heading east past Pacific Avenue and the posted speed limit is 25. Most intersections
are stop sign controlled except at Riverside Avenue. There is a buffered cycle track on the south side of
the street and metered on-street parking on the north and portions of the south side. It connects to several
arterial and local streets in the beach area

Collector Streets
The function of collectors is to provide travel within and between neighborhoods. They collect traffic
from local streets and channel it to arterial streets.

W. Cliff Drive is a two-lane multi-directional collector that runs parallel to the coastline west of Pacific
Avenue. The posted speed limit is 25 mph. It provides access to many local roads and hotel
establishments along the coast. There are bike lanes, buffered cycle tracks and multi-use trails along
stretches of the roadway primarily on the ocean side of the street.

Local Streets
The function of local streets is to provide travel within residential areas and neighborhoods, and provide
direct access to land uses. They are designed to discourage through traffic in residential areas.

Westbrook Street & Main Street are two-lane, north to south local streets that run adjacent to the La Bahia
Apartments. The un-posted speed limit is 25 mph and they both intersect Beach Street. Metered, on-street
parallel parking is available on the La Bahia frontage side and diagonal on-street parking is available on
the opposite side of both streets.

Cliff Street is a short, north to south local street connecting Beach and 3rd Streets. Most portions are two-
lanes, but one major block is a three-lane bi-directional road with two left-turn only lanes approaching
Beach Street. The un-posted speed limit is 25 mph and there is ample on-street parallel and diagonal
metered parking available on both sides.

Project Access
Regional access to the project site is provided from Highways 1, 9, and 17. Major roadways in the
vicinity of the project site are Pacific Avenue, Front Street, River Street and Beach Street.

EXISTING CONDITIONS INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Intersection turning movement counts were collected for the PM peak period between 4:00-6:00 PM on a
typical weekday in July 2013. The counts included vehicular traffic, pedestrians, and bicycles at all of the
study intersections. The traffic counts collected at Bay Street/Mission Street (Highway 1) were compared
to counts collected in 2010 when UCSC was in session to verify if traffic conditions varied significantly
during the school year. The PM peak hour volumes collected in July 2013 were within one percent of the
2010 count volumes, and were considered sufficient for use in this analysis. A field visit was conducted
in July 2013 to observe existing intersection geometry, traffic control, transit facilities, pedestrian and
bicycle accessibility and activity and general traffic conditions. Existing study intersection lane
configurations and traffic control are shown in Figure 3. Existing PM peak hour turning movement
volumes are shown in Figure 4.

Intersection levels of service were calculated for PM peak hour conditions using Synchro 7 © software,
with the exception of three unsignalized intersections that were analyzed using TRAFFIX v8.0 software
due to the limitations of Synchro to analyze unsignalized intersections with three or more approach lanes.
Both of these software tools utilize the methodologies of the HCM 2010. Results of the existing
conditions intersection LOS analysis are summarized in Table 3. Detailed intersection LOS calculations
are included in the Appendix.

As shown in Table 3, all study intersections currently operate within the City standard at LOS D or better
with the exception of the Highway 1/Highway 9 (River Street) intersection, operating at LOS E. The Bay
Street/Mission Street (Highway 1) intersection operates at LOS D, which is considered acceptable using
the City's LOS standards, but considered unacceptable based on the Caltrans LOS standards.

EXISTING CONDITIONS HIGHWAY OPERATIONS
For study highway segments, Caltrans 2012 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volume data was
used to identify existing highway mainline volumes. Caltrans `K' and `D' factors were utilized to convert
the 2012 AADT to directional PM peak hour volumes. 1

Highway segment levels of service were calculated using HCS 2010 software. Results of the existing
conditions highway LOS analysis at the study area segments during the PM peak hour are summarized in
Table 4. The analysis does not assess merge or weaving conditions.

As shown in Table 4, all highway segments are currently operating within Caltrans standards except for
the following segment:

           Highway 1 ­ Morrissey Boulevard to Soquel Avenue (LOS F ­ Southbound)

Note that the highway segment capacity analysis presented in this study may not fully reflect the potential
impacts to Highway 1 traffic operations related to ongoing construction of the Highway 1 Soquel to
Morrissey Auxiliary Lanes Project and/or traffic incidents, which can increase congestion along the
Highway 1 corridor beyond what is reflected in this analysis. Detailed LOS calculations for highway
segments are included in the Appendix.


1
 The `K' factor is the percentage of AADT during the peak hour for both directions of travel. The `D' factor is the
percentage of the peak hour travel in the peak direction. `K' and `D' factors multiplied with the AADT gives the one
way peak period directional flow rate or the design hourly volume (DHV).

EXISTING TRANSIT FACILITIES
Bus Facilities
The Santa Cruz public bus system is operated by Santa Cruz METRO and provides transit facility bus
stops in the vicinity of the La Bahia Apartment complex. All bus routes on the METRO system have
access to the Pacific Avenue transit station hub located in downtown Santa Cruz between Front Street and
Pacific Avenue. Bus riders typically will walk a maximum of .5 miles (2,640 feet) to a bus stop. There are
three major bus routes that provide service in the Project vicinity. Users can access the bus stops via
sidewalks directly from the site. The bus routes, bus stops, and their distances from the site are as follows:

 Local Santa Cruz Bus Routes
Route 3 ­ Mission / Natural Bridges provides service to the west via Mission and Bay Streets. The nearest
bus stop is at Pacific Avenue / Beach Street at 528 feet from the site.

UCSC & Westside Bus Routes
Route 19 ­ UCSC via Lower Bay & Route 20 ­ UCSC via Westside provide services to the northwest via
Bay Street and Delaware Avenue respectively. There is a bus stop at Pacific Avenue / Viaduct Lane at
1,056 feet from the site.

Cabrillo / South County Routes
Route 71 ­ Santa Cruz / Watsonville provides services to the east into Capitola and Watsonville via
Soquel Street and Water Street. The nearest bus stop is at 2nd Street / Main Street at 1,584 feet from the
site.

Train Facilities
The Union Pacific Railway line crosses Pacific Avenue just north of the intersection of Pacific Avenue
and Beach Street and continues east on Beach Street. The rail line is owned by the Santa Cruz County
Regional Transportation Commission. Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway Company operates a
tourist-oriented passenger rail service between Felton and the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Santa Cruz
and Monterey Bay Railway is the mainline rail operator that also operates trains on the track. A train stop
is located at the Boardwalk off the roadway. There are four recreational trips daily between June 8th and
August 18th (from 10 AM to 4 PM), weekends in September, and sporadically in January through April
(pre-season). Additional trips may occur over the year, but are currently limited due to the condition of
the railway bridges.

A full schedule and map of the bus routes operating within the vicinity of the site are provided in the
Appendix.

EXISTING BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN SYSTEMS
Bicycle Circulation
As the City of Santa Cruz is predominantly a beach and recreation town with an extensive bicycle
network. The city has three different types of bicycle facilities:

Class I (Off-Street bicycle/pedestrian path): A right-of-way that is completely separated from any streets.
These facilities are multi-use trails and cycle tracks that accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists or just
bicyclists.



LaBahia Draft TIA_01-06-14.doc                   11                                              January 2014

Class II (On-Street bicycle lane): A one-way striped and signed lane for bicyclists on either side of the
street

Class III (Signed Bicycle Routes): A street where bicyclists and automobiles share the traveled way
marked only by signs.

Class II bike lanes run along all extents of the study area arterials except portions of 2nd Street, Leibrandt
Avenue and East Cliff Drive. A cycle track exists along the southern side of Beach Street.

A map of the existing City of Santa Cruz bicycle system is provided in the Appendix.

Pedestrian Circulation
There are pedestrian facilities in place around the La Bahia Apartment complex including sidewalks, curb
ramps, and striping at pedestrian crossings. As the Boardwalk and beach draw in many tourists there is
heavy pedestrian traffic utilizing these facilities. From a preliminary site visit, there are adjacent
pedestrian crossings with curb ramps and striping at the intersections of Westbrook / Beach Street and
Main Street / Beach Street. Crossing Beach Street at these intersections provides pedestrians an entrance
for direct access to the beach. The Westbrook intersection has a ramp/graded access to the beach from the
sidewalk and the Main Street entrance has a stairway. Boardwalk access is available upon crossing Beach
Street and heading east. Pedestrians from the site also have access to other amenities along Beach Street
in both directions including restaurants, bars, a small market/deli, and a beach supply shop.

Table 5 lists the frontage sidewalks and measured widths currently around the La Bahia site. All study
intersections have sidewalks present on at least one side of all directional legs except the east-west legs of
Intersection 1 (Highway 1-9) and the north leg of Intersection 2 (Highway 17/Ocean). Signalized
pedestrian crossings are present at all signalized intersections on the approach(s) that pedestrians are
permitted to cross; the specific crossings and pedestrian volumes can be found in the Intersection LOS
calculations in the Appendix.

     3. EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS
This section describes the project trip generation, distribution and assignment, and summarizes the
findings of Existing Plus Project conditions traffic operations analysis.

PROJECT TRIP GENERATION
The project is composed of the following uses:


LaBahia Draft TIA_01-06-14.doc                        12                                         January 2014

                                                                                 Traffic Impact Analysis Report
                                                                                La Bahia Hotel ­ Santa Cruz, CA



           A 165-room Hotel
           Conference facilities/meeting rooms totaling 4,350 square (with seating for 290 attendees 2)
           A 2,500 square-foot retail space
           A 2,500 square-foot restaurant space
           A 750 square-foot day spa facility
           210 total on-site parking spaces as follows:
               o 87 regular striped spaces
               o 67 compact striped spaces
               o 49 valet spaces (provided in the drive aisles of the parking structure)
               o 7 Americans with Disability Act (ADA) parking spaces in the parking structure

The trip generation estimate for the proposed project was developed using trip rates published in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation, 9th Edition, 2012. ITE trip generation rates
for hotel land uses (Land Use Code 310) include facilities commonly included within a hotel site, such as
restaurants, small retail shops, cocktail lounges, meeting and banquet rooms or convention facilities, as
well as employee trips. For this reason, no additional trip generation was included for the project's retail,
restaurant or conference facility/meeting space components. The spa facility is assumed to generate some
trips from outside of the hotel; thus, half the trip generation for the spa facility was included in the trip
generation totals in addition to the hotel trip generation.

A 44-unit apartment complex currently exists within the footprint of the proposed hotel and will be
demolished prior to construction of the hotel. The trip generation for the existing apartment complex was
credited to the project trip generation totals in order to calculate the net new trips generated by the
proposed project.

Trip Generation Reductions
A 10 percent reduction was applied to the hotel trip generation. The 10 percent reduction equates to a net
reduction of 12 hotel trips during the PM peak hour. This reduction reflects the employment of
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies that are appropriate for the land use and
implemented through the project development conditions. The project applicant has developed an initial
Alternative Transportation Program in an effort to reduce private-auto and parking demand in conjunction
with the hotel project. The initial program details, which are described in a letter from the project
applicant addressed to the City of Santa Cruz, include TDM strategies such as providing on-site bicycle
parking/storage, discounted/free transit passes for employees and promoting carpooling, transit and/or
bicycle commuting for hotel employees. The City is anticipated to work with the project applicant to
pursue commitment to additional TDM strategies, such as providing a bike share program (hotel bicycles
can be shared by hotel guests; coupons to local bicycle rental shops), offering financial incentives to staff
who carpool, discounted bus or trolley passes for hotel guests, and annual reporting of results of TDM
measures to the City. A copy of this letter is included in the Appendix.

The close proximity of bicycle facilities, the local transit service, and the trolley shuttle during the
summer months, and the non-private vehicle incentives offered by the hotel, could result in trip reductions
for both staff and visitors alike. Typically, a hotel located in a resort type set-up (Boardwalk, Beach,
Wharf, Restaurants) similar in surroundings to the project, would have a PM peak hour trip generation
rates of up to 43% lower than the project (ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, ITE). The 10 percent

  The concentrated occupancy per California Building Code (tables & chairs) is 15 square feet per occupant. Using
this spacing, the Conference/Meeting Room max occupancy is estimated at 290 seats (4,350 s.f. / 15 sf per seat

reduction is much less that what could be experienced and is consistent with the allowed parking
reductions per City of Santa Cruz Zoning Code SEC 24.12.290.7. A 10 percent reduction was also
applied to the trip generation for the existing apartment units to reflect walk/bike/transit trips for the
existing site.

The project would generate a net 1,075 daily trips; with 79 trips (38 in, 41 out) occurring during the PM
peak hour.

Project trip generation assumptions and calculations are shown in Table 6.

 Notes:
 1. Trip generation rates published by Institute of Transportation Engineers, "Trip Generation," 9th Edition, 2012.
 2. ITE trip generation rates for hotel use include hotel restaurants; thus, no additional trip generation is provided for the project's restaurant component.
 3. A per room rate is used for trip generation which indicates 100% occupancy, which results in conservative analysis for off-peak season, and 100% use
    in the peak season.
 4. A 10% reduction of hotel trips is credited given the assumption that hotel staff will utilize bicycles and existing transit facilities specifically in the vicinity
    of Santa Cruz and La Bahia. This is consistent with the allowed parking reductions for a development of this type per Santa Cruz zoning code SEC 24.12.290.4.
 5. ITE does not have trip generation rates for Spa uses, so Medical Office trip generation rates are used
 6. A worst case scenario of 50% public use is assumed for the Spa use, which would generate trips from outside of the hotel and the Spa is assumed
    to be 100% occupied.
 7. Credit is given for the existing 44 apartments at the proposed project site. A 10% reduction of existing apartment trips is credited given the assumption that
 existing residents utilize bicycles, walking, and existing transit facilities within the vicinity of Santa Cruz and the apartment site.
 8. Assumed 50/50 split for apartment in and out trips due to students leaving for evening classes.
 9. Average rates are used for the apartments instead of the regression equation, because of the small number of units. This provides for a conservative analysis.

PROJECT TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
The distribution of project trips was determined based upon the locations of land uses within the City of
Santa Cruz, as well as traffic volumes at the study intersections, and is consistent with other traffic studies
within the city limits. The trip distribution for the project trips is as follows (City of Santa Cruz TRAFFIX
model gate numbers shown in parenthesis):

           To/From the North ­ Highway 17/Scotts Valley (Gate #25):                  49%
           To/From the East ­ Highway 1/Capitola (Gate #19):                         29%
           To/From the West ­ Highway 1 (Gate #1):                                   10%
           To/From the North ­ Downtown Santa Cruz (Gate #58):                       10%
           To/From the Beach Area Neighborhood                                       2%
           TOTAL:                                                                    100%

The project trip distribution is illustrated in Figure 5. The PM peak hour project trip assignment is shown
in Figure 6.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
The project trip assignment was added to the existing PM peak hour intersection volumes to determine the
Existing Plus Project conditions volumes, which are shown in Figure 7.

Intersection levels of service under Existing Plus Project conditions were evaluated using the intersection
volumes shown in Figure 7 and assuming the existing intersection geometrics and traffic control.
Existing Plus Project intersection levels of service are summarized in Table 7.

As shown in Table 7, all of the City-maintained study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of
service according the City's LOS standard. The Highway 1/Highway 9 intersection would continue to
operate at LOS E. The Bay Street/Mission Street (Highway 1) intersection would continue to operate at
an unacceptable LOS D per Caltrans' LOS standard. Detailed LOS calculations for intersections are
included in the Appendix.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT CONDITIONS HIGHWAY SEGMENT OPERATIONS
The project trip assignment was added to the existing PM peak hour highway volumes to determine the
Existing Plus Project conditions volumes, which are shown in Table 8. Highway segment levels of
service under Existing Plus Project conditions were evaluated using the Existing Plus Project volumes
and assuming the existing highway geometrics and lane configurations with completion of the Highway 1
Morrissey Boulevard to Soquel Avenue Auxiliary Lanes Project, which was under construction at the
time this analysis was performed, but will be completed prior to release of this study (and opening of the
proposed Project). Existing Plus Project highway segment levels of service for study segments of
Highway 1 and Highway 17 are summarized in Table 8.

As shown in Table 8, all of the study highway segments would operate at acceptable levels of service
according the LOS targets established by Caltrans. The segment of Highway 1 from Morrissey Boulevard
to Soquel Avenue, which currently operates at LOS F in the southbound direction during the PM peak
hour will improve to acceptable LOS D with completion of the auxiliary lanes project.

Detailed LOS calculations for highway segments are included in the Appendix.

EXISTING PLUS PROJECT IMPACTS AND RECOMMENDED MITIGATION MEASURES

Intersections

Highway 1 / Highway 9

The City of Santa Cruz level of service standard is D, although the General Plan allows consideration of
acceptance of a lower LOS at regional intersections if necessary improvements would be too costly or
result in significant environmental impacts (Policies-Actions M3.1.3, M3.1.4). However, the Caltrans
standard is LOS C/D. The intersection would operate at LOS E with a control delay of 76 seconds/vehicle
during the PM peak hour. In terms of Caltrans standards, the intersection would operate at an
unacceptable LOS, although the existing deficient LOS would not change. Although the addition of
project traffic (27 PM peak hour trips added) and the change in overall intersection control delay (increase
of 0.4 seconds/vehicle) is not considerable, the project traffic would result in a significant impact at this
intersection based on Caltrans standards.

The following improvements have been identified for this intersection and are included in the current City
Traffic Impact Fee (TIF) Program:

           Northbound Approach: Restripe the intersection to consist of one left/thru, one-thru, and two-
           right lanes.
           Southbound Approach: Modify to consist of two-left, one-left/thru, one-thru, and one-right lane.
           Eastbound Approach: Reconstruct to consist of two-left, three-thru, and one-right lanes. The
           northbound receiving leg would be widened to two lanes.

With these improvements the intersection will continue to operate at LOS E, but the average control delay
will be reduced by approximately 20 seconds/vehicle compared to existing baseline conditions.
Currently, a Project Report, preliminary engineering, associated studies and environmental review are
underway and construction is anticipated to commence in 2015/2016. The improvements are already
required under existing conditions. The City has established a TIF Program and is collecting fees for
planned improvements at this intersection. The project would be required to pay these impact fees.
However, until the improvement is implemented, the intersection will continue to operate at an
unacceptable level of service, and this impact is considered to be significant-and-unavoidable.

Bay Street / Mission Street (Highway 1)

The City of Santa Cruz level of service standard for this intersection is LOS D, while the Caltrans
standard is LOS C/D. The intersection would operate at acceptable LOS D during the PM peak hour
according to the City's standards. In terms of Caltrans standards, the intersection would operate at
unacceptable LOS. Although the addition of project traffic (8 PM peak hour trips added) and the change
in overall intersection control delay (increase of 0.1 seconds/vehicle) is not considerable, the project does
cause a significant impact at the intersection based on Caltrans standards.

The following improvements have been identified for this intersection and are included in the current City
TIF Program:

           Eastbound Approach: Reconstruct to consist of one-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.
           Westbound Approach: Reconstruct to consist of one-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.
           Northbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one-left, one-thru, and one-right lane.
           Southbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of two-left, one-thru, and one-right lane.
           Convert northbound and southbound approaches from split-phasing to protected left turn phasing.

With these improvements the intersection will operate at an acceptable level LOS C during the PM peak
hour and the impact would be mitigated. The City has established a TIF Program and is collecting fees for
planned improvements at this intersection. The project would be required to pay these impact fees.
However, until the improvement is implemented, the intersection would continue to operate at an
unacceptable level of service and the impact is considered to be significant-and-unavoidable.

     4. CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS
This section describes the traffic operations analysis results under cumulative traffic conditions with the
proposed project. The cumulative traffic condition is defined as traffic conditions with General Plan 2030
buildout.

CUMULATIVE PROJECTS TRIP GENERATION
The Cumulative traffic volumes reflect the forecast growth identified in the General Plan 2030
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) buildout development scenario with long-range growth anticipated
for the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). General Plan 2030 buildout projections include
growth from various projects under construction, projects approved but not built, projects with pending
permit applications or other reasonably foreseeable projects. Cumulative traffic forecast volumes were
provided by the City of Santa Cruz in the form of output from their citywide TRAFFIX model. The
potential development identified through buildout of the 2030 General Plan with long-range growth for
USCS results in an estimated 11,550 new trips generated during the PM peak hour.

The General Plan 2030 EIR traffic projections included a 125-room hotel project at the La Bahia site as
the project had been approved by the City, but had not yet gone to the Coastal Commission at the time the
EIR was written. In order to develop the Cumulative traffic volumes, the trip generation for the La Bahia
site was adjusted in the General Plan 2030 EIR buildout TRAFFIX model scenario to reflect the
estimated PM peak hour project trip generation, as shown in Table 6, and the project trips were assigned
to the roadway network based on the project trip distribution assumptions discussed previously and
illustrated in Figure 5.

The PM peak hour intersection volumes for Cumulative conditions are shown in Figure 8.

PLANNED AND PROPOSED TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
The City of Santa Cruz provided a list of planned improvements identified to address existing and future
transportation deficiencies as identified in the General Plan and/or other traffic studies. Improvements are
generally funded through the City's Traffic Impact Fee (TIF) program and are commonly programmed as
part of the City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The following planned future improvements were
identified for intersections analyzed as part of this study:

Int. #1: Highway 1 / Highway 9 [Project scheduled 2015-16]
           Northbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one left/thru, one-thru, and two-right
           lanes.
           Southbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of two-left, one-left/thru, one-thru, and
           one-right lane.
           Eastbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of two-left, three-thru, and one-right/thru
           lanes. The northbound receiving leg would be widened to two lanes.

Int. #3: Bay Street / Mission Street (Highway 1) [Project schedule to be determined]
           Eastbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.
           Westbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.
           Northbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one-left, one-thru, and one-right lane.
           Southbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of two-left, one-thru, and one-right lane.
           Convert northbound and southbound approaches from split-phasing to protected left turn phasing.

Int. #4: Ocean Street / Water Street [Project scheduled 2014-15]
         Eastbound Approach: Widen approach to provide two-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.
         Southbound Approach: Modify to provide two-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.

Int. #7: Ocean Street / Broadway [Project schedule to be determined]
         Prohibit left turns from Ocean Street.

Int. #9: Pacific Avenue / Beach Street [Project scheduled 2014-15]
         Reconstruct intersection as a roundabout.'

Int. #10: Cliff Street / Beach Street [Project scheduled 2015]
         Install traffic signal.

Int. #11: Riverside Avenue / 2nd Street-Leibrandt Street [Project scheduled 2015]
         Various intersection safety improvement planned as part of Riverside Avenue Utility
         Underground and Streetscape Project, including eliminating intersection approach at west leg of
         Leibrandt Street.

Int. #16: Ocean Street / San Lorenzo Boulevard [Project schedule to be determined]
         Southbound Approach: Add right turn lane.

These improvements are included in the City's TIF Program. However, because full funding has not yet
been identified and implementation schedule is yet to be determined, these improvements are not assumed
in the Cumulative roadway network.

Caltrans is responsible for improvements along state routes and has proposed a series of improvements
along Highway 1 within Santa Cruz County. Caltrans, in coordination with the Santa Cruz County
Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), propose
operational improvements along a distance of just less than one mile of Highway 1 from Soquel Avenue
to east of Morrissey Boulevard in the City of Santa Cruz. The project is currently under construction with
an estimated completion date of late 2013. In addition to this project, the Route Concept Report for
Highway 1 includes the addition of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes to Highway one, which
includes the addition of one HOV lane in each direction from Morrissey Boulevard to San Andreas
Road/Larkin Valley Road. The intent of the HOV project is to reduce congestion, encourage carpooling,
expand express bus service, and improve safety along the congested corridor. The environmental review
phase of this project is funded and is underway; however, funding has not been identified to cover costs
through construction.

No capacity improvements are currently planned for Highway 17 within the vicinity of the study area.

CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Intersection levels of service under cumulative conditions were analyzed using the intersection volumes
shown in Figure 8 and assuming existing intersection configurations. The intersection levels of service
are summarized in Table 9 below.

As shown in Table 9, all of the study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service according
the LOS targets established by the City of Santa Cruz, with the exception of the following locations:

           #1: Highway 1 / Highway 9 ­ LOS F in the PM peak hour
           #3: Bay Street / Mission Street (Highway 1) ­ LOS F in the PM peak hour
           #4: Ocean Street / Water Street ­ LOS F in the PM peak hour
           #7: Ocean Street / Broadway ­ LOS F in the PM Peak hour
           #16: Ocean Street / San Lorenzo Boulevard ­ LOS E in the PM peak

The Cumulative intersection levels of service remain consistent with the LOS results from the General
Plan 2030 EIR buildout development scenario with UCSC growth.

CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS HIGHWAY OPERATIONS
Cumulative (2030) baseline highway mainline volumes were estimated based on forecasted traffic growth
as presented in the Highway 1 & Highway 183 Corridor System Management Plan (Caltrans, 2011), the
Transportation Concept Report for US Route 17 in District 5 (Caltrans, 2006), as well as the General Plan
2030 EIR cumulative buildout traffic projections. The net new project trip assignment, minus the trip
assignment for the La Bahia development site as assumed in the General Plan 2030 EIR traffic analysis,
was added to the projected cumulative baseline highway volumes to determine the Cumulative conditions
volumes, which are shown in Table 10.

Highway segment levels of service were evaluated for the study segments of Highway 1 and Highway 17
using the Cumulative directional PM peak hour volumes and assuming construction of the Highway 1
auxiliary lanes between Morrissey Boulevard and Soquel Avenue, which are anticipated to be completed
in 2013 prior to completion of this study. Because no funding has yet been identified for costs associated
with construction of the proposed Highway 1 HOV lane improvements, this project is not included as part
of the Cumulative highway segment analysis. Cumulative highway segment levels of service are
summarized in Table 10.

As shown in Table 10, all of the study highway segments would operate at acceptable levels of service
according to the LOS targets established by Caltrans, with the exception of the following locations, which
are anticipated to operate at unacceptable LOS with or without project:

           Highway 1 ­ Highway 9 to Highway 17 Junction (LOS F ­ Southbound)
           Highway 1 ­ Emeline Avenue to Morrissey Boulevard (LOS E ­ Southbound)
           Highway 1 ­ Morrissey Boulevard to Soquel Avenue (LOS E ­ Northbound; LOS F ­
           Southbound)

Detailed LOS calculations for highway segments are included in the Appendix.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Intersections

Highway 1 / Highway 9

The City of Santa Cruz level of service standard is LOS D, while the Caltrans standard is LOS C/D. The
intersection is expected to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour under Cumulative conditions,
which is a decrease from the existing LOS of E and is considered unacceptable based on Caltrans
standards. This represents a significant impact.

The following improvements have been identified for this intersection and are included in the current City
TIF Program:

           Northbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one left/thru, one-thru, and two-right
           lanes.
           Southbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of two-left, one-left/thru, one-thru, and
           one-right lane.
           Eastbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of two-left, three-thru, and one-right/thru
           lanes. The northbound receiving leg would be widened to two lanes.

With these improvements the intersection will continue to operate at LOS F, but the average control delay
will be reduced to approximately 153 seconds/vehicle compared to Cumulative baseline conditions. The
City has established a TIF Program and is collecting fees for planned improvements at this intersection.
The project would be responsible for paying a traffic impact fee as required by the City to mitigate its
cumulative impact. With this partial mitigation, the cumulative impacts would continue to be significant.

Bay Street / Mission Street (Highway 1)

The intersection is expected to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour under Cumulative conditions,
which is a decrease from the existing LOS of D and is considered unacceptable based on Caltrans
standards. This represents a significant impact.

The following improvements have been identified for this intersection and are included in the current City
TIF Program:

           Eastbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.
           Westbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.
           Northbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of one-left, one-thru, and one-right lane.
           Southbound Approach: Reconstruct approach to consist of two-left, one-thru, and one-right lane.
           Convert northbound and southbound approaches from split-phasing to protected left turn phasing.

With these improvements the intersection will continue to operate at LOS F, but the average control delay
will be reduced to approximately 102 seconds/vehicle compared to Cumulative baseline conditions. The
City has established a TIF Program and is collecting fees for planned improvements at this intersection.

           Southbound Approach: Modify to provide two-left, two-thru, and one-right lane.

With these improvements the intersection will continue to operate at LOS F, but the average control delay
will be reduced by approximately 49 seconds/vehicle compared to Cumulative baseline conditions. The
City has established a TIF Program and is collecting fees for planned improvements at this intersection.
The project would be responsible for paying a traffic impact fee as required by the City to mitigate its

responsible for paying a traffic impact fee as required by the City to mitigate its cumulative impact. With
this mitigation, this impact would be considered less than significant.

Ocean Street / San Lorenzo Boulevard

The intersection is expected to operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour under Cumulative conditions,
which is a decrease from the existing LOS of C and is considered unacceptable based on City standards.
This represents a significant impact.

The following improvements have been identified for this intersection and are included in the current City
TIF Program:

           Southbound Approach: Add right turn lane.

With these improvements the intersection will operate at acceptable LOS D. The City has established a
TIF Program and is collecting fees for planned improvements at this intersection. The project would be
responsible for paying a traffic impact fee as required by the City to mitigate its cumulative impact. With
this mitigation, this impact would be considered less than significant.

Cumulative intersection levels of service with recommended mitigation improvements are summarized in
Table 11.

Highway Segments

Highway 1 ­ Highway 9 to Highway 17 Junction (SB)

This highway segment would operate at unacceptable LOS F according to the Caltrans established target
of LOS D for this segment of Highway 1. Based on the Caltrans significance criteria the impact is
significant and unavoidable.

Highway 1 ­ Emeline Avenue to Morrissey Boulevard (SB)

This highway segment would operate at unacceptable LOS E according to the Caltrans established target
of LOS D for this segment of Highway 1. Based on the Caltrans significance criteria the impact is
significant and unavoidable.

Highway 1 ­Morrissey Boulevard to Soquel Avenue (NB and SB)

This highway segment would operate at unacceptable LOS E in the northbound direction and LOS F in
the southbound direction during PM peak hour conditions, below the target of LOS D established by
Caltrans for this segment of Highway 1. Based on the Caltrans significance criteria the impact is
significant and unavoidable.

PROJECT PAYMENT OF TRAFFIC IMPACT FEES
The project will be required to pay the City's traffic impact fee, which would represent mitigation for the
project's contribution to cumulative impacts to City intersections. Based on the project's estimated PM
peak hour trip generation of 77 trips, the project applicant would be required to a total amount of
$304,150 in TIF fees based on the current PM peak our trip rate.

     5. PROJECT ACCESS AND SITE CIRCULATION

This section documents a review of the project site access and on-site circulation.

SITE ACCESS
The project will have a check-in driveway at the first floor level on Beach Street, which provides access
to the valet parking area and the on-site parking garage. One exit-only driveway will be provided on Main
Street and one full-access driveway will be provided on Westbrook Street. The driveway on Westbrook
Street provides access to the parking structure on the second floor. Circulation within the parking garage
is adequate for passenger-type vehicles. Some of the parking spaces at the end of the drive aisles will
require multiple turns to exit, which may be troublesome for inexperienced drivers or larger vehicles.

DELIVERIES AND TRUCK TURNING MANEUVERS
Goods vehicles will make deliveries to the project site on Westbrook Street (food, linen and hotel related
deliveries and pick-ups). Trucks would have to back up into the loading dock from the street. Westbrook
Street is a local street low traffic volume, one travel lane in each direction and on-street parking on both
sides. It is expected that the majority of delivery trucks would consist of typical 30-foot rigid-body
vehicles. These vehicles aren't anticipated to have trouble accessing the loading area. Longer 40-foot
trucks would likely have to encroach into the opposing traffic lane to access the loading area. Trucks
longer than 40 feet would likely have trouble accessing the loading area and would have to park on-street
to make deliveries or pick-ups.

BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN AND TRANSIT ASSESSMENT
A bicycle cycle track runs along the south side of Beach Street in the project vicinity and is frequently
used by cyclists. Access to the site would be available from the cycle track and sidewalks.

The site plan for the application indicates that on-site bicycle parking facilities will be provided with
capacity for 70 total bicycles. Interior storage will be provided for up to 40 bicycles, while outdoor
bicycle parking facilities with room for 30 bicycles will be provided near the entrance of the hotel. The
City Zoning Code requires the project to provide one bicycle parking space for every five units. Thus, for
the 165 units there would have to be 33 bicycle parking spaces. Ten percent, or four (4) spaces, should be
Class 1 (have a locker, individually locked or supervised area within a building providing protection for
each bicycle from theft, vandalism and weather). The remaining ninety percent would be Class 2 (a stand
of other device to enable the user to secure by locking the frame and one wheel of each bicycle parked
therein).

The sidewalk on the project frontage would be reconstructed as part of the project. The sidewalk width
should be to City standard. ADA ramps must be provided at all curb positions on the sidewalk per City
standard. Stairwells and elevators would provide access between the parking structure and the hotel. In
addition to the main entry location on Beach Street, pedestrian access will also be provided from First
Street to the parking structure and the hotel.

As noted previously, the vehicular project trip generation estimates include a 10 percent reduction based
on the assumption that some hotel staff are anticipated to travel by bicycle or transit to and from the

                                                                                                  La Bahia Hotel ­ Santa Cruz, CA


project site. Conservatively assuming that the full 10 percent multi-modal reduction is comprised of staff
trips made by bus transit, the project would potentially generate approximately 148 new weekday daily
bus passengers and 12 new weekday PM peak hour bus passengers. The project would not interfere with
any existing or planned transit facilities or systems and the additional bus ridership demand generated by
the project is not anticipated to exceed the available supply of the existing or future transit system.


     6. PARKING ANALYSIS

Parking Supply

There is currently existing on-street metered parking surrounding the La Bahia Apartments on both sides
of Westbrook Street, Main Street, and First Street and on the project frontage side of Beach Street. Along
the site frontage, there are currently 39 on-street metered parking spaces. Based on review of current site
plan, it is estimated that with the project, the on-street parking along the site frontage will reduce to 34
spaces (a loss of 5 spaces) due to the provision of project driveways to the check-in area, the parking
structure and loading areas.

The diagonal spaces on First Street will be restriped and curb extensions will be constructed on the
project frontage side of the street at Main Street and Westbrook Street. Parallel parking spaces will be
provided on Beach Street, Main Street, and Westbrook Street and will have to be restriped based on the
driveway configuration. Table 12 below summarizes the changes in existing on-street parking that will be
caused by the project.

Notes:
(1) The on-street parking supply totals include only parking along the project site frontage.
(2) The on-street parking totals do not include parking areas designated for only passenger or commercial loading.
(3) On-street parking totals with the project are estimated based on the current site plan using standard parallel parking stall
dimensions (22' x 8') and standard 45 degree diagonal parking stall dimensions (8.5' space width, 12' width at curb).


The project site plan indicates that on-site parking will be provided as follows:

           210 total on-site parking spaces
               o 87 regular striped spaces
               o 67 compact striped spaces
               o 49 valet spaces

                 o    7 Americans with Disability Act (ADA) parking spaces in the parking structure

Area for open parking spaces will be provided at the check-in area; however, these are omitted from the
on-site parking totals, as they will be used for loading only. Of the 49 valet parking spaces, 27 will be
located in the first level of the parking garage and 22 will be located on the second level. Valet service
will be provided as needed. Valet parking will occur in the drive aisles of the parking structure.

Parking Required per City Code

The City Zoning Code was used to determine the required parking for the proposed project. Reductions
per the City Zoning Ordinance were applied for shared use/cooperative parking facilities, and for non-
automobile use programs. The shared use/cooperative parking facilities reduction accounts for the
parking facilities at a single site being used for multipurpose trips being made to the site (i.e. visitors that
stay at the hotel and attend a conference, visit the spa and/or eat at the restaurant), as well as trips being
made to individual uses at different times of the day or week. The reduction for non-automotive use
programs is based on application of the trip/parking reduction strategies to be implemented through the
applicant's commitment to an Alternative Transportation Program, as described previously. The current
plan details include on-site bicycle parking and discounted/free employee transit passes, among other
strategies, and the City is anticipated to work with the applicant to pursue additional TDM strategies to
reduce private-auto and parking demand at the site. Table 13 below summarizes the parking
requirements per City Code:

Notes:
(1) Parking requirements based on City of Santa Cruz Municipal Zoning Code Section 24.12.200
(2) The concentrated occupancy per California Building Code (tables & chairs) is 15 square feet per occupant. Using
this spacing, the Conference/Meeting Room max occupancy is estimated at 290 seats (4,350 s.f. / 15 seats per s.f.).
(3) For the Conference/Meeting Room, it is anticipated that 50% of meeting occupants will guests at the hotel. For
this reason, the required parking for this use is calculated for 50% of the 290 seats (145 seats) with full occupancy.

Parking Demand per ITE

Parking generation data, as published in ITE's Parking Generation, 4th Edition, 2010, indicates that a
hotel with a restaurant and meeting facility would have an average parking demand of 0.89 vehicles per
occupied room, or approximately 95 spaces, with an average occupancy rate of 60 percent to 70 percent.
The range of parking demand rates is 0.61 to 1.94 spaces per occupied room. The 85th percentile demand
is 1.08 spaces per occupied room. It is expected that the hotel will have a higher occupancy during the
summer season (90 to 100 percent). Thus, to provide a conservative analysis, the hotel is assumed to be at
100 percent occupancy for the purposes of this assessment, resulting in an 85th percentile peak parking
demand of 178 spaces with all 165 rooms occupied. The spa component of the project is anticipated to
generate parking demand from public customers, outside of guests staying at the hotel. The ITE average
parking demand rate for a medical-dental office building, which is assumed to have similar parking
demand to the proposed spa facility, is 2.4 spaces per 1,000 square feet. The 85th percentile rate for this
use is 4.27 spaces per 1,000 square feet, or approximately 3 spaces for the proposed 750 square-foot spa
facility.

The resulting 85th percentile peak parking demand for the hotel is 181 spaces, with a conservative
assumption of 100 percent occupancy and including the spa facility. This estimate is approximately 10
percent lower than the calculated City Code required on-site parking. Parking demand calculations are
included in the Appendix.

Table 14 below compares the estimated parking demand to the proposed on-site parking supply. For the
purposes of this evaluation, the City Code required parking supply and the ITE peak parking generation
estimates are used to represent the peak parking demand at the site.

As Table 14 indicates, the City Code parking requirement is 207 spaces and the ITE peak parking
generation estimate is 181 spaces. The project will supply 161 on-site parking spaces without the valet
parking, or 210 spaces including the valet parking spaces. Thus, based on the City Code required parking,
there is a shortfall of 46 spaces excluding valet, and a surplus of 3 spaces if the valet parking is included.
Based on ITE estimates, there is a shortfall of 20 spaces excluding valet, and a surplus of 29 spaces
including valet parking.

According to the Santa Cruz General Plan 2030, there are a total of 4,145 public parking spaces available
within the Beach Area. The existing Coastal Commission public parking requirement is 3,690 spaces.
This provides a surplus of 455 public parking spaces in the Beach Area. However, according to the Beach
Area/South of Laurel Master Plan (1997), the future parking demand within the Beach and Warf Area is
expected to exceed the available supply, resulting in deficit of approximately 500 spaces. For this reason,

it is important that valet parking be utilized appropriately during all business hours at the hotel to
maximize the functional parking supply for the proposed project, as to avoid the need to rely on off-site
public parking. With valet parking spaces fully utilized, the project parking demand would be fully
accommodated on-site, thus, the project would not rely on the available public parking supply.

It should also be noted that the projected parking demand would represent a worst-case scenario, which
would likely occur less frequently at peak times during the summer weekends.

On-site Parking Layout and Dimensions

The City Zoning Code indicates that the dimensions of a standard parking space are 8.5x19 feet and that
of a compact space 7.5x16 feet. Up to 50% of the on-site parking spaces can be compact.

The site plan indicates 124 striped parking spaces on the first garage level (7 ADA compliant, 56
standard, 34 compact, and 27 valet). The second level indicates 86 striped parking spaces (31 standard,
and 33 compact, 22 valet). The site plan also indicates that some area will be provided for parking at the
check-in area. For analysis purposes, these spaces are assumed to be used for loading purposes only. The
site plan summary table indicates 49 total valet parking spaces.

The American with Disabilities Act requires the project to provide 7 ADA-compliant parking spaces (7
spaces for total parking between 201 and 300). One of these spaces must be van-accessible. The City
Zoning Code requires 5 ADA parking spaces. The project will have 7 ADA spaces in the parking
structure, including one van-accessible space. Thus both the ADA and the City requirements are met. The
ADA spaces meet all the dimensional requirements per the ADA and the City Code. The ADA spaces
are located at elevators and walkways, which is in conformance with the City and ADA requirements too.

On-street Parking Spaces

There are currently 39 on-street metered parking spaces adjacent to the project site frontage. The on-street
metered spaces will reduce to 34 spaces (a loss of 5 spaces) due to the provision of driveways to the
check-in area, parking garage and loading areas. No parking demand data has been collected for these
metered on-street spaces, but it is anticipated that they are heavily utilized during the peak season due to
their close proximity to the beach and the Boardwalk.

On-street parking spaces and loading zones on the project frontage should be striped according to City
requirements and standards.. All on-street parking spaces are metered.

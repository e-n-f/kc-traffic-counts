Draft Transportation Impact Analysis
September 27, 2011



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Juan Hernandez
Drive Road General Plan Amendment (GPA) in Morgan Hill, California. The Proposed Project is located on
two vacant parcels totaling approximately 18 acres on the south-east corner of the Juan Hernandez
Drive/Barrett Avenue intersection and is generally bounded by Tennant Avenue to the south, Juan Hernandez
Drive to the west, Barrett Avenue to the north, and US 101 to the east. The Proposed Project would change
the General Plan designations of two vacant parcels from Campus Industrial to Commercial and change the
zoning from Campus Industrial to Service Commercial. Since the proposed project is a GPA and does not
include a specific development proposal, the City of Morgan Hill provided land use assumptions for the
purpose of the transportation analysis. Based on information provided by the City staff, the GPA and rezoning
of the parcels would allow for construction of up to 45-unit congregate care facility, 94-bed nursing home,
6,050-square foot (s.f.) day care, 27,300 s.f. of general office buildings, 14,118 s.f. of medical office buildings,
a 5,250-s.f. restaurant, and 84,000 s.f. of retail uses.

The impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated following the guidelines of the City of Morgan Hill and
the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion management agency for Santa Clara
County. Roadway system operations were evaluated under Existing, Project, 2030 General Plan No Project,
2030 General Plan Plus Project, and 2030 Cumulative GPA Conditions.

Project Traffic Estimates

The development that could be constructed under the Proposed Project are forecast to generate
approximately 7,025 new daily trips, 344 net new AM peak-hour trips and 706 net new PM peak-hour trips.

Project Impacts

Based on the City of Morgan Hill's impact criteria, the Proposed Project would not have a significant impact
on roadway facilities (intersections or freeways) near the project site under Project, 2030 General Plan with
Project Conditions, or 2030 Cumulative General Plan with Project Conditions.

The Proposed Project would not significantly impact pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) for the proposed Juan Hernandez
Drive General Plan Amendment (GPA) in Morgan Hill, California. The Proposed Project site is located on two
vacant parcels totaling approximately 18 acres on the southeast corner of the Juan Hernandez Drive/Barrett
Avenue intersection and is generally bounded by Tennant Avenue to the south, Juan Hernandez Drive to the
west, Barrett Avenue to the north, and US 101 to the east. The purpose of the TIA is to identify potential
significant adverse impacts of the Proposed Project and associated GPA on the surrounding transportation
system and to recommend mitigation measures, if needed. Impacts were evaluated following the guidelines of
the City of Morgan Hill and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the congestion
management agency for Santa Clara County.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Proposed Project would change the General Plan designations of two vacant parcels from Campus
Industrial to Commercial and change the zoning from Campus Industrial to Service Commercial. Since the
proposed project is a GPA and does not include a specific development proposal, the City of Morgan Hill
provided land use assumptions for the purpose of the transportation analysis. Based on information provided
by City staff, the GPA and rezoning of the parcels ("Proposed Project") would allow for construction of up to a
45-unit congregate care facility, a 94-bed nursing home, a 6,050-square foot (s.f.) day care, 27,300 s.f. of
general office buildings, 14,118 s.f. of medical office buildings, a 5,250-s.f. restaurant, and 84,000 s.f. of retail
uses.

STUDY AREA
This analysis evaluated the operations of ten study intersections, which were selected in consultation with
City staff and based on VTA's guidelines:

    1. Tennant Avenue/US 101 Northbound Ramps                   6. Tennant Avenue/Monterey Road

    2. Tennant Avenue/US 101 Southbound Ramps                   7. Barrett Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard

    3. Tennant Avenue/Juan Hernandez Drive                      8. Barrett Avenue/Juan Hernandez Drive

    4. Tennant Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard                     9. San Pedro Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard

    5. Tennant Avenue/Vineyard Boulevard                        10. Dunne Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard

This study also included evaluation of the following US 101 freeway segments (northbound and southbound):

        US 101 between Dunne Avenue and Tennant Avenue

        US 101 between Tennant Avenue and San Martin Avenue

Figure 1 presents the project location, surrounding transportation system, and study intersections. Since the
proposed project is a GPA and does not include a specific development proposal, no site plan is currently
available for the project.

ANALYSIS SCENARIOS
Peak traffic conditions generally occur during weekday mornings between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and in the
evenings between 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during
the weekday morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak hours for the following five (5) scenarios:

        Scenario 1:     Existing Conditions ­ Existing volumes obtained from counts.

        Scenario 2:     Existing Plus Project Conditions ­ Scenario 1 volumes plus traffic generated by the
                        proposed project.

        Scenario 3:     Year 2030 General Plan No Project Conditions ­ Year 2030 traffic volumes based on
                        forecasts from the Citywide traffic model with current General Plan designations for
                        all parcels in the city and staff-approved buildout assumptions. (The project site was
                        assumed to continue to be vacant in 2030.)Transportation improvements included in
                        this scenario are those identified by the City as likely to be completed by 2030.

        Scenario 4:     Year 2030 General Plan Plus GPA Conditions ­ Year 2030 traffic volumes from
                        Scenario 3 plus traffic estimates from the proposed project from Existing Plus Project
                        Conditions.

        Scenario 5:     Year 2030 Cumulative General Plan Conditions ­ Year 2030 cumulative traffic
                        volumes based on forecasts from the City's 2030 general plan travel demand
                        forecasting model with build-out of the Proposed Project land use changes and all
                        other pending General Plan Amendments.

Intersection impacts of the proposed GPA were evaluated by comparing the intersection operations for the
following pairs of conditions:

        Project Conditions (Scenario 2) to Existing Conditions (Scenario 1)

        2030 General Plan with Project Conditions (Scenario 4) to Existing Conditions (Scenario 1)

        2030 General Plan with Project Conditions (Scenario 4) to 2030 General Plan No Project Conditions
        (Scenario 3)

        2030 Cumulative General Plan Conditions (Scenario 5) to Existing Conditions (Scenario 1).

Intersection operations under 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions are presented for informational
purposes to identify the cumulative effects of all proposed GPAs in the City of Morgan Hill. The City's travel
demand forecasting model was used to estimate traffic volumes for the 2030 scenarios under Scenarios 3
and 5. Freeway impacts of the proposed GPA were evaluated following VTA guidelines and were assessed
by adding project trips to freeway volumes established under Existing Conditions (Scenario 1). Project
impacts on bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities and services were also addressed.

ANALYSIS METHODS
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six
levels are defined from LOS A, with the least congested operating conditions, to LOS F, with the most
congested operating conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. Operations are described as LOS
F when volumes exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

Signalized Intersections

The LOS analysis method for signalized intersections approved by the City of Morgan Hill and VTA analyzes
intersection operations based on average control vehicular delay, as described in Chapter 16 of the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) published by the Transportation Research Board, with adjusted saturation
flow rates to reflect conditions in Santa Clara County. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue
move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The average control delay for signalized
intersections is calculated using the TRAFFIX analysis software and is correlated to a LOS designation as
shown in Table 1.

Unsignalized Intersections

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections are evaluated using the method contained in Chapter 17 of
the 2000 HCM and calculated using the TRAFFIX analysis software. LOS ratings for stop-sign controlled
intersections are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle. At two-way or side-
street-stop controlled intersections, control delay is calculated for each movement, not for the intersection as
a whole. For approaches composed of a single lane, delay is computed as the average of all movements in
that lane. For all-way stop-controlled locations, a weighted average delay for the entire intersection is
presented. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized intersections.

General Plan Circulation Element LOS Policy

Per its General Plan (February 2010), the City of Morgan Hill currently maintains the following tiered approach
for minimum acceptable levels of service at intersections:

           LOS F in the Downtown intersections along Monterey Road between Main and Fifth Street, and along
           Depot Street at First through Fifth Street;


                                                                                                                                3
Juan Hernandez Drive General Plan Amendment

        LOS E for the following intersections and freeway zones:

                   Main Avenue and Del Monte Avenue
                   Main Avenue and Depot Street
                   Dunne Avenue and Del Monte Avenue
                   Dunne Avenue and Monterey Avenue
                   Dunne Avenue and Church Street; also until closed: Dunne Avenue and Depot Street
                   Cochrane Road and Monterey Road
                   Tennant Avenue and Monterey Road
                   Tennant Avenue and Butterfield Boulevard
                   Cochrane Road Freeway Zone: from Madrone Parkway/Cochrane Plaza to Cochrane/DePaul
                   Drive
                   Dunne Avenue Freeway Zone: from Walnut Grove/East Dunne to Condit/East Dunne
                   Tennant Avenue Freeway Zone: from Butterfield/Tennant to Condit/Tennant
                   Freeway Ramps (such as Dunne Avenue/US 101 Southbound Ramps)

        LOS D for all remaining intersections and roadway segments in the City.

Based on the above approach, the following signalized intersections would have a minimum acceptable
threshold of LOS E:

        Tennant Avenue/Monterey Road

        Tennant Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard

        Tennant Avenue/US 101 Southbound Ramps

        Tennant Avenue/US 101 Northbound Ramps

The remaining signalized study locations would have a minimum acceptable threshold of LOS D.

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections
and peak hour signal warrant analysis to identify significant traffic impacts. Therefore, the unsignalized study
intersection at Barrett Avenue/Juan Hernandez Drive would have a minimum acceptable threshold of LOS D.

VTA Freeway Segment Level of Service Policy

Freeway segments are evaluated using VTA's analysis procedure, which is based on the density of the traffic
flow using methods described in the 2000 HCM. Density is expressed in passenger cars per mile per lane.
The Congestion Management Program range of densities for freeway segment level of service is shown in
Table 3. The LOS standard for the freeway segments is LOS E.

REPORT ORGANIZATION
The remainder of this report is divided into four chapters. The existing transportation system serving the
property and the current operating conditions of the key intersections are described in Chapter 2. Chapter 3
describes Existing Plus Project Conditions, including the method used to estimate the amount of traffic added
to the surrounding roadways by the Proposed Project and its impacts on the transportation system. This
chapter also discusses potential impacts to non-automobile modes. Chapter 4 discusses the 2030 General
Plan Conditions with and without the project. 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions are discussed in
Chapter 5. A technical appendix is also attached, which contains intersection turning movement count
summaries and detailed operations analysis outputs of information referenced in this report.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the roadway facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, transit
service, traffic volumes, and intersection operations. A discussion of the method used to calculate intersection
levels of service and the corresponding results is also presented in this chapter.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
This section describes the existing roadway network near the project site, which is illustrated on Figure 1.
Regional access to the site is provided via US 101 and local access is provided via Juan Hernandez Drive,
Tennant Avenue, Barrett Avenue, San Pedro Avenue, and Butterfield Boulevard. Each of these roadways is
described below:

United States Route 101 (US 101) is a north-south freeway that serves as the primary roadway connection
between Morgan Hill and all other areas of Santa Clara County. US 101 extends north to San Francisco and
south to Los Angeles. The freeway includes six lanes (three mixed-flow lanes in each direction) within most of
Morgan Hill. North of Cochrane Road, US 101 widens to eight lanes (three mixed-flow lanes and one high
occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction). The Tennant Avenue interchange provides access to the
project site.

Juan Hernandez Drive is a north-south, two-lane roadway to the west of the project site. Juan Hernandez
Drive extends from Tennant Avenue in the south and terminates approximately one half-mile north of San
Pedro Avenue. Juan Hernandez Drive serves as local access for the Barrett Elementary School and
residential areas along its length.

Tennant Avenue is an east-west, two- to four-lane, divided arterial roadway south of the project site. This
street extends through Morgan Hill from the Tennant Shopping Center at Monterey Road in the west to Carey
Avenue in the east. Tennant Avenue provides access for commercial uses and agricultural sites along its
length.

Barrett Avenue is a two-lane local roadway north of the project site. Barrett Avenue extends from Railroad
Avenue in the west to Juan Hernandez Drive in the east where it ends just west of US 101. Barrett Avenue
provides local access for residential uses west of Butterfield Boulevard and commercial uses to the east.

San Pedro Avenue is a two-lane collector extending from Hill Road in the east to Monterey Road in the west.
San Pedro Avenue primarily serves as local access for residential uses along its length.

Butterfield Boulevard is a north-south, two- to four-lane, divided arterial roadway west of the project site.
Butterfield Boulevard extends through Morgan Hill from Cochrane Road in the north to Tennant Avenue in the
south. Butterfield Boulevard serves as local access for commercial, residential, and industrial areas along its
length.

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES
The mild climate, relatively flat terrain, and proximity of many recreational and non-recreational destinations
provide an ideal environment for walking and bicycling in the City of Morgan Hill. This section describes the
existing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities comprising sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals are generally provided at all of
the signalized study intersections. Sidewalks are provided on the east side of Juan Hernandez Drive and on

Bicycle Facilities

Bikeway planning and design in California typically relies on the guidelines and design standards established
by Caltrans in the Highway Design Manual (Chapter 1000: Bikeway Planning and Design, 5th Edition,
California Department of Transportation, January 2001). Chapter 1000 follows standards developed by the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway
Administration ("FHWA"), and identifies specific design standards for various conditions and bikeway-to-
roadway relationships. Under California law, bicyclists are allowed to use all roadways in California unless
posted closed. Therefore, of the roadways that have no designated (or planned) bikeways identified, a
majority are open for cycling.

Caltrans standards provide for three distinct types of bikeway facilities, as generally described below and
shown on the accompanying illustrations.

        Class I Bikeways (Shared-Use Paths) provide a completely separate right-of-way and are designated
        for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized. In
        general, shared-use paths serve corridors not served by roadways or where sufficient right-of-way
        exists to allow such facilities to be constructed away from the influence of parallel streets and
        numerous vehicle conflicts.




        Class II Bikeways (Bike Lanes) are lanes for bicyclists adjacent to the outer vehicle travel lanes.
        These lanes have special lane markings, pavement legends, and signage. Bicycle lanes are generally
        five feet wide. Adjacent vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-flow are permitted.




        Class III Bikeways (Bike Routes) are designated by signs or pavement markings for shared use with
        pedestrians or motor vehicles, but have no separated bike right-of-way or lane striping. Bike routes
        serve either to: a) provide continuity to other bicycle facilities, or b) designate preferred routes through
        high demand corridors.



                                                                                                                  8

Figure 2 shows the existing bicycle facilities near the project site. No Class I bike paths exist in the project
vicinity. A Class II bike lane is located along Tennant Avenue between Monterey Road and Juan Hernandez
Drive.

A Class III bike route with shoulder striping is located on Tennant Avenue between Juan Hernandez Drive
and the US 101 northbound ramp.

EXISTING TRANSIT SERVICE
The VTA operates fixed route, commuter, and paratransit bus service and light rail service (LRT) in Santa
Clara County. VTA provides four bus routes (two local and two regional) that serve the project area. The
Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board operates Caltrain commuter rail service between San Francisco and
San Jose, with weekday commute-hour service to Morgan Hill and Gilroy. Monterey Salinas Transit (MST)
operates transit service in Monterey County, and provides express bus service to Morgan Hill and San Jose.
Existing transit service near the project site is illustrated on Figure 3 and is discussed in more detail below.
Currently no transit stops are located near the Proposed Project site.

Route 68 operates through Morgan Hill via Monterey Road. Route 68 provides connections with the Main and
Hale Transit Center in Morgan Hill. Weekend service is available.

Route 121 operates through Morgan Hill via Butterfield Boulevard and Monterey Road. Route 121 provides
connections with Route 168 and the Caltrain station in Morgan Hill. No weekend service is available.

Route 168 operates through Morgan Hill via Butterfield Boulevard and Monterey Road. Route 168 provides
connections with Route 121 and the Caltrain station in Morgan Hill. No weekend service is available.

MST 55 operates through Morgan Hill via US 101 and provides a connection with the Caltrain station in
Morgan Hill.

Caltrain provides frequent daily train service between San Jose and San Francisco. Service extends south to
Morgan Hill and Gilroy during commute hours, with three northbound trips during the AM peak period and
three southbound trips during the PM peak period stopping at both the Gilroy and Morgan Hill Caltrain
Stations.

Table 4 summarizes hours of operation and service frequencies for these bus routes.

EXISTING INTERSECTION VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
The operations of the study intersections were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.
Intersection operations were evaluated for the highest one-hour volume counted in each peak period ­ AM
between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. and PM between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. The intersection turning movement counts
were conducted in 2010 and 2011. The traffic count summaries are included in Appendix A.

Figure 4 presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes, the existing lane
configurations, and traffic control devices for the ten study intersections.

EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Existing intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning movement volumes as
illustrated on Figure 4 were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for
Existing Conditions are presented in Table 5. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.
Measured against the City of Morgan Hill LOS standard, all of the study intersections are operating at
acceptable levels of service during both peak hours under Existing Conditions.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Field observations of the study intersections were conducted in September 2011 to verify their operations. In
general, all of the study intersections are operating at or near the calculated levels of service. Most of the
vehicle queues typically cleared the signalized intersections within one signal cycle.

EXISTING FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Freeway segment densities reported in the latest (2010) VTA's Monitoring and Conformance Report were
used to calculate the existing levels of service for the key freeway segments during the AM and PM peak
hours. The results are presented in Table 6.

3. PROJECT CONDITIONS
The impacts of the proposed GPA on the surrounding roadway system are discussed in this chapter. First, the
method used to estimate the amount of traffic generated by the Proposed Project is described. Then, the
results of the LOS calculations for Project Conditions are presented. Project Conditions are defined as
Existing Conditions plus traffic generated by the Proposed Project. Since the existing site is vacant, Existing
Plus Project conditions assumes existing transportation conditions plus traffic generated by the project
components that could be constructed after the General Plan Amendment is adopted. A comparison of
intersection operations under Existing and Project Conditions is presented and the impacts of the project on
the study intersections are discussed. Non-automobile modes and a brief discussion of parking and site
access are also addressed in this chapter.

PROJECT TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
The amount of traffic associated with the project was estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip
generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. In the first step, the amount of traffic entering and
exiting the project site was estimated on a daily and peak-hour basis. In the second step, the directions
vehicles use to approach and depart the site were estimated. The trips were assigned to specific street
segments and intersection turning movements in the third step and added to the existing traffic volumes to
develop Existing Plus Project traffic volumes. The results of the process for this analysis are described in the
following sections.

Trip Generation

Trip generation forecasts for the Proposed Project for the AM and PM peak hours were calculated using the
Congregate Care Facility (ITE 253), Nursing Home (ITE 254), Day Care (ITE 565), General Office Building
(ITE 710), Medical Office Building (ITE 720), High Turn-Over Sit-Down Restaurant (ITE 932), and Shopping
Center (ITE 820) land uses identified in Trip Generation, 8th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE), 2008). The results are presented in Table 7.

The Proposed Project includes both retail and restaurant uses, and not all trips associated with these two land
use types are expected to be new trips added to the roadway network. In the case of this project it is
anticipated that a proportion of the retail and restaurant trips will already be traveling on Tennant Avenue or
Juan Hernandez Drive and will pass the site or divert from their current path of travel to access the site and
then continue on to their ultimate destination. The average pass-by trip rates presented in ITE's Trip
                           nd
Generation Handbook (2 Edition) for Shopping Centers (820) is 34 percent and for High-Turnover
Restaurants (932) is 43 percent. Guidelines presented by the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), the
congestion management agency for Santa Clara County, recommend that a maximum combined pass-
by/diverted link reduction of 30 percent should be applied per applicable land use. To present a conservative
analysis, Fehr & Peers applied a 20 percent pass-by/diverted link trip reduction to the peak-hour trip
generation estimates for the shopping center and a 25 percent pass-by/diverted link trip reduction for the
restaurant uses.

The project's potential transportation impacts under Existing Plus Project conditions were analyzed by adding
the new vehicle trips generated by the Proposed Project to Existing volumes. As shown in Table 7, the
Proposed Project would result in 7,025 new daily vehicle trips, 344 new AM peak hour vehicle trips, and 760
new PM peak hour vehicle trips.

Draft Transportation Impact Analysis
September 27, 2011



Trip Distribution

Trip distribution is defined as the directions of approach and departure that vehicles would use to arrive from
and depart to. Trip distribution percentages were developed based on existing traffic patterns at the study
intersections and the locations of complementary land uses. Distribution patterns are expected to be similar
for the AM and PM peak periods. Project-generated trips were assigned to the surrounding transportation
network based on the general directions of approach and departure illustrated on Figure 6. As shown, the
project-generated vehicle trips would be distributed as follows:

        20% from the north on US 101

        15% from the south on US 101

        35% from the west on Tennant Avenue

        5% from the east on Tennant Avenue

        25% from the north on Butterfield Boulevard

Trip Assignment

Figure 5 shows the trip assignment through the study network under Existing Plus Project Conditions. Project
trips were added to existing traffic volumes in Figure 4 to establish intersection volumes for Project
Conditions, as shown on Figure 6.

PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
The results of the intersection LOS calculations for Project Conditions are presented in Table 8. The results
for Existing Conditions are included for comparison purposes, along with the projected increases in critical
delay and critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Critical delay represents the delay associated with the
critical movements of the intersection, or the movements that require the most "green time" and have the
greatest effect on overall intersection operations. The changes in critical delay and critical V/C ratio between
Existing and Project Conditions are used to identify significant impacts.

Under Project Conditions, all study intersections are estimated to operate at acceptable levels of service
during both peak hours. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.

A few of the intersections (such as Tennant Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard) show a reduction in average delay
with the addition of project traffic, which is counter-intuitive. The average delay values in the table are
weighted averages. Weighted average delays will be reduced when traffic is added to a movement with a low
delay, such as the through movements on Tennant Avenue.1 Conversely, relatively small volume increases to
movements with high delays can substantially increase the weighted average delay.

PROJECT FREEWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
Project-generated traffic volumes were added to existing traffic volumes for each freeway mainline segment.
These volumes were then used to re-calculate density for each segment under Project Conditions. The
resulting freeway segment operations are presented in Table 9.

According to CMP guidelines, freeway segments to which a proposed development is projected to add trips
equal to or greater than one percent of the freeway segment's capacity must be evaluated. The freeway
segments immediately north and south of Tennant Avenue were reviewed to determine if a significant amount
of project traffic would be added. Capacities of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for the freeway
segments with three or more lanes.

Table 9 presents the estimated number of net new trips added to the freeway segments. The Proposed
Project would not add new trips greater than one percent of the freeway segment capacity to any of the study
freeway segments that operate at LOS F and the addition of project trips will not degrade acceptable LOS E
freeway operations to unacceptable levels (LOS F).

 For example, if there is one movement with 10 vehicles and a delay of 100 seconds and another movement with 400 vehicles and 10
seconds of delay, the weighted average delay is calculated as (100 seconds X 10 vehicles + 10 seconds X 400 vehicles) / 410 vehicles
= 12.2 seconds per vehicle. Now if 100 vehicles are added to the movement with 10 seconds of delay, the weighted average delay is
calculated as (100 seconds X 10 vehicles + 10 seconds X 500 vehicles) / 510 vehicles = 11.8 seconds per vehicle. The weighted
average delay improves, even though more vehicles are added.

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CRITERIA
The results of the level of service calculations for Existing Conditions were compared to the results for Project
Conditions to identify significant impacts. The following standards of significance apply to the transportation
impacts discussed in this study. These standards are consistent with the Guidelines for Preparation of
Transportation Impact Reports (City of Morgan Hill, February 2010).

Signalized Intersection Impact Criteria

The City's LOS standard for the following study intersections is LOS E:

         Tennant Avenue/Monterey Road

         Tennant Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard

         Tennant Avenue/US 101 Southbound Ramps

         Tennant Avenue/US 101 Northbound Ramps

The LOS standard for the remaining intersections is LOS D. The City of Morgan Hill has adopted the
signalized intersection impact criteria as defined by the VTA; therefore, traffic impacts at City of Morgan Hill
intersections would occur when the addition of traffic associated with implementation of the Project causes:

       1. Intersection operations to deteriorate from an acceptable level under Existing Conditions to an
          unacceptable level; or,
       2. Exacerbation of unacceptable operations under Existing Conditions by increasing the average
          critical delay by more than 4 seconds and increasing the critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by
          0.01 or more at an intersection operating unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F depending on study
          location) under Project Conditions.

None of the intersections analyzed for this report are designated Congestion Management Program (CMP)
intersections.

Unsignalized Intersection Impact Criteria

Level of service analysis at unsignalized intersections is generally used to determine the need for modifying
intersection control type (i.e. all-way stop or signalization). As part of this evaluation traffic volumes, delay,
and traffic signal warrants are evaluated to determine if the existing intersection control is appropriate.

The City has generally used a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for unsignalized intersections.
Significant impacts are defined to occur when the addition of project traffic degrades to LOS E or LOS F and
the intersection satisfies the peak hour signal warrants from the MUTCD.

Freeway Impact Criteria

According to VTA's Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines (VTA, 2009) a freeway segment analysis
should be included if the project meets one of the following requirements:

    1.    The proposed development project is expected to add traffic equal to at least one percent of a
          freeway segment's capacity.
    2.    The proposed development project is adjacent to one of the freeway segment's access or egress
          points
    3.    Based on engineering judgment, Lead Agency staff determines that the freeway segment should be
          included in the analysis.


                                                                                                               23
Juan Hernandez Drive General Plan Amendment
Draft Transportation Impact Analysis

For mixed-flow lanes, freeway segment capacities are defined as 2,200 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for
four-lane freeway segments and 2,300 vphpl for six-lane freeway segments. HOV lane capacities are defined
between 1,800 to 1,900 vphpl.

If a project meets the criteria outlined above, then the implementation of the Proposed Project could result in
a significant impact if the addition of project traffic on a freeway segment exceeded one of the following
thresholds:

    1. The addition of project traffic causes the operating level of a freeway segment to deteriorate from LOS
       E or better under Existing Conditions to LOS F; or
    2. The number of new trips added by a Proposed Project to a segment already operating at LOS F
       under Existing Conditions is more than one percent of the freeway segment capacity

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated by comparing intersection operations with the Project to
Existing Conditions using the 2010 General Plan Circulation Element LOS policies and the significance
criteria described above. The proposed GPA would have a less-than-significant impact on all of the study
intersections.

FREEWAY IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The freeway impacts of the proposed GPA were evaluated based on VTA's guidelines. As shown in Table 10,
the Proposed Project would not add new trips greater than one percent of the freeway segment capacity to
any of the study freeway segments that operate at LOS F and the addition of project trips will not degrade
acceptable LOS E freeway operations to unacceptable levels (LOS F). Therefore, the Proposed Project would
have a less-than-significant impact on the study freeway segments.

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The City's Guidelines for Preparation of Transportation Impact Reports do not specify impact criteria for
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit impacts. However, these impacts are generally evaluated based on whether a
Proposed Project would: 1) conflict with existing or planned pedestrian, bicycle, or transit facilities, or 2)
create walking, bicycling, or transit use demand without providing adequate and appropriate facilities for non-
motorized mobility.

The proposed GPA is not expected to increase the biking or transit demand to a level where it could not be
accommodated by existing or planned facilities. Sidewalks are currently provided along the project frontage
on Juan Hernandez Drive; thus the Proposed Project would have a less-than-significant impact on
pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities and services.

SITE ACCESS
Because the proposed project is a GPA and does not include a specific development proposal, a specific site
plan is not available for the project. Currently, details about the site layout and circulation have not been
finalized; therefore, a complete site circulation review was not undertaken. This analysis assumes vehicular
access to the project site on Juan Hernandez Drive. When a final site plan is developed, the City should
confirm that on-site circulation meets the City's requirements for driveway locations and sight distance.

PARKING DISCUSSION
Because the proposed project is a GPA and no specific development is proposed for the project site the
projects' parking supply requirements would be reviewed at the time that building permits are requested.

4. 2030 GENERAL PLAN CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the expected traffic operations under 2030 General Plan Conditions with and without
the proposed GPA. The City of Morgan Hill travel demand forecasting model was used to estimate 2030
traffic volumes. 2030 land use and network assumptions are briefly discussed below, followed by a more
detailed discussion of intersection operations.

LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK ASSUMPTIONS
The 2030 land use estimates were developed as part of the City's 2010 General Plan Circulation Element
Update and are based on input from City staff and regionally approved data from the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG). Also included in the model is the planned roadway network based on the 2010
General Plan Circulation Element. Two of the study intersections are assumed to have lane geometry
improvements under 2030 General Plan Conditions as outlined below and illustrated on Figure 7:

         Tennant Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard: added second northbound through lane, converted
         southbound right-turn lane to shared through/right-turn lane, and added second westbound left-turn
         lane.

         Tennant Avenue/Juan Hernandez Drive: provide access for future development on south leg of
         intersection and added northbound left-turn, through, and right-turn lane; added southbound through
         lane, converted eastbound through lane to a shared through/right-turn lane, added second westbound
         through lane.

The forecasted volumes were estimated for 2030 No Project Conditions. Since the site is currently vacant, the
vehicle trips generated by the Proposed Project would typically be evaluated under the Existing Plus Project
analysis, while the net new trips between the current campus industrial and the proposed service commercial
designations would be evaluated under Year 2030 General Plan Plus Project Conditions. However, under
2030 General Plan No Project Conditions the City's travel demand model does not include any land use
assumptions for this site (i.e., at the time the General Plan was completed, the City did not anticipate that the
project site would be developed by the buildout year (2030) of the General Plan). Therefore, project trips
associated with the GPA were added to the 2030 General Plan No Project volumes and no trip credits were
taken for the campus industrial uses allowed on the site under the current General Plan.

2030 GENERAL PLAN NO PROJECT INTERSECTION TRAFFIC VOLUME ESTIMATES
Using the base year and future year model forecasts, weekday peak-hour intersection turning movements
were developed for the ten study intersections for 2030 General Plan No Project Conditions. The techniques
presented in National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 2552 were used to refine the
raw model forecasts. This method is based on existing counts and the difference between the base year
(existing) and 2030 model volumes. Further manual adjustments may be made to the resulting volumes to
provide more reasonable forecasts.

Figure 8 illustrates the AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement forecast volumes for the study
intersections. These volumes were used to calculate the levels of service for the ten study intersections under
this scenario. The 2030 General Plan intersection improvements for the Tennant Avenue intersections with
Butterfield Boulevard and Juan Hernandez Drive were used as inputs for the LOS calculations. Since no
roadway improvements are included in the General Plan for the remaining eight study intersections, their

The net new project trips from the Proposed Project as shown in Figure 5 were added to the traffic volumes
from the 2030 General Plan No Project Conditions (Figure 7) to estimate volumes for 2030 General Plan With

2030 GENERAL PLAN WITH PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
The 2030 General Plan No Project Conditions intersection lane configurations and signal timings were
combined with the peak-hour turning movement volumes for 2030 General Plan With Project Conditions and
used as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for 2030 General Plan with Project
Conditions are presented in Table 11. Existing LOSs are presented for comparison purposes. Appendix B
contains the corresponding calculation sheets. All of the study intersections are projected to operate at
acceptable levels of service.

As noted under Project Conditions, the intersection of Barrett Avenue/Butterfield Boulevard in the PM peak
hour shows a reduction in average delay with the addition of project traffic, which is counter-intuitive. The
average delay values in the table are weighted averages. Weighted average delays will be reduced when

                                                                                                                                          29

traffic is added to a movement with a low delay, such as the through movements on Butterfield Boulevard.
Conversely, relatively small volume increases to movements with high delays can substantially increase the
weighted average delay.

2030 GENERAL PLAN INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
The impacts of the Proposed Project were evaluated by comparing intersection operations with the 2030
General Plan with Project to the Existing Conditions using the same significance criteria described under
Project Conditions. All of the study intersections would operate at acceptable levels of service under 2030
General Plan with Project Conditions; therefore, the Proposed Project would have a less-than-significant
impact on traffic operations under 2030 General Plan with Project conditions.

As shown in Table 11, the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS under General Plan
with Project conditions; therefore, the Proposed GPA would have a less-than-significant impact on traffic
operations when comparing the 2030 General Plan No Project and 2030 General Plan with Project scenarios.

5. 2030 GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE CONDITIONS
This chapter describes the expected traffic operations under 2030 Conditions with all of the proposed General
Plan Amendments (GPAs) in place. This scenario includes roadway traffic volumes plus vehicle trips
generated by the pending GPA land uses (including the proposed GPA), as well as changes in travel patterns
caused by City-proposed GPA roadway network changes. The City's travel demand forecasting model was
used to estimate 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions traffic volumes. The proposed GPA land use and
network assumptions are briefly discussed, followed by a more detailed discussion of the resulting
intersection operations.

LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS
The 2030 General Plan Cumulative model includes information from 2030 General Plan No Project
Conditions, plus changes in the land uses and roadway network based on information from the 12 pending
GPAs, in addition to the Proposed Project GPA analyzed for this report (ten land use GPAs and two
transportation network GPAs):

     1. West Hills Community Church USA: Add two parcels totaling approximately four acres into the
        Urban Service Area and redevelop the site with a new church assembly (sanctuary) building and
        two-story classroom building.

     2. Peet ­ Trumpp USA: Add 6 acres of single-family residences on the west side of Peet Road and
        north of Half Road into the Urban Service Area.

     3. Monterey ­ Morgan Hill Bible Church GPA and USA: Add parcels totaling 9.48 acres into the Urban
        Service Area and change the land use designation from single family low to public facility. The
        project proposes to expand approximately 11,600 s.f. of church and school space to approximately
        20,000 s.f. of the same land use.

     4. Watsonville ­ Royal Oaks GPA and USA: Change four parcels from Single Family Medium (3-5
        du/ac) to Non-Retail Commercial at the southwest corner of Watsonville Road and Monterey Road,
        and change a second parcel from Single Family Medium to Multi-Family Medium (14-21 du/ac) on
        Watsonville Road, west of Monterey Road. This application includes six parcels totaling 17.34 acres
        all of which are outside the city limits, but only five parcels involve a General Plan change.

     5. Monterey ­ City of Morgan Hill GPA: This GPA includes nine parcels on 15.98 acres located
        adjacent to the Royal Oaks project site. The proposed general plan changes include six parcels
        modified from Single Family Medium to Non-Retail Commercial and two parcels modified from
        Single Family Low to Non-Retail Commercial. The remaining parcel will not change designation but
        will be rezoned.

     6. Walnut Grove/Simonsen ­ DeRose Applications GPA: Amend General Plan Land Use Designation
        from Multi-Family Low and Commercial to 100 percent Commercial. The anticipated square footage
        for the development will be approximately 113,500 s.f.

     7. Southeast Quadrant GPA: The proposed GPA includes amending approximately 750 acres of land
        within a 1,300-acre area from Rural County land use designation to Sports-Recreation-Leisure,
        Residential Estate, Open Space, and Public Facilities. The subject area is generally bound by San
        Pedro Avenue to the north, Condit Road to the west, Maple Avenue to the south, and Carey Lane to
        the east.

     8. Condit ­ UPC: The proposed General Plan amendment would change the land use designation of
        the 18.18-acre project site from Commercial to Single Family High (5-10 dwelling units per acre) and



                                                                                                          31
Juan Hernandez Drive General Plan Amendment

         rezone the site R-1 4,500 Planned Development, which would allow for construction of
         approximately 102 new single-family dwelling units.

     9. Butterfield-Butterfield Investors: Amend General Plan Land Use Designation from Industrial to
        Single-Family High for an approximately 14 acre site at the northwest corner of Butterfield
        Boulevard/Central Avenue

     10. Edmundson-Oak Meadow: The proposed GPA includes amending approximately 18 acres from
         Rural County to Open Space. The site is located north of West Edmundson Avenue, just west of the
         City limits along Sunset Avenue.

In addition to the land use changes based on the pending GPAs, the 2030 General Plan Cumulative roadway
network includes the following roadway network amendments:

     11. Monterey Road narrowed to a 2-lane arterial between Main Avenue and Dunne Avenue - The
         Monterey Road narrowing removes a northbound and southbound through lane from the
         intersections on Monterey Road between Main Avenue and Dunne Avenue. The purpose of this
         modification is to allow for wider sidewalks, increased on-street parking supply, and enhancement of
         the downtown area as a more walkable, bikeable, and transit-friendly environment. The actual
         configuration of Monterey Road is currently under evaluation and no plans have been finalized.

     12. Walnut Grove Extension Realignment ­ The current alignment would extend from Walnut Grove
         Drive south to Laurel Road. The realignment is proposed to connect to Diana Avenue west of the
         currently planned extension by approximately 1,500 feet.

All other network assumptions from the 2030 General Plan No Project Conditions that are directly applicable
to the study intersections remain in effect.

GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Similar to the 2030 General Plan Conditions, the vehicle trips generated by the Proposed Project were
evaluated under 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions and no trip credits were taken for the campus
industrial uses allowed on the site under the current General Plan. Figure 10 shows the AM and PM peak
hour intersection turning movement forecast volumes, intersection lane configurations, and traffic control
devices for the ten study intersections under 2030 General Plan Cumulative Conditions. The results of the
LOS analysis are presented in Table 12.

GENERAL PLAN CUMULATIVE INTERSECTION OPERATIONS SUMMARY
Based on the City of Morgan Hill's LOS standards, all of the study intersections are projected to operate at
acceptable levels of service under General Plan Cumulative Conditions. Thus, there are no impacts and no
intersection mitigation measures are required under General Plan Cumulative conditions.

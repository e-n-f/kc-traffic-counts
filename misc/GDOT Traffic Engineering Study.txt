LOCATION:
This study was performed at the intersection of State Route 10/ N Avondale Rd and N Clarendon
Ave.

REASON FOR INVESTIGATION:
The purpose of this investigation is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of constructing
a roundabout at the intersection of State Route 10/N Avondale and N Clarendon Ave. Currently,
the intersection experiences heavy delays on both the eastbound and westbound approaches as
well as the southbound left turn movement.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERSECTION:

State Route 10/North Avondale Rd is a two lane urban minor arterial that runs east/west in
DeKalb County from State Route 155/South Candler St to State Route 236/Hugh Howell Rd.
State Route 10 intersects N Clarendon Ave at a four-legged signalized intersection. The nearest
intersection (S Avondale Rd at N Clarendon) is 117 feet south of this intersection. Because of the
close proximity, these two intersections' signals are timed to coordinate with each other to
optimize traffic flow and minimize delay. The eastbound approach consists of one dedicated
through lane, one dedicated left turn lane and one dedicated right turn lane. The westbound
approach consists of one through-right lane and one through-left lane. The current AADT is
17,880. State Route 10 serves significant amounts of commuter traffic during the weekday AM
and PM peak periods.

State Route 10 at this intersection runs directly through downtown Avondale Estates. The area is
a historic district and there are several retail locations and memorial sites. There is also on street
parking on the east bound approach of the intersection.

North Clarendon Ave is a two lane local road that runs north/south in DeKalb County between E
Ponce de Leon Ave and S Columbia Dr. South of the intersection, N Clarendon is heavily
residential with pedestrians and several neighborhoods. At the north end of N Clarendon, there is
a MARTA station and as a result this intersection has a fair amount of bus traffic. Also there are
several receiving plants which increase truck traffic in the area. The current AADT is 1,930.

**It should also be noted that these peak hour volumes were determined by combining volumes
from both intersections (SR 10 at N Clarendon and S Avondale Rd at N Clarendon).
The southbound through movement of N Clarendon at S Avondale was distributed as follows:
60% was added to the eastbound movement, 30% was added to the southbound movement and
10% was added to the westbound movement.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONTROL:
        Adjacent signals are located at Oak Street, 0.19 miles (985 ft) west of the intersection and
        at Lakeshore Dr, 0.32 miles (1,706 ft) east of the intersection.

VEHICLE SPEEDS:
     The posted speed limit on SR 10 is 25 MPH.

PARKING:
There is on street parking in this location on the eastbound approach. There are several retail
store fronts in the area.

ACCIDENT HISTORY:
For the years 2008-2012, there were 5 crashes at this intersection (see attached accident
diagram). Of the 5 reported crashes, it is estimated that 1 may have been correctable.

SIGHT DISTANCE:
The results are summarized in the table below:

Sight distance at the existing intersection would be greatly improved if the shrubbery and
landscaping in the area is trimmed back or relocated.


ROUNDABOUT ANALYSIS:

A multilane roundabout analysis was performed using SIDRA 5 software. The proposed
roundabout has two lanes at each approach and a right slip lane on the westbound approach (see
attached diagram). The analysis consisted of a proposed design for the current design year with a
design life of 20 years. After analysis, it was discovered that the roundabout operated at a level
of service (LOS) A and after 2 years the intersection will operate at LOS B.

CAPACITY ANALYSIS:

The existing intersection was evaluated using Synchro 7 software. Synchro provided figures for
intersection delay, queue length, level of service and the v/c ratio for each approach. The
capacity analysis was performed using the afternoon peak hour (5pm to 6pm). It indicates that
the existing intersection operates at a LOS C.

RIGHT OF WAY:
CONCLUSIONS:

Upon review of the data received from running capacity analysis software Synchro and SIDRA,
the following conclusions can be drawn. The existing intersection is currently operating at a
Level of Service C with a total intersection delay of 29.7 secs. The 20 year model for the
proposed roundabout indicates that a roundabout would operate at a Level of Service B with a
total delay of 10.9 secs. This is a 60% reduction in total intersection delay for at least 20 years.
Accidents at this intersection are currently minimal (5 crashes in 5 years) and a roundabout will
likely continue this trend.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Based on an analysis of traffic data, accident data, and field observations, the operational
improvements listed below are recommended:

       A two lane roundabout should be installed at the intersection of SR 10 and N Clarendon
       Ave.
       At the intersection of N Clarendon Ave and S Avondale Rd, the east and west bound
       approaches should be closed off to prevent access to the roundabout. Alternate routes are
       present.
       Remove on street parking.

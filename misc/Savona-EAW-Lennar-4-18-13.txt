at: http://www.eqb.state.mn.us/EnvRevGuidanceDocuments.htm. The Environmental Assessment Worksheet
provides information about a project that may have the potential for significant environmental effects. The EAW is
prepared by the Responsible Governmental Unit or its agents to determine whether an Environmental Impact Statement
should be prepared. The project proposer must supply any reasonably accessible data for -- but should not complete --
the final worksheet. The complete question as well as the answer must be included if the EAW is prepared
electronically.

Note to reviewers: Comments must be submitted to the RGU during the 30-day comment period following notice of
the EAW in the EQB Monitor. Comments should address the accuracy and completeness of information, potential
impacts that warrant further investigation and the need for an EIS.

   6. Description

   a) Provide a project summary of 50 words or less to be published in the EQB Monitor.

       The Savona residential development is proposed on approximately 112.5 acres of primarily
       agricultural land in the southern portion of Lake Elmo. The project is proposing 190 single-family
       lots, and 122 multi-family lots. Twenty-seven acres of open space is also planned, which will
       include buffers, parks, woods and ponds.

   b) Give a complete description of the proposed project and related new construction. Attach additional
       sheets as necessary. Emphasize construction, operation methods, and features that will cause
       physical manipulation of the environment or will produce wastes. Include modifications to existing
       equipment or industrial processes and significant demolition, removal, or remodeling of existing
       structures. Indicate the timing and duration of construction activities.

       Lennar is proposing construction of a single and multi-family residential development on
       approximately 112.5 acres of land. The two parcels that constitute the project are referred to as the
       Dale (west) and Frandsen (east) Properties, and are approximately 72.5 and 40 acres in size,
       respectively. The proposed project is located in the S ½ of Section 34, T29N, R21W, City of Lake
       Elmo, Washington County, Minnesota (Exhibits 1 & 2), and is generally located south of 10th Street
       North (CSAH 10) and west of Keats Avenue North (CSAH 19).

       Project development will convert approximately 112.5 acres of agricultural fields, woodlands, and
       constructed ponds to streets, homes, lawns, landscaping, parkland, trails, and stormwater ponding.
       Land use within the site will include construction of up to 190 single-family lots, and 122 multi-
       family townhome units. Development plans feature 65 to 75-foot wide single-family lots and 28
       foot-wide residential streets. The proposed project will have an overall net density of 4.0 units per
       acre. Potential adverse effects on the environment will be mitigated by preserving and creating
       approximately 27 acres of open space in the form of buffers, parks, woodlands, and ponds. The
       project proposes extensive landscaping, buffering, and berming along adjacent roadways to offset
       possible visual impacts. Each residential lot will be served by City of Lake Elmo sanitary sewer and
       water systems. No onsite sewage systems and no private wells are proposed. Public streets will
       service the development including the construction of a minor collector roadway to serve the
       development, directing traffic east to Keats Avenue for convenient access to the I-94 corridor.

       The Metropolitan Council recently approved an amendment to the Lake Elmo Comprehensive Land
       Use Plan. Under the amended plan, the city agreed to provide an additional 6,600 Residential
       Equivalent Connections (RECs) of regional sewer service by 2030. In a 2005 Memorandum of
       Understanding (MOU) with the Metropolitan Council, the city agreed to meet or exceed an average
       residential density of three units per acre in sewered areas south of 10th Street. Sewered development
       will be limited to the city's Village area (area surrounding the historic Lake Elmo Village) and the
       area south of 10th Street along Interstate 94. The proposed development of the study area is
       consistent with the total level of density guided by the MOU and Land Use Plan. The City of Lake
       Elmo I-94 Corridor Development Staging Plan map (July 2012) indicates that the project area falls
       within the Stage I area. While a specific time period has not been attached to these stages, the stages
       are intended to develop in numeric order from Stage I to Stage III. Stage I represents new sewered
       development located west of Keats Avenue that will connect to the Metropolitan Council
       Environmental Services (MCES) Woodbury, Oakdale, Northdale and East Oakdale (WONE)
       interceptor.

        Construction
        It is anticipated that the project will be constructed in six phases, with the first phase expected to
        begin in 2013. Full build-out is anticipated in 2018; however, construction timing will ultimately
        depend upon market conditions. It is anticipated that construction will entail moving approximately
        750,000 cubic yards of soil. Construction dewatering may be conducted on an as-needed and
        permitted basis to install sanitary sewer, municipal water, and storm sewer. Best Management
        Practices will be implemented during and after construction to protect water quality and reduce the
        potential for soil erosion and sedimentation.

   c)   Explain the project purpose; if the project will be carried out by a governmental unit, explain the need for the
        project and identify its beneficiaries.

        The purpose of the Savona residential development project is to meet the demand for additional
        residential housing units within the City of Lake Elmo in accordance with the signed 2005 MOU
        between the City and the Metropolitan Council. Under this MOU, the City of Lake Elmo committed
        to adding 6,600 new RECs of regional sewer service by the year 2030. The city also committed to a
        city-wide population of 24,000 by the year 2030. This project will help meet the city's obligations as
        outlined within the MOU by providing an additional 312 living units along the I-94 corridor. The
        project will be constructed and implemented by Lennar, a private developer.

   d) Are future stages of this development planned or likely to happen?  Yes  No.
      If yes, briefly describe future stages, relationship to the present project, timeline, and plans for environmental
      review.

        There are currently no planned future stages of the Lake Elmo Property residential development
        project.

   e)   Is the project a subsequent stage of an earlier project?  Yes  No.
        If yes, briefly describe the past development, timeline, and any past environmental review.

        The Savona residential development project is not a subsequent stage of an earlier development
        project.

   9. Land Use

      Describe current and recent past land use and development on the site and on adjacent lands. Discuss the
      compatibility of the project with adjacent and nearby land uses. Indicate whether any potential conflicts
      involve environmental matters. Identify any potential environmental hazard due to past site uses, such as soil
      contamination or abandoned storage tanks, or proximity to nearby hazardous liquid or gas pipelines.

      Existing Land Use within the Project Site
      Existing land use within, and adjacent to, the project site is depicted in Exhibit 4 and summarized in
      Section 10 below.

      A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was conducted on the project area in October 2012
      by Liesch Associates, Inc. (Liesch). The report indicates that according to historic aerial
      photography dating from 1936 to 2008, the Dale Property has been under agricultural production
      since at least 1936. Recent aerial photography (2008) indicates the Dale Property remains under
      agricultural use; the Frandsen parcel was converted to a golf practice facility, Mulligan Masters, on
      or around 2002. The golf business is no longer in operation. No farmsteads or buildings are
      currently located on the property aside for a small plastic storage shed on the Frandsen parcel. A
      transmission line extends along the northern project boundary, and Liesch observed a gas pipeline on
      the Frandsen Parcel. The site currently contains 61.2 acres of cropped field, 1.4 acres of developed
      area/roads, 33.5 acres of golf course driving range, 9.4 acres of upland meadow, 1.8 acres of
      excavated pond, and 5.2 acres of upland woodland (Exhibit 5).

      Compatibility with Adjacent and Nearby Land Uses
      The Lake Elmo Zoning Map is provided on Exhibit 6. The Dale property is currently zoned HD-
      RR-SRD, which is Rural Residential Sewered Residential Holding District. The Frandsen property
      is currently zoned HD-A-SRD, which is Agricultural Sewered Residential Holding District. Both
      parcels are planned and staged for sewered residential development, but will require rezoning to
      Urban Low Density Residential (LDR) and Urban Medium Density Residential (MDR) prior to
      project approvals. The properties are located within the I-94 development corridor, which is one of
      two focused locations within the city for future housing expansion and increased housing density.
      This will allow existing open space within the rural planning districts of Lake Elmo to be
      maintained, along with the overall rural flavor of the city.

      The project is compatible with adjacent and nearby land uses. Surrounding land use (Exhibit 4) is
      primarily residential development to the north/northwest, gravel mining to the north/northeast,
      agricultural land and Keats Avenue to the east, the I-94 corridor to the south, small businesses to the
      southwest, and agricultural land and a business park to the west. The proposed project will fit into
      the I-94 construction corridor as a separate but similar land use to existing land uses in the area. As
      described in the amended Comprehensive Land Use Plan, this portion of the city is guided as an
      "urbanized zone" that will feature higher density residential development and commercial uses. The
      proposed project is consistent with the land use guidance. Natural buffer strips, located adjacent to




                                                        5
Savona EAW                                                                                      April 3, 2013


      existing rural development, are proposed along the periphery of the Savona residential development
      to provide a transition zone between the new project and existing land uses in the area.

      Environmental Hazards Associated with Past Land Use
      Prior to 2002, the project site was undeveloped and used for agricultural crop production. In 2002,
      the Frandsen portion of the property (eastern 40 acres) was converted to a golf practice facility,
      Mulligan Masters. A search on the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Web site ("What's In My
      Neighborhood?") revealed no known potential sources of soil or groundwater contamination. This
      database contains properties that have already been investigated and cleaned up through federal and
      state cleanup programs, as well as those currently enrolled in MPCA cleanup programs. The
      database also includes properties that were thought to be contaminated, but after further
      investigations were determined to be clean.

      Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
      A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment completed by Liesch revealed no recognized
      environmental conditions (RECs) on the properties except for seven observed areas containing
      evidence of dumping, and surficial debris including: appliances, quart-sized oil containers (empty),
      metal debris/pieces, rusted drums, plastic containers, crushed PVC pipe, a couch, mattresses,
      televisions, tires, wood scrap/debris, a chiller unit, glass containers, asphalt piles, soil piles, concrete
      piles, drain tile, plastic posts, and trash.

      Liesch's report indicated that "although the drums and containers were empty, and no obvious
      staining was observed in the vicinity of the containers, there is potential that the original contents of
      the containers may have impacted the Property subsurface. The potential for subsurface impacts
      from the appliances, televisions, and drums and containers observed...is considered a REC." As a
      result, Liesch recommended a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to assess the dump areas
      identified during the Phase I ESA, and indicated that "debris should be managed and disposed of
      properly according to City, County, and State regulations."

      In addition to the dump areas, Liesch observed the following items of environmental note:

          · An irrigation well located on the Frandsen Parcel. Liesch recommended that the
          well be sealed according to the Minnesota Department of Health well code if it is no
          longer in use. The well is located in a Special Well Construction Area as identified
          by the MPCA.

          · A septic system with a drain field is present on the Frandsen Parcel, but is no longer
          in use. Liesch recommended that the septic system be removed / abandoned
          according to local code requirements.

          · Suspect asbestos-containing material (ACM) was not observed on the Property
          during the site walk-over. However, suspect ACM may be present among debris
          observed on the Property.


      Phase II Environmental Site Assessment
      A Phase II ESA was completed for the site as recommended during the Phase I process. Based upon
      the environmental conditions noted, Liesch completed the following scope of services as part of the
      subsurface Phase II ESA: (1) prepared a health and safety plan and cleared public and private
      utilities, (2) excavated 17 test pits throughout areas A, C, and D on the Property to assess for buried


                                                       6
Savona EAW                                                                                 April 3, 2013


      debris and potential environmental impacts due to the presence of appliances, televisions, drums, and
      containers in these areas, (3) screened soil samples for the presence of organic vapors using a
      photoionization detector (PID) equipped with a 10.6 electron volt (eV) lamp, (4) collected five soil
      samples for laboratory analysis of diesel range organics (DRO) (analyzed by silica gel method),
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the eight Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
      metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides,
      (5) observed debris for suspect asbestos containing material (ACM), and (6) prepared a Phase II
      ESA report with conclusions and recommendations.

      Work performed for the Phase II ESA included observing and field screening recovered soil samples,
      and collection of soil samples for laboratory analysis from soil test pits. Based upon the findings of
      the Phase II ESA, Liesch confirmed that the debris observed on the Property is mainly surficial. The
      only areas of deeper debris included concrete in test pit TP-11 and asphalt pieces in test pit TP-12 to
      approximately 4 feet below grade. General municipal waste was observed to 1.5 feet below grade in
      test pits TP-15 and TP-16 and to 1 foot below grade in test pits TP-4 and TP-7. Liesch test pit
      locations are shown in Appendix A.

      In the RCRA metal analysis, arsenic concentrations were detected above the Residential SRV of 9
      mg/kg ranging from 9.2 to 19.9 mg/kg. The Liesch Phase II report indicates that they suspect these
      concentrations to be within the range of naturally-occurring concentrations for this area. From a
      regulatory perspective, the MPCA Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup (VIC) Program has not
      required remedial efforts for arsenic concentrations just above the Residential SRV if the data
      supports background concentrations. This contention is supported by MPCA Fact Sheet: Best
      Management Practices for the Off-Site Reuse of Excess Fill from Development Sites dated February
      2012, in which the MPCA states that "Naturally occurring concentrations of some metals, such as
      arsenic, selenium, or copper sometimes exceed the SRV or SLV. Such soils are not considered
      impacted in the absence of a contaminant source or other field or laboratory indications of
      contamination." As noted above, the same assertion would be applicable to the selenium
      concentrations detected on the Property.

      The detection of DRO at 153 mg/kg in TP-15 (1') indicates the presence of low level petroleum
      impacts in the vicinity of TP-15. The extent and magnitude of the DRO impacted soil is unknown.
      Based upon the findings, Liesch recommended the following: Inform the Property owner of the
      release of DRO as detected on the Property, and prepare a Construction Contingency Plan to detail
      management of debris and impacted soils during development.

      Lennar will prepare a Construction Contingency Plan for the site prior to site development to manage
      known debris and impacted soils within the project area. However, the primary areas where test
      borings were completed will be largely undisturbed in the final development plan (Appendix A).
      The northernmost area (Area A) is located within an existing transmission line easement, and will
      therefore be largely avoided. Areas C is predominantly located within a tree and open space
      preservation area, and about 50 percent of Area D will be preserved and avoided by the project
      design.

      Local Soil and Groundwater Contamination
      Perfluorochemical (PFC)-containing wastes were disposed of at two land disposal sites, the 3M-
      Oakdale Disposal Site in Oakdale and the former Washington County Landfill in Lake Elmo,
      Minnesota between 1956 and 1974. The Oakdale disposal site is located approximately 3.8 miles
      northwest of the project area, and the Washington County Landfill is located approximately 3.4
      miles to the north.


                                                    7
Savona EAW                                                                                         April 3, 2013


       PFCs were released from the two facilities resulting in contamination of groundwater and nearby
       drinking water wells as outlined in a Public Health Assessment prepared by the U.S. Department of
       Health and Human Services (August 29, 2008), and the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease
       Registry (ATSDR). The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has detected PFCs in several
       surface waterbodies in the Lake Elmo, Oakdale, and Woodbury area through various sampling
       studies. Surface water bodies north of the project area that have been found to contain PFCs include:
       Raleigh Creek, Eagle Point Lake, and Lake Elmo. PFCs are suspected to infiltrate into the
       groundwater from these water body sources. Sunfish Lake was found to contain perfluorobutanoate
       (PFBA). Goose Lake, located 0.25-miles north of the project area, was sampled by the MDH in
       2010 and was found to contain no PFCs.

       According to this Public Health Assessment, PFCs have been detected in public and private wells
       across a wide area of Oakdale and Lake Elmo. In Lake Elmo, approximately 200 homes were
       connected to municipal water to mitigate exposure to PFCs in the groundwater. Additional homes,
       approximately 55, have had in home granular activated carbon filter systems installed to mitigate
       exposure to PFCs in the groundwater. These homes have also been offered bottled drinking water.
       Groundwater monitoring of PFCs is an ongoing program. The proposed project will mitigate risks to
       new residents by providing access to municipal drinking water.

   10. Cover Types

       Estimate the acreage of the site with each of the following cover types before and after development.

       If Before and After totals are not equal, explain why: Before and after totals are equal.

   11. Fish, Wildlife, and Ecologically Sensitive Resources

   a) Identify fish and wildlife resources and habitats on or near the site and describe how they would be affected by
      the project. Describe any measures to be taken to minimize or avoid impacts.

       Fish and wildlife resources on and near the site are directly related to the composition, quality, size,
       and connectivity of natural communities including woodlands, wetlands, and grasslands. Westwood
       Professional Services, Inc. used aerial photography to map the existing cover types (Exhibit 5).
       Based on this analysis, the site contains four major habitat components: 61.2 acres of cropped field,
       9.4 acres of upland meadow, 1.8 acres of excavated pond, and 5.2 acres of upland woodland. These



                                                         8
Savona EAW                                                                                        April 3, 2013


       habitats are used by a variety of animals common to central Minnesota. Wildlife resources that exist
       throughout the site likely include those species that have adapted to open lands and cropland habitats
       such as pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow, cottontail, red fox, and white-tailed deer. The open
       fields provide seasonal food and cover for these species.

       Project development is expected to convert approximately100 acres of cropped field, upland
       meadow, golf course/driving range, upland meadow, excavated pond, and upland woodland.
       Preservation of approximately 27 acres of upland woodland, upland meadow, and stormwater
       ponding is expected to mitigate some of the adverse effects on wildlife. Connections between
       existing meadow/old field and woodlands will be maintained in the development by retaining buffer
       strips along the property edges, which will allow travel corridors to remain for use by wildlife on the
       property and from off-site resource areas.

       Conversion of agricultural fields, woodlands, and meadow/old field to residential development is
       expected to result in some local decline in wildlife abundance. Populations of species that depend
       upon cropland, woodland and fields, such as ring-necked pheasants, wild turkey, and meadowlarks,
       will likely be displaced. Migratory birds are expected to respond to the development by looking for
       alternative nesting sites upon their return from wintering habitats. Some songbirds that readily adapt
       to suburban habitats may become more numerous. Non-migratory species with small home ranges
       such as small mammals will experience more adverse effects. These species will compete with other
       individuals of the same or other species to claim territories in neighboring habitats or succumb to
       mortality during project construction.

       Approximately 24 percent of the 112.5-acre project area will be open space, which is expected to
       help mitigate adverse effects on wildlife. The project is not expected to result in a regionally
       significant decline in wildlife abundance or species diversity. Measures to reduce the effects on
       wildlife include preservation of buffers and adjacent woodland integrated with open space and
       parkland, and construction of stormwater ponding. These measures are expected to provide
       additional habitat for wildlife and help mitigate adverse effects on some wildlife.

   b) Are any state-listed (endangered, threatened, or special concern) species, rare plant communities or other
      sensitive ecological resources on or near the site?  Yes  No

       If yes, describe the resource and how it would be affected by the project. Describe any measures that will be
       taken to minimize or avoid adverse impacts. Provide the license agreement number and/or Division of
       Ecological Resources contact number (#ERDB 20130158) from which the data were obtained and attach the
       response letter from the DNR Division of Ecological Resources. Indicate if any additional survey work has
       been conducted within the site and describe the results.

       The Minnesota DNR Natural Heritage Program conducted a database search of the Minnesota
       Natural Heritage Information System (NHIS) to determine if there are listed plants and animals;
       native plant communities; wildlife aggregations; geological features; or state rare features that are
       known to occur within or near the project site. The database search did not identify rare features
       within an approximate one-mile radius of the proposed project. The DNR Natural Heritage Review
       response letter is provided in Appendix B.

       Based on the nature and location of the proposed project, the DNR concluded that it does not believe
       the project will negatively affect any known occurrences of rare features. Therefore, no additional
       survey work has been or is scheduled to be conducted on the project area, and no measures to avoid
       or minimize potential impacts appear warranted.

      According to the Natural Communities and Rare Species of Washington County Map (Minnesota
      County Biological Survey, 1990), the project site does not contain rare plant or animal species or
      other significant natural features.

   12. Physical Impacts on Water Resources

      Will the project involve the physical or hydrologic alteration -- dredging, filling, stream diversion, outfall
      structure, diking, and impoundment -- of any surface water such as a lake, pond, wetland, stream or drainage
      ditch?  Yes  No If yes, identify water resource affected and give the DNR Public Waters Inventory
      number(s) if the water resources affected are on the PWI: N/A. Describe alternatives considered and
      proposed mitigation measures to minimize impacts.

      The project will not involve the physical or hydrologic alteration of natural surface waters such
      as lakes, ponds, wetlands, or streams. On September 27, 2012, Arrowhead Environmental
      Consulting, Inc., (AEC) evaluated the project area for wetlands and other jurisdictional waters.
      No jurisdictional wetlands or waters were identified within the project boundary.

      Prior to delineating the site, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Map (Lake Elmo
      Quad), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) Public Water Inventory
      Map (PWI), the Washington County Soil Survey Map, and the National Wetland Inventory
      (NWI) Map were reviewed. Historical images from 1936, 1953, 1957, 1964, 1991, 2000, 2003,
      and 2010 were also reviewed. The PWI map indicated no Public Water Wetlands are mapped
      on the property. The NWI map indicated several wetland basins within the property (PEMCd,
      PEM1C, PSS1C, PFO1C, PUBFx) (Exhibit 7); a PEMC wetland was also mapped along the
      western property line; however, field review indicated it is located off of the property.
      According to the Washington County Soil Survey map, non-hydric soil is mapped throughout
      the property.

      AEC reviewed the entire site and focused on four specific areas. Soil samples were collected in
      each of these areas and reviewed, but in each case the soils observed at the sample point
      locations were determined to be non-hydric, and no hydrology indicators were observed.
      Consequently, none of the areas examined met jurisdictional wetland criteria.

      The eastern portion of the review area was converted to a golf course in the early 2000's.
      Several "ponds" were created throughout the golf course; most of the ponds have rubber liners.
      AEC reviewed historical aerial photography to determine if the ponds were created in historical
      wetland areas. Based on the aerial analysis, it appears that none of the ponds were created in
      historical wetland. AEC submits that the pond areas should not be regulated as jurisdictional
      wetland as they were created in upland and have artificial bottoms (rubber liners). AEC
      reviewed an area in the agricultural field (just west of the golf course near the center of the
      review area, an area that is quite evident on 2010 aerial imagery. This area was a stockpile of
      coarse material (mostly sand and gravel) and was dominated by pigweed (Amaranthus) species.
      The area was determined by AEC not to meet jurisdictional wetland criteria.

      Due to the timing of late-season field work, findings have not been reviewed in the field by
      wetland regulatory agencies, and therefore have not been confirmed in writing by the Technical
      Evaluation Panel (TEP) for the project area, or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The TEP
      and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be invited to review and comment on the wetland
      delineation in spring 2013.

   13. Water Use

      Will the project involve installation or abandonment of any water wells, connection to or changes in any public
      water supply or appropriation of any ground or surface water (including dewatering)?  Yes  No.

      If yes, as applicable, give location and purpose of any new wells; public supply affected, changes to be made,
      and water quantities to be used; the source, duration, quantity and purpose of any appropriations; and unique
      well numbers and DNR appropriation permit numbers, if known. Identify any existing and new wells on the
      site map. If there are no wells known on the site, explain methodology used to determine.

      Abandonment of water wells
      No new water wells are planned for the project. The Minnesota Geological Survey's (MGS) County
      Well Index (CWI) indicates there is one registered well within the project site. According to the
      Phase I Environmental Assessment report, no municipal or private water wells were noted on the
      Property, except for an irrigation well located on the Frandsen Parcel (former golf practice range).
      According to Minnesota Department of Health well records for Unique Well No. 686580, this
      irrigation well is 300 feet deep and was installed in 2002 to irrigate the golf course facility
      (Appendix C). This well will be abandoned during construction. If any other active or inactive
      wells are discovered on the property, they will be field-located, abandoned, and sealed in accordance
      with Minnesota Department of Health regulations prior to site development.

      Connection to a public water supply system
      The City of Lake Elmo currently operates two wells, which are permitted under DNR Water
      Appropriations Permit No. 611031. The two wells range in depth from 285 to 808 feet deep, and
      draw water from the Jordan-Mt. Simon and Prairie Du Chien-Jordan aquifers (2010 Drinking Water
      Report). The City's DNR water appropriations permit allows a total system pumping capacity of
      260 million gallons per year (MGY).

      According to DNR Water Appropriation records as of 2010, the city reported pumping 103 MGY
      (average 282,192 gallons per day). The estimated water demand for the proposed development is
      34.3 MGY (94,037 gallons per day) based on the assumption that consumption is approximately 110
      percent of wastewater generation (see Item 18). Consequently, there are no water supply issues
      anticipated as a result of adding the development to the city's water supply system. According to the
      city engineer, water may be supplied to the development either through an existing services
      agreement with the City of Oakdale or via the Lake Elmo municipal water supply system.

      The current Comprehensive Plan calls for municipal water facilities to be extended from the
      southeast corner of the Eagle Point Business Park along Hudson Boulevard to service this portion of
      the city.

      Dewatering
      Dewatering will become necessary if surficial groundwater is encountered during utility installation;
      however, it is unlikely that dewatering will be necessary because the depth to groundwater exceeds
      the planned depth of sanitary sewer, municipal water, and storm sewer in most areas within the study
      area. Based on data gathered from Unique Well No. 686580 upon installation in October 2002, static
      groundwater levels in the area are approximately 120 feet below grade. The quantity and duration of
      potential construction dewatering is not known at this time, but it is expected that any necessary
      dewatering for construction will be temporary. If groundwater is encountered during utility
      installation, it will be discharged to temporary sediment basins located within the project site.



                                                       11
Savona EAW                                                                                          April 3, 2013


      If construction dewatering and pumping from the proposed development exceeds the 10,000-gallon
      per day or 1,000,000 gallons per year thresholds, a DNR Water Appropriation Permit will be
      obtained. If it becomes apparent that construction dewatering will not exceed 50 million gallons in
      total and duration of one year from the start of pumping, the contractor or project proposer will apply
      to the DNR Division of Waters for coverage under the amended DNR General Permit 97-0005 for
      temporary water appropriations. It is not anticipated that construction dewatering or pumping from
      the proposed development will be extensive or continue long enough to impact domestic or
      municipal wells.

   14. Water-Related Land Use Management District

      Does any part of the project involve a shoreland zoning district, a delineated 100-year flood plain, or a state
      or federally designated wild or scenic river land use district?  Yes  No
      If yes, identify the district and discuss project compatibility with district land use restrictions.

      The project site is not located within a shoreland zoning district. The site is not within 1,000 feet of
      a Minnesota DNR Public waterbody or 300 feet of a Minnesota DNR Public Watercourse, which
      would trigger a shoreland zoning district. According to FEMA Floodplain mapping (2008 Update),
      the project is located within Flood Panel 27163C0335E; HUC 7010206. The entire project is
      identified as being outside of either a 100 or 500-year flood zone (Exhibit 7). The site is also not in
      or adjacent to any state or federally-designated wild or scenic river land use zone.

   15. Water Surface Use

      Will the project change the number or type of watercraft on any water body?  Yes  No
      If yes, indicate the current and projected watercraft usage and discuss any potential overcrowding or conflicts
      with other uses.

      The project site does not encompass any surface waters that are used by watercraft.

   16. Erosion and Sedimentation

      Give the acreage to be graded or excavated and the cubic yards of soil to be moved:

      Acres: Approximately 100 acres of 112.5 acres will be graded for streets, house pads, and
      stormwater features.

      Cubic Yards: Approximately 750,000 cubic yards of soil will be moved.

      Describe any steep slopes or highly erodible soils and identify them on the site map. Describe any erosion and
      sedimentation control measures to be used during and after project construction.

      The Highly Erodible Land (HEL) List for Washington County, Minnesota (USDA NRCS, 2006)
      indicates there is one potentially highly erodible soil that covers approximately 23.7 acres in two
      areas within the study area (Exhibit 8). Chetek sandy loam (6-12 percent slopes) is located in the
      central portion of the western portion and in the southwest corner of the eastern portion of the
      property.

      According to the USDA NRCS SSURGO database for Washington County (Accessed 2013), steep
      slopes (12 percent or greater) may be associated with the one soil mentioned above. Contour

Savona EAW                                                                                       April 3, 2013


       mapping indicates that the majority of the surface topography is gently undulating. Elevations range
       from 1,078 feet in the northwestern portion of the site to 950 feet in the eastern portion of the site
       (Exhibit 2). The western portion of the site drains to the southwest, and the eastern portion drains
       east-northeast. With the majority of the project area being over 1,000 above mean sea level, the site
       contains some of the highest elevations in the city.

       Because the project will involve disturbance of more than one acre of land, application for coverage
       under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System/State Disposal System (NPDES/SDS)
       General Permit will be submitted to the MPCA prior to initiating earthwork on the site. This permit
       is required for discharge of stormwater during construction activity and requires that Best
       Management Practices (BMPs) be used to control erosion, and that all erosion controls be inspected
       after each rainfall exceeding 0.5 inches in 24 hours. Erosion control practices that will be
       implemented on the site include:

           1. Construction of temporary sediment basins in the locations proposed for stormwater
              ponding, and development of these basins for permanent use following construction.
           2. Silt fence and other erosion control features installed prior to initiation of earthwork and
              maintained until viable turf or ground cover is established on exposed areas.
           3. Periodic street cleaning and installation of a rock construction entrance to reduce tracking of
              dirt onto public streets.
           4. Stabilization of exposed soils, phased with grading, within 7 days for slopes steeper than 3:1,
              14 days for slopes less than 3:1 but greater that 10:1, and 21 days for slopes flatter than 10:1.
           5. Energy dissipation, such as riprap, installed at storm sewer outfalls.
           6. Use of cover crops, native seed mixes, sod, and landscaping to stabilize exposed surface
              soils after final grading.

       Erosion control plans must be reviewed and accepted by the City of Lake Elmo and applicable
       watersheds prior to project construction. Because the above BMPs will be implemented during and
       after construction, potential adverse effects from construction-related sediment and erosion on water
       quality will be minimized.

   17. Water Quality: Surface Water Runoff

   a) Compare the quantity and quality of site runoff before and after the project. Describe permanent controls to
      manage or treat runoff. Describe any stormwater pollution prevention plans.

       The project must meet the requirements of the city's Storm Water Ordinance. The project also must
       meet the requirements of the Valley Branch and South Washington Watershed Districts (e.g.
       infiltration, erosion), where applicable.

       The city's Storm Water Ordinance is available on the city's website. Lake Elmo is also a mandatory
       small MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System) city, and is required by federal and state law
       to obtain and implement a NPDES Stormwater permit administered by the MPCA. MS4s are also
       required to develop and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan program (SWPPP), and
       submit an annual report to the MPCA.




                                                        13
Savona EAW                                                                                       April 3, 2013


       Pre-Development Site Runoff
       Existing site runoff likely contains pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizer residues due to the presence
       of agricultural fields and the golf practice area. There is also likely a minor amount of runoff that
       flows to the site from Keats Avenue North. However, because the site contains some of the highest
       elevations in the city, runoff primarily drains away from the site to the southwest and east-northeast.
       It is expected that a portion of the runoff infiltrates into the site's permeable, silty and sandy soils
       (see Item 19) and some likely reaches existing onsite stormwater ponds located on the golf course
       practice area.

       Post-Development Site Runoff
       The change in land use will decrease the amount of agricultural chemicals and suspended solids, and
       increase other components typical of urban runoff. It is expected that the volume of runoff will
       increase during significant storm events as a result of the increase in impervious surface area. It is
       anticipated that only extreme conditions such as those occurring in connection with 50- or 100-year
       storm events will result in measurable increases in runoff volume and associated pollutant transport.
       The preservation and creation of open space in the form of buffers, parks, woodlands, and ponds will
       help to mitigate potential adverse effects from the increase in impervious surface.

       Runoff water quality will be typical of residential developments, and will likely be slightly degraded
       due to pollutants deposited on roads, roofs, and other impervious surfaces. Similar to current
       conditions, sediment, nutrient, and other pollutant removal will occur when much of the stormwater
       filters through upland vegetation, vegetated drainage swales, stormwater ponds, and other best
       management practices, including infiltration. Preserved and newly seeded vegetation will provide
       filter strips to help remove sediment and nutrients before runoff discharges to area wetlands and
       surface waters, mitigating potential effects on water quality.

       Potential adverse effects of runoff volume and quality will be further mitigated by the construction of
       approximately 5.0 acres of stormwater ponds, which will be designed to reduce peak runoff rates and
       meet all requirements of the City of Lake Elmo, and Valley Branch and South Washington
       Watershed Districts. The design of ponding areas and the quality of stormwater discharging from
       the development will meet the requirements of the MPCA General Stormwater Permit for
       Construction Activity (Minnesota Stormwater Manual, and applicable local regulations. In a storm
       event, stormwater will be retained in the ponds and discharged at or below existing peak runoff rates.

       BMPs will be employed during construction to reduce erosion and sediment loading of stormwater
       runoff. Inspection and maintenance of BMPs during construction will be consistent with
       NPDES/SDS General Permit requirements, including site inspection after rainfall events, perimeter
       sediment control maintenance, and sediment removal.

   b) Identify routes and receiving water bodies for runoff from the site; include major downstream water bodies as
      well as the immediate receiving waters. Estimate impact runoff on the quality of receiving waters.

       According to available watershed district mapping, the project site is located within the Valley
       Branch and South Washington Watershed Districts (Exhibit 6). Surface waters generally flow east-
       northeast towards Lake Elmo, and southwest towards an unnamed creek which connects Armstrong
       Lake to Wilmes Lake. Because the site represents one of the highest locations in the city, the site
       does not receive directed runoff from off-site waterbodies such as Raleigh Creek, Eagle Point Lake,
       or Lake Elmo, and there are no direct hydrologic connections to these waterbodies from the project
       site.

Savona EAW                                                                                        April 3, 2013


        The goal of the project will be to maintain peak discharge rates at or below the existing condition.
        Post-construction drainage will follow similar pathways, with minor differences in drainage routes
        and increases in the volume of road ditches and swale flows. Post-development stormwater runoff
        will either travel overland, into stormwater ponds, or through storm sewers prior to discharging to
        receiving waters.

        For the following reasons, it is anticipated that site development will have minimal effects on
        receiving water quality:
                Preservation and creation of approximately 27 acres of buffers, parks, woodlands, and ponds
                (24 percent of the site).
                Hydraulic storage within sediment basins will be designed, and BMPs implemented, in
                accordance with the General NPDES/SDS Permit for Construction Activities to protect
                water quality and control erosion.

   18. Water Quality: Wastewaters

   a)    Describe sources, composition and quantities of all sanitary, municipal and industrial wastewater produced
        or treated at the site.

        Only normal domestic wastewater production is expected from the project. The types of wastewater
        produced will be typical of new residential developments. No onsite municipal or industrial
        wastewater treatment is anticipated or planned.

        Both the MPCA and the Metropolitan Council Environmental Services (MCES) have compiled and
        documented extensive data that relates wastewater flow generation to population and land use.
        Sanitary wastewater production for the proposed development was estimated based on the methods
        outlined in the Service Availability Charge (SAC) Procedure Manual (MCES, 2012). The MCES
        has established 274 gallons per day (gpd) to be the average daily wastewater production from a
        typical residential connection. One SAC unit is defined as 274 gallons of wastewater flow volume,
        which is based on the assumption of 2.74 persons per unit and 100 gallons per capita day (gpcd) of
        wastewater production.

        Each single family residence and townhome was assigned one SAC unit. The estimated maximum
        potential daily wastewater production for the entire development is 85,488 gpd. The following table
        provides information on wastewater production based on land use.

   b) Describe waste treatment methods or pollution prevention efforts and give estimates of composition after
      treatment. Identify receiving waters, including major downstream water bodies (identifying any impaired
      waters), and estimate the discharge impact on the quality of receiving waters. If the project involves on-site
      sewage systems, discuss the suitability of site conditions for such systems.

        No on-site sanitary sewage treatment is proposed.

   c)   If wastes will be discharged into a publicly owned treatment facility, identify the facility, describe any
        pretreatment provisions and discuss the facility's ability to handle the volume and composition of wastes,
        identifying any improvements necessary.

        According to the city's approved Comprehensive Plan, the project area is situated within a
        designated sewer service area (see Future Land Use ­ Sewer Plan, 2012). Current plans call for the
        proposed development site to be served by municipal sewer extended from the southeast corner of
        the Eagle Point Business Park along Hudson Boulevard. All wastewater from the proposed project
        will be discharged to the Woodbury, Oakdale, Northdale, and East Oakdale (WONE) Interceptor.
        The amended Land Use Plan (2012) forecasts approximately 515 new households connecting to the
        WONE Interceptor by 2015, and an additional 1,235 households by 2020. From the WONE
        Interceptor, wastewater from the development would flow to the Metropolitan Wastewater
        Treatment Plant in St. Paul, Minnesota for treatment; the largest wastewater treatment facility in
        Minnesota. This facility currently treats approximately 215 million gallons of wastewater each day,
        and has the capacity to treat up to 250 million gallons per day. The Metropolitan Council projects
        ample capacity at this plant through 2030. Consequently, no wastewater facility or treatment
        capacity issues are anticipated (MCES 2007).

   19. Geologic Hazards and Soil Conditions

        Approximate depth (in feet) to groundwater:       0      minimum       ~150     average
        Approximate depth (in feet) to bedrock:          ~50     minimum       ~125     average

   a) Describe any of the following geologic site hazards to ground water and also identify them on the site map:
      sinkholes, shallow limestone formations or karst conditions. Describe measures to avoid or minimize
      environmental problems due to any of these hazards.

        Groundwater elevations within the vicinity of the site are around 875 feet above sea level based on
        The Geologic Atlas of Washington County, Minnesota (1990) C-5, Plate 5. Topographic mapping
        indicates that elevations on the site range from approximately 1,070 above mean sea level in the
        northwest corner of the site to 980 above mean sea level towards the eastern border of the site.
        Consequently, the maximum depth to groundwater is estimated at about 195 feet. Because surficial
        groundwater is sometimes encountered in seasonally wet areas, the minimum depth to groundwater
        is estimated at 0 feet. The approximate average depth to groundwater was calculated by averaging
        the topographic elevations on the site (1,025) and subtracting the anticipated depth shown on the
        Washington County Atlas (875).

        Depth to bedrock was estimated from the record of Unique Well No. 686580 (County Well Index,
        2012) (Appendix C). The well and boring record completed for this new well in October 2002
        indicates that Prairie Du Chien bedrock was reached at a depth of 152 feet below grade. The
        Geologic Atlas of Washington County, Minnesota (1990) C-5, Plate 4 indicates that the distance to
        bedrock ranges between approximately 50 and 200 feet below grade.

   b) Describe the soils on site, giving NRCS (SCS) classifications, if known. Discuss soil texture and potential for
      groundwater contamination from wastes or chemicals spread or spilled onto the soils. Discuss any mitigation
      measures to prevent such contamination.

       The Geologic Atlas of Washington County, Minnesota (1990) C-5, Plate 1 indicates there are no
       known sinkholes, exposed bedrock, springs, or seeps on or near the site. If such features are
       encountered on the site, actions will be taken to mitigate potential effects such as stormwater routing,
       soil stabilization, and groundwater protection practices.

       Soil Classification
       The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) digital database for Washington County (USDA NRCS,
       Accessed 2013) indicates the soils that occur within the project area (Exhibit 8) are classified as
       summarized in Table 19.1. Soils on the site are predominantly non-hydric silty and sandy loams.

       A geotechnical subsurface investigation has been initiated. Results of the investigation will be
       published separately.

       Potential for Groundwater Contamination
       The Geologic Atlas of Washington County, Minnesota (1990) pollution sensitivity map indicates that
       the sensitivity of groundwater to pollution in the project areas is generally moderate. Sensitivity of
       groundwater systems to pollution is defined as the approximate time it takes from the moment a
       contaminant infiltrates the land surface until it reaches an aquifer. Although shallow groundwater is


                                                         17
Savona EAW                                                                                 April 3, 2013


      highly susceptible to contamination, moderately permeable soils with finer textures will slow or
      restrict the movement of water, which extends the time needed for chemicals to break down before
      reaching the water table. As stated in Item 19, the average depth to groundwater on the site is
      estimated at approximately 150 feet below ground surface, providing a significant buffer between the
      soil surface and the groundwater aquifer.

      Because development will be typical of residential uses, no unusual wastes or chemicals are
      anticipated to be spread or spilled that would cause significant groundwater contamination. The
      proposed project may offer continued groundwater protection by providing adequate stormwater
      treatment and vegetated infiltration areas such as rain gardens, and buffers to help capture runoff and
      filter pollutants.

      The project will adhere to the Valley Branch and South Washington Watershed Districts infiltration
      requirements for stormwater. Because of the site's elevated position in the overall landscape, the
      propensity for runoff to drain away from rather than towards the site, and the absence of surface
      water connections to known PFC-contaminated waterbodies (i.e. Raleigh Creek, Eagle Point Lake,
      and Lake Elmo), the potential for infiltrating contaminated surface waters on the site is low.

      Special Well and Boring Construction Area
      According to the Minnesota Department of Health, 2012, a special well and boring construction area
      is "a mechanism which provides for controls on the drilling or alteration of public and private water
      supply wells, and monitoring wells in an area where groundwater contamination has, or may, result
      in risks to the public health. The purpose of a Special Well and Boring Construction Area is to
      inform the public of potential health risks in areas of groundwater contamination, provide for the
      construction of safe water supplies, and prevent the spread of contamination due to the improper
      drilling of wells or borings." Contractors proposing to drill a well or boring in an advisory area must
      first contact the Minnesota Department of Health, Well Management Section to determine proper
      procedures for installation. As previously discuss, Perfluorochemical (PFC)-groundwater
      contamination exists near the project area. While the project is located in a Special Well and Boring
      Construction Area, installation of new groundwater wells is not planned by the project.

      Groundwater Protection and Mitigation Measures
      The Savona residential development will offer a higher level of groundwater protection than exists
      under current conditions. Chemical applications can be high in agriculturally-dominated landscapes.
      The conversion of the site to urban uses will ensure greater protection of groundwater by: (1)
      covering exposed soils with turf and landscape plants to reduce infiltration of nutrients and
      pesticides; (2) reducing hazardous materials on the property to include only household quantities; (3)
      providing 27 acres of park, woodland, and open space; (4) providing stormwater treatment systems;
      (5) abandoning an existing irrigation well; and (6) not drilling any new wells for the project.

   20. Solid Wastes, Hazardous Wastes, and Storage Tanks

   a) Describe types, amounts and compositions of solid or hazardous wastes, including solid animal manure,
      sludge and ash, produced during construction and operation. Identify method and location of disposal. For
      projects generating municipal solid waste, indicate if there is a source separation plan; describe how the
      project will be modified for recycling. If hazardous waste is generated, indicate if there is a hazardous waste
      minimization plan and routine hazardous waste reduction assessments.

       Construction activities will generate wastes typical of residential development operations. No solid
       or hazardous wastes, including solid animal manure, sludge, and ash, will be produced during
       construction and/or operation. The contractor will dispose of wastes generated at the site in an
       approved method by using commercial dumpsters and disposing construction wastes at an MPCA-
       permitted landfill. The contractor will recycle construction waste that can be recycled, when
       feasible.

       Following project construction, solid waste generation will be typical of occupied residential
       developments of this size. It is not anticipated that the proposed project will generate significant
       amounts of wastes that would be considered hazardous aside from typical household cleaners, paints,
       lubricants, and fuel storage for small power equipment. The majority of the solid waste generated
       will include materials such as paper, organics (food wastes, wood, and rubber products), yard waste,
       and inert solids. The remaining wastes will likely include plastics, metals, and glass.

       According to the Metropolitan Solid Waste Management Policy Plan 2010-2030 (MPCA, 2011), a
       Minnesota family of five generates approximately six tons of garbage per year, or 1.2 tons per
       occupant. The following residential solid waste generation rates were based on the conservative
       figures that the average single-family dwelling consists of 2.9 persons based on 2010 City of Lake
       Elmo census data. The household occupant number was then multiplied by 1.2 tons per person per
       year, based on the MPCA estimate for Minnesota families. Using these conservative figures, the
       proposed development could generate as much as 1,086 tons per year (312 units X 2.9 people/unit X
       1.2 tons/person/year) of residential municipal solid waste per year.

       Residents within the new development will contract individually with waste haulers for solid waste
       collection and recycling services under the city's open trash and recycling collection system.
       According to the cities web page, there are currently five licensed waste haulers. Curbside recycling,
       including paper, plastics, glass, and metals, is available to Lake Elmo residents through their solid
       waste collector. Participation in the recycling program by future residents of the project area is
       expected to reduce costs for solid waste trucking and disposal.

       Waste generated in Washington County is delivered to the Resource Recovery Facility in Newport,
       Minnesota. The majority of the waste is processed into Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF). This fuel is
       burned in place of coal at Xcel's power plants in either Red Wing or Mankato, Minnesota.

   b) Identify any toxic or hazardous materials to be used or present at the site and identify measures to be used to
      prevent them from contaminating groundwater. If the use of toxic or hazardous materials will lead to a
      regulated waste, discharge or emission, discuss any alternatives considered to minimize or eliminate the waste,
      discharge or emission.

       Only normal construction and household hazardous wastes are anticipated. Toxic or hazardous
       material such as fuel for construction equipment and materials used during the normal construction
       process of residential units (paint, adhesives, stains, acids, bases, herbicides, and pesticides) will


                                                         19
Savona EAW                                                                                           April 3, 2013


        likely be used in typical quantities during site preparation and unit construction. Builders and
        contractors are responsible for proper management and disposal of wastes generated during
        construction, which is typically handled by using construction dumpsters and the appropriate
        certified landfills. No known hazardous materials are currently located onsite. Use of toxic or
        hazardous materials, outside of vehicle fuels, standard household cleaners, and lawn care chemicals,
        is not anticipated within the project area in conjunction with the proposed residential development.

   c)   Indicate the number, location, size and use of any above or below ground tanks to store petroleum products or
        other materials, except water. Describe any emergency response containment plans.

        As described in Item 9, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment was conducted by Liesch
        Associates, Inc. in October 2012. No underground storage tanks or aboveground storage tanks were
        observed on the property, or reported to Liesch. It is currently not anticipated that above or below
        ground tanks for storage of petroleum or other materials will be located on the project site.
        However, if above or below ground tanks are proposed on the site, they will be installed according to
        MPCA regulations, and consideration will be given to spill and leak detection and prevention
        technologies, as well as double-walled tank construction.

        Indicate source of trip generation rates used in the estimates.        Trip Generation, 9th Edition

        If the peak hour traffic generated exceeds 250 vehicles or the total daily trips exceeds 2,500, a traffic impact
        study must be prepared as part of the EAW. Using the format and procedures described in the Minnesota
        Department of Transportation's Traffic Impact Study Guidance (available at:
        http://www.dot.state.mn.us/accessmanagement/pdf/manualchapters/chapter5.pdf) or a similar local guidance,
        provide an estimate of the impact on traffic congestion on affected roads and describe any traffic
        improvements necessary. The analysis must discuss the project's impact on the regional transportation system.

        A traffic study was completed for the proposed project in April 2013. The traffic study examined the
        potential traffic-related impacts of the proposed project on the adjacent roadway system and key
        intersections near the site. A copy of the traffic study is included in Appendix E, and summarized
        below.

        Trip Generation
        The trip generation for the proposed project was determined based on the standard trip generation
        rates contained in Trip Generation, 9th Edition (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2012). The
        trip generation estimates for the proposed project are shown in Table 21.1.

      As shown in Table 21.2, the proposed project is expected to generate a total of 2,518 trips on a daily
      basis, 197 trips during the a.m. peak hour (with 45 inbound and 152 outbound), and 253 trips during
      the p.m. peak hour (with 162 inbound and 91 outbound). The values listed under the "Daily" column
      represent total trip ends. A trip end is one movement to or from a location. For example, a resident
      leaving home in the morning to drive to work produces one morning trip end from the house. The
      return trip home in the afternoon produces a second trip end to that house.

      Access and Trip Assignment
      Access for the proposed project will be provided via a newly constructed collector roadway (5th
      Street North) which will then intersect with Keats Avenue (CSAH 19). The newly constructed
      roadway was originally identified in the City of Lake Elmo's Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
      The Transportation Plan suggested a new east-west roadway between 10th Street (CSAH 10) and the
      I-94 frontage road be added to the transportation system. This new roadway alignment has been
      incorporated into the site plans of the proposed project and represents the southern boundary of the
      single-family residential development. "Designated as a minor collector, this route would allow
      local traffic to access the north-south county roads. Rather than a straight shot between points, this
      roadway would likely curve between new developments to provide access." According to the City's
      Transportation Plan, this new east-west roadway is expected to handle approximately 5,000 vpd by
      the year 2030 between Keats Avenue and Inwood Avenue to the west. Once extended through to
      Inwood Avenue, some traffic flowing east to Keats Avenue would likely be re-directed west to
      Inwood Avenue for access to the I-94 corridor. This new east-west roadway will also likely reduce
      the traffic volumes along 10th Street to levels where capacity improvements will not likely be
      needed by the year 2030.

      The trips generated by the proposed project were distributed to the adjacent roadway system using
      the following directional distribution:

              15 percent to/from the north via Keats Avenue (CSAH 19)
              10 percent to/from the south via Keats Avenue (CSAH 19)
              20 percent to/from the east via I-94
              40 percent to/from the west via I-94
              15 percent to/from the west via Hudson Boulevard

      Existing Conditions
      An operations analysis was conducted for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours at the following key
      intersections in order to determine how traffic conditions currently operate in the study area:

              Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at 10th Street (CSAH 10)
              Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at Hudson Boulevard
              Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at I-94 West Ramps
              Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at I-94 East Ramps
              Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) at Hudson Boulevard

      The Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersections with the I-94 West and East Ramps are signalized, as
      well as the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection with Hudson Boulevard. The Keats Avenue
      intersection with 10th Street (CSAH 10) is all-way stop controlled, and the Keats Avenue
      (CSAH 19) intersection with Hudson Boulevard is side-street stop controlled.

      The existing conditions analysis revealed that all five (5) of the key intersections currently operate at
      acceptable level of service (LOS) C or better during the a.m. and p.m. peak hour with existing
      geometrics and traffic control.

      Future Conditions
      It is anticipated that the proposed project will be fully built-out by the year 2018. Therefore, an
      operations analysis was also completed for the year 2018 in order to determine the traffic-related
      impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadway system. Two future year
      development scenarios were analyzed: year 2018 no-build, and year 2018 build. The year 2018 no-
      build conditions assume that the proposed project is not built; however, background traffic growth in
      the study area is assumed to grow at a 1.7 percent annual growth rate. The year 2018 no-build
      conditions is used as a future year base from which the year 2018 build traffic volumes were
      developed. The year 2018 build conditions assume that the proposed project is fully build-out. In
      addition to the five (5) key intersections analyzed as part of the existing conditions analysis, the
      proposed east-west roadway (5th Street) intersection with Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) was also
      analyzed as part of the year 2018 build conditions operations analysis.

      The year 2018 no-build conditions analysis revealed that all of the five (5) key intersections continue
      to operate at acceptable LOS C or better during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, with existing
      geometrics and traffic control.

      The analysis results for the year 2018 build-out conditions revealed that even with the addition of the
      traffic generated by the proposed development, the five (5) key study intersections as well as the
      Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with the proposed 5th Street will operate at an acceptable
      LOS C or better during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, with existing geometrics and traffic control.

      Conclusions
      While the proposed development will increase traffic volumes on adjacent roadways, the increase
      will not have an adverse impact on traffic operations since the adjacent roadways have enough
      reserve capacity to accommodate the site-related traffic. Therefore, with the exception of the
      proposed east-west collector roadway (5th Street) that will serve as the primary access to the
      proposed development, no additional improvements are needed to the existing roadway system to
      accommodate the proposed project.

   22. Vehicle-Related Air Emissions

      Estimate the effect of the project's traffic generation on air quality, including carbon monoxide levels. Discuss
      the effect of traffic improvements or other mitigation measures on air quality impacts.

      Increased traffic will generate a relatively small corresponding increase in carbon monoxide levels
      and other vehicle-related air emissions. The project is expected to have a negligible impact on air
      quality. Consequently, baseline air quality monitoring, or predictive air quality modeling, has not
      been scheduled at this time, and no measures to mitigate air quality impacts have been considered.

   23. Stationary Source Air Emissions

      Describe the type, sources, quantities and compositions of any emissions from stationary sources of air
      emissions such as boilers, exhaust stacks or fugitive dust sources. Include any hazardous air pollutants
      (consult EAW Guidelines for a listing) and any greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
      oxide) and ozone-depleting chemicals (chloro-fluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons or sulfur
      hexafluoride). Also describe any proposed pollution prevention techniques and proposed air pollution control
      devices. Describe the impacts on air quality.

      Because development of heavy industrial facilities is not proposed on this site, no stationary source
      air emissions are anticipated as a result of this project.

   24. Odors, Noise and Dust

      Will the project generate odors, noise or dust during construction or during operation?  Yes  No
      If yes, describe sources, characteristics, duration, quantities or intensity and any proposed measures to
      mitigate adverse impacts. Also identify locations of nearby sensitive receptors and estimate impacts on them.
      Discuss potential impacts on human health or quality of life. (Note: fugitive dust generated by operations may
      be discussed at item 23 instead of here.)

      Project development will not generate odors, noise or dust in excess of levels emitted during typical
      construction practices of suburban developments. Any odors, noise, or dust produced during
      construction will meet the requirements of the MPCA and applicable local regulations.

      Odors
      The project will not generate significant odors during construction or operation. The emission of
      odor by any use shall be in compliance with City Code Section 96.03, 4(a).

      Noise
      The project will be constructed in accordance with the city's established noise ordinance as outlined
      in City Code Sections 130.45 to 130.47. It is anticipated that noise levels will temporarily increase
      locally during project construction, but are expected to return to normal levels following project
      completion. Noise levels on and adjacent to the site will vary considerably during construction
      depending on the pieces of construction equipment being operated simultaneously, the percent of
      time in operation, and the distance from the equipment to the receptors. The nearest receptors to the
      proposed project are several single-family residences located to the north along Julep Avenue North,
      and commercial businesses to the south and west along both Eagle Point and Hudson Boulevards. In
      accordance with Section 130.47 of the City Code, construction equipment will not be operated
      between the hours of 6:00 pm and 7:00 am on weekdays, and during any hours on Saturdays,
      Sundays, and state and federal holidays.

      Dust
      The construction process is expected to generate some dust, but it is not anticipated that fugitive dust
      will be generated in objectionable quantities. Consideration will be given to suppression of airborne
      dust by application of water if significant fugitive dust generation occurs during site grading and
      equipment operation. In general, incidental dust emissions generated during site construction will be
      consistent with City Code Section 96.03, 4(a).

   25. Nearby Resources

      Are any of the following resources on or in proximity to the site?
      If yes, describe the resource and identify any project-related impacts on the resource. Describe any measures
      to minimize or avoid adverse impacts.

      Archaeological, historical or architectural resources?  Yes  No

      The Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) conducted a search of the Minnesota
      Archaeological Inventory and Historic Structure Inventory for the project area ( Appendix D). Based
      on their review, no previously-recorded archaeological sites or historic structures were identified in
      the database for the project area. Consequently, no further review of archaeological, historical or
      architectural resources is considered warranted at this time.

      Prime or unique farmlands or land within an agricultural preserve?  Yes  No

      According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), four of the eight soil types found
      on the site are classified as prime farmland (Table 19.1). These soils comprise 73.0 acres or
      approximately 65 percent of the site area.

      Prime farmlands consist of land that has the best combination of physical and chemical
      characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, and oilseed crops. According to the NRCS, prime
      farmlands have "an adequate and dependable water supply from precipitation, a favorable
      temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity, acceptable salt and sodium content
      and few or no rocks." This does not mean all soils listed as prime farmland produce exceptionally
      high crop yields.

      No farmland preservation measures have been considered. Because the site is guided for
      development, no clear alternatives to conversion of prime farmland are readily identifiable.

      Designated parks, recreation areas or trails?  Yes  No

      There are currently no designated parks, recreation areas, or trails within the project boundaries.
      Lake Elmo Regional Park Reserve is located less than a mile north of the proposed project site.
      Stonegate Park, located approximately 1,000 feet northwest of the project area, contains a
      playground and athletic fields.

      Scenic views and vistas?  Yes  No

      There are no scenic views or vistas located on or near the property.

      Other unique resources?  Yes  No



                                                       24
Savona EAW                                                                                          April 3, 2013


   26. Visual Impacts

      Will the project create adverse visual impacts during construction or operation? Such as glare from intense
      lights, lights visible in wilderness areas and large visible plumes from cooling towers or exhaust stacks?  Yes
       No. If yes, explain.

      The project will not create adverse visual impacts. The proposed residential land use is consistent
      with other established uses in the area, and therefore will not create a significant change in visual
      aesthetics. Measures to soften visual transitions include providing buffers between existing homes
      and gravel mining operations to the north, preservation of tree cover where possible, and providing
      berms, buffers and landscaping adjacent to proposed collector streets and other adjacent land uses.

   27. Compatibility with Plans and Land Use Regulations

      Is the project subject to an adopted local comprehensive plan, land use plan or regulation, or other applicable
      land use, water, or resource management plan of a local, regional, state or federal agency?  Yes  No.
      If yes, describe the plan, discuss its compatibility with the project and explain how any conflicts will be
      resolved. If no, explain.

      The project is subject to the City of Lake Elmo's Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance. As
      described in the recently amended Land Use Plan, the city plans to grow its population by increasing
      the total number of households from 2,779 to 3,519 by 2015. In accordance with a Memorandum of
      Understanding with the Metropolitan Council, the city has committed to providing 6,600 additional
      Residential Equivalent Connections (RECs) by 2030. This will be partially achieved by increasing
      residential density within the I-94 corridor. The Comprehensive Plan includes a land use and staging
      plan map that guides future community growth and improvement. The City of Lake Elmo zoning
      map designates the Dale property as HD-RR-SRD, which is a Rural Residential/Sewered Residential
      Holding District. The Frandsen property is currently zoned HD-A-SRD, which is an Agricultural/
      Sewered Residential Holding District. Both are consistent with the proposed use, although re-zoning
      the properties to the appropriate LDR and MDR zoning will be required prior to development. The
      Lake Elmo I-94 Development Staging Plan map (2012) designates the project area as being within
      Stage I (new sewered development located west of Keats Avenue that will connect to the MCES
      WONE interceptor). Consequently, the proposed project is consistent with the goals and plans of
      both the City of Lake Elmo and the Metropolitan Council for this area.

   28. Impact on Infrastructure and Public Services

      Will new or expanded utilities, roads, other infrastructure or public services be required to serve the project?
       Yes  No.

      If yes, describe the new or additional infrastructure or services needed. (Note: any infrastructure that is a
      connected action with respect to the project must be assessed in the EAW; see EAW Guidelines for details.)

      Public and private infrastructure improvements will need to be constructed in association with this
      development. These include but are not limited to: roadways, trails, stormwater systems, electrical
      lines, telephone lines, and continued improvements and upgrades to the sanitary sewer and water
      supply systems. The Comprehensive Plan calls for municipal sewer and water facilities to be
      extended from the southeast corner of the Eagle Point Business Park along Hudson Boulevard to
      service this portion of the city and proposed new residential development. The project will also
      require construction of a collector roadway along the southern portion of the property boundary that



                                                         25
Savona EAW                                                                                        April 3, 2013


      would intersect with Keats Avenue North to the east for proper site access and traffic control. This
      collector road will eventually be extended west as those properties develop as guided. Impacts
      related to public improvements directly associated with the proposed development project are
      discussed throughout this document.

   29. Cumulative Impacts

      Minnesota Rule part 4410.1700, subpart 7, item B requires that the RGU consider the "cumulative potentia l
      effects of related or anticipated future projects" when determining the need for an environmental impact
      statement.

      Identify any past, present or reasonably foreseeable future projects that may interact with the project
      described in this EAW in such a way as to cause cumulative potential effects. (Such future projects would be
      those that are actually planned or for which a basis of expectation has been laid.)

      Describe the nature of the cumulative potential effects and summarize any other available information relevant
      to determining whether there is potential for significant environmental effects due to these cumulative effects
      (or discuss each cumulative potential effect under appropriate item(s) elsewhere on this form).

      The changes in regional land use in the Lake Elmo area from open space and agricultural land to
      more urbanized uses is expected to have a cumulative impact on the area. Cumulative effects of this
      and future projects on natural resources and infrastructure are expected to be roughly proportional to
      the impacts discussed in this EAW, or somewhat greater if future projects are developed at a higher
      density. The City of Lake Elmo has planned for future growth and development in this particular
      area as part of its Amended Comprehensive Land Use Plan (2012), utility plans, stormwater
      management plans, and administration of zoning ordinances. These efforts will ensure that the
      cumulative impacts of future growth and development to the environment, and to the city's service
      capacity, are anticipated and mitigated.

      The project proposer does not currently own or have options on adjacent lands. Consequently, the
      precise timing and nature of future development in the project vicinity is unknown. However, land
      adjacent to the project site is eventually expected to develop, per the city's Land Use Plan, thereby
      converting existing open space and agricultural lands to residential and commercial uses. The City
      of Lake Elmo's Amended Comprehensive Land Use Plan (2012) anticipates and guides the intensity
      of development within the city and directs necessary infrastructure improvements to support the
      planned development.

      Parcels to the south, west, and northeast of the proposed project area are currently undeveloped and
      zoned HD-A-SRD or HD-RR-SRD. In keeping with the city's Comprehensive Plan, and the MOU
      with the Metropolitan Council, these parcels are expected to develop in the future to mediumdensity
      residential and/or commercial uses. Undeveloped parcels immediately surrounding the proposed
      development site contain similar land uses and land features as the project site. Existing land cover
      on these properties is primarily agricultural, with grasslands, wooded tree lines, and small wetlands
      interspersed. The proposed project will not result in conversion of jurisdictional wetland to upland,
      but will result in minor tree removal and conversion of agricultural lands to non-agricultural uses.
      Consequently, cumulative impacts to natural resources are anticipated to be minimal, and have been
      purposefully concentrated in this portion of the city to preserve an agricultural core to the north of
      10th Street (CSAH 10).

         Development of surrounding parcels will also result in cumulative impacts to city infrastructure such
         as roads, sewer, and water. These cumulative impacts have been thoughtfully contemplated and
         addressed in the city's Comprehensive, Transportation, Wastewater, and Water Plans. As the
         surrounding properties develop, they will be evaluated under the Minnesota Environmental Policy
         Act (MEPA) rules, and will adhere to guidelines presented in the city's approved zoning and
         comprehensive plans for the area.

         Mitigation for anticipated minor cumulative impacts in the area will include providing approximately
         27 acres of open space (24 percent of the site), providing buffers from surrounding developments,
         protecting woodlands to the extent practicable, pretreating stormwater and controlling stormwater
         rates, providing adequate municipal facilities such as potable water and wastewater treatment, and
         addressing future traffic issues. These provisions will help minimize potential cumulative effects of
         past developments and future developments within the region.

   30. Other Potential Environmental Impacts

         If the project may cause any adverse environmental impacts not addressed by items 1 to 28, identify and
         discuss them here, along with any proposed mitigation.

         No other adverse environmental impacts are anticipated as a result of this project. Potential
         environmental impacts have been addressed in Items 1 through 29.

   31. Summary of Issues

         Do not complete this section if the EAW is being done for EIS scoping; instead, address relevant issues in the
         draft Scoping Decision document, which must accompany the EAW.

         List any impacts and issues identified above that may require further investigation before the project is begun.
         Discuss any alternatives or mitigative measures that have been or may be considered for these impacts and
         issues, including those that have been or may be ordered as permit conditions.

RE: Natural Heritage Review of the proposed Lake Elmo Property;
T29N R21W Section 34; Washington County

Dear Mr. Weetman,
         As requested, the above project has been reviewed for potential effects to known occurrences of rare
features. A search of the Minnesota Natural Heritage Information System did identify rare features within an
approximate one-mile radius of the proposed project, but these records did not include any federally listed
species and were either historical or not of concern given the project details that were provided with the data
request form. As such, I do not believe the proposed project will adversely affect any known occurrences of rare
features.
         The Natural Heritage Information System (NHIS), a collection of databases that contains information
about Minnesota's rare natural features, is maintained by the Division of Ecological and Water Resources,
Department of Natural Resources. The NHIS is continually updated as new information becomes available, and
is the most complete source of data on Minnesota's rare or otherwise significant species, native plant
communities, and other natural features. However, the NHIS is not an exhaustive inventory and thus does not
represent all of the occurrences of rare features within the state. Therefore, ecologically significant features for
which we have no records may exist within the project area.
         For environmental review purposes, the results of this Natural Heritage Review are valid for one year;
the results are only valid for the project location (noted above) and project description provided on the NHIS
Data Request Form. Please contact me if project details change or if an updated review is needed.
         Please note that locations of the gray wolf (Canis lupus), state-listed as special concern, and the Canada
lynx (Lynx canadensis), federally-listed as threatened, are not currently tracked in the NHIS. As such, the
Natural Heritage Review does not address these species.
         Furthermore, the Natural Heritage Review does not constitute review or approval by the Department of
Natural Resources as a whole. Instead, it identifies issues regarding known occurrences of rare features and
potential effects to these rare features. Additional rare features for which we have no data may be present in the
project area, or there may be other natural resource concerns associated with the proposed project. For these
concerns, please contact your DNR Regional Environmental Assessment Ecologist (contact information available
at http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/ereview/erp_regioncontacts.html). Please be aware that additional site
assessments or review may be required.
         Thank you for consulting us on this matter, and for your interest in preserving Minnesota's rare natural
resources. An invoice will be mailed to you under separate cover.

                                                       Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM

Date:   April 9, 2013

Re:     Savona: Traffic Study
        Lake Elmo, Minnesota
        File 20121161.00

To:     Joe Jablonski, Land Development Manager,
        Lennar

From: John M. Hagen, P.E., PTOE, Senior Transportation Engineer
      Cindie Flaig, Traffic Specialist

Executive Summary

As part of the on-going Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW) for the proposed Savona
development, the City of Lake Elmo requested that a traffic study be completed in order to
determine the traffic-related impacts associated with the proposed Savona residential
development located in the northwest quadrant of the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with
Hudson Boulevard in Lake Elmo, Minnesota. The proposed development will consist of 190
single-family and 122 multi-family lots. The study results are summarized in the following
paragraphs, with detailed information provided in the body of the memorandum.

Existing Conditions: Results of the traffic operations analysis indicate that all of the key
intersections are currently operating at an acceptable LOS C or better during the a.m. and p.m.
peak hours, with the existing traffic control and geometric layouts.

A review of the vehicular queues revealed that vehicles in the southbound through lanes
currently back up past the existing left- and right-turn lanes approximately 2 percent of the p.m.
peak hour. However, the existing lagging left-turn signal phase helps to minimize the negative
operational impacts of this occasional blockage of the southbound turn lanes.

Proposed Development: It is anticipated that the proposed Savona residential development will
be fully build-out by the year 2018. The proposed development will consist of 190 single-family
and 122 multi-family lots. Access to the proposed development will be via a new east-west
minor collector located between 10th Street (CSAH 10) and Hudson Boulevard. This new east-
west collector roadway was initially identified in the City of Lake Elmo's Transportation Plan.
As part of this project, the east-west collector roadway will be constructed from Keats Avenue
(CSAH 19) to the western edge of the proposed Savona residential development (or
approximately 3/4-mile west of Keats Avenue). Ultimately, the east-west collector roadway will
April 9, 2013

be extended to connect to Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13). However, the completion of this future
connection will be dependent on the development of the adjacent properties.

The proposed Savona development will generate an estimated 2,518 trips on an average
weekday, 197 trips during the a.m. peak hour (with 45 inbound and 152 outbound trips), and 253
trips during the p.m. peak hour (with 162 inbound and 91 outbound trips).

A comparison of the proposed development with the assumed land uses in the City of Lake
Elmo's transportation plan revealed that the proposed Savona residential development appears to
be consistent with the land use assumptions included in the Lake Elmo Comprehensive Plan.

Future Year 2018 No-Build Conditions: The year 2018 no-build analysis revealed that all
intersections are expected to continue to operate at acceptable LOS C or better during the peak
hours under the year 2018 no-build conditions with existing geometrics and signal timing.

Not surprisingly, the review of the vehicular queues revealed the same minor queuing issues
reported during the existing conditions on the southbound approach of Inwood Avenue (CSAH
13) at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection with Hudson Boulevard during the p.m. peak
hour will continue under the year 2018 no-build. Under year 2018 no-build conditions, the
vehicular queues from the southbound through movement will back up past the existing left- and
right-turn lanes approximately 6 percent of the p.m. peak hour (versus 2 percent under existing
conditions). However, once again the existing lagging left-turn signal phase helps to minimize
the negative operational impacts of this occasional blockage of the southbound turn lanes.

The increase in the background traffic from the existing conditions and the year 2018 no-build
conditions result in another potential queuing issue in the future during the p.m. peak hour. The
review of the vehicular queues also revealed that vehicles in the heavy eastbound to southbound
movement from I-94 to CSAH 19 spill-out beyond the long eastbound dual right-turn lane
approximately 1 percent of the p.m. peak hour. The existing traffic signal timing at the Keats
Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with the South I-94 Ramps should be monitored and may need
to be adjusted in the future in order to minimize the likelihood of the vehicular queues of this
heavy eastbound to southbound movement from spilling beyond the existing dual right-turn lanes
and blocking access to the eastbound shared left-turn/through lane during the p.m. peak hour.

Future Year 2018 Full Build-out Conditions: The analysis results for year 2018 full build-out
conditions indicate that all of the key intersections will continue to operate at an acceptable
LOS C or better during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, with the existing traffic control and
geometric layouts.

Similar to the no-build conditions, a review of the year 2018 full build-out conditions vehicular
queues revealed that the same minor queuing issues reported on the southbound approach of
Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection with Hudson
Boulevard; and the eastbound approach of the I-94 South Ramps at the Keats Avenue
(CSAH 19) intersection during the p.m. peak hour. Under year 2018 build conditions, the
vehicular queues from the southbound through movement at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13)
April 9, 2013
Page 3

intersection with Hudson Boulevard will back up past the existing left- and right-turn lanes
approximately 8 percent of the p.m. peak hour (versus 6 percent under no-build conditions); and
the eastbound right-turning vehicles from I-94 to southbound CSAH 19 will continue to spill-out
beyond the existing eastbound dual right-turn lane approximately 1 percent of the p.m. peak
hour. The existing lagging left-turn signal phase at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection
with Hudson Boulevard will continue to help minimize the negative operational impacts of this
occasional blockage of the southbound turn lanes. The existing traffic signal timing at the Keats
Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with the South I-94 Ramps should be monitored and may need
to be adjusted in the future in order to minimize the likelihood of the vehicular queues of this
heavy eastbound to southbound movement from spilling beyond the existing dual right-turn lanes
and blocking access to the eastbound shared left-turn/through lane during the p.m. peak hour.
This potential signal timing adjustment would be needed with or without the proposed Savona
development.

Secondary Access to Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) or Hudson Boulevard: The proposed Savona
residential development will construct a portion of 5th Street from Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) to
the western limits of their site. As the remaining available land north of I-94 between Keats
Avenue (CSAH 19) and Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13 develops, a secondary access may be
needed to either Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) to the west or Hudson Boulevard to the south, in
order to relieve pressure on the proposed Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with 5th Street.

Based on the results of the traffic operations analysis, the intersection of Keats Avenue (CSAH
19) and 5th Street can accommodate 100 percent (or the full build-out) of the ultimate 796
dwelling units assumed by the City's comprehensive plan to be directly served by the proposed
east-west collector (5th Street) before a secondary access is needed to relieve pressure on the
intersection.

Conclusions/Recommendations: The existing roadway system and traffic control will be able to
accommodate the proposed Savona residential development, assuming the construction of the
proposed 5th Street from Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) to the western limits of the project to provide
access in/out of the site.

Existing Conditions

The proposed development is located in the northwest quadrant of the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19)
intersection with Hudson Boulevard in Lake Elmo, Minnesota (see Figure 1: Project Location).
Keats Avenue (CSAH 19), in the vicinity of the proposed development, is a divided four-lane
roadway with an existing speed limit of 55 mph north of Hudson Boulevard and 50 mph south of
Hudson Boulevard.

Hudson Boulevard is a two-lane undivided roadway, and serves as north frontage road to I-94.
The existing speed limit along Hudson Boulevard is 50 mph.

Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13), to the west of the proposed development, is a divided four-lane
roadway with an existing speed limit of 45 mph north in the vicinity of Hudson Boulevard.

An operations analysis was conducted for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours at the following key
intersections in order to determine how traffic conditions currently operates in the study area:

       Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at 10th Street (CSAH 10)
       Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at Hudson Boulevard
       Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at North I-94 Ramps
       Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) at South I-94 Ramps
       Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) at Hudson Boulevard

All key intersections were analyzed using Synchro/SimTraffic software. The existing signal
timing (provided by the Washington County) was used in the analysis. Existing peak hour
turning movement counts were collected by Westwood Professional Services in March 2013 at
the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersections with 10th Street (CSAH 10), Hudson Boulevard, and
the North I-94 Ramps. Washington County staff provided year 2010 counts at the Keats Avenue
(CSAH 19) intersection with the South I-94 Ramps and the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13)
intersection with Hudson Boulevard. Since there have been no major changes in this area and
relatively stagnant economic conditions since the year 2010 traffic counts were taken by the
County, the year 2010 traffic volumes were deemed to be a reasonable reflection of existing
conditions at these two intersections

Current geometrics and peak hour traffic volumes at the key intersections are shown in Figure 2.
Copies of the raw turning movement count data at each of the key intersections are provided in
Appendix A.

Using the roadway geometric and traffic volume data described above as input, traffic
operational analysis was performed per the standards set out in the 2010 Highway Capacity
Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board. Synchro/SimTraffic 7 was used to
complete the analysis.

Two fundamental outputs from the operations analysis are typically used to characterize traffic
flow. The first is Level of Service (LOS), a letter grade ranging from "A" (free flow) to "F"
(demand exceeds capacity). Generally, LOS D represents the threshold for acceptable overall
intersection operating conditions during a peak hour in the Twin Cities metro area. An average
of five SimTraffic simulation runs is reported in the tables in the following sections within the
body of this report. Level of service results from SimTraffic are reported in the Appendix.

The second important output to consider from the operations analysis is queuing. A queue is a
line of vehicles waiting to pass through an intersection. While an intersection may be reported as
operating at an acceptable level of service, queues from the intersection extending to upstream
intersections or driveways could create a potential safety issue. The 95th percentile queue is
typically considered the standard for design purposes. The micro simulation component of the
model, SimTraffic, is best suited for reviewing vehicular queues between closely-spaced
intersections. Any 95th percentile queues that extend to an upstream intersection/driveway are
reported in the text below as well as in the detailed results tables presented in the Appendix B.

Results of the Synchro/SimTraffic analysis shown in Table 1 indicate that all of the key
intersections are currently operating at an acceptable LOS C or better during the a.m. and p.m.
peak hours, with the existing traffic control and geometric layouts.

  For signalized intersections, the letter reported represents the LOS for the entire intersection. For unsignalized intersections,
the first letter reported is the LOS of the entire intersection, while the second letter (in italics) is the LOS of the worst operating
approach.

A review of the vehicular queues revealed some existing minor queuing issues on the
southbound approach of Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13)
intersection with Hudson Boulevard during the p.m. peak hour. The vehicular queues from the
southbound through movement currently backs up past the existing left- and right-turn lanes
April 9, 2013

approximately 2 percent of the p.m. peak hour. However, the existing lagging left-turn signal
phase helps to minimize the negative operational impacts of this occasional blockage of the
southbound turn lanes. The LOS results for the year 2018 full build-out conditions are provided
in Appendix B.

Proposed Development and Site Access

The proposed Savona residential development is located in the northwest quadrant of the Keats
Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with Hudson Boulevard in Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Based on the
conceptual site plan dated April 1, 2013 (shown in Figure 3), the proposed development will
consist of 190 single-family and 122 multi-family lots. It is anticipated that proposed
development will be fully built-out by the year 2018.

As shown in Figure 3, the conceptual site plan indicates that access to the proposed development
will be via a new east-west minor collector located between 10th Street (CSAH 10) and Hudson
Boulevard. This new east-west collector roadway (hereafter referred to as 5th Street) was
initially identified in the City of Lake Elmo's Year 2030 Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
As part of this project, 5th Street will be constructed as a two-lane divided roadway with turn
lanes provided at major intersections, from Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) to the western edge of the
proposed Savona residential development (or approximately 3/4-mile west of Keats Avenue).
Ultimately, 5th Street will be extended to connect to Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13). However, the
completion of this future connection will be dependent on the development of the adjacent
properties. Figure 4 illustrates the future minor collector roadway identified in the City of Lake
Elmo's Year 2030 Comprehensive Transportation Plan and the portion of the roadway (5th
Street) that will be constructed as part of the proposed Savona development.


Comparison of Proposed Development to Lake Elmo Comprehensive Plan

In order to determine if the proposed development is consistent with the land use assumptions
included in the City of Lake Elmo's Comprehensive Transportation Plan, a land use comparison
was completed. The proposed development is located within the transportation analysis zone
(TAZ) 1229C. As shown in Table 2, TAZ 1229C is anticipated to have 796 households by the
year 2030, according to the Lake Elmo 2030 Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

The Savona residential development is proposing 312 new households to TAZ 1229C. This
represents less than 40 percent of the assumed number of households in TAZ by the year 2030.
This means that more than 60 percent of the assumed 796 households is still available for the
remaining land in TAZ 1229C that is guided for residential land uses. Figure 4 shows the
proposed land uses in and around TAZ 1229C. As shown in Figure 5, the proposed development
accounts for more than half of the land area within TAZ 1229C that is guided residential.
Therefore, the proposed Savona residential development appears to be consistent with the land
use assumptions included in the Lake Elmo Comprehensive Plan.


Traffic Forecasts

Since the full build-out of the proposed development is assumed by the year 2018, future traffic
volumes were developed for the year 2018. Year 2030 average daily traffic volumes on area
roadways (based on the City of Lake Elmo and Washington County Transportation Plans) will
also be presented for informational purposes.

Year 2018 ­ No-Build Traffic Volumes

The year 2018 no-build scenario assumes that the Savona site does not develop. Existing traffic
volumes were increased at a rate of 1.7 percent per year in order to account for background
traffic growth in the area. This growth rate was based on the current traffic volume projection
factors for Washington County published by MnDOT.

Year 2018 ­ Full Build-Out Traffic Volumes

The year 2018 full build-out scenario assumes that the proposed Savona residential development
is fully built-out. Future year 2018 full build-out volumes were developed by adding the
development-related traffic from the Savona development to the Year 2018 no-build traffic
volumes.

Year 2030 ­ Traffic Volumes

Washington County staff requested that forecast year 2030 traffic volumes on area roadways
(based on City/County comprehensive plans) be included in the traffic study for informational
purposes. Forecast year 2030 volumes were taken from the City of Lake Elmo's Year 2030
Comprehensive Transportation Plan and Washington County's 2030 Comprehensive: A Policy
Guide to 2030 ­ Transportation.

Trip Generation

Trip generation estimates for the a.m. and p.m. peak periods and on a daily basis were calculated
for the proposed Savona residential development. The trip generation estimates were developed
based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.
The trip generation estimates for the proposed development are shown in Table 3.

(1)
  The trip generation estimates were based on the 2012 ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.

As shown in Table 3, the proposed Savona residential development would generate
approximately 2,518 trips on an average weekday, 197 trips during the a.m. peak hour (with 45
inbound and 152 outbound trips), and 253 trips during the p.m. peak hour (with 162 inbound and
91 outbound trips).

The trips generated by the proposed development were assigned to the adjacent roadway system
using the directional distribution shown in Figure 6. The directional distribution shown in
Figure 6 was based on existing population, traffic patterns, and adjacent roadways system. The
resultant year 2018 no-build and traffic volumes are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. The
forecast year 2030 traffic volumes on area roadways (based on the City of Lake Elmo and
Washington County Transportation Plans) are shown in Figure 9.

Future Conditions

To determine how well the existing roadway system would accommodate the future traffic
volumes, an a.m. and p.m. peak hour operations analysis was conducted for the year 2018 no-
build and full build-out conditions.

Year 2018 No-Build Conditions

As shown in Table 4, all intersections are expected to continue to operate at acceptable LOS C or
better during the peak hours under the year 2018 no-build conditions with existing geometrics
and signal timing.

  For signalized intersections, the letter reported represents the LOS for the entire intersection. For unsignalized intersections,
the first letter reported is the LOS of the entire intersection, while the second letter (in italics) is the LOS of the worst operating
approach.

Not surprisingly, the review of the vehicular queues revealed that the same minor queuing issues
reported during the existing conditions on the southbound approach of Inwood Avenue (CSAH
13) at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection with Hudson Boulevard during the p.m. peak
hour will continue under the year 2018 no-build. Under year 2018 no-build conditions, the
vehicular queues from the southbound through movement will back up past the existing left- and
right-turn lanes approximately 6 percent of the p.m. peak hour (versus 2 percent under existing
conditions). However, once again the existing lagging left-turn signal phase helps to minimize
the negative operational impacts of this occasional blockage of the southbound turn lanes.

The increase in the background traffic from the existing conditions and the year 2018 no-build
conditions result in another potential queuing issue in the future. The review of the vehicular
queues also revealed that vehicles on the eastbound dual right-turn lane of the South I-94 Ramp
April 9, 2013
Page 19

approach to the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection will extend approximately 590 feet back
from the intersection. This is primarily due to the high number of existing (1,220) and future
year 2018 (1,330) eastbound right-turning vehicles from I-94 to southbound CSAH 19 during the
p.m. peak hour. However, since the existing eastbound dual right-turn lane currently has 540
feet of storage provided, the vehicular queues will only spill-out beyond the eastbound dual
right-turn lane approximately 1 percent of the p.m. peak hour. The existing traffic signal timing
at the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with the South I-94 Ramps should be monitored and
may need to be adjusted in the future in order to minimize the likelihood of the vehicular queues
of this heavy eastbound to southbound movement from spilling beyond the existing dual right-
turn lanes and blocking access to the eastbound shared left-turn/through lane during the p.m.
peak hour. The LOS results for the year 2018 no-build conditions are provided in Appendix C.

Year 2018 Full Build-Out Conditions

A year 2018 full build-out analysis was conducted in order to determine how the existing
roadway system can accommodate the proposed development-related traffic volumes. It should
be noted that the year 2018 full build-out scenario assumes the existing roadway system and
intersection traffic control at the key study intersections with the exception of the new
intersection of Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) with 5th Street.

For the purposes of the year 2018 full build-out analysis, the following lane configuration and
traffic control assumptions where included at the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with
5th Street:

Assumptions for the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19)/5th Street Intersection:
       Northbound Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) Approach:
           o Free-flow
           o Three (3) approach lanes (consisting of 1 ­ left-turn lane & 2 ­ through lanes)
       Southbound Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) Approach:
           o Free-flow
           o Three (3) approach lanes (consisting of 2 ­ through lanes & 1 ­ right-turn lane)
       Eastbound 5th Street Approach:
           o Stop-Controlled
           o Two (2) approach lanes (consisting of 1 ­ left-turn lane & 1 ­ right-turn lane)

The results of the year 2018 full build-out analysis are shown in Table 5. As shown in Table 5,
all intersections are expected to continue to operate at acceptable LOS C or better during the
peak hours under the year 2018 full build-out conditions with the existing geometrics and signal
timing, and the proposed 5th Street.

Similar to the no-build conditions, a review of the year 2018 full build-out conditions vehicular
queues revealed that the same minor queuing issues reported on the southbound approach of
Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection with Hudson
Boulevard, and the eastbound approach of the I-94 South Ramps at the Keats Avenue
(CSAH 19) intersection during the p.m. peak hour. Under year 2018 no-build conditions, the
vehicular queues from the southbound through movement at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13)
intersection with Hudson Boulevard will back up past the existing left- and right-turn lanes
approximately 8 percent of the p.m. peak hour (versus 6 percent under no-build conditions); and
the eastbound right-turning vehicles from I-94 to southbound CSAH 19 will continue to spill-out
beyond the existing eastbound dual right-turn lane approximately 1 percent of the p.m. peak
hour. As previously mentioned, the existing lagging left-turn signal phase at the Inwood Avenue
(CSAH 13) intersection with Hudson Boulevard helps to minimize the negative operational
impacts of this occasional blockage of the southbound turn lanes. The existing traffic signal
timing at the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with the South I-94 Ramps should continue
to be monitored and adjusted as needed in order to minimize the likelihood of the vehicular
queues of this heavy eastbound to southbound movement from spilling beyond the existing dual
right-turn lanes and blocking access to the eastbound shared left-turn/through lane during the
p.m. peak hour. The LOS results for the year 2018 full build-out conditions are provided in
Appendix D.

Secondary Access to Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) or Hudson Boulevard

As mentioned previously, the proposed Savona residential development will construct a portion
of 5th Street from Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) to the western limits of their site. As the remaining
available land north of I-94 between Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) and Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13
develops, a secondary access may be needed to either Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) to the west or
Hudson Boulevard to the south, in order to relieve pressure on the proposed Keats Avenue
(CSAH 19) intersection with 5th Street. Consistent with the City's transportation plan, the
Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) connection will ultimately be completed as the remaining land to the
west develops. Therefore, this additional analysis will focus on identifying when a secondary
access to 5th Street via Hudson Boulevard may be needed based on the future traffic operations
at the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with 5th Street.

The following methodology was utilized to estimate when a secondary access to 5th Street via
Hudson Boulevard may be needed based on the future traffic operations at the Keats Avenue
(CSAH 19) intersection with 5th Street. The forecast year 2018 full build-out traffic volumes
were used as a base. The traffic volumes in/out of 5th Street were increased in 10 percent
increments until the traffic operations at the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with
5th Street falls below acceptable LOS D. The resultant increase in traffic will then be
documented, and an equivalent build-out percentage of the available land within TAA 1229C be
identified.

Based on the results of this iterative analysis, the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with
5th Street can accommodate approximately 200 percent additional traffic to/from 5th Street than
the year 2018 full build-out traffic volumes before the traffic operations of the eastbound left-
turn from 5th Street to northbound Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) breakdowns during the p.m. peak
hour and delays for this movement become unacceptable. This 200 percent additional traffic
during the p.m. peak period corresponds to approximately 500 additional single-family homes
build-out of the available land in TAZ 1229C. Since the City of Lake Elmo's transportation plan
assumed 796 households in TAZ 1229C by the year 2030, and the proposed Savona development
accounts for 312 of the assumed 796 dwelling units, a total of 484 households remain in the
TAZ's allotment before it exceeds the development level assumed in the comprehensive plan.
These 484 dwelling units are approximately equal to the equivalent number of additional single-
family homes that will generate enough traffic to either trigger the need for a secondary access to
5th Street, or require improvements to the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with 5th Street.
Therefore, the intersection of Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) and 5th Street can accommodate
100 percent (or the full build-out) of the assumed 796 dwelling units in TAZ 1229C before a
secondary access is needed to relieve pressure on the intersection.

It should be noted that this analysis looked exclusively at traffic operations as a trigger for the
future need of a potential secondary access to serve the development along 5th Street. Other
items such as fire, life, and public safety issues will also need to be considered when considering
the timing/need for a secondary access.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on our review of the proposed Savona residential development, we offer the following
conclusions and recommendations for your consideration:

       All of the key intersections are currently operating at an acceptable LOS C or better
       during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, with the existing traffic control and geometric
       layouts.
       The proposed Savona residential development will consist of 190 single-family and 122
       multi-family lots. It is anticipated that the proposed Savona residential development will
       be fully build-out by the year 2018.
       The proposed Savona development will generate an estimated 2,518 trips on an average
       weekday, 197 trips during the a.m. peak hour (with 45 inbound and 152 outbound trips),
       and 253 trips during the p.m. peak hour (with 162 inbound and 91 outbound trips).
       Under year 2018 no-build conditions, all of the key intersections will continue to operate
       at an acceptable LOS C or better during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, with the existing
       traffic control and geometric layouts.
       Under year 2018 full build-out conditions, all of the key intersections will continue to
       operate at an acceptable LOS C or better during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, with the
       existing traffic control and geometric layouts.
       A review of the vehicular queues revealed some minor queuing issues reported on the
       southbound approach of Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13)
       intersection with Hudson Boulevard; and the eastbound approach of the I-94 South
       Ramps at the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection during the p.m. peak hour under the
       existing, year 2018 no-build, and the year 2018 build conditions. The vehicular queues
       from the southbound through movement at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection
       with Hudson Boulevard will back up past the existing left- and right-turn lanes
       approximately 2 to 8 percent of the p.m. peak hour (depending on the analysis year); and
       the eastbound right-turning vehicles from I-94 to southbound CSAH 19 will continue to
       spill-out beyond the existing eastbound dual right-turn lane approximately 1 percent of
       the p.m. peak hour under year 2018 no-build and build conditions.
       The existing lagging left-turn signal phase at the Inwood Avenue (CSAH 13) intersection
       with Hudson Boulevard helps to minimize the negative operational impacts of the
       occasional blockage of the southbound turn lanes. The existing traffic signal timing at
       the Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) intersection with the South I-94 Ramps should be
       monitored and may need to be adjusted in the future in order to minimize the likelihood
       of the vehicular queues of this heavy eastbound to southbound movement from spilling
       beyond the existing dual right-turn lanes and blocking access to the eastbound shared left-
       turn/through lane during the p.m. peak hour. This potential signal timing adjustment
       would be needed with or without the proposed Savona development.
April 9, 2013
Page 23

       Based on the results of the traffic operations analysis, the intersection of Keats Avenue
       (CSAH 19) and 5th Street can accommodate 100 percent (or the full build-out) of the
       ultimate 796 dwelling units assumed by the City's comprehensive plan to be directly
       served by the proposed east-west collector (5th Street) before a secondary access is
       needed to relieve pressure on the intersection.
Therefore, the existing roadway system and traffic control will be able to accommodate the
proposed Savona residential development, assuming the construction of the proposed 5th Street
from Keats Avenue (CSAH 19) to the western limits of the project to provide access in/out of the
site.

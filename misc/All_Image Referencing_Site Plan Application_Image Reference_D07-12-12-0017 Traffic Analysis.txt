The purpose of this memo is to summarize the findings of preliminary traffic analysis in support of
the Zoning By-law Amendment application for the above development. A Transportation Brief will
be prepared in accordance with City of Ottawa guidelines in support of the Site Plan application.

The development presently consists of 23 storey tower and 6 storey podium. A total of 195
residential units, 5,020 ft2 of commercial retail space, 26,100 ft2 of commercial office space and 244
underground vehicle parking spaces are to be provided. Vehicle access is proposed on the
laneway west of the site. The proposal includes widening the laneway to a two-way two-lane
cross-section between Somerset and the proposed access.

The study area of the analysis was discussed with City staff and includes the following
intersections:

      ·   Somerset/Breezehill
      ·   Somerset/Laneway
      ·   Breezehill/Laurel
      ·   Laurel/Laneway

The time periods for analysis include the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours of adjacent street
traffic. Analysis was completed for the existing and build-out conditions.

1.0       Existing Traffic

Weekday traffic counts were completed to verify the existing pedestrian, bicycle and motor vehicle
volumes at study area intersections. The Devonshire Public School and daycare, located
immediately south of 1050 Somerset, were consulted regarding the date, times and locations of the
traffic counts. The pedestrian data was classified into two groups including children and adults.
M:\2011\111152\DATA\CORRESPONDENCE\MEMOS\2012JULY06 - PRELIM TRAFFIC ANALYSIS.DOCX
This distinction was made so that the most vulnerable pedestrians walking to and from the
Devonshire Public School could be accounted for.

The traffic counts were completed at the following times and locations:

      ·   Somerset & Breezehill, motor vehicles ­ Thursday, March 29, 2012
      ·   Somerset & Breezehill, pedestrians and bicycles ­ Wednesday, May 30, 2012
      ·   Somerset & Public Laneway, motor vehicles ­ Thursday, March 29, 2012
      ·   Somerset & Public Laneway, pedestrians and bicycles ­ Thursday, May 31, 2012
      ·   Laurel & Breezehil, all modes ­ Thursday, May 17, 2012
      ·   Laurel & Public Laneway, all modes ­ Thursday, May 17, 2012

Copies of the above counts are included in Appendix A.

The volumes observed during the school and daycare's peak hours of operation are summarized in
Figures 1 to 3 which are included in Appendix A. The 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. peak reflects school and
daycare arrivals, the 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. peak reflects school departures and the 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.
peak reflects daycare departures.

The peak hours of the adjacent street traffic generally occur at 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 to 5:30
p.m. Peak hour site traffic generated by the proposed development is expected to coincide with the
peak hours of the adjacent street traffic.

2.0       Site Traffic

Key assumptions are as follows:

      ·   Trip generation rates for the previous and proposed land uses were estimated using the ITE
          Trip Generation Manual (8th Edition),
      ·   Trips generated by the former supermarket were reduced by 50% of the ITE rate to allow for
          the unique nature of this supermarket,
      ·   Pass-by trips for the former supermarket were estimated at 35% based on the ITE Trip
          Generation Handbook.
      ·   A vehicle occupancy factor of 1.23 (taken from the TRANS O-D Survey Report) and non
          auto usage factor of 1.1 was applied to convert ITE vehicle trip rates to person trip rates,
      ·   An auto modal share of 40% was used for trips generated by the former supermarket and
          proposed specialty retail. An auto modal share of 55% was used for the proposed
          residential and commercial office (auto modal shares taken from the TRANS O-D Survey
          Report),
      ·   Distribution of trips generated by the site were based on existing traffic patterns

3.0       Intersection Analysis

Intersection capacity analysis has been completed using Synchro 8 traffic software. This software
uses methodology from the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM) to evaluate signalized and
unsignalized intersections in terms of volume to capacity ratios, delay and queue length.


M:\2011\111152\DATA\CORRESPONDENCE\MEMOS\2012JULY06 - PRELIM TRAFFIC ANALYSIS.DOCX
The results of the analysis show that all movements at intersections within the study area perform
at an acceptable level of service under existing and future conditions during the weekday AM and
PM peak hours.

The peak hour site traffic volumes meet the MTO criteria for a dedicated westbound left-turn lane
on Somerset Street at the laneway. A copy of the left-turn storage lane graph is included in
Appendix B. Based on the peak hour volumes the MTO criteria suggest a minimum storage length
of 15 metres.

A review of the existing traffic volumes at the Somerset/Breezehill intersection shows that a
westbound left turn lane is currently warranted without the addition of site traffic. A left turn lane
was not implemented as part of the recent Somerset Street reconstruction project.

Within the study area Somerset Street has a right of way (ROW) of approximately 20 metres and
consists of a four lane undivided arterial roadway with a width of approximately 14 metres and
concrete sidewalks on both sides. Since this section of Somerset Street is not under ROW
protection according to Annex 1 of the City of Ottawa Official Plan there is insufficient space to
create a westbound left-turn lane at the laneway and Breezehill Avenue.

Collision records will be obtained and reviewed as part of the Transportation Brief.

While the above results do not indicate a need for traffic signal control at Somerset Street and
Breezehill Avenue, the MTO criteria for traffic signal control was reviewed to determine the extent
to which the warrants are met. The calculations were performed for both the existing and build-out
conditions. Average Hourly Volumes (AHV) were estimated for the future condition by dividing the
sum of the projected AM and PM peak hour volumes by four. The results show that warrants are far
from being met under existing and future conditions. A copy of the calculations is included in
Appendix B.

4.0       Proposed Access

Sight distance analysis has been completed for the intersection of Somerset Street and the
laneway using standards outlined in the TAC Geometric Design Guide. The guidelines outline
minimum requirements for stopping sight distance (SSD) and turning sight distance (TSD).

Field measurements have been conducted to confirm the available SSD for westbound vehicles
coming over the O-Train overpass and TSD for vehicles exiting left out of the laneway.

The minimum SSD required along Somerset is 105 metres. A SSD of 135 metres is currently
provided for westbound vehicles approaching the Somerset/laneway intersection, which exceeds
the minimum requirement. The minimum sight distance required to turn left onto Somerset Street
from the laneway is approximately 180 metres. A TSD of 150 metres is currently provided. As
noted previously, collision data will be reviewed as part of the Transportation Brief to determine if
there are any historical safety concerns at the laneway.

5.0       Neighbourhood Infiltration

Concerns have been raised by members of the public regarding the potential for site traffic to travel
south on the laneway to Laurel or Gladstone rather than access the site via Somerset. The
concerns were specifically with respect to children who currently use the laneway to access the
Devonshire Public School.

Based on the results of the capacity analysis, we recommend signage prohibiting the left turn
movement out of the proposed parking garage and monitoring of the laneway following occupancy
to determine if cut-through traffic is a problem. Possible mitigation measures to resolve the issue
could include blocking the laneway south of the site.

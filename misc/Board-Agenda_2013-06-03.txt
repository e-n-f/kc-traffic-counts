SUBJECT:       Adoption of Amendment to Section 16-20 of the Delta Township Code of
               Ordinances


As we discussed at the May 20, 2013 Township Board meeting, in order for us to comply
with the Michigan Fireworks Safety Act, we need to adopt the provisions of the Fire
Code addressing the sale of fireworks to comply with the Michigan Fireworks Safety Act.

Therefore, I offer the following for your consideration:

"I move that the Township Board adopt an amendment to Section 16-20 of the
Delta Township Code of Ordinances. The proposed adoption would amend
provisions to the Fire Code addressing the sale of fireworks to comply with the
Michigan Fireworks Safety Act.

Further, the Township Clerk is hereby directed to publish a notice of adoption of
the amendments in local newspapers and the amendments shall become effective
upon publication."

SUBJECT:       Adopt Amendment to Section 14-114 of the Delta Township Code of
               Ordinances


As we discussed at the May 20, 2013 Township Board meeting, in order for us to comply
with the Michigan Fireworks Safety Act, we need to adopt some definitions of section 14-
114 of the Delta Township Code of Ordinances.

Therefore, I offer the following for your consideration:

"I move that the Township Board adopt an amendment to Section 14-114 of the
Delta Township Code of Ordinances. The adopted amendment would correct the
definitions in said section to comply with the Michigan Fireworks Safety Act.

Further, the Township Clerk is hereby directed to publish a notice of adoption of
the amendments in local newspapers and the amendments shall
become effective upon publication."

VIII.   PUBLIC COMMENTS FOR ITEMS NOT ON AGENDA

        Alan Lewis, 905 Garfield Ave., said he had experienced a problem with outdoor
        burning in his neighborhood which necessitated him having to close his windows
        because his house was filling up with smoke. Mr. Lewis indicated that when he
        called the Fire Department to inquire about burning regulations, he was told to call
        911. Mr. Lewis didn't feel that 911 was the appropriate measure to take due to the
        fact that it wasn't an emergency, but rather a nuisance call and he wanted to bring
        this matter to the Board's attention.

        Supervisor Fletcher indicated that he would have staff look into this situation. Mr.
        Watkins stated a run number from 911 is required for all reports.

        Mr. Lewis spoke to the Board about the nuisance loud car stereos had become and
        how this issue could be policed.

     Supervisor Fletcher said the Township would look into this matter and thanked Mr.
     Lewis for bringing this matter to the Board's attention.

     Nicole Schuiling, 4513 Cranberry Ct., said she was here with her family because they
     had received an enforcement letter from the Township informing them that they were
     not allowed to keep their pot belly pig as a pet. Ms. Schuiling noted that this had
     been very hard on her family and that she brought some pictures with her this
     evening so that the Board could see the type of pet their pot belly pig was. She noted
     that their pot belly pig wasn't a farm hog or livestock living in their yard, but rather he
     lived in their home. Ms. Schuiling said the letter had indicated that livestock animals
     were not permitted to be kept in residential areas, but she explained to the Board that
     he wasn't livestock, but rather he was their pet and she provided the Board with a
     letter from the US Department of Agriculture which defined pot belly pigs as pets and
     not livestock. Ms. Schuiling pointed out that most of the Township's ordinances were
     written prior to 1995 which was before pot belly pigs were introduced into the United
     States. She felt the ordinance was written for farm pigs which was very different from
     pot belly pigs.

     Ms. Schuiling explained that pot belly pigs had been accepted as pets by the US
     Department of Agriculture, the Delta Society Pet Partner Program, Life Magazine,
     Governors of Pennsylvania and Florida, numerous hospitals and nursing homes,
     special need schools, adult day care centers, as well as recognized as companion
     pets in numerous cities all over the United States. Ms. Schuiling stated that pot belly
     pigs were very intelligent animals and very clean animals. She indicated that their
     pot belly pig spent 99% of his time inside their home and when he was outside, it was
     within their fenced in yard on a leash. Ms. Schuiling stated that she had letters from
     all of her neighbors who were very fond of their pet and who were all surprised that
     this had become an issue. Ms. Schuiling pointed out that there were over one million
     pot belly pigs all over the United States. She wasn't asking the Township to amend
     their ordinance, but to accept pot belly pigs as pets and not livestock because this
     situation would come up again in the future.

     Trustee Kosinski said during his research on this matter, he felt the language
     contained in the Zoning Ordinance not only defined pets as cats, dogs, and birds, but
     other animals that were generally regarded as pets. Mr. Kosinski said his search on
     Google revealed hundreds of sites on the issue of pot belly pigs as domesticated pets
     and not farm animals. Mr. Kosinski didn't feel an amendment to the Zoning
     Ordinance was necessary because pot belly pigs were encompassed by the existing
     language.

     Trustee Mojica said she would like to review the materials Ms. Schuiling had provided
     the Board with this evening.

      Community Development Director Mark Graham pointed out that the Board did not
      have the authority to interpret the ordinance and that this matter could be referred to
      the Zoning Board of Appeals for an interpretation.

IX.   INTRODUCTION OF ORDINANCES

XV.    MANAGER'S REPORT

       Township Manager Watkins informed the Board of the following:

               The portable speed sign the Township purchased was providing very good
               data that cold be used in the future for traffic calming purposes.

               The Broadbent Road water main project started today.

               There were two vacancies in the Fire Department that would have to be filled
               for the positions of Assistant Fire Chief and Township Fire Inspector.

               The Township was served with a complaint from Kelly Johnson in Circuit Court
               seeking to reverse the decision by the Board to deny her request for a home
               occupation for dog grooming.

XVI.   COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

       12. Finance Update ­ Jeff Anderson

           Finance Director Jeff Anderson provided the Board with an overview of the 2013
           Citizens Guide to Delta Township's Financial Health which was a report that
           provided specifics on the Township's expenditures and revenues in an easy to
           read format for better understanding by the residents. The Citizens Guide has
           been placed on the Township's website in order to make financial information
           more accessible to Delta's residents. Mr. Anderson also provided the Board with
           an update on the Looking Glass Regional Fire Authority Agreement audit report,
           as well as a brief review of the Township's General Fund Balance and committed
           assigned and unassigned fund balance data. Mr. Anderson noted that the
           Township's General Fund had been very consistent with budgeted projections.

     13. 2013-2014 Water System Improvements Bond Discussion ­ Richard Watkins

        Mr. Watkins said as the Township paid off older bond issues, discussions had
        taken place regarding new bond issues for this years water construction projects,
        as well as next years projects. Mr. Watkins noted that as he and Mr. Anderson
        researched different rates and spoke to financial advisors, they found that
        competitive negotiated sale of bonds was the preferred method of sale throughout
        the State in that it was a more simplified process and more cost effective than
        going out for competitive bids. Mr. Watkins explained the benefits of using a
        competitive negotiated sale and the fact that he would like to move forward and
        bring a bond resolution to the Board for funding of this years projects, as well as
        next year's projects. An interest rate of 2% or less is anticipated.

        A bond resolution would be placed on the next Board agenda.

     14. Tent Displays ­ Mark Graham

        Mr. Graham informed the Board that staff had been receiving complaints from
        merchants and citizens regarding the display of tents in front of stores. He noted
        that the Fire Department mandated a permit for tents 200+ square feet for safety
        reasons, but at the present time, the Township didn't have any regulations
        governing display tents. Mr. Graham highlighted a few suggestions contained in
        his May 13th memo to the Board as to how tents could be regulated and the pros
        and cons of regulating display tents on commercial properties.

        It was the consensus of the Board to place this item on a future Committee of the
        Whole agenda for further discussion.

     15. Ancillary Services & Equipment Front Setback Requirements ­ Mark Graham

        Mr. Graham provided the Board with background information regarding the
        emerging trend of car wash facilities installing vacuums and other appurtenances
        within the front setback area of their site to entice business. It was noted that
        vacuums and other appurtenances were ancillary uses of a car wash that were
        allowed on-site, but they had always been installed towards the back of a site.
        Mr. Graham noted that in order to maintain the aesthetics of the Township's
        commercial corridors, staff was recommending that the Board consider adopting
        amendments to the Zoning Ordinance that would not allow these types of services
        within the front setback area.

        It was the consensus of the Board to move forward with proposed amendments
        regulating ancillary services and equipment within the front setback area.

work, plus 70% to cover fringes, transportation, equipment and administrative overhead costs. Above
said work by the Township Engineering Division is estimated to cost $3,111.24: as much as 20%
increase is estimated if part of the work is performed during the period of November through April.
         6.    That the construction shall not commence until the Township Engineer shall have given
written authorization to the Developer. Prior to starting construction work Developer shall have:
               A.     caused his contractor to furnish certificates of insurance noting Delta as an
                      additional insured (see General Specifications of Installation Standards).

               B.     bulkhead the existing sanitary sewer main at a location and in the manner
                      approved by the Township Engineer to preclude storm water getting into the
                      sanitary sewer system.

               C.     conducted the pre-construction meeting (See General Specifications of
                      Installation Standards).

               D.     caused his contractor to have obtained proper permits from the Road Commission
                      and the other governmental agencies as may be applicable and to have notified the
                      MISS DIG program.

     7.       It is agreed between the parties that the Township Engineer shall have jurisdiction and
   control of the water valves in Delta's existing water mains and that any time the water valves must
   be turned on or off in order to facilitate the construction of the new water main, same shall be done
   under the jurisdiction or representatives of the Township Engineer. Water meters shall not be
   installed until after the Township Engineer has certified the satisfactory completion of the work;
   however, at the sole discretion of the Township, temporary meters may be installed at the expense of
   the Developer for water to be used in the construction of a building, said temporary water meter to
   be installed by Delta's Water Department personnel only after the pressure testing and "safe" water
   sampling is complete and with the affirmation of the Township Engineer. If temporary meters are
   permitted by the Township, the Developer shall be liable for any damage or loss which is incurred
   due to the Developer's use of the Township water system. The Township Engineer shall not draw
   the "safe" water sample prior to satisfactory completion of that portion of the public sanitary sewer
   and water systems serving the same buildable parcels of land.
    8.         That the Township Engineer shall certify the satisfactory completion of the work
provided for hereunder; said certificate shall be filed with the Township Clerk. The following items, as
applicable, shall be completed before final certification can be made:
               A.     A satisfactory high pressure hydrostatic testing of the water main shall be made.


                                          4 of 9
                                                   57 of 156
                B.      Receipt of tests of water taken from the water main showing same to have been
                        tested "safe" by the Michigan Department of Public Health.

                C.      A satisfactory low pressure air test per standards set by the Nation Clay Pipe
                        institute, on the sanitary sewer mains shall be made.

                D.      Developer shall insure clean-up of construction site within the road right-of-way.

                E.      Developer shall deliver a deed of grant from Developer to Delta covering all of
                        the in-ground installation which is to be owned by Delta.

                F.      Waivers of lien on the project shall be filed with the Township Engineer.

                G.      Easement grants, suitable for recording, granting to Delta access to the utility
                        mains to be owned by Delta for construction, operation and maintenance
                        purposes, including the right to make future hook-ups or connections to any of
                        said lines shall have been delivered for such mains not constructed in public
                        roadways.

     9.         That no permits for the use of any utilities shall be either requested or issued until after
the facilities which are to become the property of Delta have been certified as satisfactorily complete by
the Township Engineer and the proper deeds of grant, waivers of lien and easement agreements are
provided to the Township in accordance with the requirements of Paragraph 8 above. In the event of a
violation of this paragraph, the Township may without notice or liability to the Developer, disconnect
the facilities and/or take any other action necessary to prevent the flowage of sanitary sewage into the
public sewer system and/or the flowage of water into the facilities constructed pursuant to this
Agreement. The Developer shall pay all costs, including actual attorney's fees, which the Township
incurs in enforcing the provisions of this paragraph.
     10.        It is further agreed by the parties that no building shall be occupied nor an occupancy
permit be issued until after an access road shall be completed to assure access by Delta's fire department
apparatus and the Township Engineer has certified to the satisfactory completion of the work.
     11.        Delta agrees that when certification of final approval has been made by the Township
Engineer, subject to a final financial accounting and any other applicable considerations which may
arise, the Board of Delta shall accept the certain facilities which are to be a part of Delta's water and/or
sanitary sewer systems.

     12.          That Developer guarantees the materials and workmanship in the facilities for a period of
not more than two (2) years from the date of partial utilization, but at least one (1) year from the date of
final acceptance of said facilities by the Township Board.
     13.          Developer shall, upon completion of construction of the water and/or sewer mains, certify
as to the costs of materials, labor, equipment, engineering and administrative overhead to the Township
Engineer so that Delta may capitalize donated assets.
     14.          Except as provided in Sections 18-98 and 18-300 of the Township Code of Ordinances,
main charges shall not be levied on the facilities to be constructed under this agreement.
     15.          That the Developer shall indemnify and hold harmless, Delta and its agents and
employees from and against any and all claims for damage or losses and expenses arising out of or
reasonably incidental to construction, installation and/or hook-up operations, irrespective of ownership
or control or the specific location of damage or system component involved, to the extent caused by
Developer's negligence or intentional misconduct.

years. The Township shall have the sole authority to determine what future connections come within the
provisions of this paragraph. Total rebates shall not exceed the actual cost of construction abutting
Third Parties property. The Developer shall not contract with, or otherwise exact any fee from, any third
party who desires to connect to, and/or make any addition to the public water and/or sewer system.
     17.          This Agreement shall expire seven (7) years from the first said date and may be amended
or extended at any time upon mutual consent of the parties.
     18.          Partial Invalidity. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any manner, the remaining provisions of the
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated in
any way. In addition, if any provision of this Agreement may be modified by a court of competent
jurisdiction such that is may be enforced, then said provision shall be modified and, as modified, shall be

DATE:                  May 28, 2013

SUBJECT:               Sponsorship and Referral of Proposed Zoning Ordinance Amendments
                       Pertaining to Ancillary Services & Equipment Front Setback Prohibition for
                       Automobile Service & Repair, Car Wash, Commercial Garage, Commercial
                       Fueling Station, and Truck Repair Establishments. Case No. 5-13-10

There appears to be an emerging trend regarding the placement of vacuums and other appurtenances
related to car washes, gas stations, etc. in the front setback area that are designed to serve as an
attractive device to entice customers to patronize these business. In essence, it almost acts as a form
of additional business identification beyond the traditional signage governed by the Township's sign
ordinance.

In order to maintain the and improve the aesthetics of the Township's commercial corridors, staff is
recommending that the Township Board consider adopting amendments to the Zoning Ordinance
that would address this new trend. Attached please find the language staff proposes to add to the
respective Special Land Use Permit requirements that regulate the applicable auto-related
establishments in the commercial and industrial zoning districts. The same language will be added
to requirements listed under each use to maintain consistency.

Staff has researched dozens ordinances across the country to determine if other communities have
adopted a similar approach. What we have found is that most specify setbacks for fuel pump islands,
but exempt ancillary uses from these requirements. Delta would appear to be somewhat in the
minority if the proposed amendments were adopted.

The proposed amendments were discussed at the Board's May 20, 2013 Committee of the Whole
meeting and it was the Board's consensus to proceed with the adoption process. The amendments
are being placed on the Board's June 3, 2013 regular meeting agenda for formal sponsorship and
referral to the Planning Commission for the purposes of holding a public hearing and making a
recommendation to the Board. The following motion is offered for the Board's consideration:

       "I move that the Delta Township Board sponsor proposed Zoning Ordinance text
       amendments prepared by staff pertaining to Ancillary Services & Equipment Front
       Setback Prohibition for Automobile Service & Repair, Car Wash, Commercial
       Garage, Commercial Fueling Station, and Truck Repair Establishments, as described
       in Case No. 5-13-10; and refer the proposed amendments to the Planning

                             County of Eaton, State of Michigan

             RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING ISSUANCE AND SALE OF
       GENERAL OBLIGATION CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS, SERIES 2013

A RESOLUTION TO PROVIDE FOR:
· Issuance of $4,000,000 of General Obligation Capital Improvement Bonds to
   replace water mains throughout the Township;
· Township pledge of full faith and credit for the payment of the Bonds;
· Delegation of Sale of Bonds without further approval of Township Board;
· Other matters necessary to prepare for sale and delivery of Bonds.

                                         PREAMBLE

       WHEREAS, the Charter Township of Delta, County of Eaton, Michigan (the
"Township") has determined that it is necessary for the public health, safety and welfare of the
Township to replace water mains throughout the Township together with any appurtenances and
attachments thereto and any related site improvements (collectively, the "Capital
Improvements"); and

       WHEREAS, under the provisions of Section 517 of the Revised Municipal Finance Act,
Act No. 34, Public Acts of Michigan, 2001, as amended ("Act 34") a Township may issue
municipal securities to pay the cost of any capital improvement items within the limitations
provided by law; and

         WHEREAS, the issuance by the Township of bonds under Section 517 of Act 34 in the
amount of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the "Bonds") for the purpose of financing costs of
acquisition and construction of the Capital Improvements appears to be the most practical means
to that end; and

       WHEREAS, a Notice to Electors of the Township of intent to issue the Bonds to finance
the Capital Improvements and right of referendum thereon was published in accordance with
Act 34, the 45 day referendum period described in the Notice to Electors has been completed,
and no petitions for referendum were filed with the Township Clerk; and

        WHEREAS, the Township Board wishes to authorize either the Township Manager or
the Township Finance Director (either, an "Authorized Officer") to sell and deliver and receive
payment for the proposed issue of bonds without the necessity of the Township Board taking
further action prior to sale and delivery of the bonds.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT:

       1.     Bonds of the Township designated as the GENERAL OBLIGATION CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT BONDS, SERIES 2013 (the "Bonds") are authorized to be issued in the
aggregate principal sum of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) for the purpose of paying all or




                                            68 of 156
part of the costs of acquiring and constructing the Capital Improvements, including the costs
incidental to the issuance, sale and delivery of the Bonds.

        The Bonds shall mature serially (or be subject to mandatory redemption if term bonds are
issued) on April 1 of each year, as follows:

              PRINCIPAL                            PRINCIPAL                        PRINCIPAL
    YEAR       AMOUNT                 YEAR          AMOUNT                YEAR       AMOUNT
      2014       $350,000               2018           $ 400,000            2021       $ 400,000
      2015        350,000               2019             400,000            2022         450,000
      2016        400,000               2020             400,000            2023         450,000
      2017        400,000

        The Authorized Officer may revise the maturity dates and amounts of the Bonds at the
time of sale of the Bonds, provided that the date of the final maturity shall not be later than ten
(10) years from the date of delivery of the Bonds. The Bonds shall consist of bonds in fully-
registered form of the denomination of $5,000, or integral multiples thereof not exceeding for
each maturity the maximum principal amount of that maturity, numbered as determined by the
Transfer Agent (as hereinafter defined). The Bonds shall bear interest at the rates determined
upon sale of the Bonds but in any event not to exceed 5.00% per annum. The Bonds shall be
dated as of the date of delivery thereof or such other date as shall be determined by the
Authorized Officer at the time of sale of the Bonds. The Bonds may be issued without option of
redemption prior to maturity or shall be subject to mandatory and/or optional redemption prior to
maturity as determined by the Authorized Officer at the time of sale of the Bonds.

        The Bonds may be issued in book-entry only form through The Depository Trust
Company in New York, New York ("DTC") and the Authorized Officer is authorized to execute
such custodial or other agreement with DTC as may be necessary to accomplish the issuance of
the Bonds in book-entry only form, and to make such changes in the form of the Bonds within
the parameters of this resolution as may be required to accomplish the foregoing.

        Interest on the Bonds shall be payable to the registered owner of record as of the 15th day
of the month prior to the payment date for each interest payment. The record date of
determination of registered owner for purposes of payment of interest as provided in this
paragraph may be changed by the Township to conform to market practice in the future. Interest
shall be payable by check or draft drawn on the Transfer Agent mailed to the registered owner at
the registered address, as shown on the registration books of the Township maintained by the
Transfer Agent. The principal of the Bonds shall be payable upon presentation and surrender of
such Bonds to the Transfer Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Bonds are held in book-
entry form by DTC, payment shall be made in the manner prescribed by DTC.

        The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, Detroit, Michigan, or such other bank or
trust company to be designated by the Authorized Officer as registrar and transfer agent for the
Bonds, is hereby appointed to act as bond registrar, paying agent and transfer agent (the
"Transfer Agent") for the Bonds; provided, however, in consultation with the initial purchaser of
the Bonds the Authorized Officer may appoint the City Treasurer as Transfer Agent. The
Authorized Officer is hereby authorized to execute one or more agreements with the Transfer


                                               69 of 156
Agent on behalf of the Township. The Township reserves the right to replace the Transfer Agent
at any time, provided written notice of such replacement is given to the registered owners of
record of the Bonds not less than sixty (60) days prior to an interest payment date.

        2.     The Bonds of this issue shall be executed in the name of the Township with the
manual or facsimile signatures of the Supervisor and the Township Clerk, and the corporate seal
of the Township shall be manually impressed or a facsimile thereof shall be printed on the
Bonds. No Bond shall be valid until authenticated by an authorized representative of the
Transfer Agent unless the purchaser thereof does not require the Bonds to be authenticated. If
the Bonds are not authenticated, then at least one signature on the Bonds shall be a manual
signature. If the Bonds are not held in book-entry form then executed blank bonds for
registration and issuance to transferees shall, as necessary, be delivered to the Transfer Agent for
safekeeping.

        3.     The Transfer Agent shall keep the books of registration for this issue on behalf of
the Township. Any Bond may be transferred upon such registration books by the registered
owner of record, in person or by the registered owner's duly authorized attorney, upon surrender
of the Bond for cancellation, accompanied by delivery of a duly executed written instrument of
transfer in a form approved by the Transfer Agent. Whenever any Bond or Bonds shall be
surrendered for transfer, the Township shall execute and the Transfer Agent shall authenticate
and deliver a new Bond or Bonds, for like aggregate principal amount. The Transfer Agent shall
require the payment by the bondholder requesting the transfer of any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with respect to the transfer.

        If the Bonds are subject to mandatory or optional redemption prior to maturity then when
the Township calls bonds for redemption prior to maturity the Transfer Agent shall give official
notice of redemption on behalf of the Township unless receipt of notice is waived by any
registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed. Such notice shall be dated and shall contain at a
minimum the following information: original issue date; maturity dates; interest rates; CUSIP
numbers, if any; certificate numbers (and in the case of partial redemption) the called amounts of
each certificate; the place where the Bonds called for redemption are to be surrendered for
payment; and that interest on the Bonds or portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to
accrue from and after the redemption date. In addition, further notice shall be given by the
Transfer Agent in such manner as may be required or suggested by regulations or market
practice at the applicable time, but no defect in such further notice nor any failure to give all or
any portion of such further notice shall in any manner defeat the effectiveness of a call for
redemption if notice thereof is given as prescribed herein.

        4.     The Township intends to pay the principal and interest of the Bonds from water
system rates and charges and other revenues received by the Township from the operations of the
Township's water supply system. In the event of the insufficiency of water system revenues, the
Township expressly and irrevocably pledges its full faith and credit for the prompt and timely
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Bonds shall be payable, as a first
budget obligation, from the general fund of the Township, and the Township shall levy annually
ad valorem taxes on all the taxable property in the Township which, taking into consideration
estimated delinquencies in tax collections, shall be fully sufficient to pay the principal and
interest on the Bonds provided, however, that if at the time of making any such tax levy there



                                              70 of 156
shall be other legally available funds, such as water system revenues, for the payment of
principal of and interest on the Bonds, then credit therefor may be taken against the levy for
payment of the Bonds. The levy shall be subject to constitutional and statutory tax rate
limitations.

        5.      The Township Treasurer is authorized and directed to create a fund designated as
the GENERAL OBLIGATION CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS, SERIES 2013 DEBT
RETIREMENT FUND (the "Debt Retirement Fund"). The Debt Retirement Fund may be
pooled or combined with other debt retirement funds for issues of bonds of like character as
provided by Act 34 or other state law. An amount sufficient to assure timely payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds shall be transferred each year into the Debt Retirement
Fund from funds legally available therefor, including the general fund of the Township. The
moneys deposited in the fund shall be used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of and
interest on the Bonds and, as may be necessary, to rebate arbitrage earnings, if any, to the United
States Department of Treasury as required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The accrued interest and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds shall also be
deposited in the Debt Retirement Fund.

        In the event a deposit of trust is made of cash or direct obligations of the United States or
obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States, or a
combination thereof, the principal of and interest on which, without reinvestment, come due at
times and in amounts sufficient to pay at maturity or irrevocable call for earlier optional or
mandatory redemption, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, this
Resolution shall be defeased and the owners of the Bonds shall have no further rights under this
Resolution except to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest of the
Bonds from the cash or securities deposited in trust and the interest and gains thereon and to
transfer and exchange Bonds as provided herein.

        6.      The Township Treasurer is authorized and directed to create a fund designated as
the GENERAL OBLIGATION CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS, SERIES 2013
CONSTRUCTION FUND (the "Construction Fund"). The Township Treasurer shall deposit the
proceeds of the Bonds into the Construction Fund, less accrued interest and premium, if any,
which shall be deposited into the Debt Retirement Fund. The moneys in the Construction Fund
shall be used to pay the costs of the Capital Improvements and to pay the costs of issuance of the
Bonds. Moneys remaining in the Construction Fund after completion of the Capital
Improvements may be used for any purpose permitted by law.

       7.     The Bonds shall be in substantially the following form with such revisions,
additions and deletions as may be advisable or necessary to comply with the final terms of the
Bonds established upon sale thereof:

"Township"), acknowledges itself to owe and for value received, hereby promises to pay to the
Registered Owner specified above, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount specified above,
in lawful money of the United States of America, on the Date of Maturity specified above, with
interest thereon (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) from the
Date of Original Issue specified above or such later date to which interest has been paid, until

sixty (60) days prior to any interest payment date (the "Transfer Agent"). Interest on this bond is
payable by check or draft mailed by the Transfer Agent to the person or entity who or which is as

of record, at the registered address.

        This bond is one of a series of bonds of even Date of Original Issue aggregating the
principal sum of $4,000,000, issued for the purpose of paying costs to replace water mains
throughout the Township together with any appurtenances and attachments thereto and any
related site improvements under and in pursuance of the provisions of Act 34, Public Acts of
Michigan, 2001, as amended, and a resolution of the Township Board adopted on [date].

        The limited tax full faith, credit and resources of the Township are pledged for the
payment of the bonds of this issue, and the Township has pledged that it shall pay the principal
of and interest on the bonds of this issue as they mature as a first budget obligation from its
general fund and, after taking into account funds which the Township may have legally available
for payment of principal of and interest on the bonds of this issue, shall levy annually ad valorem
taxes on all taxable property in the Township sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the
bonds of this issue subject to applicable constitutional and statutory tax rate limitations.

                                     if Term Bonds are issued]

        Any bond may be transferred by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or
by the registered owner's duly authorized attorney or legal representative, upon surrender of the
bond to the Transfer Agent for cancellation, together with a duly executed written instrument of
transfer in a form approved by the Transfer Agent. Whenever any bond is surrendered for
transfer, the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver a new bond or bonds, in like aggregate
principal amount, interest rate and maturity. The Transfer Agent shall require the bondholder
requesting the transfer to pay any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with
respect to the transfer.

         It is hereby certified and recited that all acts, conditions and things required by law to be
done, exist and happen, precedent to and in the issuance of this bond and the series of bonds of
which this is one, in order to make them valid and binding obligations of the Township have

this is one, does not exceed any constitutional or statutory debt limitation.

of Authentication on this bond has been executed by the Transfer Agent.

proceeds of the Bonds pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
in such a manner as to cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of the Code.
The Township hereby covenants that, to the extent permitted by law, it shall take all actions
within its control and that it shall not fail to take any action necessary to maintain the exclusion
of the interest on the Bonds from adjusted gross income for general federal income tax purposes
under the Code, including, but not limited to, actions relating to the rebate of arbitrage earnings,
if applicable, and the expenditure of investment of Bond proceeds and moneys deemed to be
Bond proceeds, all as more fully set forth in the Non-Arbitrage and Tax Compliance Certificate
to be delivered by the Township with respect to the Bonds.

        9.     The Township hereby designates the Bonds as "qualified tax exempt obligations"
for purposes of deduction of interest expense by financial institutions pursuant to the Code.

        10.    The estimated period of usefulness of the Capital Improvements to be constructed
and acquired with proceeds of the Bonds is hereby declared to be not less than 10 years. The
Township shall not issue the Bonds in an amount greater than the estimated total cost of
acquiring and constructing the Capital Improvements, including costs incidental to the issuance,
sale and delivery of the Bonds.

        11.    If the Authorized Officer determines, in consultation with Bendzinski & Co.,
Municipal Finance Advisors (the "Financial Advisor") that it is in the best interests of the
Township to sell the Bonds by competitive sale, then the Authorized Officer shall fix a date of
sale for the Bonds and publish a Notice of Sale of the Bonds in The Bond Buyer, New York,
New York, or such other newspaper as may fulfill the requirements of Act 34. If the Bonds are
sold by competitive sale, then the Authorized Officer is hereby authorized on behalf of the
Township, subject to the provisions and limitations of this Resolution, to award sale of the Bonds
to the bidder whose bid produces the lowest interest cost computed in compliance with the terms
of the Notice of Sale as published if such bid complies with the limitations contained in this
Resolution.

        12.    If the Authorized Officer determines, in consultation with the Financial Advisor,
that the Township will reduce costs of issuance without a significant increase in interest expense
if the Township negotiates sale of the Bonds to a financial institution or other sophisticated
purchaser of municipal debt, then it is determined to be in the best interests of the Township to
negotiate the sale of the Bonds, and the Authorized Officer is hereby authorized and directed on
behalf of the Township to negotiate sale of the Bonds to a bank or financial institution or other
sophisticated purchaser of municipal debt subject to the provisions and limitations of this
Resolution.

        13.    If the Financial Advisor recommends that the Township apply for ratings on the
Bonds, then the Authorized Officer is authorized to apply for one or more ratings on the Bonds
as shall be recommended by the Financial Advisor. If the Financial Advisor recommends that
the Township consider purchase of municipal bond insurance, or consider qualification for
approval for municipal bond insurance, then the Authorized Officer is hereby authorized and
directed to apply for municipal bond insurance, to negotiate with insurers regarding acquisition

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of converting Elmwood Road between Mall
Drive and Willow Highway from the existing 4-lane cross section to a 3-lane cross section in
Delta Charter Township, Eaton County, Michigan.

Delta Charter Township has constructed a two mile pathway for walking and biking, which is
located approximately one-half mile north of Saginaw Highway (M-43) and connects Canal
Road and Elmwood Road, and the Township preparing to extend this pathway east from
Elmwood Road to Maycroft Road. As part of the pathway extension to Maycroft Road, the
Township would like to have a paved bike path on Elmwood Road between the Sharp Park
Driveway and Willow Highway.

The Eaton County Road Commission (ECRC) is preparing to mill and repave Elmwood Road
between Saginaw Highway (M-43) and Willow Highway in the summer of 2013. Currently
Elmwood Road is marked as a 4-lane roadway between the Sharp Park Driveway (across
from the Delta Township Library) to Willow Highway. Between the Sharp Park Driveway
and Saginaw Highway (M-43), Elmwood Road is marked as a 5-lane roadway with a center
left turn lane.

Delta Charter Township is requesting the ECRC to stripe Elmwood Road as a 3-lane roadway
with bike paths on both sides between the Sharp Park Driveway and Willow Highway when
the milling and repaving is completed. The southern end of Elmwood Road from Sharp Park
to Saginaw Highway (M-43) would remain as a 5-lane roadway.




                                         79 of 156
SCOPE OF WORK

The purpose of this traffic analysis is to determine the difference between the level of service
and vehicle delay at the intersection of Willow Highway and Elmwood Road. The cross
section at the intersection of Elmwood Road and Mall Drive will not be changed; it will
remain a 5-lane roadway.

The traffic analysis is limited to the following items:

   ·   Evaluation of the capacity analysis between the existing cross section and the
       proposed cross section at the Willow Highway and Elmwood Road intersection to
       determine the future level of service (LOS) and vehicle delay.

   ·   Determination of what roadway and traffic control improvements, if any, will be
       needed to accommodate future traffic volumes.

ROADWAYS AND INTERSECTIONS

Roadway
Elmwood Road is a 4-lane paved road between the Sharp Park Driveway and Willow
Highway, and is under the jurisdiction of the Eaton County Road Commission (ECRC).
Elmwood Road runs north to south with a posted speed limit of 40 MPH. There is concrete
curb and gutter and sidewalks on both sides.

Intersections
The intersection of Elmwood Road and Willow Highway is a four-way intersection and the
traffic control is fully actuated traffic signal. The north approach is a 2-lane unmarked
subdivision street; the south approach is four lanes with one (1) exclusive right turn lane, one
(1) left-thru lane and two (2) outbound lanes; the east approach is three lanes with one (1)
exclusive left turn lane, one (1) thru-right lane and one (1) outbound lane; the west approach
is four lanes with one (1) exclusive right turn lane, one (1) thru lane, one (1) exclusive left
turn lane and one (1) outbound lane.

The intersection has pedestrian crossings and push buttons for only two (2) approaches, the
west approach and the south approach. There are sidewalks on the north and south side of
Willow Highway, west of Elmwood Road, and there is a sidewalk on the west side of
Elmwood Road, south of Willow Highway. Willow Highway has a marked bike path on the
north and south side, west of Elmwood Road; there are no bike paths on Willow Highway east
of Elmwood Road.


LAND USE

Elmwood Road between the Sharp Park Driveway and Willow Highway is primarily
residential with an elementary school located on the west side of Elmwood Drive, south of
Willow Highway.


EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES

TEA, Inc. conducted a vehicle turning movement survey on Tuesday, April 30, 2013, at
Elmwood Road and Willow Highway, and also at Elmwood Road and Mall Drive. Counts
were taken during the morning between 7:00 and 9:00 AM and again in the afternoon between
4:00 and 6:00 PM.

The weekday AM and PM peak hour of existing traffic on the adjoining road system is 7:30 to
8:30 AM and 4:45 to 5:45 PM respectively. The existing peak hour volumes are illustrated in
Figure 1.

LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS EXISTING CONDITIONS

The intersection of Willow Highway and Elmwood Road was analyzed according to the
methodologies published in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual. The
analysis determines the "Level of Service" of the intersection and is based on factors such as
the number and types of lanes, signal timing, traffic volumes, pedestrian activity, etc. The
level of service (LOS) is defined by average vehicle delay in seconds created by a traffic
control device for a given traffic movement or intersection approach.


            Level of Service              Delay per Vehicle (seconds)

                                   Non-Signalized               Signalized

                   B                  10 to 15                   10 to 20
                   C                  15 to 25                   20 to 35
                   D                  25 to 35                   35 to 55
                   E                  35 to 50                   55 to 80
                   F                   > 50                        > 80

Levels of Service are expressed in a range from "A" to "F," with "A" being the highest LOS
and "F" representing the lowest LOS. Level of service "D" is considered the minimum
acceptable LOS in an urban area.

The above table shows the thresholds for Levels of Service "A" through "F" for non-
signalized and signalized intersections, respectively.

Level of Service computations contained in this report was based upon the Synchro 8
software which is approved for use by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).
Delay per vehicle includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and
final acceleration delay.

The existing level of service analysis (4-lane roadway) for the traffic at the Elmwood Road
and Willow Highway intersection during the morning peak hour and the afternoon peak hour
is summarized in Table 1.

All movements under existing conditions are expected to operate at an acceptable level of
service (LOS D) or better at the intersection of Elmwood Road and Willow Highway. The
longest queue exists for the northbound left-thru turn movement is 211 feet, and assuming one
(1) vehicle equals 20 feet, the queue length is approximately 10 vehicles.

ROAD DIET

A "road diet" entails converting a 4-lane undivided roadway to a 2-lane roadway, plus a two-
way center left turn lane, by removing a travel lane in each direction. The remaining roadway
width can be converted to bike lanes, on-street parking or sidewalks. In cities throughout the
world, roadways have been put on "road diets," and these improvements have generated
benefits to all modes of transportation including transit, bicyclists, pedestrians and motorists.
These benefits include reduced vehicle speeds, improved mobility and access, reduced
collisions and injuries, and improved livability and quality of life.

Past recommendations for the conversion of a 4-lane to a 3-lane road diet was an average
daily traffic volume (ADT) of approximately 17,000 vehicles per day. Current research has
shown that these conversions will work for roads with significantly higher volumes, up to
23,000 vehicles per day. Traffic volume counts from the ECRC data base show that the 24-
hour volume on Elmwood Road between Mall Drive and Willow Highway is 9,200 per day,
with 4,700 northbound and 4,500 southbound, almost an even 50/50 split. The traffic counts
were taken in 2010.

Typically, road diet conversions will operate at acceptable levels as long as the signalized
intersections do not present any operational problems. This study will focus on the
intersection of Willow Highway and Elmwood Road, a "before and after" evaluation of the
level of service, vehicle delays and vehicle queues.




                                           87 of 156
LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS WITH ROAD DIET

Currently under the existing 4-lane cross section, the south approach at the intersection of
Elmwood Road and Willow Highway consists of four (4) lanes; one (1) exclusive right turn
lane, one (1) left-thru lane and two (2) outbound lanes. With the proposed new 3-lane cross
section, the south approach at the intersection of Elmwood Road and Willow Highway will
consist of three (3) lanes; one (1) exclusive left turn lane, one (1) thru-right lane and one (1)
outbound lane. The future level of service analysis (3-lane roadway) for the traffic along the
Elmwood Road corridor during the morning peak hour and the afternoon peak hour is
summarized in Table 2.

Although the proposed road diet lane change will not affect the intersection of Elmwood Road
and Mall Drive, the level of service and vehicle delay are expected to continue to operate at a
good level of service (LOS C) or better.

The traffic signal evaluation of this intersection compared the existing lane assignments for
the 4-lane cross section to the proposed lane assignments for the 3-lane cross section. The
changes in the level of service and the vehicle delay were very minimal. The overall
intersection level of service remained the same with an increase in the intersection vehicle
delay of 0.3 seconds for the AM peak hour and the PM peak hour intersection vehicle delay
remained the same. The longest queue for the future "road diet" configuration will be for the
northbound left turn movement, which will be 201 feet, and assuming one (1) vehicle equals
20 feet, the queue length is approximately 10 vehicles. The vehicle queues for the existing
northbound left-thru are almost identical to the future vehicle queues for the northbound
exclusive left turn lane under the future road diet configuration.

All movements under future conditions are expected to operate at an acceptable level of
service (LOS D) or better at the intersection of Elmwood Road and Willow Highway with the
proposed three-lane cross section.

The level of service stayed the same at Elmwood Road and Mall Drive between the four-lane
cross section and the proposed three-lane cross section. The laneage in all four approaches at
Elmwood Road and Mall Drive will remain the same. An analysis was conducted to
determine if the lane drop at the Library driveway would affect the northbound traffic at Mall
Drive. There was no issue with the lane drop design at Mall Drive.

ROADWAY TRANSITION

In order to transition from the existing 5-lane roadway to the proposed 3-lane roadway, a
proper lane transition must occur. The proposal is to use a "far-side intersection lane drop"
for northbound Elmwood Road between Mall Drive and the Delta Township Library
driveway.

It is approximately 500 feet between the intersection of Mall Drive and the Delta Township
Library driveway. The proposal is to convert the northbound outside lane between Mall Drive
and the Library driveway to an exclusive right turn only lane.

The distance between the Library driveway and Sharp Park Drive is approximately 200 feet,
and will be restriped as a 4-lane roadway with one (1) northbound thru lane, one (1)
northbound center left turn lane and two (2) southbound lanes. The north approach at the
intersection of Sharp Park Drive and Elmwood Road (and to the Willow Highway
intersection) will be stripped as a 3-lane roadway with one (1) northbound thru lane one (1)
southbound thru lane and one (1) center left turn lane, and bicycle paths on both sides of the
roadway. The suggested signing and sign placement distances for the northbound transition
from the 5-lane roadway to the 3-lane roadway on Elmwood Drive is shown in Figure 2.

CONCLUSIONS

The traffic analysis showed that there will be virtually no change in the intersection level of
service or vehicle delay at either the intersection of Elmwood Road and Willow
Road, and at the intersection of Elmwood Road and Mall Drive.

Recommended changes;

   ·   Change the existing 4-lane configuration at the south approach at the Elmwood Road
       and Willow Highway intersection from; one (1) exclusive right turn lane, one (1) left-
       thru lane with two (2) outbound lanes, to the following; one (1) left turn lane, one (1)
       thru-right lane and one (1) outbound lane.

   ·   Provide marked bicycle paths on both sides of Elmwood Road between Willow
       Highway and Sharp Park Drive.

   ·   Transition from the existing 5-lane cross section between Mall Drive and the Delta
       Township Library driveway to a new 5-lane cross section with an exclusive
       northbound right turn lane a the Library driveway. Provide appropriate new signing
       and pavement marking.

   ·   Transition from the existing 5-lane cross section between the Delta Township Library
       driveway and Sharp Park Drive to a 4-lane cross section in the south approach,
       providing one (1) left turn lane, one (1) thru lane and two (2) outbound lanes; and also
       providing a new 3-lane cross section in the north approach which will consist of one
       (1) left turn lane, one (1) thru lane and one (1) outbound lane.

Dear Mr. Graham:

Traffic Engineering Associates, Inc. (TEA) is pleased to provide you with the completed
analysis for comparing various methods of mid-block pedestrian crossings for the
intersection of Elmwood Road and the Sharp Park Drive in Delta Charter Township, Eaton
County, Michigan. The focus of the analysis was to determine the various types, and
estimated cost, for mid-block pedestrian crossing protection.


Project Description

The intersection of Elmwood Road and the Sharp Park Drive is approximately 700 feet
north of the existing signalized intersection of Elmwood Road and Mall Drive. It is the Delta
Township's desire as part of the Township pedestrian/ bicycle system to provide a
protected pedestrian crossing on the south side of Sharp Park Drive, aligning the
pedestrian crossing with the existing curb cuts and sidewalks on the east and west side of
Elmwood Road. TEA has investigated several methods of providing pedestrian crossing
protection. This report shows pictures of existing pedestrian crossing protection in the local
area, and other methods that are becoming widely used in Michigan, along with a cost
comparison.


Current Conditions

In 2008, a traffic analysis was conducted by Mr. William Savage in which he recommended
pavement markings and pedestrian crossing signing for the crosswalk at the Sharp Park
Drive. Currently Elmwood Road is a five-lane roadway with a center left turn lane at this
location. Mr. Savage took vehicle turning movement counts on a weekday evening
between 5:15 and 6:15 PM and the results showed that there were approximately 311
southbound vehicles and 382 northbound vehicles at the park driveway.




                                           125 of 156
TEA, Inc. conducted new turning movement counts at the Elmwood Road and Mall Drive
intersection (approximately 700 feet south of the Sharp Park Drive) and the results showed
approximately 276 southbound vehicles and 353 northbound vehicles (between 4:45 and
5:45 PM). In the five years between 2008 and 2013, the total amount of traffic on Elmwood
Drive near the Sharp Park Drive during the evening peak period has not significantly
changed.


Proposed Road Diet

Delta Charter Township has requested that the Eaton County Road Commission consider
restriping Elmwood Road between Sharp Park Drive and Willow Road from the existing
four-lane roadway to a new three-lane roadway with bike paths on both sides of Elmwood
Road. If this concept is approved and implemented, the cross section at the Elmwood
Road and Sharp Park Drive would be reduced from a five-lane roadway to a four-lane
roadway at the south side of this intersection. This would not reduce the total pedestrian
crossing distance, as the existing curb and gutter would remain the same, but it would
reduce the northbound lanes from two lanes to one lane, thus reducing the number of
lanes that a pedestrian or bicycle would need to cross.


Midblock Crossings

It is always better to have pedestrians cross a roadway at a signalized intersection with
pedestrian crossing signals; however, observation of pedestrian behavior clearly indicates
that people routinely cross at midblock locations. This is even more evident at the Sharp
Park Drive as the existing sidewalk system encourages pedestrian crossings at this
location. As mention earlier, it is approximately 700 feet between the Sharp Park Drive and
the signalized intersection at Mall Drive. Human behavior dictates that a pedestrian/
bicyclist will not travel 1,400 feet (700 feet south to Mall Drive, then 700 feet north to Sharp
Park Drive) to cross a roadway if there is any chance that they can safely cross at the mid
block location. Therefore, it is in the best interest to provide a safe, protected mid block
pedestrian/ bicycle crossing at the Sharp Park Drive.

As part of this analysis, pedestrian refuge islands were considered. A pedestrian refuge
island consists of a raised concrete island, usually with signing and reflectorized markings,
to provide a stopping point so that the pedestrian/bicyclist can concentrate on only one
direction of traffic at a time. However, the existing mid-block crossing at the Sharp Park
Drive is located on the south approach. A raised pedestrian/bicyclist refuge island in the
center of the left turn lane would block all northbound vehicles from using the center left

turn lane to turn left into Sharp Park. Therefore, a pedestrian/bicyclist refuge island is not
recommended as part of this report.
Mid-block Crossing Signals

There are several types of mid-block crossing signals. The first is a mast arm construction
with lighted case signs and flashing yellow warning lights that hang out over the roadway.
The flashing lights are activated by pedestrian push buttons and generally are set on a
timer so that they will turn off after a specified amount of time. The mast arm structure is
installed on a concrete base and the lighted case signs and flashing lights are attached to
the mast arm. The pedestrian push buttons are mounted in accordance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards and usually there will be underground
conduit for wiring as part of the installation. Whether a mast arm installation is provided, or
some other warning device, the appropriate pavement markings and pedestrian crossing
signing will be the same. It is also recommended that some sort of indication be installed
so that the pedestrian/bicyclist will know when the overhead lights are activated when
standing at the cross walk.

Delhi Charter Township installed a mast arm pedestrian crossing protection on Cedar
Street directly across from their Senior Center. Following are several pictures of this
installation.

As can be seen in these photos, this mid-block crossing is a four-lane roadway (Cedar
Street) without any pedestrian refuge island.

The estimated cost for this installation is $35,000.00, not including the signing or pavement
marking.

                               Rapid Flashing Beacon

Another method of providing mid-block pedestrian crossing protection is called
"Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacon: RRFG-XL". This type of installation uses the standard
Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MMUTCD) signing and mounts right
on the same post as the signing. The installation includes a rapid flashing LED light, a
solar panel for power and a small control box that controls the flashing beacon.




The flashing beacons are Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) certified, and provide
an alternating "wig-wag" pattern. They are designed for high speed, multi-lane roadways.

The unit also includes a side mounted LED array that flashes concurrently to advise the
pedestrian that the units are flashing.




The estimated cost for this installation is $11,000.00, not including the signing or pavement
marking.

Conclusions

The results of the pedestrian/ bicycle crossing protection analysis find that both the mast
arm system and the RRFB system will provide adequate warning to motorists that there is
a pedestrian/ bicycle crossing, or waiting to cross, the marked mid-block crosswalk. The
mast are system has a much larger presence than the RRFB system, however, the RRFB
system has been shown to provide 80% to 90% compliance with about one-third of the
cost.

We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and look forward to working with you again
in the future. Should you need further information, please contact this office.


Sincerely,



David J. Sonnenberg, P.E.

 Solar powered, eco-friendly

TAPCO's pedestrian-activated RRFB systems feature large, 7" x 3" LED arrays that
exceed FHWA standards. They provide greater visiblity, ideal for high speed and
multi-lane pedestrian and school crossings. When activated, the SAE J595
certified LED arrays flash an FHWA specified, alternating 'wig-wag' pattern.
Side-mounted LED arrays flash concurrently to advise pedestrians that the
units are flashing.
RRFBs have produced 80% to 90% driver compliance in yielding to pedestrians at
high-risk uncontrolled crossings. This is the highest yielding rate of all devices not
featuring a red display, and up to 4 times greater than standard round beacons.
RRFBs cost less than other devices with similar vehicular yield rates.
RRFB options include:
  Advance RRFB, wirelessly linked to Crossing RRFB
  Self-powered remote bollard-mounted pushbutton
  Passively activated systems: microwave or infrared

      Manager prior to entering into a contract with the Township, unless specifically

      total employment by occupational category, sex and minority group. If, after

      and females. Said goals shall reflect the availability of minorities and females

      recruitment area of the geographical area. Construction contractors determined to
      be in compliance shall be accepted by the Manager as having fulfilled affirmative
      action requirements for a period of six (6) months at which time the Manager
      shall conduct another review.

(c)   In hiring for construction projects, contractors shall make good faith efforts to
      employ local persons, so as to enhance the local economy.

(d)   All contracts shall include provisions through which the contractor agrees, in
      addition to any other applicable federal or state labor laws:

      (1)    To set goals, in conference with the Manager, for each job category or
             division of the work force used in the completion of the Township work;

      (2)    To provide periodic reports concerning the progress the contractor has
             made in meeting the affirmative action goals it has agreed to;

      (3)    To permit the Manager access to all books, records and accounts
             pertaining to its employment practices for the purposes of determining
             compliance with the affirmative action requirements.

(e)   The Manager shall monitor the compliance of each contractor with the non-
      discrimination provisions of each contract. The Manager shall develop procedures
      and regulations consistent with the administrative policy adopted by the Township



                                    153 of 156
       for notice and enforcement of non-compliance. Such procedures and regulations
       shall include a provision for the posting of contractors not in compliance.

(f)    All Township contracts shall provide further that breach of the obligation not to
       discriminate shall be a material breach of the contract for which the Township
       shall be entitled, at its option, to do any or all of the following:

       (1)    To cancel, terminate, or suspend the contract in whole or part and/or
              refuse to make any required periodic payments under the contract;

              the Township for a specified length of time;

              percentage of the labor expenditure for the time period involved which
              would have accrued to minority group members had the affirmative action
              not been breached;

       (4)    Impose for each day of non-compliance, liquidated damages of a specified
              sum, based upon the following schedule:

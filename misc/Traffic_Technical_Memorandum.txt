   Santa Rosa County Project Development &Environment (PD&E) Study

1.0    INTRODUCTION
Santa Rosa County has undertaken a Project Development &Environment (PD&E) study
to evaluate the transportation needs of in the area generally north of Five Points, the
impact of developments in the vicinity of Norris Road, West Spencer Field Road,
Education Drive, and Sawmill Circle, and more specifically, the need for improvements
to the Woodbine Road/Chumuckla Highway Corridor. The general (planning level)
study area includes the area north of Five Points where significant development is
anticipated to occur over the next 20 years. The more specific study and analysis area
(engineering level study area) will be bounded on the north by Gardenview Road, on the
south by U.S. Highway 90, on the east by West Spencer Field Road, and on the west by
Woodbine Road (see Figure 1-1).

The specific objective of this technical memorandum is to provide the methodology used
in developing the design traffic demand for the year 2025.

This report is divided into the following sections:
   · Introduction
   · Existing Conditions
   · Traffic Data Needs
   · Forecasting Methodology


2.0    EXISTING CONDITIONS

2.1 Field Data Collection
A two-day field trip was carried-out within the planning level study area to evaluate the
characteristics of the study area roadways. Data relevant to physical features on study
roads, study corridors, and twelve study intersections were inventoried, which included
but were not limited to:
    o existing number of lanes and typical lane widths,
    o posted speed limits,
    o informational and guidance related signs,
    o type of medians,
    o type of traffic controls,
    o drainage and shoulder features,
    o driveways locations,
    o park and ride locations,
    o pedestrian and bicycle facilities,
    o schools, residential areas, and commercial centers, and
    o important City or County buildings

 Field measurements were taken at twelve study intersection locations to obtain
 intersection layout graphics. These graphics (not to scale) are included in Appendix A.
 To support the inventoried data, a total of 875 digital images were captured along both
 travel directions of all the study roads and at twelve study intersections.

 2.2 Crash Data
 This task summarizes the trends and observations of crash data obtained for the previous
 six years (1998 to 2003) from FDOT along US 90 corridor between Woodbine Road and
 West Spencer Field Road. Table 2-1 presents a summary of crashes and their severity
 that occurred at three (Woodbine Road, Chumuckla Highway, and West Spencer Field
 Road) of the twelve study intersections and also at mid-segments between these
 intersections along US 90.

         Total Number of Crashes          233
         Total Number of Injuries         318

 A total of 233 crashes occurred over a period of six years with zero fatalities. There were
 318 people injured in a total of 167 injury-related crashes. Over 62% of total crashes
 occurred at intersections or influenced by intersections, while the remaining 38% of total
 crashes occurred along road segments away from the intersections.

 Careless driving accounted for 40% of the crashes, followed by Failed-to-Yield with
 24%. Rear-end type crashes represented 38% of the total followed by left-turn crashes
 with 22% of the total number of crashes. Monday and Friday were observed to be the
 most crash-prone day of the week with 16% crashes on each of those days. Just over
 10% of total crashes occurred due to alcohol and/or drug influence. Over 25% of the
 crashes happened during nights and 83% of those occurred at locations with no street
 lights.




                                                                                                  6
No crash data was available for the county roads within the study area. However,
feedback obtained from the "Community Traffic Safety Team for Escambia and Santa
Rosa Counties" (meeting on August 11, 2005) has indicated the following:

   o No significant crash issues within the study area (including the 5 Points
     Intersection)
   o Significant concern for the crash potential along Woodbine Road due to the use of
     the new 2-Way left-turn lane for passing.

2.3 Traffic Volume
Current and historic estimates of average annual daily traffic (AADT) for the last ten
years (1994-2004) were obtained from FDOT's 2004 Florida Traffic Information (FTI)
application CD. As shown in Figure 2-1, there were seven State-monitored portable
counting units within the study area boundaries. The location of these counters and the
AADT information for the last ten years are provided in Table 2-2. The table also
provides the K30, D30, and T24 factors for the year 2004. The last row in the table shows
the year 2005 forecasted AADT information obtained from regression analysis.

    3.0                    TRAFFIC DATA NEEDS
    After evaluating the available historic traffic data within the study area, the need for new
    traffic counts at additional locations and potentially important intersections for the
    existing year (2005) was identified. The new traffic data required to support the analysis
    of the study network included:
        o Twelve 48-hour machine counts along roadway segments
        o Twelve PM peak hour (4:00 PM ­ 6:00PM) manual intersection turning
             movement counts (TMC)

    Existing 2005 PM peak hour intersection turning movement volumes are illustrated in
    Figure 3-1 and 2005 ADT volumes are illustrated in Figure 3-2. The turning movement
    and machine count data sheets are provided in Appendix B.

    During the time period of traffic data collection (May 10-12, 2005), Interstate-10 between
    SR 281 (Avalon Blvd.) in Santa Rosa County and US 90 (Scenic Highway) in Escambia
    County was open on a restrictive basis with a speed limit of 45 mph. This was mainly
    because of the damage caused by hurricanes and high winds. The detour route is
    provided from Exit 13 SR 291 (Davis Highway) or Exit 22 SR 281 (Avalon Boulevard)
    to US 90. Motorists were asked to follow the detour signs. Also, Blue Angel's Classic
    Golf Championship was held during the same time (May 9-15, 2005). Hence, the traffic
    counts on US 90 eastbound and westbound and also on certain roads within the study
    area reported higher volumes than normal.

                                                                                                                                     8
4.0      FSUTMS MODEL
Tindale-Oliver & Associates Inc. (TOA) has initially obtained Florida-Alabama
Transportation Planning Organization's (TPO) 2002 Input Model and 2025 Needs socio-
economic data, which was last updated in August 2004. This model is based on the
Florida Standard Urban Transportation Model Structure (FSUTMS) computer travel
demand model.

4.1 2002 Input Model
The zonal structure used to represent the study area in this model was reviewed to
determine its appropriateness in producing future year traffic volume estimates. This
review found that the TPO's study area traffic analysis zones (TAZs) loaded to the road
network in a way not accurately enough for small-area forecasting purposes.
Modifications were made to the road network, centroid loading points, link
configurations, and node locations to enhance the model's ability to accurately forecast
traffic volumes. Also, area type and facility type were reviewed and updated to reflect
the actual field conditions.

The year 2002 original and revised model networks are illustrated in Appendices C-1 and
C-2. The revised network included West Spencer Field Road, which is assumed to be an
important connector between US 90 on the south and Berryhill Road on the north. North
Spencer Field Road and a portion of East Spencer Field Road were included to provide
reasonable connectivity to Hamilton Bridge Road. Centroid connections were updated
for TAZs 455, 457, and 494 using the 2002 aerial photographs and the Santa Rosa
County's streets map. The original TAZ structure was not disaggregated and the socio-
economic data associated with each of these TAZs was not reallocated.

4.2 TPO's 2025 Model (LRTP Adopted Needs Assessment Model)
Recently, TOA obtained the most current 2025 Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP)
Adopted Needs Plan Projects graphic developed by Florida-Alabama TPO.

Appendix D-1 shows the most current 2025 LRTP Adopted Needs Plan Projects graphic
developed by Florida-Alabama TPO, while Appendix D-2 shows the assessed roadway
and public transportation projects table. Four new projects that were identified to have a
direct influence on this study include:

      o Widen CR 197A (Woodbine Road) to 4 lanes from US 90 on the south to CR 184
        (Berryhill Road) on the north
      o Widen SR 10 (US 90) to 6 lanes from Scenic Highway on the west to SR 281
        (Avalon Boulevard) on the east
      o New Beltway from US 90 (Mobile Highway) on the east to SR 87 (Santa Rosa
        County) on the west, which would serve as a regional facility
      o CR 197A (Bell Lane) extension from US 90 on the south to New Beltway on the
        north.


                                                                                           11
Figure 4-1 shows the four identified future projects within the study area under the 2025
Needs Assessment Plan.

4.3 TOA's 2025 Needs Model (updated socio-economic data, `Zdata')
A total of 63 TAZs were identified to have a direct or some degree of influence on traffic
forecasts through the study area and study roads. A series of meetings and telephone
conferences were carried out with the Santa Rosa County planning staff to obtain their
input on growth of current and planned developments within these 63 TAZs. The 2025
Needs road network updates included any current and future road improvement projects
or new planned roadway projects within the vicinity of the study area. These updated
model files are herein referred as "TOA's 2025 Needs Model" files. See Appendix E for
details.

4.4 2025 Zdata for Traffic Forecasting
A comparison was performed between the socio-economic data (Zdata) of TOA's 2025
Needs and TPO's 2025 Needs for the 63 identified TAZs. Table 4-1 shows the summary
of the comparison. A negative number indicates that TOA data is lower than TPO data.

A detailed list of 63 TAZs and their associated socio-economic data used in 2002 Input,
TOA's 2025 Needs, and TPO's 2025 Needs models is illustrated in Appendix E-1 and
Appendix E-2 illustrates the 63 TAZ boundaries on existing roads.

After reviewing the two sets of 2025 Zdata information, TOA's updated socio-economic
data was considered the most current and was approved for use in the forecasting model
by Santa Rosa County.

5.0      FORECASTING METHODOLGY
For the forecasting purposes, the following assumptions were made:

      o by 2025, the proposed New Beltway from US 90 (Mobile Highway) on the east to
        SR 87 (Santa Rosa County) on the west will not be constructed within the
        forecasting period.
      o by 2025, the proposed CR 197A (Bell Lane) extension will be constructed from
        US 90 on the south to Berryhill Road on the north, but not up to New Beltway

These assumptions along with the revisions made to the 2002 Input model network were
incorporated to produce a "revised" TPO's 2025 Needs road network. Figure 5-1
illustrates the projected year 2025 Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes as
output from the revised 2025 Needs model. The plot of the FSUTMS model output
volumes for the forecasted 2025 is provided in Appendix E-3.

A total of seven major intersections were identified within the study area for detailed
analysis. In order to estimate the design hour turning volumes at these intersections, the
"select-link analysis" function of the model was utilized to calculate the directional
percentages for each of the link approaches. In addition, a 10% peak hour percentage (K)
was assumed as well as the assumed directional distribution percentages (D) as shown in
Figure 5-2 for the PM peak hour.

The "K" and "D" values shown in Table 2-2 were not utilized, since they were
representative estimates based on the FDOT roadways. As volumes increase on the
Study Area roadways through the Year 2025, typical values for "K" (10%) and "D"
(55%) are more appropriate to use in the future year analysis.

Figure 5-3 illustrates the resulting 2025 projected hour traffic turning volumes along with
existing (2005) PM peak hour turning volumes at these seven selected intersections,
while Figure 5-4 illustrates the resulting existing and projected mid-segment volumes
obtained from the turning movement counts.

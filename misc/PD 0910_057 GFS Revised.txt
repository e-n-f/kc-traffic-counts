INTRODUCTION

SR 289 (9th Avenue) is located in Pensacola, Florida in Escambia County and is under the
jurisdiction of FDOT - District 3. Langley Avenue, Tippin Avenue, and 12th Avenue are also
located in Pensacola and are under the jurisdiction of Escambia County.        The functional
                 th
classification of 9 Avenue, according to FDOT's District 3 road inventory, is an "urban other
principal arterial". Langley Avenue and Tippin Avenue are local collector roadways. These
streets make up what is commonly called the "triangle area" that consist of six approaches and
three traffic signals which are controlled by a master controller to provide coordinated
movements.


The purpose of this study is to review the current signal timings, accident data and traffic
volumes to determine what, if any, recommendations for short-term (signal timing adjustments,
access management improvements, and minor lane configuration changes) and long-term
(right-of-way acquisition and major roadway re-alignments) solutions can be made to improve
the traffic flow through this intersection. The intersection was also reviewed for a possible
roundabout design.

                                                                                           2
In addition to the triangle area, other intersections that were included in the study area were:
           1. 9th Avenue/Creighton Road
           2. 9th Avenue/McAllister Avenue
           3. 9th Avenue/John Carroll Drive
           4. John Carroll Drive/Tippin Avenue
           5. 9th Avenue/Schwab Drive
           6. Schwab Drive/Langley Avenue
           7. 9th Avenue/Underwood Avenue



EXISTING CONDITIONS
POSTED SPEEDS

The current posted speed along this section of 9th Avenue is 40 mph. The posted speed for
Langley Avenue is 30 mph. The posted speed for Tippin Avenue (which turns into 12th Avenue)
is 35 mph south of the Langley Avenue/Tippin Avenue intersection and 30 mph north of the 9th
Avenue/Tippin Avenue Intersection. Design speeds for improvements will be 5 mph over the
posted speeds for each roadway segment.



PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLIST, and PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

From Section 25.4.19 of FDOT's Plans Preparation Manual (PPM), pedestrian and bicycle
needs must be addressed and recommendations should be obtained from the FDOT District
Three Pedestrian/ Bicycle Coordinator (Zena Riley) for the final design.

Movement through the corridor is primarily vehicular traffic. With Pensacola Junior College
(PJC), Cordova Mall, numerous businesses and residential areas being located relatively close
to the intersections under review, pedestrians also
utilize this corridor.   At the present time, access
through the    corridor appears to be acceptable for
both pedestrians and bicyclists. There are sidewalks
throughout the project limits and signalized cross
walks with curb ramps are provided at all legs of the
intersections. The area is also serviced by ECAT
(Escambia County Area Transit) system.




                                                                                                   3
UTILITIES

From Section 25.4.20 of FDOT's PPM and the Utility
Accommodation Manual (UAM), relocation or adjustment is
required if the following conditions are present:
(1)   The   minimum     clear   zone    or    horizontal   clearance
requirements are not met.
       Clear zone = 6 feet for design speeds < 45 mph,
       Horizontal clearance = 4 feet back of face of curb, or
       2.5 feet back of face of curb when all other alternatives
       are deemed impractical)
(2)   The   utility   system    conflicts    with   proposed   RRR
       improvements and sufficient right-of-way is available.


During a field review, it was noted that the majority of the utilities are outside the limit for
adequate horizontal clearance except as noted below:
       1)    A power pole is located within the horizontal clearance north of the 9th/Tippin
       intersection on the south side of Tippin Avenue (near the old Enterprise Rental Car
       facilities).


Additional utility relocations will be required for the long term solutions and shall be designed to
accommodate the design criteria offsets per the UAM.



HIGHWAY TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES

From Section 25.4.24 of FDOT's PPM, traffic control devices such as signals, signing and
markings shall be updated as required to comply with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies, the Department's Roadway and Traffic Design
Standards, and the ADA design guidelines.


There are three signalized intersections within the project
limits. The existing control cabinets are located in the
south east corner of 9th Avenue/Tippin Avenue


New signals required for geometric realignments will be
mast arms.     Signs and markings will be upgraded as
necessary for the new geometrics.

                                                                                                 4
ACCIDENT DATA

An accident data summary was prepared utilizing the 2005-2008 accident data provided by
Escambia County. In summary, rear end accidents account for 51% of the total accidents,
running a red light accounts for 14% of the accidents and 18% of accidents are caused by
improper lane changes and miscellaneous movements. These accidents do not appear to be
attributed to any defects in the geometry of the intersection or timings of the signals. However,
it can be noted that the congested area and lack of space between driveways and intersections
could lead to higher accident volumes. See Appendix A for a summary of the accidents.



TRAFFIC VOLUME AND LEVEL OF SERVICE

Traffic counts were performed by Southern Traffic Services, Inc. on December 11, 2008 for
Tippin Avenue at Langley Avenue, 9th Avenue at Tippin Avenue, and 9th Avenue at Langley
Avenue. Counts were performed starting at 7:00 a.m. and continued through until 6:00 p.m.
Volumes were determine for the morning peak period (7:00 a.m. to 9:45 a.m.), the afternoon
peak period (10:00 a.m. to 1:45 p.m.), and the evening peak period (2:00 p.m. to 5:45 p.m.).
Detailed traffic count information is provided in Appendix B.


The traffic counts revealed the AM Peak and PM Peak hour traffic volumes for analysis. The
peak hour periods were used in this analysis to determine capacity and level-of-service at the
study intersections. The existing peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 1.


From this information, the capacity and level-of-service (LOS) of an intersection is evaluated
based on the average vehicular delay during the peak hour periods. The vehicular delays are
directly related to the turning movement volumes, traffic composition and roadway geometrics at
the intersection. The methodology utilized in this analysis is based on the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM), 2000 Edition. The level-of-service, as outlined in the HCM, is reported as a
letter designation of LOS A through LOS F (A is least delay and F is most delay). The traffic
volumes recorded at the study intersections during the AM and PM peak hours were analyzed
using the information provided in the HCM. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1 on
the next page.




                                                                                              5

                *HCM Average Control Delay

       The level-of-service analysis shows that the intersections are currently operating at acceptable
       levels during both the AM and PM peak hours as independent intersections. The close proximity
       of the intersections, however, presents limits on the effectiveness of the coordination and
       progression through the intersection during peak hours.


       The existing traffic volumes traversing the "triangle" area were evaluated to identify the major
       and minor approaches of the six approaches of the three intersections. Traffic volumes for AM
       and PM peak hours were totaled and compared to calculate the percentage of total traffic by
       approach. The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

       The approach volume analysis reveals that existing traffic on 9th Avenue has the highest
       volume combined entering and exiting volume in the study area in both the AM and PM peak
       hours. Langley Avenue west of 9th Avenue and Tippin Avenue north of 9th Avenue consistently
       contribute the least volumes of the six intersection approaches.

SHORT-TERM SOLUTIONS
The objective of this section is to identify and describe multiple short-term solutions for further
consideration by Escambia County. For this report, a short-term solution is being considered as
an improvement that could be immediately implemented with no additional right-of-way
acquisition, minimal business impacts, and minimal costs.            These are options that, if
implemented, will promote immediate improvement to safety and maneuverability along the
corridor.



ACCESS MANAGEMENT

In reviewing the current access management it was noted during a field review that FDOT Rule
14-96 has not been followed in establishing driveway connection spacing. Due to the number of
businesses and sizes of lots, few corrections can be made to improve the flow of traffic along
the project limits. Figure 2 shows the following recommendations that could be made with little
cost to the County:
    1. At the old Enterprise Car site, (south west
        corner of 9th Ave./Langley Ave.), the
        driveway could be narrowed down to allow
        for a 24 foot right in / right-out only
        entrance. This would improve the corner
        opening distance from 0 feet to 97 feet.
    2. In the south east corner of 9th Avenue and
        Langley Avenue, the driveway entrance of
        North   Market     Square   closest   to   the
        intersection should be closed. A second entrance to the south is already in use.
    3. Along 9th Avenue, the center lane that is
        hatched out should be converted to a
        concrete island between the intersections
        of 9th Avenue and Langley Avenue and 9th
        Avenue and Tippin Avenue.         This would
        require the existing driveway entrances to
        a dentist office and Waffle House to
        become right-in / right-out only movements
        and prevent left turns in the northbound
        direction   from   trying   to   access    the
        businesses unsafely.

       should be reduced to allow for a 95 foot corner clearance and provide a 24 foot right-in /
       right-out movement. We would recommend that the County approach this business to
       close this driveway down completely and force all traffic for this business to utilize the
       Tippin Avenue entrance.



SIGNAL TIMING ADJUSTMENTS

Possible improvements that were reviewed included adjusting the signals such that left turns
were changed from permissive movements to protected movements (left turns not yielding
accounted for 10% of the accidents). Another possible improvement is to disallow right turns on
red (accounts for 2% of the accidents). These changes would not improve the Level of Service
of the roadway, however, improvements could be gained from a reduction in accidents thereby
reducing the delay time for motorists and improving the overall mobility through the
intersections.


It has been indicated by Escambia County and FDOT staff that the signals in the triangle are
working at virtually peak efficiency at the present time. In speaking with Cliff Johnson, FDOT
Traffic Operations, FDOT feels that the existing signals are working as well as can be expected
and it is not felt that timing adjustments would result in any better performance. From further
analysis, it was deemed feasible to consider certain turning movement "restrictions" or
eliminating low volume movements, thus promoting an improved traffic flow scenario and
eliminating delays for specific minor turning
movements.

Alternative 1 ­ Eliminate Southbound Left Turns
from Tippin Avenue onto 9th Avenue

Alternative 1 involves prohibiting southbound left
turns from Tippin Avenue onto Ninth Avenue.
Currently the lane assignment for this approach
includes an exclusive southbound right turn lane
and a shared through-left lane. The traffic signal
operates with a concurrent north/south phasing,
with no protected southbound left-turn movement.
The signal phase is allocated a minimal amount of
green time, and a single southbound left turning
vehicle blocks the through traffic trapped in the
                                                                                              9
lane behind this vehicle. Alternate routes to the north exist to enter 9th Avenue via John Carroll
Drive or Creighton Road. The left turn movement was less than 10 vehicles per hour (vph)
during the AM and PM peak hours. Traffic typically darts out of the through lane and into the
right turn lane to go around the left turning vehicle to avoid having to sit through an additional
cycle. The LOS impacts are shown in Table 4.

Alternative 2 - Eliminate NB Permitted Lefts from 9th Avenue to Langley Ave
Alternative 2 involved restricting north east bound left turns from Ninth Avenue onto Tippin
Avenue to protected only phasing. Currently left turning vehicles are permitted to turn left during
the green phase of the adjacent through movement. This left turn movement has to cross a
heavy southbound through movement on 9th Avenue that has few gaps during peak hours and
when vehicles are in the southbound left turn
lanes on Ninth Avenue, the sight distance is
severely hindered for this movement. Crash
data reveals that restricting lefts to protected-
only phasing could improve safety by reducing
the number of accidents caused by this
turning movement.
The results of the analysis for Alternative 2
are provided in Table 5.

Alternative 3 - Eliminate NB Protected Left Phase from Tippin Avenue to Langley Ave
Alternative 3 involves eliminating the northbound left turn protected phase from Tippin Avenue
onto Langley Avenue and allow only permissive left turn movement northbound. The left turn
movement was less than 10 vehicles per hour (vph) during the AM peak hour and less than 35
during the PM peak hour. Currently left turning vehicles are moving in advance of the
southbound through green phase. This modification would increase the allotted green time
given to southbound through traffic. The results of the analysis for Alternative 3 are provided in
Table 6.

LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS
The objective of this section is to identify and describe multiple long-term solutions for further
consideration by Escambia County. For this report, a long-term solution is being considered as
an improvement that could be implemented in the future with the acquisition of additional right-
of-way, business impacts, and higher design and construction costs. These are options that, if
implemented, will promote improvement to safety and maneuverability along the corridor in the
future as funds become available for design, construction and right of way. Construction cost
estimates of the developed alternatives for the long term solutions are provided in Appendix D
for the alternatives discussed below.



GEOMETRIC IMPROVEMENTS

Possible improvements that were considered included reviewing the connecting side streets to
determine if any could be removed without adversely affecting the traffic patterns and routes of
the commuters. Other options were more involved and included realigning multiple side streets
in order to space the signalized intersections further apart and allow more queue lengths for the
turning movements and the overall operation of the intersections.

Alternative 5-Eliminate Langley Crossing of Airport Property
An evaluation of the re-routing of Langley Avenue to the east side of the airport property was
conducted to divert Langley traffic that currently crosses the north end of the airport property to
a new traffic signal at McAllister Avenue (see Figures 3 and 4).              This would include
reconstruction of the existing two-lane section of McAllister Avenue to a four lane section , dual
left turns from McAllister to 9th Avenue, and a new signal. The existing section of Langley
Avenue that traverses the airport property connecting Tippin Avenue with McAllister Avenue
would be eliminated. The intersection at Ninth Avenue will be upgraded to include a north
bound right turn lane onto McAllister Avenue.          The existing geometry surrounding the
Ninth/Langley/Tippin triangle would remain similar to the existing condition; however, the
southbound left turn movement from Tippin Avenue onto Ninth Avenue would be eliminated.
Traffic volumes for Alternative 5 are shown in Figure 5.        The level-of-service analysis for
Alternative 5 are summarized in Table 8 and the cost estimate is summarized in Table 9.

Alternative 6-Eliminate Langley Crossing of Airport Property with realignments of 12th Avenue
and Langley Avenue

Alternative 6 (see Figure 6) is a build on to Alternative 5 that could be built at the same time or
in the future as one project. The additional work includes realigning 12th Avenue and Langley
Avenue (west leg) to the south with a new signalized intersection on 9th Avenue. The existing
west leg of Langley Avenue would have a cul-de-sac to maintain access to the businesses that
are served by the existing connection. Tippin Avenue and the east leg of Langley Avenue would
become right in/right out only connections to 9th Avenue. This alternative will require substantial
right of way acquisition and construction cost. The level-of-service is provided in Table 10 and
the cost estimate is summarized in Table 11.

Alternative 7-Eliminate Langley Crossing of Airport Property with realignments of 12th Avenue
utilizing La Vista Avenue, Schwab Drive, and Langley Avenue
Alternative 7 (see Figure 7) is a build on to Alternative 5 that could be built at the same time or
in the future as one project. The additional work includes realigning 12th Avenue to the south
utilizing as much of the existing La Vista Avenue right of way as possible. The west leg of
Langley Avenue will remain open, however it's current connection to 9th Avenue will become a
right in/right out only connection. Schwab Drive will be improved to accommodate the additional
traffic volumes and turning movements. The new intersection of 9th Avenue, 12th Avenue, and
Schwab Drive will be signalized. The connection of Langley Avenue (east leg) and Tippin
Avenue will be reconstructed to allow right in/right out connections at 9th Avenue. The widening
of La Vista Avenue will require less right of way acquisition than the realignment of Langley
Avenue as shown in Alternative 6. Traffic volumes for Alternative 7 are similar to those for
Alternative 6 and were not reproduced (see Figure 8). A cost estimate is provided in Table 12.




Alternative 8 ­ Roundabout Design
This option involves the elimination of the North Tippin Avenue intersection and realignment of
both 9th Avenue and South Tippin Avenue to form the 4-legged roundabout (see Figure 9).
Minimal modifications would be required to Langley Avenue (East & West). Specific access
management changes would need to be implemented for appropriate operation of the roadway.
American has designed several roundabouts in the State and have found that the placement of
proper signage to "introduce the roundabout at the intersection" is critical.         This option is
available but is not felt to be the best alternative for this location. The construction of a 4-legged
roundabout at this location would require additional right-of-way and will cause significant
business impacts. Based upon our discussions with the County, this option was dropped from
future discussions and right-of-way cost and cost estimates were not obtained for this option.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This design recommendation report outlines possible short term and long term improvements to
improve the traffic flow through the intersections of 9th Avenue, Langley Avenue, and Tippin
Avenue in Pensacola, Florida. These three streets make up what is commonly referred to as the
"triangle area". 9th Avenue (SR 289) is under jurisdiction of FDOT ­ District 3 and is classified
as an "urban other principal arterial". Langley Avenue and Tippin Avenue are local collector
roadways that are under jurisdiction of Escambia County.

Improvements identified in this report consist of short-term and long-term solutions. For the
purposes of this report, short-term solutions refer to improvements that could be made
immediately with no additional right-of-way, minimal business impacts, and minimal costs, for
example access management changes and signal timing adjustments. Long-term solutions refer
to options that include additional right-of-way, business impacts, and higher design and
construction costs. Long-term solutions include moving one or more legs of the triangle without
adversely affecting existing traffic patterns.

Short Term Solutions Recommendation:
Although these short term recommendations do not improve the Level of Service through the
intersections, it is our belief that these improvements would reduce the number of accidents and
therefore improve the operation of the intersections.        We recommend Escambia County
consider implementing some of these alternatives as low cost improvements for the short term
until a more permanent solution to improving the Level of Service can be implemented. Based
on the letter from Blair Martin, FDOT, a recommendation is made to hold a public involvement
meeting or one on one meetings with the business owners to discuss the access management
solutions before any construction is undertaken.

Long Term Solutions Recommendation:
Based on meetings with Escambia County, FDOT, City of Pensacola, and the Pensacola Airport
representatives, we recommend that the long term alternatives presented in this report be
carried forward to a PD&E study to determine the preferred alignment that should be carried
forward to final design and construction. An overall general timeline has been prepared to
show the time required in order to complete the project from submittal of the Final Design
Recommendation Report submittal through construction (see Appendix E).             This timeline is
based on past experience with similar projects and has been accelerated as much as possible.
As the project progresses, the timeline may need to be adjusted. Fees for the PD&E and final
design           plans            are            provided        in          Appendix               F.

The following notes reflect our understanding of the discussions and decisions made at this meeting. If you
have any questions, additions or comments, please contact us at the above address. We will consider the
minutes to be accurate unless written notice is received within 10 working days of the date issued.

Larry Newsom began the meeting by thanking everyone for their participation in the project to date and
their willingness to be at the joint agency meeting. Larry also mentioned that this project is one that a
corrective measure should be taken to reduce the number of accidents and improve the level of service
(LOS) through the corridor. To date, Escambia County has paid for the conceptual study to be
completed by American and that the study will be wrapping up in the next couple of months based on
the outcome of this meeting.

After introductions of the attendees, American presented the group with a quick background of the
project's scope of services and status of the recommendations to date. Discussions included review of
the current traffic volume through the intersection (approximately 58,000 vpd) and the current LOS for
the 3 intersections (ranging from LOS B-D). There have been 247 accidents over the last 4 years with 1
fatality. In comparison of other intersections in Pensacola, these 3 intersections have a higher number
of accidents occurring on them.

A discussion followed about possible access management improvements. It was noted that there are
numerous small parcels that will prevent the Access Management Guidelines from being complexly
implemented, but that with improvements, there should be an improvement in the number of accidents

                                                                                                                      July 2, 2009

occurring because of the number of access points currently available. The recommendations included
reducing the widths of some driveways to force movements at a certain point, closure of some
driveways, adjusting the spacing of driveways from the intersection/signals, and placement of an island
along 9th Ave. in some areas to prevent left in/out movements across numerous lanes. Specific
information was provided in the Draft Conceptual Report (Figure 2) that was provided to each attendee.

The discussions then moved forward to the short term solutions. These solutions were considered
minor improvements to the intersection by adjusting signal timings, removing movements, etc.
Alternative 1 recommends eliminating the south bound lefts from Tippin Avenue onto 9th Avenue. The
AM peak hour shows 5 lefts vs. 154 through movements in this combined through/left lane. The PM
peak hour shows 8 lefts vs. 182 through movements. It was suggested to remove the turning
movement due to the low volume of turning movements, blocking traffic to make this move, and the
availability of alternative routes.

Alternative 2 recommends eliminating the north bound permitted lefts from 9th Avenue onto Tippin
Avenue and changing the signal timings to a protected left. The AM peak hour shows 43 lefts while the
PM peak hour shows 94. Although these turns are considerably more than Alternative 1, we feel that
the number of accidents would be reduced due to drivers running red lights and having a sight distance
issue.

Alternative 3 recommends eliminating the north bound protected lefts from Tippin Avenue onto Langley
Avenue. The AM peak hour movements were 7 and 31 during the PM peak hour. By removing the
protected left timing, this would allow the southbound through timing to be increased.

Alternative 4 reviewed the cumulative effects of implementing Alternatives 1 through 3. Although no
overall improvements to the LOS was indicated through the modeling, we feel that these alternatives
could help to reduce the number of accidents in the intersections.

The discussion was then turned to the long term solutions. These improvements included looking at a
broader picture in all directions from the intersections and what could be done if funding for design,
right of way acquisition and construction could be funded. These improvements would have impacts to
all of the agencies at today's meeting, and therefore the focus of the meeting.

Alternative 5 recommends removing the current crossing of Langley Avenue through the Pensacola
Airport property. This would require realignment/widening of McAllister Aveunue to accommodate the
additional traffic volume. A signal would be required at the intersection of 9th Avenue and McAllister
Avenue. The remaining legs of the 9th Avenue, Langley Avenue, and Tippin Avenue would remain the
same. The traffic models show a slight improvement to the LOS for the intersections; however it does
not improve the signal spacing for the remaining legs.

Alternative 6 is a build on of Alternative 5. Additional improvements would require the realignment of
Tippin Avenue just north of La Vista Avenue, to be realigned to the south along with the west leg of
Langley Avenue to form a new signalized intersection. Other small changes are also recommended as
shown in Figure 6 of the Draft Report. It was noted that although we feel like we have a pretty good
handle on how traffic might react; it is hard to now how these changes will affect the circulation
patterns.

Alternative 7 is also a build on to Alternative 5. This alternative utilizes the existing La Vista Aveunue
and Schwab Drive right of way to realign the Tippin Avenue and Langley Avenue realignments. These
improvements are shown in Figure 7 of the Draft Report.

Cost estimates for Alternatives 5, 6, and 7 were included with the meeting handouts. It was noted that
an error was included in Alternative 6's cost estimate for the miles of solid yellow markings required. In
correcting this, the new subtotal for the Tippin Avenue (12th Avenue) work was reduced from
$7,012,410.32 to $512,624.72 which brings the new total alternative cost to $2,479,791.03.

Assistant Fire Chief Schmitt indicated that all of the long term alternatives will affect the operation of the
fire station at the corner of 9th Avenue and McAllister Avenue. It was noted that we would work with
Chief Schmitt on any proposed designs so that we could improve the movements of his emergency
vehicles entering/exiting the station onto either street.

After the presentation, the agencies were asked to remain in the room for further discussions on
whether or not the project should be carried forward, and if it should be carried forward, would a PD&E
study be required or could work begin on final design. Funding issues were also to be discussed.
Based on feedback from Escambia County, it appears that everyone is in favor of progressing the
project to either a PD&E study or directly to design.

Subject: RE: Langley and 9th road improvements project

Anna,

I have spoken to Bill Farris. From the FAA's standpoint they would look at
the following:

1. Right-of-way: The additional right-of-way for McAllister would need to be
treated as a release of property. This would require an appraisal of the
property to determine the fair market value and then would need a formal
release of the property. This isn't as bad as it sounds. Do you know if the
existing right-of-way for Langley was ever formally turned over to the
County? I ask because if this was and it is coming back to the airport, then
the fair market value of this property is used to offset the fair market
value of the right-of-way needed for McAllister.

2. The County would need to complete an environmental checklist, a copy of
which will be forthcoming.
3. Once all is said and done, the airport would need to update it's airport
layout plan.

Does this information help? Again, I will forward a copy of the
environmental checklist once it comes to me.

Dan

Mr. Flynn

Have you gotten any response from Bill Farris? We are trying to provide
the County with an update and would love to be able to explain what
studies or processes they will need to follow for this project. Thanks!

Bill,

Escambia County is in the process of reviewing alternatives to modify a
public thoroughfare that goes across airport property on our northern
side.
Two alternatives are attached. Alternative 1 would involve modifying
another
existing road, McAllister Avenue, and directing traffic down it rather
than
on Langley. In this situation, the County would need to work with the
Pensacola Airport to obtain the necessary right-of-way. The
right-of-way for
McAllister would be modified and then the existing right-of-way for
Langley
would be vacated and returned to us for our use. From our standpoint,
we
need to start working with you to determine the FAA's requirements for
something such as this. In addition, Escambia County is starting to
explore
funding options and is trying to determine that given the FAA's
involvement,
will there be any specific requirements involving permitting,
environmental
and engineering studies, etc...

Your input would be appreciated.

Thanks Bill.

Dan Flynn

Hello Mr. Flynn

Thank you for discussing this project with me this morning. Attached
please
find two alternatives for the project that we are currently considering.
These are both in the early stages still and are subject to change. As
discussed on the phone, we would like to begin coordination with FAA on
this
project. Escambia County is interested in obtaining federal funds for
this
project. Though we are not sure at this time if federal funds will be
available, we are trying to advance the project in a manner that would
allow
the County to receive federal funds if they do come available. That
being
said, we are not sure what our obligations would be to FAA as far as
permits,
environmental studies, or engineering analyses and are interested in
beginning communications on this, if possible.

If you could pass these drawings on to Mr. Farris I would greatly
appreciate
it. As the project advances, I will continue to send information.
Thanks!

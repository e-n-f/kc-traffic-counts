Project/Event:            17th Street and Jordan Avenue Intersection and Roadway Improvements   
Design Engineer:          Clark Dietz Engineering      
Staff Representative:  Justin Wykoff          
Date:  February 10, 2010                                        
                           
                                                                                                             

Report:    The  City  of  Bloomington  has  identified  the  intersection  of  17th  Street  and  Jordan 
Avenue  as  a  location  eligible  for  Hoosier  Safety  Improvement  Program  (HSIP)  Funding.    This 
identification  was  discovered  following  the  2005  Annual  Accident  Report  prepared  by  the  City 
Planning  Department.    That  same  year  the  intersection  of  17th  Street  and  Fee  Lane  was 
identified  and  programmed  for  improvements  using  HSIP  funding  through  the 
Bloomington/Monroe County MPO, and those improvements were constructed in 2008. 

At  this  time  we  are  working  with  the  same  design  firm  (Clark  Dietz)  to  continue  improvements 
along  17th  Street  that  will  include  both  intersections  with  Jordan  Avenue.    These  changes  will 
include  a  reduction  in  the  height  of  the  hill  for  improved  sight  distance.   Other  improvements 
include  completion  of  pedestrian  sidewalk  (with  grass  separation)  linkages  between  the  two 
projects,  as  well  as  continuing  the  multiuse  pathway  (with  grass  separation)  along  the  north 
side of 17th Street.   

We  have  identified  modifications  to  the  existing  plans  that  would  create  additional  pedestrian 
crossings at the intersections, and will detail further at the meeting. 
 
                                                                                                             

Request:  At this time we are requesting comments from members of the Bicycle and Pedestrian 
Safety  Commission  regarding  proposed  pedestrian  improvements  as  well  as  suggestions  for 
additional modifications to the plans to better support pedestrian usage along these streets.

Report:   The  City  of  Bloomington  has  began  design  work  on  the  intersection  of  Sare  Road  and 
Rogers Road through the Bloomington / Monroe County MPO. 

Included  in  your  packet  is  the  preliminary  design  for  a  roundabout  at  this  intersection  that  will 
compare  in  size  to  the  existing  roundabout  at  the  intersection  of  High  Street/Winslow 
Road/Rogers Road, that was completed in 1999.  (see overlay included) 

At this time one section of sidewalk (east side of Sare Road) is shown to not be included.  This is 
still  being  discussed  and  your  input  is  needed  on  this  and  other  pedestrian  and  cyclist 
considerations  that  will  be  constructed  with  this  project.   We  are  working  to  schedule  meetings 
with the Tree Commission and Environmental Commission to discuss this project.

Design Engineer:          Engineering Department   
Staff Representative: Justin Wykoff            
Date:                     February 10, 2010                                
                           
                                                                                                                

Report:    The  City  of  Bloomington  has  began  data  collection  on  signalized  intersections  within 
downtown Bloomington along Walnut Street and College Avenue. 

Included  in  your  packet  is  an  existing  turning  movement  count  that  includes  pedestrians  for  the 
intersection  of  11th  Street  and  College  Avenue,  as  well  as  copies  of  accident  summaries  for  the 
past 3 years at this intersection. 

An  additional  turning  movement  count  will  be  performed  during  the  week  of  February  15th  to 
include the afternoon peak (11:00a.m. to 1:00p.m.) in an effort to seek the maximum pedestrian 
count at this intersection. 

Accident  summaries  of  all  10  accidents  that  occurred  at  this  intersection  over  the  past  3  years 
are included as well. 

A  sight  distance  analysis  will  be  performed  prior  to  the  next  meeting,  and  a  summary  of  current 
and future data will be compiled into a report and recommendation regarding the inclusion of a 
`no turn on red' for this intersection. 
 
                                                                                                                

Request:  As  part of an overall analysis of each signalized intersection in  the  downtown  (College 
Avenue  and  Walnut  Street),  the  Engineering  Department  will  continue  to  provide  updates  each 
month on progress completing these studies.

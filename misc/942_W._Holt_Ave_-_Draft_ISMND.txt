West Holt Avenue Apartment Project
Initial Study - Mitigated Negative Declaration


      Approximately 19 mobile homes would either be relocated or demolished and the
      permanent residence would be demolished to accommodate the proposed project.

      The proposed apartment complex would consist of 19 townhomes and 43 apartment units.
      The apartment units would consist of 27 two-bedroom units and 16 one-bedroom units,
      located in a three-story building of approximately 38 feet in height. The townhomes would
      be two-stories and approximately 24 feet in height. In addition, 21 of the 62 units would be
      designated for Mental Health Services Act housing.

      Access and Parking
      Vehicle access to the project site would be via a single driveway along West Holt Avenue
      on the eastern portion of the property. On-site vehicle parking for residents would be
      provided by surface lots toward the rear of the property. A total of 73 parking spaces
      would be provided.

      Utilities
      The proposed project would connect to existing on-site infrastructure for water and waste
      water services.

      Project Construction
      The project would be built in a single phase over approximately 12 months, tentatively
      scheduled to begin in 2013.

9.    Surrounding land uses and setting:

      The project site is located on West Holt Avenue in a predominantly commercial area.
      There is a market and a restaurant located to the east of the proposed project and vacant
      commercial buildings lie to the west. Both properties east and west have land use
      designations of Urban Neighborhood. To the north, across West Holt Avenue, are motels
      and restaurants. The businesses to the north have land use designations of Urban Edge.
      South of the proposed project are single-family residences, which are designated as Urban
      Neighborhood.

10.   Other public agencies whose approval is required:

The project requires approval by the City of Pomona. The entitlements required from the City
include:

        Conditional Use Permit and General Plan amendment so that the proposed project can be
        designed in accordance with the Corridor Specific Plan, which has not yet been adopted.
        Zone change to up-zone the project site from R-4 to Corridor Specific Plan.
        Variance to reduce the parking requirement from 97 parking spaces to 70 parking spaces.

Approvals from other agencies would not be required.

Initial Study - Mitigated Negative Declaration


DETERMINATION:

On the basis of this initial evaluation:

    I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment,
    and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

    I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
    there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been
    made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE
    DECLARATION will be prepared.

    I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an
    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.

    I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or "potentially
    significant unless mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one effect (1) has been
    adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and (2)
    has been addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis as described on
    attached sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but it must analyze
    only the effects that remain to be addressed.

    I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
    because all potential significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earlier EIR
    or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards, and (b) have been
    avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION, including

I.   AESTHETICS ­ Would the project:
a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a
   scenic vista?
b) Substantially damage scenic resources,
   including, but not limited to, trees, rock
   outcroppings, and historic buildings within
   a state scenic highway?
c) Substantially degrade the existing visual
   character or quality of the site and its
   surroundings?
d) Create a new source of substantial light or
   glare which would adversely affect day or
   nighttime views in the area?

a) The project site is surrounded on all sides by existing commercial and residential
development. Because of topography, site location, adjacent residential and commercial
development, views into the site are generally limited to Holt Avenue in the immediate vicinity
of the proposed project. Views out of the site are also limited by the surrounding development.
Views of the surrounding hillsides and San Gabriel Mountains are available in the distance
from higher elevations. However, views of these scenic resources from and through the project
site are mostly obscured by the existing mobile home park. Furthermore, the City of Pomona
does not identify the project site as a scenic resource or as vantage point to view the scenic
vistas located north of the site. Therefore, no impact on scenic vistas would occur.

b) The project site is entirely surrounded by urban development and does not contain any
scenic resources, such as historic buildings or rock outcroppings. There are no state scenic
highways within the project area. No impact to scenic resources would occur.

c) Development in the project area consists of residential and commercial development.
Fronting West Holt Avenue, all of the surrounding properties are occupied by commercial
development, including restaurants, markets, and auto services. There are also single-family
residences to the south of the project site. The proposed project would replace the existing
residential development and vacant lots with a two- and three-story apartment complex. The
proposed project would be consistent with existing development patterns in the project area.
Because the project is located in an urban area, development of the vacant lots would make the
project site more consistent with the urban environment. Impacts would be less than
significant.

d) The project site is surrounded by commercial and residential development; therefore,
parking lot light fixtures, building mounted light fixtures and parked vehicles all contribute to
ambient light levels that are typical of an urban environment. At night, the project's interior and

                                                                                       City of Pomona

exterior building lights and landscape lighting would likely be visible from the adjacent
residential dwellings, and to a lesser extent, from the surrounding public streets. The proposed
project's exterior light fixtures and low-level pedestrian lighting would have the potential to
cast light onto the ground surface and into the atmosphere. However, these light sources would
not have a significant impact on the night sky, as they would not exceed existing background
light levels already present. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

The proposed residential dwellings could potentially increase sources of glare, as residential
structures typically utilize some reflective materials (such as windows) on the building exterior.
In addition, vehicles parked on-site would increase the potential for reflected sunlight during
certain times of the day. However, the buildings would be set back from the street and on-site
landscaping and security fencing would further reduce glare generated by the proposed project.
The parking lot would also be located in the rear of the building, shielding reflections from
parked cars. Light and glare impacts would therefore be less than significant.

II. AGRICULTURE AND FOREST
    RESOURCES -- Would the project:
a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique
   Farmland, Farmland of Statewide
   Importance (Farmland), as shown on the
   maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland
   Mapping and Monitoring Program of the
   California Resources Agency, to non-
   agricultural use?
b) Conflict with existing zoning for
   agricultural use, or a Williamson Act
   contract?
c) Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause
   rezoning of, forest land (as defined in
   Public Resources Code Section
   12220(g)), timberland (as defined by
   Public Resources Code Section 4526), or
   timberland zoned Timberland Production
   (as defined by Government Code Section
   51104(g))?
d) Result in the loss of forest land or
   conversion of forest land to non-forest
   use?
e) Involve other changes in the existing
   environment which, due to their location
   or nature, could result in conversion of
   Farmland, to non-agricultural use?

a) The project site has been previously disturbed and the surrounding areas are developed with
residential and commercial uses. Review of the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
(FMMP) maps prepared by the California Department of Conservation confirmed that neither
the project site nor adjacent land is designated Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland
of Statewide Importance by the FMMP (FMMP, 2010). No impact would occur.

b) The project site is zoned multi-family residential and is not enrolled in a Williamson Act
contract. The proposed project would not conflict with any zoning designations designed to
promote agriculture. Based upon a review of historical air photos, neither the project site nor
surrounding land has recently been used for agricultural production. No impact would occur.

c-e) Neither the site nor surrounding areas are used for timber production or agriculture. The
project would therefore not conflict with any zoning designations designed to preserve timber
or for agricultural resource preservation. No impact would occur.

III.   AIR QUALITY -- Would the project:
a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of
   the applicable air quality plan?
b) Violate any air quality standard or
   contribute substantially to an existing or
   projected air quality violation?
c) Result in a cumulatively considerable net
   increase of any criteria pollutant for which
   the project region is non-attainment under
   an applicable federal or state ambient air
   quality standard (including releasing
   emissions which exceed quantitative
   thresholds for ozone precursors)?
d) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial
   pollutant concentrations?
e) Create objectionable odors affecting a
   substantial number of people?

The project site is located within the South Coast Air Basin, which is under the jurisdiction of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). A significant adverse air quality
impact may occur when a project individually or cumulatively interferes with progress toward
the attainment of the ozone standard by generating emissions that equal or exceed the
established long term quantitative thresholds for pollutants, or exceed a state or federal ambient
air quality standard for any criteria pollutant. Table 1 shows the significance thresholds that
have been recommended by the SCAQMD for projects within the South Coast Air Basin.

The analysis of air quality impacts follows the methodologies recommended in the SCAQMD's
CEQA Air Quality Handbook (1993). The regional construction emissions associated with

                                                                                      City of Pomona
                                                   11

development of the proposed project were calculated using the CalEEMOD Version 2011.1.1
(2011) software. The construction emissions are analyzed using the regional thresholds
established by the SCAQMD and published in the CEQA Air Quality Handbook. The construction
activities associated with development would generate diesel emissions and dust. Construction
equipment that would generate criteria air pollutants includes excavators, graders, haul trucks,
and loaders. Some of this equipment would be used during both grading and construction. It is
assumed that all of the construction equipment used would be diesel-powered.

Operational emissions associated with onsite development were estimated using CalEEMOD
software and the information provided in the traffic study prepared by Linscott, Law &
Greenspan, Engineers (April 2013). Operational emissions would be comprised of mobile source
emissions, energy emissions, and area source emissions. Mobile source emissions are generated
by the increase in motor vehicle trips to and from the project site associated with operation of
onsite development. Emissions attributed to energy use include electricity and natural gas
consumption for space and water heating. Area source emissions are generated by landscape
maintenance equipment, consumer products and architectural coating.

To determine whether a significant regional air quality impact would occur, the increases in
emissions generated by the proposed project were compared to the SCAQMD's recommended
regional thresholds for both construction and operational emissions. A significant adverse air
quality impact may occur when a project individually or cumulatively interferes with progress
toward the attainment of the ozone standard by generating emissions that equal or exceed the
established long term quantitative thresholds for pollutants, or exceed a state or federal ambient
air quality standard for any criteria pollutant.

In addition to the thresholds shown in Table 1, the SCAQMD has developed Localized
Significance Thresholds (LSTs) in response to the Governing Board's Environmental Justice
Enhancement Initiative (1-4), which was prepared to update the CEQA Air Quality Handbook.
LSTs were devised in response to concern regarding exposure of individuals to criteria
pollutants in local communities. LSTs represent the maximum emissions from a project that
would not cause or contribute to an air quality exceedance of the most stringent applicable
federal or state ambient air quality standard at the nearest sensitive receptor, taking into
consideration ambient concentrations in each source receptor area (SRA), project size, and
distance to the sensitive receptor. However, LSTs only apply to emissions within a fixed
stationary location, including idling emissions during both project construction and operation.
LSTs have been developed for NOX, CO, PM10, and PM2.5. LSTs are not applicable to mobile
sources, such as cars on a roadway (SCAQMD, July 2008). As such, LSTs for operational
emissions do not apply to on-site development, as the majority of operational emissions would
be generated by cars on the roadways.

LSTs have been developed for emissions within construction areas up to five acres in size. The
SCAQMD provides lookup tables for project sites that measure one, two, or five acres. The three
parcels encompassing project site total approximately 2.5 acres. Therefore this analysis uses the
five acre LSTs. According to the SCAQMD's publication, Final Localized Significant Thresholds
Methodology, the use of LSTs is voluntary, to be implemented at the discretion of local agencies.
LSTs for construction on a five-acre site in are shown in Table 2 at various distances from



                                                                                    City of Pomona

sensitive receptors. The City of Pomona falls under Source Receptor Area (SRA) 10; therefore,
the LST thresholds shown in Table 2 correspond to this SRA area.

a) According to SCAQMD Guidelines, to be consistent with the Air Quality Management Plan
(AQMP) (2012), a project must conform to the local General Plan and must not result in or
contribute to an exceedance of the City's projected population growth forecast. According to the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), the current population of Pomona is
149,058 (SCAG, 2011). SCAG estimates the population of Pomona will continue to grow to
168,500 persons by the year 2020 and 197,400 persons by the year 2035 (SCAG, 2012). Based
upon California Department of Finance (DOF) data (2012), the average household size in
Pomona is 3.78 persons per household. Therefore, the proposed project's estimated increase in
population would be 234 persons, which equates to approximately 1.2% of Pomona's estimated
population growth through the year 2020. Therefore, the project would not contribute to an
exceedance of the City's projected population growth forecast. The project's potential impact
with respect to regional air quality management plans would be less than significant.

b-c) The proposed project would generate temporary air pollutant emissions during
construction and long-term operational emissions due to energy use. Both construction and
operational emissions associated with the proposed project are discussed below.

Construction Emissions
Construction vehicles and equipment traveling along unpaved roads, grading, trenching, and
stockpiled soils have the potential to generate fugitive dust (PM10 and PM2.5) through the
exposure of soil to wind erosion and dust entrainment. In addition, exhaust emissions
associated with the operation of heavy construction equipment could potentially degrade local
air quality. Project-related construction activities would also emit ozone precursors (oxides of
nitrogen (NOX), reactive organic gases (ROG)) as well as carbon monoxide (CO). The majority of
construction-related emissions would result from site preparation and grading due to the use of
heavy duty construction equipment. Air pollutants would also be emitted during building
construction due to the evaporation of ROGs during the application of architectural coatings
(paint) to the building exteriors.


                                                                                                    City of Pomona

CalEEMod calculates construction emissions during the various phases of project construction,
including demolition, building construction, site preparation, grading, paving, and architectural
coating. As indicated in Table 3, maximum daily emissions from construction activities would
not exceed SCAQMD construction thresholds for any of the criteria air pollutants. Therefore,
construction impacts would be less than significant.

         1. Maximum daily emissions account for the overlap of construction phases. These values represent the
            worse-case scenario. Maximum daily emissions would not occur each day of the construction period.
         2. The season with the highest emissions calculated for each pollutant was used. Winter emissions were
            used for all pollutants.


Operational Emissions
Long-term operational emissions associated with the proposed project are those attributed to
vehicle trips (mobile emissions), the use of natural gas (energy emissions), consumer products,
architectural coatings, and landscaping equipment (area emissions). CalEEMod was used to
calculate emissions based on the land uses for the proposed project and the number of vehicle trips
generated by development. As shown in Table 4, overall emissions would not exceed SCAQMD
operational thresholds. Therefore, operational impacts associated with the proposed project
would be less than significant.

d) Table 5 compares the project's estimated on-site construction emissions to the SCAQMD's
LSTs. The nearest sensitive receptors with respect to the LSTs are the residences located directly
south of the project site. Single-family residential dwellings are located within 15 feet of the
proposed grading boundary. Therefore, LSTs were evaluated using a distance of 25 meters, or
82 feet. The thresholds are relative only to those emissions that occur within a five-acre area,
such as onsite grading emissions or stationary source emissions, and do not apply to offsite
mobile emissions. Emissions generated by the proposed project during construction would not
exceed LSTs during any phase of construction. Impacts to nearby sensitive receptors would
therefore be less than significant.

e) The proposed project would be used for residential purposes and would not generate
objectionable odors. No impact related to odors would occur.

a) A search of the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) determined that there are
five sensitive plant species and four sensitive animal species within a two-mile radius of the
project site. Figure 4 shows the locations of sensitive elements and critical habitat in the project
area.

The sensitive plant species include: intermediate mariposa-lily (Calochortus weedii var.
intermedius), many-stemmed dudleya (Dudleya multicaulis), mesa horkelia (Horkelia cuneata var.
puberula), Robinson's pepper-grass (Lepidium virginicum var. robinsonii), and San Bernadino aster
(Symphyotrichum defoliatum). None of the plants have a federal or state listing status (CDFW,
2013). The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) rank is either 1b.1 or 1b.2 for
each plant species, which indicates that they are all rare or endangered in California and
elsewhere. However, the project site is currently developed with a mobile home park and the
vacant portions of the site are highly disturbed. The project site is surrounded by urban uses,
primarily consisting of paved surfaces. In addition, there have been no recorded sitings of these


                                                                                          City of Pomona

species on the project site. As such, the project site would not provide suitable habitat for
sensitive plant species. Impacts to sensitive plant species would be less than significant.

The sensitive animal species in the project area include: big free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops
macrotis), coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), western mastiff bat
(Eumops perotis californicus), and western yellow bat (Lasiurus xanthinus). All of the sensitive
animal species within the project area are listed as CDFW species of special concern (CDFW,
2011). None of the species have state or federal listing status, except the coastal California
gnatcatcher is federally listed as threatened (CDFW, 2011). As shown in Figure 4, no sightings

of sensitive species have been reported on the project site. Suitable habitat for the big free-tailed
bat and the western mastiff bat is not present on-site, as the big free-tailed bat prefers arid, high-
relief landscapes and the western mastiff bat typically roosts in crevices in vertical cliffs, high
buildings, trees, and tunnels (Bolster, 1998 and CDFW, 1995). However, the western yellow bat
is believed to be expanding its range with the increased usage of ornamental palms in
landscaping (Bolster, 1998). To ensure that roosting habitat for western yellow bats would not
be disturbed during construction of the proposed project, Mitigation Measure BIO-2 would be
required. While sensitive bird species are not known to be present on-site, Mitigation Measure
BIO-1 would further ensure that impacts would be less than significant. With the
implementation of Mitigation Measures BIO-1 and BIO-2, impacts to sensitive animal
species would be less than significant.

b, c) The project site is currently developed with a mobile home park and the vacant portions of
the site are highly disturbed. The proposed project is located in an urban/developed area and
there are no riparian habitats, sensitive communities, or wetlands on-site or in the project
vicinity (USFWS, 2013). As such, there would be no habitat or wetlands impacts.

d) The site is not located within a known migration corridor or native wildlife nursery. The
project site is currently developed with a mobile home park and the vacant portions of the site
are highly disturbed. Due to the urban nature of the site, little local movement is expected to
occur through the project site except for nesting or foraging birds and small reptile and
mammal (rodent) species. Because there are some trees and shrubs on-site that could provide
habitat for nesting birds, Mitigation Measure BIO-1 would be required. With the
implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-1, impacts to nesting birds would be less than
significant.

                      shall be kept in place until the nest becomes inactive (vacated). To
                      the extent determined necessary by the qualified biologist, limits of
                      construction shall be established around the trees containing any
                      active nests. The limits of construction to avoid a nest shall be
                      established in the field with flagging and stakes or construction
                      fencing. Encroachment into buffers around active nests must be
                      conducted at the discretion of a qualified biologist. Construction
                      personnel shall be instructed on the sensitivity of the area by a
                      qualified biologist hired by the project proponent and endorsed by
                      the City of Pomona's Planning Department. The applicant shall
                      record the results of the recommended protective measures

                     roosting in areas that will be impacted, prior to construction, the
                     applicant shall prepare a plan to exclude bat species from impact area.
                     If bats cannot be excluded from bat roosts, work activities will be

                     been weaned and are deemed independent by a qualified biologist.
                     CDFW will be contacted for additional guidance if roosting bats are
                     observed within the project area during construction.

e, f) The proposed project would not conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting
biological resources, and the project site is not within any habitat conservation plans or any
other regional planning areas. Therefore, no impact would occur.

a) No portion of the project site is not listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR), or as a locally significant property in the
City of Pomona. The property at 934 W. Holt Avenue is occupied by a circa 1885 residence and
a trailer court established during the 1940s. Because of the age of these facilities, a historic
resources report was prepared to determine whether they are eligible for national, state, or local
listing as historic resources. The findings of that report, prepared by San Buenaventura
Research Associates and included in Appendix B, are summarized below.

The property consists of a several buildings, including a wood frame residence, two stucco-clad
commercial buildings, and two additional residences. The balance of the site is a trailer park
featuring older trailer coaches organized around an internal driveway loop. The original owner
of this property is not currently known, though it is likely that much of its current appearance is
the result of alterations made circa 1947 when the property was converted to a trailer court by
the Richter family.

NRHP and CRHR Eligibility
This property does not appear to be closely associated with any historical event. Residence 1
(constructed circa 1885) is no longer representative of the early settlement of Pomona during the
1880s due to the extensive alterations that occurred to the building, primarily after circa 1947
when the property was converted to a trailer court. It is generally representative of the
evolution of this section of W. Holt Avenue to automobile-oriented businesses during the
postwar era, but it does not appear to have played any notable role in this transition (NRHP
Criterion A and CRHR Criterion 1). The property was owned from circa 1945 through at least
the mid-1970s by the Richter family. Harold F. Richter was an active member of the Pomona
community but he does not appear to have lived on this property for more than a short time
near the end of his life (NRHP Criterion B and CRHR Criterion 2). None of the extant buildings
on the property are representative examples of an architectural style or type of construction
(NRHP Criterion C and CRHR Criterion 3). The circa 1885 residence is a highly altered example
of a Folk Victorian house and the other buildings on the property are extensively altered.

Local Significance and Eligibility
City of Pomona Historic Landmark Designation Criteria (Pomona City Code, §5809-13 D) are
discussed below.

Criterion 1: This property does not appear to "exemplif[y] or reflect[s] special elements of the
City of Pomona's cultural, social, economic, political, aesthetic, engineering, architectural, or
natural history." The property is a combination of a highly altered example of a circa 1885
residence, and a typical example of automobile-oriented postwar development from the late
1940s.

Criterion 2: It does not appear to be "identified with persons or events significant in local, state,
or national history." The original owner is not currently known. Harold Richter appears to have
been somewhat active in community affairs, but not to a significant extent. His association with
the property also appears to be somewhat tenuous, as he seems to have lived elsewhere while
managing the trailer court, at least into the 1960s.



                                                                                       City of Pomona

Criterion 3: The property does not "embod[y] distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period,
or method of construction, or is a valuable example of the use of indigenous materials or
craftsmanship." The buildings on the property are a highly altered example of a circa 1885
residence, and a typical example of automobile-oriented postwar development from the late
1940s.

Criterion 4: The property does not "contribute[s] to the significance of a historic area, being a
geographically definable area possessing a concentration of historic or scenic properties or
thematically related grouping of properties which contribute to each other and are unified
aesthetically by plan or physical development." This property does not appear to have the
ability to contribute to the formation of a historic district in this area.

Criterion 5: The property does not appear to be "the work of a notable building, designer,
landscape designer, or architect." Building permits for this property were not available for
examination but it appears unlikely that a known or notable designer was responsible for any of
the buildings on the property.

Criterion 6: The property does not represent "a unique location or singular physical
characteristics or is a view or vista representing an established and familiar visual feature of a
neighborhood, community, or the City of Pomona." It is one of numerous examples of its type
in the City.

Criterion 7: The property does not "embod[y] elements of architectural design, detail, materials,
or craftsmanship that represent a significant structural or architectural achievement or
innovation." The buildings on the property are a highly altered example of a circa 1885
residence, and a typical example of automobile-oriented postwar development from the late
1940s.

Criterion 8: The property does not appear to be "similar to other distinctive properties, sites,
areas, or objects based on a historic, cultural, or architectural motif." This and other commercial
arterials in Pomona were recently evaluated citywide as part of the Corridors Specific Plan. The
historic resources evaluation associated with this planning effort did not identify this property
as significant or eligible.

Criterion 9: The property does not appear to "reflect[s] significant geographical patterns,
including those associated with different eras of settlement and growth, particular
transportation modes, or distinctive examples of park or community planning." The buildings
on the property are a highly altered example of a circa 1885 residence, and a typical example of
automobile-oriented postwar development from the late 1940s.

Criterion 10: The property does not appear to be "one of the few remaining examples in the
City of Pomona, region, state, or nation possessing distinguishing characteristics of an
architectural or historical type or specimen." The property is a combination of a highly altered
example of a circa 1885 residence, and a typical example of automobile-oriented postwar
development from the late 1940s.

Based on the above, there would be no impact to historic resources.

                                                                                      City of Pomona

b, c) There are no notable geologic features on-site. A portion of the project site is currently
developed and the vacant portions were previously developed with residences. Due to existing
and recent development on the project site, unique archaeological or paleontological resources
are not anticipated. In addition, the project site is predominantly flat and would not require
substantial grading or excavation that would disturb subsurface materials. Nevertheless, project
construction has the potential to disturb undiscovered resources during grading. This is a
potentially significant impact unless mitigation is incorporated. Impacts would be less than
significant after implementation of Mitigation Measure CR-1.

        CR-1 Archaeological Assessment and Remediation. If unanticipated
             archaeological or paleontological resource remains are encountered
             during construction activities (any permitted action requiring physical
             digging or grading of a project area using mechanical equipment or hand
             tools, including core sampling, soil borings, work required for placing
             caissons or footings, planting trees, disking, grubbing, trenching and
             installation of poles, underground electrical systems, sewers, water
             mains, or other utilities, or geological/ geotechnical testing) work shall
             cease until the nature, extent, and possible significance of any cultural
             remains can be assessed and, if found to be significant pursuant to
             Section 15064.5 of the California Code of Regulations (CEQA Guidelines),
             remediated. Such assessment and remediation shall be implemented by
             the City through consultation with a qualified cultural resources
             professional prior to recommencement with onsite construction/grading
             activities. If remediation is necessary, possible techniques include
             removal, documentation, curation, or avoidance of the resource,
             depending upon the nature of the find. Cultural resource remains may
             include artifacts, shell, bone, features, foundations, trash pits and privies,
             etc.

d) There is no evidence of human remains on-site. Nevertheless, the proposed project could
have the potential to disturb undiscovered human remains. The California Health and Safety
Code §7050.5, Public Resources Code § 5097.98, and § 15064.5 of the California Code of
Regulations (CEQA Guidelines) mandate procedures to be followed, including that, if human
remains are encountered during excavation, all work must halt, and the County Coroner must
be notified (Section 7050.5 of the California Health and Safety Code). The coroner will
determine whether the remains are of forensic interest. If the coroner, with the aid of the
supervising archaeologist, determines that the remains are prehistoric, the coroner will contact
the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC). The NAHC will be responsible for
designating the most likely descendant (MLD) responsible for the ultimate disposition of the
remains, as required by Section 5097.98 of the Public Resources Code. The MLD should make
his/her recommendations within 48 hours of their notification by the NAHC. This
recommendation may include A) the non-destructive removal and analysis of human remains
and items associated with Native American human remains; (B) preservation of Native
American human remains and associated items in place; (C) relinquishment of Native American
human remains and associated items to the descendants for treatment; or (D) other culturally
appropriate treatment. Section 7052 of the Health & Safety Code also states that disturbance of



                                                                                     City of Pomona

would be less than significant.

            Would the project:
a) Expose people or structures to potential
   substantial adverse effects, including the
   risk of loss, injury, or death involving:
      i)     Rupture of a known earthquake fault,
             as delineated on the most recent
             Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
             Zoning Map issued by the State
             Geologist for the area or based on
             other substantial evidence of a known
             fault?


      ii)    Strong seismic ground shaking?
      iii) Seismic-related ground failure,
           including liquefaction?
      iv) Landslides?
b) Result in substantial soil erosion or the
   loss of topsoil?
c) Be located on a geologic unit or soil that is
   unstable as a result of the project, and
   potentially result in on- or off-site
   landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence,
   liquefaction, or collapse?
d) Be located on expansive soil, as defined
   in Table 1-B of the Uniform Building Code,
   creating substantial risks to life or
   property?
e) Have soils incapable of adequately
   supporting the use of septic tanks or
   alternative wastewater disposal systems
   where sewers are not available for the
   disposal of wastewater?

a(i-iv)) The project site is not located within the boundaries of a Seismic Hazard Zone as defined
by the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act of 1972 (California Geological Survey, 1999).
The project site does not contain areas subject to liquefaction or earthquake induced landslides
as shown on the State of California Seismic Hazards Zone Map for the San Dimas Quadrangle
(California Geological Survey, 1999). Impacts would be less than significant.



                                                                                           City of Pomona

The project site is situated in a seismically active area that has historically been affected by
generally moderate to occasionally high levels of ground motion. In addition, the site lies in
relative close proximity to the following active faults, defined as having Holocene fault
displacement (during the past 11,700 years):

        San Andreas fault, 20 miles northwest of the project site
        Whittier Fault, 8.5 miles southwest of the project site
        Chino Fault, 6.0 miles south of the project site
        Raymond Fault, 15.5 miles west of the project site

There are severally potentially active faults, defined as having late Quarternary fault
displacement (during the past 700,000 years), in the area. These include:

        San Jose Fault, 0.25 miles north of the project site
        Central Avenue Fault, 2.25 miles south of the project site
        Sierra Madre Fault Zone, 2.0 miles north of the project site

Therefore, during the life of the proposed improvements, the property will probably experience
similar moderate to occasionally high ground shaking from these fault zones, as well as some
background shaking from other seismically active areas of the Southern California region.
However, the design and construction in accordance with the current California Building Code
(CBC) requirements would address issues related to potential ground shaking. Impacts would
be less than significant.

b) The project site is generally flat and located in an urban area that is developed and/or highly
disturbed. Therefore, soils on-site would have a relatively low risk of erosion. Nevertheless, site
development would be larger than one acre; therefore, the proposed project would be required
to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. A Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) would also be required to address erosion and discharge
impacts associated with the proposed onsite grading. For additional information, see Section IX,
Hydrology and Water Quality. As the proposed project would be required to adhere to the
City's grading requirements, obtain an NPDES permit, and prepare an SWPPP, soil erosion
hazard impacts would be less than significant.

c, d) Settlement and expansive soils are identified as potential hazards within the City (Pomona
General Plan, 1976). Soils in the project area consist of unconsolidated alluvium (medium
grain), which could susceptible to soil instability issues. Although subsidence generally occurs
slowly enough that its effects are not dangerous to inhabitants, it can cause substantial building
damage over time. In addition, the presence of expansive soils would require proper
engineering controls to ensure the safety of structures and inhabitants. The site-specific stability
of underlying soils is unknown. Should unstable soils exist, proper engineering controls would
need to be implemented to ensure the safety of structures and inhabitants. Impacts to soil
stability would be potentially significant, but mitigable. Implementation of Mitigation
Measure GEO-1 would be required to reduce impacts to a less than significant level.

                     shall include an analysis of the subsidence, settlement, and expansive
                     potential of the underlying materials. If the proposed project is
                     confirmed to be in an area prone to subsidence, settlement, or
                     expansive soils, appropriate techniques to minimize hazards shall be
                     prescribed and implemented. Suitable measures to reduce ground-
                     failure impacts could include, but are not limited to, the following:

                          Design of foundations by a structural engineer to address any identified
                          geotechnical hazards.
                          Removal or treatment of expansive soils
                          In-situ densification of soils
                          Replacement or recompaction of soils, or
                          Other alterations to the ground characteristics.

Seismic hazards cannot be completely eliminated even with site-specific geotechnical investigation
and advanced building practices described above. However, the building and design practices
described above would reduce the potential hazards associated with seismic activity to a less-than-
significant level.

e) The proposed project does not include any improvements that would require the use of septic
systems. Sewers are proposed to dispose of wastewater from the proposed project. Therefore,
no impact would occur.

VII.   GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -
       Would the project:
a) Generate greenhouse gas emissions,
   either directly or indirectly, that may have
   a significant impact on the environment?
b) Conflict with any applicable plan, policy,
   or regulation adopted for the purpose of
   reducing the emissions of greenhouse
   gases?


Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are often called greenhouse gases (GHGs), analogous to the
way in which a greenhouse retains heat. Common GHG include water vapor, carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2Ox), fluorinated gases, and ozone. GHGs are emitted by
both natural processes and human activities. Of these gases, CO2 and CH4 are emitted in the
greatest quantities from human activities. Emissions of CO2 are largely by-products of fossil fuel
combustion, whereas CH4 results from off-gassing associated with agricultural practices and
landfills. Man-made GHGs, many of which have greater heat-absorption potential than CO2,



                                                                                            City of Pomona

include fluorinated gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6) (Cal EPA, 2006).

The accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere regulates the earth's temperature. Without the
natural heat trapping effect of GHGs, Earth's surface would be about 34° C cooler (Cal EPA, 2006).
However, it is believed that emissions from human activities, particularly the consumption of fossil
fuels for electricity production and transportation, have elevated the concentration of these gases in
the atmosphere beyond the level of naturally occurring concentrations.

Pursuant to the requirements of SB 97, the Resources Agency adopted amendments to the CEQA
Guidelines for the feasible mitigation of GHG emissions and analysis of the effects of GHG
emissions. The adopted CEQA Guidelines provide regulatory guidance on the analysis and
mitigation of GHG emissions in CEQA documents, while giving lead agencies the discretion to
set quantitative or qualitative thresholds for the assessment and mitigation of GHGs and
climate change impacts. The SCAQMD is considering a tiered approach with locally adopted
GHG reduction plans followed by GHG threshold values set to capture 90 percent of project
GHG emissions by project type. SCAQMD's current proposed threshold is 3,000 metric tons
CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) per year (SCAQMD, "Proposed Tier 3 Screening Levels ­
Residential/Commercial Projects, September 2008). For the purposes of this analysis, the City of
Pomona will use the 3,000 metric tons per year threshold to determine if the proposed project's
contribution to cumulative impacts would be considered significant.

Construction and operation of the proposed project would generate air pollutant emissions that
have the potential generate GHG emissions through the burning of fossil fuels or other
emissions of GHGs, thus potentially contributing to cumulative impacts related to global
climate change. Emissions associated with the project's construction period and long term
operational emissions were estimated using the California Emissions Estimator Model
(CalEEMod) computer program. Complete CalEEMod results and assumptions can be viewed
in Appendix A.

a) The proposed project's construction activities, energy use, daily operational activities, and
mobile sources (traffic) would generate quantities of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The
California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod) was used to calculate emissions resulting
from project construction and long-term operation. The project-related construction emissions
are confined to a relatively short period of time in relation to the overall life of the proposed
project. Therefore, the construction GHG emissions were amortized over a 30-year period to
determine the annual construction-related GHG emissions over the life of the project. As shown
in Table 6, the combined annual GHG emissions associated with the proposed project would be
837.51 metric tons CO2e. This is less than the proposed SCAQMD threshold of 3,000 metric tons per
year. Therefore, impacts from GHG emissions would be less than significant

b) In April 2012, the South Coast Association of Government (SCAG) adopted the 2012-2035
Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS). SCAG's RTP/SCS
includes a strong commitment to reduce emissions from transportation sources by promoting
compact and infill development. A goal of the SCS is to "promote the development of better
places to live and work through measures that encourage more compact development, varied
housing options, bike and pedestrian improvements, and efficient transportation
infrastructure." The proposed project would be infill development that would also be located
within walking distance of commercial retail, civic, and recreational uses, thereby reducing
vehicle trips. It would also be consistent with the SCS goal of "creating more compact
neighborhoods and place everyday destinations closer to homes and closer to one another." The
proposed project is also consistent with energy efficiency measures because it would comply
with Title 24, the California Building Energy Efficiency Program. As discussed above and in
Tables 7 and 8, below, the proposed project would not conflict with any applicable plan, policy,
or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Impacts
would be less than significant.

The California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) CEQA Guidelines also include recommended
mitigation strategies to reduce GHG impacts. According to this document, mitigation measures
may include:

    1. Potential measures to reduce wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary consumption of energy
       during construction, operation, maintenance and/or removal.
    2. The potential of siting, orientation, and design to minimize energy consumption, including
       transportation energy, water conservation and solid-waste reduction.
    3. The potential for reducing peak energy demand.
    4. Alternate fuels (particularly renewable ones) or energy systems.
    5. Energy conservation which could result from recycling efforts.

Consistent with OPR mitigation strategies, onsite development would reduce wasteful,
inefficient and unnecessary consumption of energy and utilize alternative fuels by complying
with requirements of Part 6, Title 24 of the California Building Standards Code ­ California
Energy Code. The City of Pomona requires all multi-family uses to have recycling programs.
Therefore, recycling efforts would also comply with OPR strategies. The proposed project
would be consistent with CAT and Attorney General Strategies, as demonstrated in Tables 7
and 8, as well as OPR strategies, as discussed above.

GHG emissions generated by the proposed project would not have a significant adverse impact
on the environment. The project would not conflict with applicable plans, policies, or
regulations adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of GHGs. Therefore, the
contribution of onsite development to cumulative global climate change impacts would be
less than significant.

      MATERIALS - Would the project:
d) Be located on a site which is included on
   a list of hazardous material sites compiled
   pursuant to Government Code Section
   65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a
   significant hazard to the public or the
   environment?
e) For a project located within an airport land
   use plan or, where such a plan has not
   been adopted, within two miles of a public
   airport or public use airport, would the
   project result in a safety hazard for people
   residing or working in the project area?
f)   For a project within the vicinity of a private
     airstrip, would the project result in a safety
     hazard for people residing or working in
     the project area?
g) Impair implementation of or physically
   interfere with an adopted emergency
   response plan or emergency evacuation
   plan?
h) Expose people or structures to a
   significant risk of loss, injury, or death
   involving wildland fires, including where
   wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas
   or where residences are intermixed with
   wildlands?

a, b) Exposure to hazardous materials during the construction and operation the project could
result from: (1) exposure of contaminated soil or groundwater during grading; (2) the improper
handling or use of hazardous substances; (3) transportation accident; or (4) inadvertent release
resulting from an unforeseen event (e.g., fire, flood, or earthquake). The severity of any such
exposure is dependent upon the type, amount, and characteristic of the hazardous material
involved; the timing, location, and nature of the event; and the sensitivity of the individual or
environment affected. A Phase I ESA was prepared for the currently vacant parcels on the
project site by P&D Consultants in 2008. The Phase I ESA reported that there was no evidence of
hazardous materials or soil stains observed on-site and no past or present usage or conditions
appeared to be of environmental concern. No further environmental investigation for this site
was recommended. In addition, the existing use of the remainder of the project site as a mobile
home park would not be expected to handle, store, or dispose of hazardous materials. A site
reconnaissance visit was performed by Rincon Consultants, Inc. on March 25, 2013, and no
evidence of hazardous materials were observed. Existing structures on-site would be inspected
for evidence of any asbestos and lead-containing materials prior to demolition, in compliance
with all pertinent existing rules and regulations, including SCAQMD Rule 1403, Asbestos

Emissions from Demolition/Renovation Activities, which would minimize health hazards
associated with these activities. In addition, the proposed project would comply with CalOSHA
regulations regarding lead-based materials. California Code of Regulations, §1532.1, requires
testing, monitoring, containment, and disposal of lead-based materials such that exposure levels
do not exceed CalOSHA standards. Impacts resulting from the use, storage, disposal, or
release of hazardous materials during construction of the proposed project would be less
than significant.

Operation of the proposed project would not involve the transport, storage, disposal, or use of
large quantities of hazardous materials. There would be some on-site storage of household
hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents and paint. However, compliance with existing
household hazardous waste programs would ensure that impacts would be less than
significant. Impacts resulting from the use, storage, disposal, or release of hazardous
materials during operation of the proposed project would be less than significant.

c) St. Joseph Elementary School is located approximately 900 feet from the project site. As
discussed under items a and b, there are no recognized environmental conditions on-site that
would result in the release of hazardous materials within the vicinity of a school during
construction. Because the proposed project is an apartment complex, operation of the proposed
project would not handle or emit hazardous materials. There would be some on-site storage of
household hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents and paint. However, compliance with
existing household hazardous waste programs would ensure that impacts would be less than
significant. Impacts related to the release of hazardous materials within one-mile of a school
would be less than significant.

d) There is no evidence of a hazardous environmental condition on the project site. The project
site is not listed on the Cortese list or listed in the Site Mitigation and Brownfields Reuse
Program Database, as maintained by the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)
Envirostar database. Furthermore, the project site is not listed on the lists of Leaking
Underground Storage Tanks (LUST) Geotracker database, as maintained by the State Water
Resources Control Board (SWRCB). Although no LUSTs were identified on the project site, the
EnviroStor database identified 14 LUST sites within a half-mile of the project site. However, 11
of the 14 LUST cases have been closed. In addition, the three LUST sites with active site
assessments all list soil as the affected media. Soil contamination on these three sites would not
be expected to affect the project site. There is also a state cleanup site at 822 West Commercial
Street (Calsol, Inc.), which is approximately 725 feet southeast of the project site. Potential media
affected includes soil, soil vapor, and groundwater. Soil contamination at this site would not be
expected to affect the proposed project. Groundwater flow in the vicinity of the Calsol Inc. site
in the uppermost groundwater zone is southerly and regional groundwater flow in the
downgradient area west of Calsol Inc. is westerly (SCS Engineers, 2008). As such, groundwater
contamination from this cleanup site would not be expected to affect groundwater at the project
site, which lies to the northwest. Due to the media affected and the groundwater flow in the
project area, impacts resulting from hazardous materials releases in the project area would be
less than significant.

e, f) The Brackett Field Airport, a general aviation airport, is located approximately 1.7 miles
north of the project site. A review of the Los Angeles County Airport Land Use Plan confirmed

not construct any structures that would interfere with flight patterns or airport operations. No
impact would occur.

g) The proposed project is an infill project within the City of Pomona. As such, the proposed
project would not change any circulation patterns, and there would be no impact to existing
evacuation routes or emergency response plans. In addition, the proposed project would
comply with all Los Angeles County Fire Department standards for emergency access. No
impact would occur.
h) The proposed project is an infill project within the City of Pomona. According to the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE)(2011), the project site is

a, c, f) The eastern portion of the project site is currently developed with a mobile home park
and drainage leaves the site overland and flows into the City's storm drain system. Storm water
on the undeveloped portions of the project site to the west currently percolate into the soil,
although this area was previously developed and historical drainage was likely overland. Soil
exposed during site grading and construction could potentially be transported into area storm
drains during rain events. This off-site transport of sediments and other pollutants could have
major impacts on water quality, especially if wet weather occurs during construction activities.
Therefore, if not properly managed, soil stockpiles and grading activities on the project site
could result in erosion from wind and rain and could increase the quantity of sediment in local
drainages. However, construction-related stormwater pollutant discharges from the project site
would be temporary and would be controlled through compliance with the applicable National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements.

The project site is within the region covered by the Los Angeles County Municipal Storm Water
NPDES Permit No. CAS004001 issued by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control
Board (LARWQCB). This permit governs non-point source discharges associated with storm
water runoff. Regulations under the federal Clean Water Act require compliance with the
NPDES storm water permit for projects disturbing more than one acre during construction. Per
State regulations, the applicant would be required to file a Notice of Intent with the Los Angeles
Regional Water Quality Control Board (LARWQCB) and prepare a Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The SWPPP would require the use of BMPs (such as gravel bags, silt
fences, hay bales, check dams, hydro seed, mulch, and soil binders) during construction, which
would prevent excessive storm water runoff pollution. The project would also be required to
prepare a Standard Urban Storm Water Management Plan (SUSMP), which requires the

                                                                                          City of Pomona
                                                      36

integration of post-construction BMPs into the site's overall drainage system, which would
further reduce the potential for pollutants to enter the storm drain system. The SWPPP and
SUSMP must be approved by the City prior to the issuance of a grading or building permit.
With implementation of the proposed SUSMP drainage improvements and the standard
construction-related SWPPP BMPs discussed above, water quality impacts from runoff
during temporary construction activities and long-term operational activities would be less
than significant.

b) Water service within Pomona is provided by the Pomona Public Works Department with
supply sources including groundwater, treated surface water, imported water and water
conservation. Approximately 68% of the City's water supply comes from groundwater (UWMP,
2011). However, the project site is located in the Spadra Groundwater Basin, which has a
limited amount of natural and return flow recharge to the aquifer system due to urbanization
and the lining of San Jose Creek (UWMP, 2011). As such, the project site does not substantially
contribute to groundwater recharge that would affect groundwater supplies. In addition, the
eastern portion of the project site is currently developed, and, while the western portion is
currently undeveloped, it has historically been developed with a residence. Therefore, the
project site would not interfere with groundwater recharge and impacts would be less than
significant.

Section XVII, Utilities and Service Systems, includes an analysis of water supplies available to
serve the proposed project.

d, e) The proposed project would increase the quantity of on-site impervious surfaces, which
could increase the amount of water that is discharged to the storm drain system. However, the
Los Angeles County Flood Control District (LACFCD) requires the proposed project to include
on-site drainage infrastructure to ensure that receiving water peak flows would not be increased
above pre-development volumes. Furthermore, the proposed project would include drainage
improvements that capture runoff on-site and discharge it to the storm drain system at rates
that would not exceed the pre-project condition. Therefore, project site runoff would not exceed
the capacity of storm drain facilities that serve the project site or the surrounding areas. The
project's proposed drainage plan would be consistent with LACFCD requirements and thus
impacts would be less than significant.

g, h, i) The project site is not located within FEMA Flood Zone X, which is defined as an area of
"0.2% annual chance of flood; areas of 1% annual chance of flood with average depths of less
than 1 foot or with drainage areas less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from
1% annual chance of flood (FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map No. 06037C1725F)." Therefore, the
proposed project would not impede or redirect flood flows (FEMA 2008). No impact would
occur.

j) Seiches are oscillations of the surface of inland bodies of water that vary in period from a few
minutes to several hours. Seismic excitations can induce such oscillations. Tsunamis are large
sea waves produced by submarine earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. The project site is not
located close to body of water and is not located at least 1,000 feet above sea level. Therefore, the
proposed project would not be affected by a tsunami or seiche. Furthermore, the project site is
flat and surrounded by urban development. As such, the project site would not be subject to
mudflows. There would be no impact resulting from a tsunami, seiche, or mudflow.

                                                                                      City of Pomona

X.    LAND USE AND PLANNING --
      Would the proposal:
a) Physically divide an established
   community?
b) Conflict with any applicable land use plan,
   policy, or regulation of an agency with
   jurisdiction over the project (including, but
   not limited to the general plan, specific
   plan, local coastal program, or zoning
   ordinance) adopted for the purpose of
   avoiding or mitigating an environmental
   effect?
c) Conflict with an applicable habitat
   conservation plan or natural community
   conservation plan?

a) The proposed project would be located on an existing developed lot and a vacant lot that was
previously developed with a residence. The project site is an infill site within the City.
Therefore, construction of the proposed project would not divide an established community
and there would be no impact.

b) The proposed project would require a conditional use permit, a general plan amendment, a
variance, and a zone change. Approval of the proposed entitlements would ensure that the
proposed project would be consistent with applicable general plan and zoning policies. In
addition, the proposed project would be consistent with the Corridors Specific Plan, which is
currently underway and would include the project site. Therefore, impacts would be less than
significant.

c) The project site is located within an urban area and is not governed by an adopted habitat or
natural conservation plan. Therefore, no impact would occur.

a,b) The California Department of Conservation does not designate Pomona as being within a
Significant Mineral Aggregate Resource Area (SMARA), nor is it located in an area with active
mineral extraction activities. Therefore, no impact to mineral resources would occur.

XII.     NOISE ­ Would the project result in:
a) Exposure of persons to or generation of
   noise levels in excess of standards
   established in the local general plan or
   noise ordinance, or applicable standards
   of other agencies?
b) Exposure of persons to or generation of
   excessive groundborne vibration or
   groundborne noise levels?
c) A substantial permanent increase in
   ambient noise levels above levels existing
   without the project?
d) A substantial temporary or periodic
   increase in ambient noise levels in the
   project vicinity above levels existing
   without the project?
e) For a project located within an airport land
   use plan or, where such a plan has not
   been adopted, within two miles of a public
   airport or public use airport, would the
   project expose people residing or working
   in the project area to excessive noise
   levels?
f)     For a project within the vicinity of a private
       airstrip, would the project expose people
       residing or working in the project area to
       excessive noise?

Noise level (or volume) is generally measured in decibels (dB) using the A-weighted sound
pressure level (dBA). The A-weighting scale is an adjustment to the actual sound power levels
consistent with the human hearing response, which is most sensitive to frequencies around
4,000 Hertz (about the highest note on a piano) and less sensitive to low frequencies (below 100
Hertz).

Sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale with the 0 dBA level based on the
lowest detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible sound that is not
zero sound pressure level). Based on the logarithmic scale, a doubling of sound energy is
equivalent to an increase of 3 dBA, and a sound that is 10 dBA less than the ambient sound level
has no effect on ambient noise. Because of the nature of the human ear, a sound must be about
10 dB greater than the reference sound to be judged as twice as loud. In general, a 3 dBA change

                                                                                              City of Pomona
                                                          39
West Holt Avenue Apartment Project

in community noise levels is noticeable, while 1-2 dBA changes generally are not perceived.
Quiet suburban areas typically have noise levels in the range of 40-50 dBA, while those along
arterial streets are in the 50-60+ dBA range. Normal conversational levels are in the 60-65 dBA
range, and ambient noise levels greater than 65 dBA can interrupt conversations.

In addition to the instantaneous measurement of sound levels, the duration of sound is
important since sounds that occur over a long period of time are more likely to be an annoyance
or cause direct physical damage or environmental stress. One of the most frequently used noise
metrics that considers both duration and sound power level is the equivalent noise level (Leq).
The Leq is defined as the single steady A-weighted level that is equivalent to the same amount of
energy as that contained in the actual fluctuating levels over a period of time (essentially, the
average noise level). Typically, Leq is summed over a one-hour period.

The time period in which noise occurs is also important since noise that occurs at night tends to
be more disturbing than that which occurs during the daytime. Two commonly used noise
metrics ­ the Day-Night average level (Ldn) and the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
recognize this fact by weighting hourly Leqs over a 24-hour period. The Ldn is a 24-hour average
noise level that adds 10 dB to actual nighttime (10:00 PM to 7:00 AM) noise levels to account for
the greater sensitivity to noise during that time period. The CNEL is identical to the Ldn, except
it also adds a 5 dB penalty for noise occurring during the evening (7:00 PM to 10:00 PM).

Vibration is sound radiated through the ground. The rumbling sound caused by the vibration of
room surfaces is called ground borne noise. Ground borne vibration is almost exclusively a
concern inside buildings and is rarely perceived as a problem outdoors. Ground-borne
vibration related to human annoyance is generally related to velocity levels expressed in
vibration decibels (VdB). However, construction-related groundborne vibration in relation to its
potential for building damage can also be measured in inches per second (in/sec) peak particle
velocity (PPV) (Federal Transit Administration, May 2006). Based on the FTA's Transit Noise and
Vibration Impact Assessment and the California Department of Transportation's 1992
Transportation-Related Earthborne Vibration, Technical Advisory, vibration levels decrease by 6 VdB
with every doubling of distance.

Noise exposure goals for various types of land uses reflect the varying noise sensitivities
associated with those uses. Residences, hospitals, schools, guest lodging, libraries, and parks are
most sensitive to noise intrusion and therefore have more stringent noise exposure targets than
commercial or industrial uses that are not subject to impacts such as sleep disturbance. Sensitive
land uses generally should not be subjected to noise levels that would be considered intrusive
in character. Therefore, the location, hours of operation, type of use, and extent of development
warrant close analysis in an effort to ensure that noise sensitive receptors are not substantially
affected by noise.

Noise Standards
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has published guidelines for assessing the impacts of
groundborne vibration associated with construction activities, which have been applied by
other jurisdictions to other types of projects. The FTA measure of the threshold of architectural
damage for non-engineered timber and mason buildings (e.g., residential units) is 0.2 in/sec


                                                                                     City of Pomona

PPV. The threshold of perception of vibration is 0.01 in/sec PPV (Federal Transit
Administration, Office of Planning and the Environment, 2006).

Title 24, Section 3501 et. seq. of the California Code of Regulations codifies California Noise
Insulation Standards. This code section uses the Community Noise Equivalency Level (CNEL)
as its primary noise evaluation measurement. The CNEL measurement assesses noise variation
during different times of the day for the purposes of averaging noise over a 24-hour period.
Essentially, CNEL takes average sound levels at an observation point and adds a weighted
penalty to those sounds that occur during the evening and nighttime hours. An interior noise
level of 45 dBA CNEL is often considered the desirable noise exposure level for single-family
residential units. An exterior noise level of 65 dBA is generally considered an acceptable level
for residential and other noise-sensitive land uses.

The City of Pomona Municipal Code Chapter 18, Article VII, identifies interior and exterior
noise level standards for residential uses. Table 9 shows the City's noise level standards for
multi-family residential properties.

The Municipal Code also identifies vibration standards:

           "Notwithstanding other sections of this article, it shall be unlawful for any
           person to create, maintain or cause any ground vibration which is perceptible
           without instruments at any point on any affected property adjoining the
           property on which the vibration source is located. For the purpose of this article,
           the perception threshold shall be presumed to be more than 0.05 inch per second
           RMS vertical velocity."

Construction Noise
The proposed project would generate temporary (construction-related) noise over the duration
of the construction phase, which is estimated to occur over 12 months. Noise levels associated
with project construction would be substantially higher than existing ambient noise levels in the
project vicinity, but would cease upon completion of construction. Noise impacts experienced
on-site would vary depending on the type of construction equipment, the equipment's location,
the sensitivity of nearby land uses, and the timing/duration of construction. Typical

                                                                                                      City of Pomona

Initial Study - Mitigated Negative Declaration


construction noise levels range from about 78-88 dBA at a distance of 50 feet. There is a single-
family residence located approximately 15 feet south of the proposed project, as well as several
others within 50 feet. Construction noise would be audible at these locations and may cause
temporary disturbance during times of peak activity. To address temporary construction noise
impacts, the City of Pomona limits construction activities to the hours of 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM
Monday through Saturday, and prohibits construction anytime on Sundays and legal holidays,
provided the noise does not exceed the 65 dBA exterior noise level standard. Compliance with
existing noise timing restrictions would reduce impacts to a less than significant level. In
addition, Mitigation Measures N-1(a) through N-1(f) are recommended to further reduce
construction noise impacts on adjacent sensitive receptors.

        N-1      Acoustical Shelters. Air compressors and generators used for
                 construction shall be surrounded by temporary acoustical shelters if
                 within 100 feet of a sensitive receptor.

        N-2      Mufflers. During all project site excavation and grading, all construction
                 equipment, fixed or mobile, shall be operated with closed engine doors
                 and shall be equipped with properly operating and maintained mufflers
                 consistent with manufacturers' standards.

        N-3      Stationary Equipment and Equipment Staging. All equipment staging
                 and stationary construction equipment shall be located near the center of
                 the project site, or in a location that establishes at least a 100 foot setback
                 between the adjacent residential dwellings and construction staging areas
                 and stationary construction equipment.

        N-4      Electrically-Powered Tools and Facilities. To the extent practical,
                 electrical power shall be used to run air compressors and similar power
                 tools and to power any temporary structures, such as construction trailers
                 or caretaker facilities.

        N-5      Additional Noise Attentuation Techniques. For all noise-generating
                 construction activity on the project site, additional noise attenuation
                 techniques shall be employed as necessary to reduce noise levels. Such
                 techniques may include, but are not limited to, the use of sound blankets
                 on noise-generating equipment and the construction of temporary sound
                 barriers between construction sites and nearby sensitive receptors.

        N-6      City Enforcement - Noise. The Building Official of the City of La Verne
                 shall enforce noise-attenuating construction requirements.
                     Excavation, grading, and other construction activities related to the proposed
                     project shall comply with City restrictions on hours of construction activity.
                     All construction vehicles, such as bulldozers and haul trucks, shall be
                     prohibited from idling in excess of 5 minutes.
                     The contractor shall inspect construction equipment to ensure that such
                     equipment is in proper operating condition and fitted with standard factory

                     silencing features. Construction equipment shall utilize all standard factory
                     silencing features, such as equipment mufflers, enclosures, and barriers.

Operational Noise
The proposed project would also be considered a sensitive use. Onsite noise monitoring
conducted on March 21, 2013, measured onsite noise levels at 72.6 dBA Leq, which exceeds the
normally acceptable range for residential uses. As such, operation of the proposed project could
expose residents to excessive noise levels generated by traffic along West Holt Avenue.
However, compliance with existing California building code standards (Title 24) would require
incorporation of noise attenuation features to ensure that the proposed project would maintain
an interior noise level standard of 45 dBA. Such features could include, but are not limited to,
windows, wall assemblies, and exterior doors with a Sound Transmission Class (STC) sufficient
to achieve an acceptable interior noise level (based on the onsite measure, the STC rating would
need to be approximately 30 (the STC rating is roughly equivalent to the dBA reduction
required). Compliance with Title 24 would ensure that residents of the proposed project would
not be exposed to excessive noise. Impacts would be less than significant.

b) Vibration is a unique form of noise. It is unique because its energy is carried through
buildings, structures, and the ground, whereas noise is simply carried through the air. Thus,
vibration is generally felt rather than heard. Some vibration effects can be caused by noise; e.g.,
the rattling of windows from truck pass-bys. This phenomenon is caused by the coupling of the
acoustic energy at frequencies that are close to the resonant frequency of the material being
vibrated. Typically, groundborne vibration generated by manmade activities attenuates rapidly
as distance from the source of the vibration as vibration rapidly diminishes in amplitude with
distance from the source. In the U.S., the ground motion caused by vibration is measured as
particle velocity in inches per second and is also referenced as vibration decibels (VdB).

Construction activity on the project site would be temporary, and the use of heavy equipment
would be limited to the demolition, site preparation, grading and bulding construction phases.
As construction of the outer shell of the residential dwellings progresses, the residence itself
would contain much of the construction activity, and the likelihood of using bulldozers,
jackhammers, and other heavy equipoment decreases. Trucks would still be anticipated to bring
construction materials to the site throughout the building phases, which may periodically
generate vibrations that could be felt by nearby receptors; however, these vibrations likely
would not persist for long periods. Typical groundborne vibration levels for a large bulldozer is
87 VdB at 25 feet, 81 Vdb at 50 feet, and 75 Vdb at 100 feet, based on the Federal Transit
Administration's (FTA's) Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment (May 2006) as shown in
Table 10.

The existing residential uses located immediately east and south of the project site are located
within 25 feet of the construction envelope, and would be exposed to groundborne vibration
reaching approximately 87 VdB (large bulldozer at 25 feet). The exposure of nearby residents to
87 VdB is equivalent to a peak particle velocity of 0.089 inches per second or an RMS velocity of
0.003 inches per second (Harris, et al., 1995). As such, the exposure of nearby residences to
groundborne vibration would not exceed the City's standard of 0.05 RMS velocity. In addition,
the construction activity on the project site with the potential to cause groundborne vibration
would be temporary in duration and would be limited to the hours of 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM

Monday through Saturday, and would be prohibited anytime on Sundays and legal holidays.
This restriction would prevent construction vibration impacts associated with sleep disturbance
for nearby residents. Therefore, the proposed project's construction activity would not involve
any vibration sources that would expose people to excessive or prolonged groundborne
vibration or groundborne noise levels. Impacts would be less than significant.

c) The residential use of the proposed project would not generate excessive noise levels.
However, the proposed project could contribute to ambient noise levels through the increase in
vehicle trips along West Holt Avenue. The primary source of ambient noise in the project area is
traffic along West Holt Avenue. According to the traffic study (Linscott, Law & Greenspan
Engineers, 2013), the proposed project would generate approximately 412 daily trips. Based on
the existing peak hour volumes at the two intersections on either side of the project site (Dudley
Street/Holt Avenue and Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue), the heaviest traffic volumes along
West Holt Avenue occur during the PM peak hour. An average of the traffic volumes at these
two intersections suggests that there are approximately 1,847 trips along the segment of West
Holt Avenue adjacent to the project site during the heaviest peak hour traffic. As discussed
previously, a doubling of sound energy is needed to generate an audible increase in community
noise level. Therefore, a doubling of traffic would be required to generate an audible increase in
noise levels along West Holt Avenue. The proposed project would increase roadway traffic
along West Holt Avenue by 412 trips, which is an increase of about 22 percent. Therefore, the
proposed project would not generate a perceptible permanent increase in noise compared to
existing noise levels in the project area. Therefore, operational noise impacts generated by the
proposed project would be less than significant.

e) The Brackett Field Airport, a general aviation airport, is located approximately 1.7 miles
north of the project site. A review of the Los Angeles County Airport Land Use Plan confirmed
that the project site is not within a designated fly zone. Therefore, the proposed project would
not expose future residents to significant levels of aircraft noise. Impacts would be less than
significant.

f) There are no private airstrips within the vicinity of the proposed project. No impact would
occur.

XIII. POPULATION AND HOUSING --
      Would the project:
a) Induce substantial population growth in an
   area, either directly (for example, by
   proposing new homes and businesses) or
   indirectly (for example, through extension
   of roads or other infrastructure)?
b) Displace substantial numbers of existing
   housing, necessitating the construction of
   replacement housing elsewhere?
c) Displace substantial numbers of people,
   necessitating the construction of
   replacement housing elsewhere?

a) According to the 2010 Census data summary provided by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG), the population of the City of Pomona is 149,058. Since the
2000 Census, the City has experienced a population decline of approximately 0.3%. As indicated
in Table 11, SCAG estimates that the population of Pomona will continue to grow to 168,500
persons by the year 2020 and 197,400 persons by the year 2035.

The construction of additional residential dwellings could directly generate population growth
by attracting new residents from outside the City, thereby contributing to a permanent increase

                                                                                                       City of Pomona

in population within the project area. The proposed project involves the construction of 62
single-family residential dwellings. The California Department of Finance (DOF) estimates that
there are 3.78 persons per household in the City of Pomona (2012). Using the DOF estimates, the
proposed 62 units would generate approximately 234 new residents. This equates to
approximately 1.2% of the City's total projected population growth through the year 2020.
Therefore, project-related population growth has been anticipated in SCAG's long-term
population forecasts. Population growth impacts would be less than significant.

b, c) A portion of the project site is currently developed with a mobile home park. As part of the
proposed project, approximately 19 mobile homes would either be relocated to another site, or
possibly demolished, depending on the condition of the structures. For the purpose of a
providing a conservative analysis for population and housing impacts, it is assumed the trailers
would all be demolished. Assuming 3.78 persons per household (DOF, 2012) and the loss of 19
housing units, the proposed project would displace approximately 71.82 people. However,
according to the DOF, the City currently has a vacancy rate of 5.43%, which is equivalent to
2,209 housing units. As such, there is sufficient existing housing within the City to
accommodate displaced residents. In addition, the proposed project is an apartment complex
that would add 62 housing units to the City's housing stock. Therefore, the project would
compensate for the loss of housing units. Impacts to the displacement of people and housing
would be less than significant.

XIV. PUBLIC SERVICES
a) Would the project result in substantial
   adverse physical impacts associated with
   the provision of new or physically altered
   governmental facilities, or the need for
   new or physically altered governmental
   facilities, the construction of which could
   cause significant environmental impacts,
   in order to maintain acceptable service
   ratios, response times or other
   performance objectives for any of the
   public services:
    i)    Fire protection?
    ii)   Police protection?
    iii) Schools?
    iv) Parks?
    v) Other public facilities?

a(i)) The Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) would provide fire protection
services to the project site. Pomona is part of the LACoFD Division VIII. In addition to Pomona,
Division VIII includes the neighboring cities of Diamond Bar, Walnut, Hacienda Heights, and

                                                                                       City of Pomona
                                                   46

Industry. There are 19 fire stations among the cities in Division VIII, 8 of which are located in
Pomona. The proposed project is within the jurisdiction of Battalion 15 of the LACoFD, and the
fire station nearest to the project site is Fire Station No. 182, located at 1059 N. White Avenue,
approximately 0.7 miles northeast of the project site. Fire Station No. 184 is also located at 1980
W. Orange Grove, which is approximately 1.3 miles west of the project site. If necessary,
resources in adjacent jurisdictions provide additional support. While the proposed project may
incrementally increase the demand for fire protection services, the project site is within the
existing service area of the LACFD and would not require new or expanded fire protection
facilities. In addition, the proposed project would be required to comply LACFD standards,
including but not limited to, adequate vehicle access, adequate fire flow, the use of proper fire
resistant construction methods, and a sufficient number of on-site fire hydrants. Therefore,
impacts to fire services would be less than significant.

a(ii)) Police service to the project site would be provided by the Pomona Police Department. The
police station nearest to the project site is located at 490 West Mission Boulevard, approximately
1.2 miles southeast of the project site. The proposed development of 62 residential units may
incrementally increase the demand for police protection services. However, the proposed
project would be within the existing service area of the Pomona Police Department and no new
facilities would be needed to accommodate the proposed project. Therefore, impacts to police
services would be less than significant.

a(iii)) The project site is located within the Pomona Unified School District (PUSD). Schools that
would serve the project site include Roosevelt Elementary School located at 701 N. Huntington
Boulevard; Marshall Middle School, located at 1921 West Arroyo Avenue; and Ganesha High
School, located at 1151 Fairplex Drive. The proposed development of 62 residential units would
incrementally increase student enrollment within the PUSD. The estimated student generation
factor for multi-family residential units in the PUSD is 0.1 elementary students, 0.05 middle
school students, and 0.08 high school students (Personal Communication, Terry, 2012).
Therefore, the proposed project would generate a total of 16 students, including 7 elementary
students, 4 middle school students, and 5 high school students. In the 2011/2012 school year,
Roosevelt Elementary had an enrollment of 756 students and a capacity of 1,042; Marshall
Middle School had an enrollment of 644 students and a capacity of 1,030; and Ganesha High
School had an enrollment of 1,362 students and a capacity of 1,680 (Personal Communication,
Young, 2012). Based on the 2011/2012 enrollment, each of the schools would have sufficient
capacity to serve new students generated by the proposed project. In addition, the project
proponents would be required to pay the state-mandated school impact fees. Pursuant to
Section 65995 (3)(h) of the California Government Code (Senate Bill 50, chaptered August 27,
1998), the payment of statutory fees "...is deemed to be full and complete mitigation of the
impacts of any legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the
planning, use, or development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or
reorganization." Therefore, impacts would be less than significant.

a(iv)) Please refer to Section XV, Recreation.

a(v)) The proposed project would incrementally increase the local population which may
incrementally increase the demand for library services. However, the increase in population
generated by the proposed project would not require the construction of new facilities. In

                                                                                      City of Pomona

addition, the payment of property taxes would offset project-related impacts to library services.
Impacts would be less than significant.

Impacts to other public facilities (e.g. sewer, storm drains, and roadways) are discussed in
sections XVI, Transportation/Traffic, and XVII, Utilities and Services Systems, of this Initial Study.

XV.   RECREATION --
a) Would the project increase the use of
   existing neighborhood and regional parks
   or other recreational facilities such that
   substantial physical deterioration of the
   facility would occur or be accelerated?
b) Does the project include recreational
   facilities or require the construction or
   expansion of recreational facilities which
   might have an adverse physical effect on
   the environment?

a, b) As of 2010, the City of Pomona owns and operates 211 acres of developed park land
(Personal Communication, Arends, 2012). Based on the California Department of Finance (DOF)
population estimate of 149,950 residents of the City of Pomona, the City provides about 1.4
acres of park land per 1,000 residents. The project involves the construction of 62 apartment
units, which would incrementally increase the demand for park facilities. Hamilton Park is the
closest park, located approximately 300 feet east of the project site and offers a playground,
basketball court, and picnic/barbeque areas.

The DOF estimates that there are 3.78 persons per household in the City of Pomona (2012).
Using the DOF estimates, the proposed 62 units would generate approximately 234 new
residents. Because it is unknown at this time whether the existing residences would be
demolished or relocated, it is assumed all residents would be new residents. The addition of 234
new residents would not be substantial enough to change the existing ratio of park land to
residents. In addition, the proposed project would provide approximately 0.2 acres of
landscaped open space and 0.4 acres of private open space, for a total of 0.6 acres of open space.
The useable open space provided on-site would further reduce the need for off-site recreational
facilities. Impacts to existing City parks would be less than significant.

XVI. TRANSPORTATION / TRAFFIC --
     Would the project:
a) Conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance
   or policy establishing a measure of
   effectiveness for the performance of the
   circulation system, taking into account all
   modes of transportation, including mass
   transit and non-motorized travel and
   relevant components of the circulation
   system, including but not limited to
   intersections, streets, highways, and
   freeways, pedestrian and bicycle paths,
   and mass transit?
b) Conflict with an applicable congestion
   management program, including, but not
   limited to level of service standards and
   travel demand measures, or other
   standards established by the county
   congestion management agency for
   designated roads or highways?
c) Result in a change in air traffic patterns,
   including either an increase in traffic
   levels or a change in location that results
   in substantial safety risks?
d) Substantially increase hazards due to a
   design feature (e.g., sharp curves or
   dangerous intersections) or incompatible
   use (e.g., farm equipment)?
e) Result in inadequate emergency access?
f)   Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or
     programs regarding public transit,
     bikeways, or pedestrian facilities, or
     otherwise substantially decrease the
     performance or safety of such facilities?

The project's potential impact on the circulation system within the City of Pomona was
evaluated by Linscott, Law, & Greenspan, Engineers (April 2013). The full text of this Traffic
Impact Study (TIS) can be found in Appendix C of this IS-MND. The TIS was prepared
pursuant to the City of Pomona traffic study guidelines and the Los Angeles County
Congestion Management Program. Study area intersections were determined in consultation
with City of Pomona Public Works Department (PPWD) staff. The Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) method was used to determine levels of service for the study intersections. A review
was also conducted of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority freeway and
intersection monitoring stations to determine if a Congestion Management Program
transportation impact assessment analysis was required for the proposed project.

Initial Study - Mitigated Negative Declaration


The traffic study evaluated the following two intersections, chosen in collaboration with City of
Pomona PPWD staff:

    1. Dudley Street/Holt Avenue
    2. Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue

Roadway Descriptions
Dudley Street is a north-south oriented roadway that is located west of the project site. Dudley
Street is a discontinuous roadway that extends from just north of I-10 freeway to Holt Avenue
to the south. Two through travel lanes are generally provided in each direction on the roadway
within the project study area. Dual left-turn lanes and a right-turn only lane are provided at the
southbound approach on Dudley Street at the Holt Avenue intersection. Dudley Street is posted
for a 35 miles per hour speed limit in the project vicinity.

Hamilton Boulevard is a north-south oriented roadway that is located east of the project site.
Two through travel lanes are generally provided in each direction on the roadway within the
project study area. A two-way left-turn lane is also provided along Hamilton Boulevard, north
of Holt Avenue. Separate left-turn lanes are provided in both directions on Hamilton Boulevard
at the Holt Avenue intersection. Hamilton Boulevard is posted for a 35 miles per hour speed
limit in the project vicinity.

Holt Avenue is an east-west oriented roadway that borders the project site to the north. Two
through travel lanes are generally provided in each direction on the roadway within the project
study area. Separate left-turns are provided in both directions on Holt Avenue at the Dudley
Street and Hamilton Boulevard study intersections. A two-way left-turn lane is also provided
along Holt Avenue within the project study area. Holt Avenue is posted for a 35 miles per hour
speed limit in the project vicinity.

Significance Thresholds/Methodology
According to the City's published traffic study guidelines, the impact is considered significant if
the project-related increase in the volume to capacity (v/c) ratio equals or exceeds the
thresholds presented in Table 12.

According to Section 15130 of the CEQA Guidelines, cumulative development can be forecast
one of two ways:

        "(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
        cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of
        the [lead] agency, or

        (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted local, regional or
        statewide plan, or related planning document, that describes or evaluates
        conditions contributing to the cumulative effect. Such plans may include: a
        general plan, regional transportation plan, or plans for the reduction of
        greenhouse gas emissions. A summary of projections may also be contained in
        an adopted or certified prior environmental document for such a plan. Such


                                                                                     City of Pomona

                                       scenario without project traffic in which the addition of project traffic causes the
                                       intersection to degrade to a LOS `E' or `F' shall mitigate that impact so as to
                                       bring the intersection back to at least LOS `D'.

                                       Any study intersection that is operating at LOS `E' or `F' for any study scenario
                                       without project traffic shall mitigate any impacts so as to bring the intersection
                                       back to the overall level of delay established prior to project traffic being added.
     Unsignalized Intersections        An impact is considered significant if the study determines that either section a)
                                       or both sections b) and c) occur:

                                         a) The addition of project related traffic causes the intersection to move
                                             from a LOS `D' or better to a LOS `E' or worse
                                        OR

                                          b) The project contributes additional traffic to an intersection that is already
                                              projected to operate at LOS `E' or `F' with background traffic (per
                                              Section 3.2b)

                                          AND

                                              1) The project adds ten (10) or more trips to any approach
                                              2) The intersection meets the peak hour traffic signal warrant after the
                                                  addition of project traffic (per Section 3.2c).

Based on consultation with PPWD staff, the traffic analysis utilizes option "B" for purposes of
developing the future without project traffic volumes as outlined in the CEQA Guidelines.

The existing traffic volumes were increased at an annual rate of 2.0 percent (2.0%) per year to
the year 2014 (i.e., the anticipated year of project build-out). The ambient growth factor was
determined in consultation with PPWD staff. It is noted that based on general traffic growth
factors provided in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (the
"CMP manual") for the Pomona area (RSA No. 27), it is anticipated that the existing traffic
volumes are expected to increase at an annual rate of less than 2.0% per year between the years
2010 and 2015 (i.e., approximately 1.62%). Thus, application of the 2.0% annual growth factor
allows for a conservative forecast of future traffic volumes in the area. Further, it is noted that
the CMP manual's traffic growth rate is intended to anticipate future traffic generated by
development projects in the project vicinity.

The TIS analyzed the following four scenarios:

    1.   Existing Conditions
    2.   Existing + Project Conditions
    3.   Future without Project Conditions
    4.   Future + Project Conditions

The impact discussion below provides analysis of each of the four scenarios. The project trip
distribution and assignment used for all four scenarios were based on the following
considerations:

        The site's proximity to major traffic corridors (i.e., Holt Avenue, Dudley Street, Hamilton
        Boulevard, White Avenue, etc.);
        Expected localized traffic flow patterns based on adjacent roadway channelization and
        presence of traffic signals;
        Existing intersection traffic volumes;
        Ingress/egress availability at the project site assuming the site access and circulation
        scheme proposed;
        Nearby population and employment centers as well as adjacent residential
        neighborhoods; and
        Input from PPWD staff.

Project trip distribution is shown in Figure 5.

Public Transit Services
Public transit service within the Holt Family Apartments project study area is currently
provided by Foothill Transit and Metrolink. Foothill Transit provides service to Pomona
TransCenter to Puente Hills Mall via Cal Poly, Diamond Bar, and Rowland Heights. Stops are
located on Holt Avenue, Hamilton Boulevard, and Dudley Street. Metrolink provides service
from Riverside-Downtown to Los Angeles Union Station. There is a stop located in downtown
Pomona at 101 West First Street.

Bicycle Access
Bicycle access to and from the project site will be facilitated in the future by the planned City of
Pomona's bicycle roadway network. A total of four bicycle facilities (i.e., Class II Bike Lanes, or
Class III Bike Routes) in the City's planned bicycle network will be located within the
immediate proximity from the project site. These four bicycle facilities will in the future connect
with the City's proposed bicycle network. The following key bicycle routes planned to be
located near the Holt Family Apartments project site:

        North-South Routes
           o Dudley Street ­ Class III Bike Route
           o Hamilton Boulevard ­ Class II Bike Lane
        East-West Routes
           o Orange Grove Avenue ­ Class II Bike Lane
           o Laurel Avenue ­ Class III Bike Route

Class II bikeways are lanes on the outside edge of roadways reserved for the exclusive use of
bicycles and are designated with special signing and pavement markings. Class III bikeways are
roadways recommended for bicycle use and are designated with signs posted along roadways.

Enhanced Class III bikeways include 4" white edgelines and "Share the Road" signage.

Pedestrian Network
The project site has been configured to facilitate pedestrian activity and walking as a
transportation mode. The proposed project will connect to adjacent sidewalks and site
enhancements are planned to facilitate connectivity and walkability. Walkability is a term for
the extent to which walking is readily available as a safe, connected, accessible and pleasant
mode of transport.

a) The traffic impact analysis was prepared for the study intersections using the HCM
methodology and application of the City of Pomona significant traffic impact criteria. As
described above, four separate scenarios were analyzed: (1) Existing Conditions, (2) Existing +
Project Conditions, (3) Future without Project Conditions, and (4) Future + Project Conditions.
The traffic impact determinations for each scenario are described below. Table 13 shows the
traffic volume to capacity ratios and the levels of service for each scenario, while Table 14 shows
the project trip generation.

Existing Conditions
As shown in Table 13, the two study area intersections currently operate at LOS B or better
during the peak hours. Existing delays at the intersection of Dudley Street/Holt Avenue are 7.9
seconds in the AM peak hour and 5.6 seconds in the PM peak hour. Existing delays at the
Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue intersection are 15.7 seconds in the AM peak hour and 13.9
seconds in the PM peak hour. Figure 6 shows existing traffic volumes.

Existing + Project Conditions
The project's vehicle trips were estimated by applying standard trip generation rates based
upon ITE's Trip Generation, 9th Edition (2012). ITE Land Use Code 220 (Apartment) trip
generation rates were used to forecast project traffic volumes and were based upon rates per
number of dwelling units.

The project would generate a total of 412 vehicle trips, 32 during the AM peak hour and
38during the PM peak hour. Figure 7 shows the Existing + Project traffic volumes at study area
intersections. As shown in Table 13 above, application of the City's threshold criteria to the
"Existing + Project" scenario indicates that the proposed project is not expected to create
significant impacts at either of the study intersections. The intersection of Dudley Street/Holt
Avenue would continue to operate at LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours. Delays at
the Dudley Street/Holt Avenue intersection would increase by 0.1 second in the PM peak hour.
The intersection of Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue would continue to operate at LOS B
during both the AM and PM peak hours. Delays at Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue would
increase by 0.1 second in the PM peak hour. As such, impacts to study area intersections in the
Existing + Project scenario would be less than significant.

Future without Project Conditions
The Future without Project Conditions scenario analyzes the intersection conditions with the
addition of traffic generated by the growth in traffic due to the combined effects of continuing
development, intensification of existing developments and other factors (i.e. ambient growth).
The delay at the study area intersections is incrementally increased with the addition of ambient
traffic growth. As shown in Table 13 above, the Dudley Street/Holt Avenue intersection would
continue to operate at LOS A, and delays would be 7.9 seconds in the AM peak hour and 5.7
seconds in the PM peak hour. The Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue intersection would
continue to operate at LOS B, and delays would be 17.1 seconds in the AM peak hour and 14.0
in the PM peak hour. Figure 8 shows the Future without Project traffic volumes at the study
area intersections.

Future + Project Conditions
As shown in Table 13 above, application of the City's threshold criteria to the "Future + Project"
scenario indicates that the proposed project is not expected to create significant impacts at either
of the study intersections. Figure 9 shows the Future + Project traffic volumes at study area
intersections. The intersection of Dudley Street/Holt Avenue would continue to operate at LOS
A during both the AM and PM peak hours. Delays at the Dudley Street/Holt Avenue
intersection would increase by 0.1 second in the PM peak hour. The intersection of Hamilton
Boulevard/Holt Avenue would continue to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak
hours. Delays at Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue would increase by 0.1 second in the PM
peak hour. As such, impacts to study area intersections in the Future + Project scenario would
be less than significant.

As required by the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County, a Traffic
Impact Assessment (TIA) has been prepared to determine the potential impacts on designated
monitoring locations on the CMP highway system. The analysis has been prepared in
accordance with procedures outlined in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles
County, County of Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 2010. According to
Section D.9.1 (Appendix D, page D-6) of the 2010 CMP manual, the criteria for determining a
significant transportation impact is listed below:

        "A significant transportation impact occurs when the proposed project increases
        traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of capacity (V/C > 0.02), causing or
        worsening LOS F (V/C > 1.00)."

The CMP impact criteria apply for analysis of both intersection and freeway monitoring
locations.

Intersections
The following CMP intersection monitoring locations in the project vicinity have been
identified:

        CMP Station               Intersection
        No. 124                   Arrow Highway/Garey Avenue
        No. 125                   Corona Expressway/Garey Avenue
        No. 126                   Corona Expressway/Mission Boulevard

The CMP TIA guidelines require that intersection monitoring locations must be examined if the
proposed project will add 50 or more trips during either the AM or PM weekday peak hours.

The proposed project will not add 50 or more trips during either the AM or PM weekday peak
hours (i.e., of adjacent street traffic) at the CMP monitoring intersections in the project vicinity,
which is stated in the CMP manual as the threshold criteria for a traffic impact assessment.
Therefore, no further review of potential impacts to intersection monitoring locations that are
part of the CMP highway system is required. Impacts to CMP intersections would be less than
significant.

Freeways
The following CMP freeway monitoring location has been identified in the project vicinity:

        CMP Station               Location
        No. 1020                  I-10 Freeway at Dudley Street


The CMP TIA guidelines require that freeway monitoring locations must be examined if the
proposed project will add 150 or more trips (in either direction) during either the AM or PM
weekday peak periods. The proposed project will not add 150 or more trips (in either direction)
during either the AM or PM weekday peak hours to CMP freeway monitoring locations which
is the threshold for preparing a traffic impact assessment, as stated in the CMP manual.

of the CMP highway system is required. Impacts to CMP intersections would be less than
significant.

c) The Brackett Field Airport, a general aviation airport, is located approximately 1.7 miles north
of the project site. A review of the Los Angeles County Airport Land Use Plan confirmed that
the project site is not within a designated fly zone. Therefore, the proposed project would not
change any air traffic patterns, increase the number of flights, impose any additional safety risks
for airport operations, or necessitate a change in location for the airfield. No impact would
occur.

d) Access to the project site would be consolidated to a single driveway, thus reducing potential
turning movement conflicts for traffic along Holt Avenue and opposing driveways situated on
the north side of Holt Avenue. Vehicular access to the site would be provided via a single
driveway located in essentially the same location as the existing easterly site driveway on Holt
Avenue. The project site driveway would be modified to accommodate two-way traffic and full
access (i.e., left-turn and right-turn ingress and egress turning movements). An existing two-
way left-turn lane is provided on Holt Avenue that can provide a storage area for left-turning
vehicles into the site. Additionally, the project site access has been configured to include a
driveway throat sufficient in length to preclude inbound vehicle queuing back out onto the
public right-of-way. The project site driveway would be constructed to City of Pomona design
standards. As such, the project does not include any design features that would result in safety
hazards. In addition, the project is located in an urban area and would not result in a conflict
with an incompatible use. No impact would occur.

e) The proposed project is an infill project within the City of Pomona. As such, the proposed
project would not interfere with existing emergency access routes and would comply with all
Los Angeles County Fire Department standards for on-site emergency access. The project's
impact on emergency vehicle access would be less than significant.

f) As required by the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County, a review has
been made of the potential impacts of the project on transit service. As previously discussed,
existing transit service is provided in the vicinity of the proposed project.

The project trip generation was adjusted by values set forth in the CMP (i.e., person trips equal
1.4 times vehicle trips, and transit trips equal 3.5 percent of the total person trips) to estimate
transit trip generation. Pursuant to the CMP guidelines, the proposed project is forecast to
generate demand for 2 transit trips during the weekday AM peak hour and 2 transit trips
during the weekday PM peak hour. Over a 24-hour period, the proposed project is forecast to
generate demand for 20 daily transit trips. Therefore, the calculations are as follows:

        AM Peak Hour = 32 × 1.4 × 0.035 = 2 Transit Trips
        PM Peak Hour = 38 × 1.4 × 0.035 = 2 Transit Trips
        Daily Trips = 412 × 1.4 × 0.035 = 20 Transit Trips

Two transit lines and routes are provided adjacent to or in close proximity the project site.
These two transit lines provide services for an average of (i.e., average of the directional number
of buses/trains during the peak hours) generally two buses/trains during the weekday AM

                                                                                      City of Pomona

peak hour and roughly two buses/trains during the weekday PM peak hour. Therefore, based
on the above calculated weekday AM and PM peak hour trips, this would correspond to no
more than one additional transit rider per bus/train. It is anticipated that the existing transit
service in the project area would adequately accommodate the increase of project generated
transit trips. Thus, given the low number of project-generated transit trips per bus/train,
impacts to existing or future transit services in the project area would be less than significant.

Furthermore, the proposed project would encourage the use of bicycles as a transportation
mode by providing ample and safe bicycle parking facilities. The project site is also located
within the vicinity of four of the City of Pomona's planned bicycle facilities. The proposed
project would also promote walkability by including extensive green and landscape space
throughout the site with connections to the adjacent sidewalk provided along Holt Avenue.
Sidewalks along Holt Avenue would provide connectivity to other area corridors. Therefore,
the proposed project would be consistent with local plans and would facilitate the performance
of existing facilities. Impacts to bicycle and pedestrian facilities would be less than
significant.

XVII. UTILITIES AND SERVICE SYSTEMS --
      Would the project:
g) Comply with federal, state, and local
   statutes and regulations related to solid
   waste?

a) The City of Pomona requires NPDES permits, as administered by the Regional Water Quality
Control Board (RWQCB), according to Federal regulations for both point source discharges (a
municipal or industrial discharge at a specific location or pipe) and nonpoint source discharges
(diffuse runoff of water from adjacent land uses) to surface water of the United States. For point
source discharges, such as sewer outfalls, each NPDES permit contains limits on allowable
concentrations and mass emissions of pollutants contained in the discharge. The proposed
project would be required to comply with all provisions of the NPDES program, as enforced by
the RWQCB. Therefore, the proposed project would not result in a violation of wastewater
treatment requirements and impacts would be less than significant.

b, e) Wastewater service within Pomona is provided by the City's Public Works Department.
Wastewater from the City's system is treated by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts
(LACSD). The City's wastewater is treated and disposed of at the LACSD's Pomona Water
Reclamation Plant (PWRP). Located at 295 Humane Way in Pomona, the plant occupies
approximately 14 acres east of SR-57 and north of the Phillips Ranch development area. Sewage
effluent from the neighboring cities of La Verne and Claremont is also treated at the PWRP,
which currently has a design capacity of 15 million gallons per day (mgd). In 2012, the average
daily flow to the plant was approximately 8.4 mgd (Raza, 2013). Thus, the PWRP has an
available capacity of approximately 6.6 mgd. The PWRP currently serves an estimated 130,000
people; therefore, per capita wastewater generation is estimated to be 65 gallons per day. Based
on the estimate of 3.78 persons per household in the City of Pomona (DOF, 2012), the proposed
project would add approximately 234 new residents to the City. The addition of 234 new
residents would increase the demand for wastewater treatment by 15,210 gallons per day. With
an available capacity of 6.6 mgd, the PWRP would have sufficient capacity to serve the
wastewater needs of the proposed project. Therefore, the proposed project would not result in
the need for new wastewater treatment facilities, and impacts would be less than significant.

c) The proposed project would be required to prepare a Standard Urban Storm Water
Management Plan (SUSMP), which requires the integration of post-development BMPs into the
site's overall drainage system. Specifically, the SUSMP would require that post-development
peak storm water runoff discharge rates do not exceed the estimated pre-development rate. As
such, the proposed project would not increase storm water runoff volumes leaving the project
site and would not require the construction or expansion of off-site storm water infrastructure.
Impacts would be less than significant.

d) The City's current water supply portfolio is comprised of 68% groundwater, 16% imported
water, 15% local surface water, and 1% recycled water. It is projected that by 2035, the supply

                                                                                       City of Pomona

mix will be 73% groundwater, 11% imported, 10% local surface water and 6% recycled water.
Table 15 shows projected average water supply and demand through the year 2035.

      * Demand assumes implementation of conservation programs.


The City's 2010 Urban Water Management Plan indicates that, due to its existing water rights
and groundwater storage agreements, an adequate supply of water should be available, with
normal conservation efforts, for projected demands through 2035 (City of Pomona, 2011).

SCAG growth forecasts for the City anticipate a 2035 population of 197,400. The 2010 UWMP
(City of Pomona, 2011) estimated a 2035 population of 216,899 people. With this anticipated
growth, the UWMP projects that the City will have adequate water supply, with normal
conservation efforts, to meet demand through 2035 in average year, single dry year, and
multiple dry year scenarios. Development facilitated by the proposed project is expected to
increase the City's population by 234 people, which is line with SCAG projections. Forecasted
growth under the SCAG projections is less than anticipated in the 2010 UWMP by
approximately 19,500 people. Therefore, water supplies would be adequate to serve population
growth facilitated by the proposed project. Impacts to water supply would be less than
significant.

f) Currently, four landfills serve Pomona: (1) Olinda Alpha Landfill, (2) El Sobrante Landfill, (3)
Azusa Land Reclamation Company Landfill, and (4) Mid-Valley Sanitary Landfill. Table 16
summarizes the permitted daily throughput, estimated average waste quantities disposed, and
remaining capacity for these landfills.

About half of the City's waste was formerly taken to the Puente Hills Sanitary Landfill near
Whittier. However, that landfill closed in October 2013 and will be replaced by a waste-by-rail
system that will provide disposal to remote landfills, such as the Mesquite Regional Landfill in
Imperial County.

Assuming a solid waste generation rate of four pounds per day per unit for a multi-family
residential use (CalRecycle, 2012), the proposed project would generate 248 pounds per day of
solid waste, or 45.25 tons per year. It is anticipated that the waste-by-rail system to be
implemented upon closure of the Puente Hills landfill will maintain currently daily disposal
capacity levels, which would be adequate to serve the proposed project. Impacts to solid waste
disposal would be less than significant.

g) The proposed project would be required to comply with applicable elements of AB 1327,
Chapter 18 (California Solid Waste Reuse and Recycling Access Act of 1991), and other
applicable local, State, and Federal solid waste disposal standards. Impacts would be less than
significant.

XVIII. MANDATORY FINDINGS OF
       SIGNIFICANCE --
a) Does the project have the potential to
   substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or
   wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife
   population to drop below self- sustaining
   levels, eliminate a plant or animal
   community, reduce the number or restrict
   the range of a rare or endangered plant or
   animal or eliminate important examples of

                                                                                                           City of Pomona

    the major periods of California history or
    prehistory?
b) Does the project have impacts that are
   individually limited, but cumulatively
   considerable? ("Cumulatively
   considerable" means that the incremental
   effects of a project are considerable when
   viewed in connection with the effects of
   past projects, the effects of other current
   projects, and the effects of probable future
   projects)?
c) Does the project have environmental
   effects which will cause substantial
   adverse effects on human beings, either
   directly or indirectly?

a) Construction activities would occur within a vacant parcel, which includes limited biological
resources. However, mitigation measures have been identified (Mitigation Measures BIO-1
and BIO-2) to reduce potential impacts to biological resources to a less than significant level.
Although the project area is not anticipated to contain any known paleontological or
archaeological resources, it may contain previously undetected subsurface archaeological
resources. Mitigation measures have been identified (Mitigation Measures CR-1) to mitigate
any impacts associated with the discovery of previously undetected subsurface cultural
resources during excavation activities. Adherence to this measure would reduce cultural
impacts to a less than significant level. After mitigation, potential impacts of the project on
these resources would be less than significant.

b) As presented in the discussion of environmental checklist Sections I through XVII, the project
would have no impact, a less than significant impact, or a less than significant impact after
mitigation with respect to all environmental issues. Due to the limited scope of direct physical
impacts to the environment associated with the proposed project, the impacts are project-
specific in nature. Consequently, the project along with other cumulative projects would
result in a less than significant cumulative impact with respect to all environmental issues.

c) The proposed project could result in potentially significant direct or indirect impacts to
humans. Refer to the Geology and Soils section in the above analysis. However, as described in
these sections, all impacts would be mitigated to a less than significant level. Therefore, with
implementation of the required measures, no substantial adverse effects on human beings
would occur as a result of the proposed project.

Executive Summary

This report was prepared for the purpose of assisting the City of Pomona in their compliance with the Califor-
nia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as it relates to historic resources for three parcels totaling approxi-
mately 4.0 acres, addressed at 934 W. Holt Avenue, Pomona (APN 8348-09-906; -907; -908). The first of these
parcels is the location of a circa 1885 residence and a trailer court established during the 1940s. The latter of
the two parcels are vacant. A multifamily residential project is proposed for the parcels that will result in the
demolition of the existing improvements. [Figure 1]

This report assesses the historical and architectural significance of potentially significant historic properties
in accordance with the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), the California Register of Historical Re-
sources (CRHR) Criteria for Evaluation, and City of Pomona Historic Landmark criteria.

This report was prepared by San Buenaventura Research Associates of Santa Paula, California, Judy Triem, His-
torian; and Mitch Stone, Preservation Planner, for Rincon Consultants, Inc, and is based on a field investiga-
tion and research conducted in September 2013. The conclusions contained this report represent the profes-
sional opinions of San Buenaventura Research Associates, and are based on the factual data available at the
time of its preparation, the application of the appropriate local, state and federal regulations, and best pro-
fessional practices.

Summary of Findings

No buildings on the property evaluated in this report were found to be potentially eligible for listing on the
NRHP and CRHR or potentially eligible for designation as a City of Pomona landmark. Consequently, none were
found to be historic resources for purposes of CEQA.

1. Administrative Setting

   The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires evaluation of project impacts on historic resources,
   including properties "listed in, or determined eligible for listing in, the California Register of Historical Re-
   sources [or] included in a local register of historical resources." A resource is eligible for listing on the Cali-
   fornia Register of Historical Resources if it meets any of the criteria for listing, which are:

       1.   Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of Califor-
            nia's history and cultural heritage;
       2.   Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past;
       3.   Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or rep-
            resents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or
       4.   Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. (PRC
            §5024.1(c))

   By definition, the California Register of Historical Resources also includes all "properties formally determined
   eligible for, or listed in, the National Register of Historic Places," and certain specified State Historical Land-
   marks. The majority of "formal determinations" of NRHP eligibility occur when properties are evaluated by the
   State Office of Historic Preservation in connection with federal environmental review procedures (Section 106
   of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966). Formal determinations of eligibility also occur when prop-
   erties are nominated to the NRHP, but are not listed due to a lack of owner consent.

   The criteria for determining eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) have been
   developed by the National Park Service. Eligible properties include districts, sites, buildings and structures,

       A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
          our history; or
       B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
       C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that rep-
          resent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
          distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
       D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

   According to the NRHP standards, in order for a property which is found to significant under one or more of
   the criteria to be considered eligible for listing, the "essential physical features" which define the property's
   significance must be present. The standard for determining if a property's essential physical features exist is
   known as integrity, which is defined as "the ability of a property to convey its significance." The integrity
   evaluation is broken down into seven "aspects."

   The seven aspects of integrity are: Location (the place where the historic property was constructed or the
   place where the historic event occurred); Design (the combination of elements that create the form, plan,
   space, structure, and style of a property); Setting (the physical environment of a historic property); Materials
   (the physical elements that were combined or deposited during a particular period of time and in a particular
   pattern or configuration to form a historic property); Workmanship (the physical evidence of the crafts of a
   particular culture or people during any given period of history or prehistory); Feeling (a property's expression
   of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time), and; Association (the direct link between an
   important historic event or person and a historic property).

   The relevant aspects of integrity depend upon the NRHP criteria applied to a property. For example, a property
   nominated under Criterion A (events), would be likely to convey its significance primarily through integrity of
Historic Resources Report
934 W. Holt Avenue, Pomona



   location, setting and association. A property nominated solely under Criterion C (design) would usually rely
   primarily upon integrity of design, materials and workmanship. The California Register regulations include
   similar language with regard to integrity, but also state that "it is possible that historical resources may not
   retain sufficient integrity to meet the criteria for listing in the National Register, but they may still be eligible
   for listing in the California Register." Further, according to the NRHP guidelines, the integrity of a property
   must be evaluated at the time the evaluation of eligibility is conducted. Integrity assessments cannot be
   based on speculation with respect to historic fabric and architectural elements which may exist but are not
   visible to the evaluator, or on restorations which are theoretically possible but which have not occurred. (CCR
   §4852 (c))

   The minimum age criterion for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the California Register of
   Historical Resources (CRHR) is 50 years. Properties less than 50 years old may be eligible for listing on the
   NRHP if they can be regarded as "exceptional," as defined by the NRHP procedures, or in terms of the CRHR,
   "if it can be demonstrated that sufficient time has passed to understand its historical importance" (Chapter
   11, Title 14, §4842(d)(2))

   Historic resources as defined by CEQA also includes properties listed in "local registers" of historic properties.
   A "local register of historic resources" is broadly defined in §5020.1 (k) of the Public Resources Code, as "a
   list of properties officially designated or recognized as historically significant by a local government pursuant
   to a local ordinance or resolution." Local registers of historic properties come essentially in two forms: (1)
   surveys of historic resources conducted by a local agency in accordance with Office of Historic Preservation
   procedures and standards, adopted by the local agency and maintained as current, and (2) landmarks desig-
   nated under local ordinances or resolutions. These properties are "presumed to be historically or culturally
   significant... unless the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that the resource is not historically or
   culturally significant." (PRC §§ 5024.1, 21804.1, 15064.5)

   City of Pomona Historic Landmark Designation Criteria (Pomona City Code, §5809-13 D)

   For the purposes of this section, an improvement, natural feature, or site may be designated an Historic
   Landmark by the Historic Preservation Commission and City Council and any area within the City of Pomona
   may be designated an Historic District pursuant to Subsection E (Appeal Procedure) of this Section, if the
   building or majority of buildings (in a district) are fifty (50) or more years old or of exceptional quality if less
   than fifty (50) years old, and it meets one or more of the following criteria:

       1.   It exemplifies or reflects special elements of the City of Pomona's cultural, social, economic, political,
            aesthetic, engineering, architectural, or natural history;
       2.   It is identified with persons or events significant in local, state, or national history;
       3.   It embodies distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period, or method of construction, or is a
            valuable example of the use of indigenous materials or craftsmanship;
       4.   It contributes to the significance of a historic area, being a geographically definable area possessing
            a concentration of historic or scenic properties or thematically related grouping of properties which
            contribute to each other and are unified aesthetically by plan or physical development;
       5.   It is the work of a notable building, designer, landscape designer, or architect;
       6.   It has a unique location or singular physical characteristics or is a view or vista representing an es-
            tablished and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, community, or the City of Pomona;
       7.   It embodies elements of architectural design, detail, materials, or craftsmanship that represent a
            significant structural or architectural achievement or innovation;



SAN BUENAVENTURA RESEARCH ASSOCIATES                                                                       Page 2 of 10

        8.  It is similar to other distinctive properties, sites, areas, or objects based on a historic, cultural, or
            architectural motif;
        9. It reflects significant geographical patterns, including those associated with different eras of settle-
            ment and growth, particular transportation modes, or distinctive examples of park or community
            planning; and/or
        10. It is one of the few remaining examples in the City of Pomona, region, state, or nation possessing
            distinguishing characteristics of an architectural or historical type or specimen.

2. Impact Thresholds and Mitigation

    According to the Public Resources Code, "a project that may cause a substantial change in the significance of
    an historical resource is a project that may have a significant effect on the environment." The Public Re-
    sources Code broadly defines a threshold for determining if the impacts of a project on an historic property
    will be significant and adverse. By definition, a substantial adverse change means, "demolition, destruction,
    relocation, or alterations," such that the significance of an historical resource would be impaired. For pur-
    poses of NRHP eligibility, reductions in a property's integrity (the ability of the property to convey its signifi-
    cance) should be regarded as potentially adverse impacts. (PRC §21084.1, §5020.1(6))

    Further, according to the CEQA Guidelines, "an historical resource is materially impaired when a project...
    [d]emolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of an historical resource
    that convey its historical significance and that justify its inclusion in, or eligibility for, inclusion in the Cali-
    fornia Register of Historical Resources [or] that account for its inclusion in a local register of historical re-
    sources pursuant to section 5020.1(k) of the Public Resources Code or its identification in an historical re-
    sources survey meeting the requirements of section 5024.1(g) of the Public Resources Code, unless the public
    agency reviewing the effects of the project establishes by a preponderance of evidence that the resource is
    not historically or culturally significant."

    The lead agency is responsible for the identification of "potentially feasible measures to mitigate significant
    adverse changes in the significance of an historical resource." The specified methodology for determining if
    impacts are mitigated to less than significant levels are the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treat-
    ment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic
    Buildings and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating His-
    toric Buildings (1995), publications of the National Park Service. (PRC §15064.5(b)(3-4))

3. Historical Setting

    General Historical Context

    The city of Pomona is located on a portion of the 20,000-acre Rancho San José de Arriba, granted by the
    Mexican government in 1837 to Ygnacio Palomares and a family friend, Ricardo Vejar. Holding the rancho as
    an undivided interest, Palomares constructed a home near today's Ganesha Park, and Vejar built an adobe on
    the Arroyo Pedragoso, near the western boundary of the rancho. In 1840 Palmomares and Vejar were joined in
    ownership by Luis Arenas, the brother-in-law of Ygnacio Palomares.

    The three petitioned the government for an expansion of their holdings, which was granted as the Rancho San
    José Addition, covering roughly 2,000 acres located between present-day Glendora and La Verne. Arenas built
    his home on this portion of the conjoined land grants, but not long after his interests were acquired by Henry
    Dalton. By agreement of the three partners, the rancho was partitioned by court order in 1846, the southern

   portion going to Vejar, the northern section to Palomares, and the part encompassed by the 1840 addition, to
   Dalton.

   After statehood, Palomares and Vejar applied for a patent of their rancho lands. The petition was filed in
   1852, but as was typical of this complicated, expensive, and often controversy-laden process, their title was
   not proven until 1875. Before the patent was granted, the prolonged droughts of the 1860s intervened, ruin-
   ing many Californios, including Ricardo Vejar. In 1864 Vejar lost his section of Rancho San José to debts held
   by Isaac Schlesinger and Hyman Tischler of Los Angeles. The new owners turned over management of the
   property to Louis Phillips. A resourceful operator, Phillips bought the land from Schlesinger and Tischler two
   years later. Additional scattered settlement of the Pomona Valley by pioneer ranchers continued into the
   1870s. (Pomona Centennial-Bicentennial Committee, 1976: 11-13).

   In 1873 Louis Phillips provided a right-of-way through his land to the Southern Pacific Railroad, and with its
   impending arrival, the idea of a town in the Pomona Valley began to take hold. In 1874 the Los Angeles Im-
   migration and Land Co-Operative Association was formed. The new company purchased an interest in the Phil-
   lips and the Palomares sections of Rancho San José and recorded a townsite in 1875. A naming contest was
   held for the new town; the winning entry was Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruitful abundance. In typical
   frontier fashion, the map included a gridded central townsite of city lots, ringed around the periphery by fam-
   ily farm parcels averaging forty acres in size.

   Despite the railroad's arrival, and the recorded townsite, growth in the new community remained unimpressive
   into the early 1880s. In 1882 interests in the townsite were purchased by Cyrus Mills and M.L. Wicks, who
   sought out new water sources, and reincorporated the enterprise as the Pomona Land and Water Company. An
   immense regional land boom arrived in 1887, and Pomona's fortunes rose along with it. Though the land rush
   lasted barely a year, Pomona had grown sufficiently as a result to justify incorporation in 1888. (Robinson,
   1939: 199-217)

   Agriculture in the Pomona Valley evolved from vineyards and wine during the 1880s, to olives, deciduous
   fruits, and ultimately, citrus. The valley also became an important center for cattle ranching and dairy produc-
   tion. Citrus crops, first planted commercially in the valley in 1872 by Cyrus Burdick, began to define the
   economy and character of the community after the turn of the century, as it did across the Southern California
   foothills during this period. By 1900 Pomona had became an important center of the citrus industry, sur-
   rounded by verdant groves of oranges and lemons, and the location of numerous packing houses. Along with
   the expansion of citriculture, by 1900 the town's population had grown to 5,000 residents. Pomona was inte-
   grated into the regional grid with its connection to the Pacific Electric interurban "Red Car" system in 1912.
   (Pomona Centennial-Bicentennial Committee, 1976: 22, 74, 80-85; Crump, 1983: 230)

   Agriculture and other industries continued to drive economic expansion in Pomona, to the extent that it be-
   came one of the largest cities in Los Angeles County by the end of the 1920s, rising to a population of over
   25,000 by 1930. During the postwar period, Pomona was reshaped into one of the regional centers of the Cold
   War aerospace industry, most notably with the arrival of a huge facility to house the Convair Division of Gen-
   eral Dynamics during the early 1950s. The completion of the San Bernardino Freeway in 1954 connected Po-
   mona to the automotive grid that had superseded the interurban railroads as the primary regional transporta-
   tion method after the war. The results were massive suburban growth, the creation of commercial strips along
   the city's main arterials, and the steady loss of the agriculture that had shaped and defined the city during its
   first seven decades.

      Pomona's central role in the county's agricultural industry was solidified when it became the home of the Los
      Angeles County Fair in 1922. The city purchased 43 acres of the Vejar estate north of Ganesha Park for the
      construction of fairgrounds, including exhibit halls and a racetrack. With the success of the first fair in 1922,
      the size of the fairgrounds was more than doubled the following year. Construction of facilities continued
      through the 1920s and 1930s, and at a particularly accelerated rate after pari-mutual wagering on horse rac-
      ing was legalized in California in 1933 and introduced at the Los Angeles County Fair. The fairgrounds were
      expanded further in the 1940s. A drag racing course named Pomona Raceway was added to the fairgrounds in
      1953.

      Property-Specific Context

      The non-vacant portion of the project site is located on a roughly 2.58 acre section of the original 35.90 acre
      Block 220 of the Pomona Tract recorded in 1875. It is presently unknown who first purchased this farm lot,
      which was bounded by the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way on the south, Holt Avenue on the north,
      Hamilton Boulevard on the east, and another farm parcel on the west. Family ranches were established on
      these larger parcels located around the periphery of the townsite, primarily from the mid-1880s through the
      1910s. A 1½ story residence constructed circa 1885, a trailer park, and several commercial and utility building
      constructed circa 1947, are currently located on this property.

      By the 1920s, urban-style land subdivisions began to encroach into this area as the city expanded, breaking
      down many of the original farm parcels into lots sizes more suitable for residential and commercial develop-
      ment. Some of these land divisions were accomplished by means of recorded subdivision maps, while others
      were the result of ad-hoc metes and bounds methods. The latter type are far more difficult to trace in terms of
      date and ownership. However, it appears that by the early 1920s the subject parcel was roughly 0.74 acres in
      size and fronted onto Holt Avenue.

      The earliest known, probable owners of this property were Louis W. and Mary M. Shaeffer. They apparently ar-
      rived in Pomona from Texas during the 1910s and are first found at this location circa 1920. Little additional
      information was located on this family. By 1930 the property was apparently owned by Frank C. and Mae Bon-
      ser. He was a real estate agent. In 1937 the property was occupied by Joseph L. Bernard, an ironworker, and
      his wife Anita.

      By 1945 the property was owned by Franz C. Richter. At this time the property may have been joined to a par-
      cel to the south to encompass its current area of 2.58 acres, but the timing of this event is presently uncer-
      tain. It is known, however, that within two years, this entire property was developed as Rick's Trailer Court. At
      around this time, two small commercial buildings were constructed on the property adjacent to Holt Avenue,
      and a commercial addition attached to the northern elevation of the house. A number of other buildings on
      the property, including a garage and residence, also appear to have been constructed during the period 1946-
      7, or perhaps moved to the site and altered at that time. According to building permit files, a building of 800
      square feet was moved to the site in 1959.1

      The conversion of this property to a trailer court serving transient residents is consistent with the evolution of
      this stretch of W. Holt Avenue in the postwar period. A number of other trailer courts and motels were con-
      structed in the vicinity during the 1940s and 1950s. This period coincides with the expansion of the Los An-
      geles County Fairgrounds and the rapid industrial growth and in Pomona in the postwar period. It has been

    this report was being conducted.

    suggested that one of the factors driving the creation of transient housing in this section of Pomona during
    this period was the increasing importance of horse racing at the Fairgrounds. This information was provided to
    the preparers verbally by the Pomona Valley Historical Society. This context does not appear to be otherwise
    documented.

    Franz Charles Richter died in 1946 but his second wife Carmelita remained on the property until a few years
    prior to her death in 1982. The management of Rick's Trailer Park was taken over at some point during the
    1950s by Harold F. Richter, the son of Franz Richter by his first wife. Born in Corona in 1925, Harold Franz
    Richter was a combat veteran who served in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Theater during World War II. He ap-
    parently did not return to Pomona until the late 1950s. After his return, he worked as a sign painter and
    graphic artist, running his business, A&A Signs, out of one of the commercial buildings on the property. He
    was an active member of the community and participated in a number of service and social clubs in the city.
    He is found living elsewhere in Pomona during the 1960s, though at the time of his death in 1977, his ad-
    dress was listed as 934 W. Holt Avenue. The property was purchased by the Redevelopment Agency of the City
    of Pomona in 2006, with at least one additional property owner intervening. (Pomona Progress Bulletin; 8-9-
    1977, 7-15-1982; California Death Index; City Directories; Telephone Directories)

4. Potential Historic Resources

    The project site consists of a several buildings, including a wood frame residence, two stucco-clad commercial
    buildings, and two additional residences. The balance of the site is a trailer park featuring older trailer
    coaches organized around an internal driveway loop. The original owner of this property is not currently
    known, though it is likely that much of its current appearance is the result of alterations made circa 1947
    when the property was converted to a trailer court by the Richter family.

    Residence 1. This 1½ story wood frame residence with an attached commercial wing features a high-pitched
    cross-gabled roof. The main body of the building is clad in wide horizontal shiplap siding with fish scale shin-
    gles under the gable ends. A slanted bay covered by a shed roof supported by brackets projects from the west-
    ern elevation. Windows in the main body of the house are primarily narrow sash with undecorated casings.
    Cutout brackets are located under the eaves and small cutout pendants are found within the gable ends. Eaves
    are shallow and boxed. A hip-roofed single story wing projects from the rear (southern) elevation. Based on
    visual appearance (mismatched siding, attached rooflines), this wing appears to have been constructed in at
    least three stages. A small, rectangular-plan stucco-clad commercial wing with a parapeted roof is attached to
    the front (northern) elevation of the residence by means of a wood-sided hyphen. An entry to the commercial
    wing is centered on the northern elevation and above a small flight of concrete steps. The windows are small,
    and boarded over. The foundation material is concrete in some locations and covered with wood skirting in
    others.

    The residence was probably constructed circa 1885, based on the remaining evidence of its original architec-
    tural style, which is essentially a Folk Victorian interpretation of the Stick Style as it was commonly con-
    structed in Southern California from the 1870s through the early 1890s. The main body of the wing to the rear
    of the building appears to date from circa 1900. The commercial wing and its attachment to the front of the
    residence are undated, but based on visual appearance and known uses of the property was probably con-
    structed circa 1947. [Photos 1-3]

    Commercial Building 1. This rectangular plan building located at the northeastern corner of the property is
    stucco clad and features a parapeted roof. A single entry door is located off-center on the right side of the
    northern elevation. Windows are aluminum. It was probably constructed circa 1947 when the property was

    converted to a trailer court by the Richter family. The degree of alterations is difficult to determine, but it
    seems likely to have once featured a display window facing Holt Avenue. This building is stylistically indis-
    tinct. [Photo 4]

    Commercial Building 2. This rectangular plan building located at the northwestern corner of the property is
    stucco clad and features a parapeted roof. A single entry door is located off-center to the right on the north-
    ern elevation with a display window to the left. Windows are aluminum. The building was probably built circa
    1947 when the property was converted to a trailer court by the Richter family. The degree of alterations is
    difficult to determine, but visual evidence suggests that at least one window or door opening on the eastern
    elevation was closed. This building is stylistically indistinct. [Photo 5]

    Residence 2. This rectangular plan building is located to the rear (south) of Residence 2. It is stucco clad
    and features a medium-pitched gable roof with shallow, open eaves and exposed rafter tails. Windows are
    aluminum. The building was probably built or moved to this location circa 1947 when the property was con-
    verted to a trailer court by the Richter family, or later. The degree of alterations is difficult to determine, but
    it appears this building was converted to a residence from a garage. It is stylistically indistinct. [Photo 6]

    Residence 3. This rectangular plan building is located to the rear (south) of Residence 2. It is stucco clad
    and features a medium-pitched gable roof with shallow, open eaves and exposed rafter tails. A secondary ga-
    ble roof wing is inset under the main roofline on the western elevation. Entry doors are located on the eastern
    and western elevations above low concrete stoops. Windows are aluminum. The building appears to be a heav-
    ily altered circa 1920 California Bungalow that was probably moved to this location circa 1947 when the
    property was converted to a trailer court by the Franz Richter family, or later. The degree of alterations is dif-
    ficult to determine, but the windows are likely not original construction. This building is stylistically indis-
    tinct. [Photo 7]

    Trailer Court. The balance of a property is a trailer court consisting of older trailer coaches organized around
    a looped asphalt driveway. The majority of the approximately 25 coaches appear to date from the 1950s and
    later. [Photos 8, 9]

5. Eligibility of Historic Resources

    National and California Registers: Significance, Eligibility and Integrity

    This property does not appear to be closely associated with any historical event. Residence 1 (constructed
    circa 1885) is no longer representative of the early settlement of Pomona during the 1880s due to the exten-
    sive alterations that occurred to the building, primarily after circa 1947 when the property was converted to a
    trailer court. It is generally representative of the evolution of this section of W. Holt Avenue to automobile-
    oriented businesses during the postwar era, but it does not appear to have played any notable role in this
    transition (NRHP Criterion A and CRHR Criterion 1). The property was owned from circa 1945 through at least
    the mid-1970s by the Richter family. Harold F. Richter was an active member of the Pomona community but he
    does not appear to have lived on this property for more than a short time near the end of his life (NRHP Crite-
    rion B and CRHR Criterion 2). None of the extant buildings on the property are representative examples of an
    architectural style or type of construction (NRHP Criterion C and CRHR Criterion 3). Residence 1 is a highly
    altered example of a Folk Victorian house and the other buildings on the property are extensively altered.

    NRHP Criterion D and CRHR Criterion 4 pertain to archeological resources and consequently have not been
    evaluated in this report.

   Local Significance and Eligibility

   Criterion 1: This property does not appear to "exemplif[y] or reflect[s] special elements of the City of Po-
   mona's cultural, social, economic, political, aesthetic, engineering, architectural, or natural history." The
   property is a combination of a highly altered example of a circa 1885 residence, and a typical example of
   automobile-oriented postwar development from the late 1940s.

   Criterion 2: It does not appear to be "identified with persons or events significant in local, state, or national
   history." The original owner is not currently known. Harold Richter appears to have been somewhat active in
   community affairs, but not to a significant extent. His association with the property also appears to be some-
   what tenuous, as he seems to have lived elsewhere while managing the trailer court, at least into the 1960s.

   Criterion 3: It does not "embod[y] distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period, or method of construc-
   tion, or is a valuable example of the use of indigenous materials or craftsmanship." The buildings on the
   property are a highly altered example of a circa 1885 residence, and a typical example of automobile-oriented
   postwar development from the late 1940s.

   Criterion 4: The property does not "contribute[s] to the significance of a historic area, being a geographically
   definable area possessing a concentration of historic or scenic properties or thematically related grouping of
   properties which contribute to each other and are unified aesthetically by plan or physical development." This
   property does not appear to have the ability to contribute to the formation of a historic district in this area.

   Criterion 5: This property does not appear to be "the work of a notable building, designer, landscape designer,
   or architect." Building permits for this property were not available for examination but it appears unlikely
   that a known or notable designer was responsible for any of the buildings on the property.

   Criterion 6: The property does not represent "a unique location or singular physical characteristics or is a view
   or vista representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, community, or the City of
   Pomona." It is one of numerous examples of its type in the city.

   Criterion 7: The property does not "embod[y] elements of architectural design, detail, materials, or craftsman-
   ship that represent a significant structural or architectural achievement or innovation." The buildings on the
   property are a highly altered example of a circa 1885 residence, and a typical example of automobile-oriented
   postwar development from the late 1940s.

   Criterion 8: The property does not appear to be "similar to other distinctive properties, sites, areas, or objects
   based on a historic, cultural, or architectural motif." This and other commercial arterials in Pomona were re-
   cently evaluated citywide as part of the Corridors Specific Plan. The historic resources evaluation associated
   with this planning effort did not identify this property as significant or eligible. (Rincon Consultants, 2013)

   Criterion 9: The property does not appear to "reflect[s] significant geographical patterns, including those as-
   sociated with different eras of settlement and growth, particular transportation modes, or distinctive exam-
   ples of park or community planning." The buildings on the property are a highly altered example of a circa
   1885 residence, and a typical example of automobile-oriented postwar development from the late 1940s.

   Criterion 10: The property does not appear to be "one of the few remaining examples in the City of Pomona,
   region, state, or nation possessing distinguishing characteristics of an architectural or historical type or
   specimen." The property is a combination of a highly altered example of a circa 1885 residence, and a typical
   example of automobile-oriented postwar development from the late 1940s.

   Conclusion

   No buildings on this property appear to be eligible for listing on the NRHP, CRHR or for City of Pomona Land-
   mark designation. Therefore this property should not be regarded as a historic resource for the purposes of
   CEQA.

Executive Summary
This traffic analysis has been prepared to identify and evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the
proposed Holt Family Apartments project. The proposed project is located at 934 West Holt
Avenue in the City of Pomona, California. The project applicant seeks to obtain entitlements to
demolish the existing buildings on the project site and construct an apartment complex with a
total of 62 dwelling units. The apartment complex will include extensive green and landscape
space throughout the site with connections to the adjacent sidewalk provided along Holt Avenue.
It is concluded herein that the proposed project is not expected to cause any potentially
significant impacts at the study intersections.

The traffic analysis follows City of Pomona traffic study guidelines and is consistent with traffic
impact assessment guidelines set forth in the Los Angeles County Congestion Management
Program. This traffic analysis evaluates potential project-related impacts at two key
intersections in the vicinity of the project site. The study intersections were determined in
consultation with City of Pomona Public Works Department staff. The Highway Capacity
Manual analysis method was used to determine the Levels of Service for the study intersections.
A review was also conducted of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
freeway and intersection monitoring stations to determine if a Congestion Management Program
transportation impact assessment analysis is required for the proposed project.

Access to the proposed project site will be consolidated to a single driveway (i.e., reduced from
the existing four site driveways), thus reducing potential turning movements conflicts for traffic
along Holt Avenue and opposing driveways situated on the north side of Holt Avenue.
Vehicular access to the site will be provided via a single driveway located in essentially the same
location as the existing easterly site driveway on Holt Avenue. The project site driveway will be
modified to accommodate two-way traffic and full access (i.e., left-turn and right-turn ingress
and egress turning movements). Additionally, the project site access has been configured to
include a driveway throat sufficient in length to preclude inbound vehicle queuing back out onto
the public right-of-way. The project site driveway will be constructed to City of Pomona design
standards.

1.0        INTRODUCTION
This traffic analysis has been conducted to identify and evaluate the potential traffic impacts of
the proposed Holt Family Apartments project ("proposed project"). The proposed project is
located at 934 West Holt Avenue in the City of Pomona, California. The project applicant seeks
to obtain entitlements to demolish the existing buildings on the project site and construct an
apartment complex with a total of 62 dwelling units. The proposed project site is bounded by
Holt Avenue to the north, existing single-family residential development to the south, and
existing commercial development to the east and west. The project site location and general
vicinity are shown in Figure 1­1.

The traffic analysis follows City of Pomona traffic study guidelines1 and is consistent with traffic
impact assessment guidelines set forth in the Los Angeles County Congestion Management
Program2. This traffic analysis evaluates potential project-related impacts at two key
intersections in the vicinity of the project site. The study intersections were determined in
consultation with City of Pomona Public Works Department (PPWD) staff. The Highway
Capacity Manual analysis method was used to determine Levels of Service for the study
intersections. A review also was conducted of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority freeway and intersection monitoring stations to determine if a Congestion
Management Program transportation impact assessment analysis is required for the proposed
project.

This study (i) presents existing traffic volumes, (ii) includes existing traffic volumes with the
forecast net new traffic volumes from the proposed project, (iii) recommends mitigation
measures, where necessary, (iv) forecasts future cumulative baseline traffic volumes, (v)
forecasts future traffic volumes with the proposed project, (vi) determines future forecast with
project-related impacts, and (vii) recommends mitigation measures, where necessary.

1.1        Study Area
Upon coordination with PPWD staff, two study intersections have been identified for evaluation
during the weekday morning and afternoon peak hours. The study intersections provide local
access to the study area and define the extent of the boundaries for this traffic impact analysis.
Further discussion of the existing street system and study area is provided in Section 3.0.

The traffic impact study area was determined in consultation with PPWD staff and in compliance
with the criteria set forth in the City's traffic study guidelines. Based on these guidelines, the
minimum area to be studied included any intersection of Collector type or higher classification
street with Collector type or higher classification roadways, at which the proposed project will
add 50 or more weekday AM and PM peak hour trips. However, as the proposed project will not
generate 50 or more weekday peak hour trips, the two nearest signalized intersections with
Collector type or higher classification streets along Holt Avenue were identified for analysis.

The general location of the project in relation to the study locations and surrounding street
system is presented in Figure 1­1. The traffic analysis study area is generally comprised of those
locations which have the greatest potential to experience significant traffic impacts due to the
proposed project as defined by the Lead Agency. In the traffic engineering practice, the study
area generally includes those intersections that are:

           a.         Immediately adjacent or in close proximity to the project site;

           b.         In the vicinity of the project site that are documented to have current or projected
                      future adverse operational issues; and

           c.         In the vicinity of the project site that are forecast to experience a relatively greater
                      percentage of project-related vehicular turning movements (e.g., at freeway ramp
                      intersections).

The locations selected for analysis were based on the above criteria, proposed Holt Family
Apartments project peak hour vehicle trip generation, the anticipated distribution of project
vehicular trips and existing intersection/corridor operations.

2.0        PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1        Site Location
The proposed Holt Family Apartments project is located at 934 West Holt Avenue in the City of
Pomona, California. The project applicant seeks to obtain entitlements to demolish the existing
buildings on the project site and construct an apartment complex with a total of 62 dwelling
units. The proposed project site is bounded by Holt Avenue to the north, existing single-family
residential development to the south, and existing commercial development to the east and west.
The project site location and general vicinity are shown in Figure 1­1.

Holt Avenue is identified as one of the principal east-west arterials and commercial corridors in
the City of Pomona, aligning approximately parallel to the Metrolink/Amtrak tracks which are
located about one-quarter mile to the south.3 The portion of Holt Avenue in which the proposed
project is located (i.e., between North Weber Street to White Avenue) includes smaller blocks,
miscellaneous single-family houses, and residential conversion sites in conjunction with the mix
of strip retail and auto service uses. The local and arterial street system pattern in the proposed
project study area form a typical grid pattern.

2.2        Existing Project Site
The existing project site is presently occupied by a trailer home park with a total of
approximately 19 dwelling units. All of the existing dwelling units on the site will be relocated.
At present, access to the existing project site is provided via four driveways situated on the
northerly property frontage along Holt Avenue.

2.3        Proposed Project Description
The project applicant seeks to obtain entitlements for development of an apartment complex with
a total of 62 dwelling units. The apartment complex will include extensive green and landscape
space throughout the site with connections to the adjacent sidewalk provided along Holt Avenue.
The site plan for the proposed Holt Family Apartments project is illustrated in Figure 2-1.
Construction and occupancy of the proposed project is planned to be completed by the year
2014.

As shown in Figure 2-1, a total of 73 parking spaces is planned to be provided as part of the
proposed project. Of this total, a minimum of three parking spaces will need to be Americans
With Disabilities Act handicap accessible spaces. Vehicular access to the site will be provided
via a single driveway located in essentially the same location as the existing easterly site
driveway on Holt Avenue. Further discussion of the proposed project site access and circulation
schemes is provided in Section 3.0.

3.0        SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
The proposed site access scheme for the Holt Family Apartments project is displayed in Figure
2-1. A description of the proposed site access and circulation scheme is provided in the
following subsections.

3.1        Existing Site Access
Vehicular access to the existing site is presently provided via a total of four driveways situated
on the northerly property frontage along Holt Avenue. It is noted that the two existing site
driveways that provide direct access to the trailer home park are one-way driveways, with the
westerly driveway inbound only and the easterly driveway outbound only. Also, it is noted that
the remaining two existing site driveways on Holt Avenue are blocked and currently not in use
for vehicular access. In addition, it is noted that the three existing westerly driveways on Holt
Avenue will be closed pursuant to City standards with concrete curb, gutter and sidewalk as part
of the proposed project. The remaining site driveway (i.e., the easterly driveway located at the
northeast corner of the project site) will be modified and used for vehicular site access for the
proposed project as described below.

3.2        Vehicular Project Site Access
Access to the proposed project site will be consolidated to a single driveway, thus reducing
potential turning movements conflicts for traffic along Holt Avenue and opposing driveways
situated on the north side of Holt Avenue. Vehicular access to the site will be provided via a
single driveway located in essentially the same location as the existing easterly site driveway on
Holt Avenue. The project site driveway will be modified to accommodate two-way traffic and
full access (i.e., left-turn and right-turn ingress and egress turning movements). An existing two-
way left-turn lane is provided on Holt Avenue that can provide a storage area for left-turning
vehicles into the site. Additionally, the project site access has been configured to include a
driveway throat sufficient in length to preclude inbound vehicle queuing back out onto the public
right-of-way. The project site driveway will be constructed to City of Pomona design standards.

3.3        Pedestrian Access
The project site has been configured to facilitate pedestrian activity and walking as a
transportation mode 4. As indicated in Figure 2­1, the proposed project will connect to adjacent
sidewalks but site enhancements are planned to facilitate connectivity and walkability.
Walkability is a term for the extent to which walking is readily available as a safe, connected,
accessible and pleasant mode of transport. There are several criteria that are widely accepted as
key aspects of the walkability of urban areas that should be satisfied. The underlying principle is
that pedestrians should not be delayed, diverted, or placed in danger. The widely accepted
characteristics of walkability are as follows:

4
  For example, refer to http://www.walkscore.com/, which generates a walkability score of approximately 51
(Somewhat Walkable) out of 100 for the project site. Walk Score calculates the walkability of an address by
locating nearby stores, restaurants, schools, parks, etc. Walk Score measures how easy it is to live a car-lite
lifestyle--not how pretty the area is for walking.

                                                                                             Holt Family Apartments Project
                                                                                             O:\JOB_FILE\4013\Report\4013-Rpt1.doc


                                                         -6-
      ·    Connectivity: People can walk from one place to another without encountering major
           obstacles, obstructions, or loss of connectivity.

      ·    Convivial: Pedestrian routes are friendly and attractive, and are perceived as such by
           pedestrians.

      ·    Conspicuous: Suitable levels of lighting, visibility and surveillance over its entire length,
           with high quality delineation and signage.

      ·    Comfortable: High quality and well-maintained footpaths of suitable widths, attractive
           landscaping and architecture, shelter and rest spaces, and a suitable allocation of
           roadspace to pedestrians.

      ·    Convenient: Walking is a realistic travel choice, partly because of the impact of the other
           criteria set forth above, but also because walking routes are of a suitable length as a result
           of land use planning with minimal delays.

A review of the project site location and pedestrian walkway network indicates that these five
primary characteristics are accommodated as part of the proposed project. The project site will
include extensive green and landscape space throughout the site with connections to the adjacent
sidewalk provided along Holt Avenue, which in turn provide connectivity with other area
corridors. As such, the majority of pedestrian access to the project site is envisioned to occur via
the existing public sidewalks provided along both sides of Holt Avenue. In addition, it is noted
that the site's internal pedestrian walkways and adjacent sidewalks should be appropriately
landscaped and adorned to provide a friendly walking environment.

3.4        Bicycle Access
Bicycle access to and from the project site will be facilitated in the future by the planned City of
Pomona's bicycle roadway network. A total of four bicycle facilities (i.e., Class II Bike Lanes, or
Class III Bike Routes) in the City's planned bicycle network will be located within the
immediate proximity from the project site. These four bicycle facilities will in the future connect
with the City's proposed bicycle network. The following key bicycle routes planned to be
located near the Holt Family Apartments project site:

      ·    North-South Routes

           -    Dudley Street:                    Class III Bike Route

           -    Hamilton Boulevard:               Class II Bike Lane

      ·    East-West Routes

           -    Orange Grove Avenue:              Class II Bike Lane

           -    Laurel Avenue:                    Class III Bike Route

Class II bikeways are lanes on the outside edge of roadways reserved for the exclusive use of
bicycles and are designated with special signing and pavement markings. Class III bikeways are
roadways recommended for bicycle use and are designated with signs posted along roadways.
Enhanced Class III bikeways include 4" white edgelines and "Share the Road" signage.

Use of bicycles as a transportation mode to and from the project site will be encouraged by the
provision of ample and safe bicycle parking facilities. Convenient bicycle parking spaces are
recommended for the residents and visitors of the proposed project site.

4.0        EXISTING STREET SYSTEM
4.1        Regional Highway System
Regional access to the project site is provided by I-10 Freeway and State Route 57 Freeway as
shown in Figure 1-1. Brief descriptions of the I-10 and State Route 57 Freeways are provided in
the following paragraphs.

I-10 Freeway is a major east-west oriented freeway connecting the Inland Empire to the east
with Santa Monica to the west. I-10 Freeway generally contains four mainline freeway lanes and
one high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction along with auxiliary lanes in the
project vicinity. On-ramps and off-ramps to/from the freeway in the project vicinity are
provided at Fairplex Drive, Dudley Street, and White Avenue.

State Route 71 Freeway a north-south oriented freeway connecting the eastern San Gabriel
Valley area to the north with Orange County to the south. State Route 71 Freeway generally
contains two mainline freeway lanes in each direction in the project vicinity. On-ramps and off-
ramps to/from the freeway in the project vicinity are provided at Holt Avenue and Mission
Boulevard.

4.2        Local Roadway System
Immediate access to the project site is provided via Holt Avenue. The following study
intersections were selected in consultation with PPWD staff for analysis of potential impacts due
to the proposed project:

           1. Dudley Street/Holt Avenue

           2. Hamilton Boulevard/Holt Avenue

Both study intersections selected for analysis are presently controlled by traffic signals. The
existing lane configurations at the study intersections are displayed in Figure 4­1.

4.3        Roadway Classifications
The City of Pomona utilizes the roadway categories recognized by regional, state and federal
transportation agencies. There are four categories in the roadway hierarchy, ranging from
freeways with the highest capacity to two-lane undivided roadways with the lowest capacity.
The roadway categories are summarized as follows:

      ·    Freeways are limited-access and high speed travel ways included in the state and federal
           highway systems. Their purpose is to carry regional through-traffic. Access is provided
           by interchanges with typical spacing of one mile or greater. No local access is provided
           to adjacent land uses.

           type is divided into two categories: principal and minor arterials. Principal arterials are
           typically four-or-more lane roadways and serve both local and regional through-traffic.
           Minor arterials are typically two-to-four lane streets that service local and commute
           traffic.

      x    Collector roadways are streets that provide access and traffic circulation within
           residential and non-residential (e.g., commercial and industrial) areas. Collector
           roadways connect local streets to arterials and are typically designed with two through
           travel lanes (i.e., one through travel lane in each direction) that may accommodate on-
           street parking. They may also provide access to abutting properties.

      x    Local roadways distribute traffic within a neighborhood, or similar adjacent
           neighborhoods, and are not intended for use as a through-street or a link between higher
           capacity facilities such as collector or arterial roadways. Local streets are fronted by
           residential uses and do not typically serve commercial uses.

5.0        TRAFFIC COUNTS
New manual counts of vehicular turning movements were conducted at each of the study
intersections during the weekday morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) commuter periods to
determine the peak hour traffic volumes. The manual counts were conducted by a traffic count
subconsultant, Accutek Traffic Data, at the study intersections from 6:30 to 9:00 AM to
determine the AM peak commuter hour, and from 4:00 to 6:00 PM to determine the PM peak
commuter hour. In conjunction with the manual turning movement vehicle counts, a count of
bicycle and pedestrian volumes were collected during the peak periods. The traffic counts were
conducted when local schools were in session. Traffic volumes at the study intersections show
the morning and afternoon peak periods typically associated with peak commuter hours in the
metropolitan area.

The existing weekday AM and PM peak commuter period manual counts of turning vehicles at
the study intersections are summarized in Table 5-1. The existing traffic volumes at the study
intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak commuter hours are shown in Figure 5-1,
respectively. Summary data worksheets of the manual traffic counts of the study intersections
are contained in Appendix A.

6.0        CUMULATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
The forecast of future pre-project conditions was prepared in accordance to procedures outlined
in Section 15130 of the CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, the CEQA Guidelines provide two
options for developing the future traffic volume forecast:

           "(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
           cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of
           the [lead] agency, or

           (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted local, regional or statewide
           plan, or related planning document, that describes or evaluates conditions
           contributing to the cumulative effect. Such plans may include: a general plan,
           regional transportation plan, or plans for the reduction of greenhouse gas
           emissions. A summary of projections may also be contained in an adopted or
           certified prior environmental document for such a plan. Such projections may be
           supplemented with additional information such as a regional modeling program.
           Any such document shall be referenced and made available to the public at a
           location specified by the lead agency."

Based on consultation with PPWD staff, the traffic analysis utilizes option "B" for purposes of
developing the future without project traffic volumes as outlined in the CEQA Guidelines.

6.1        Ambient Traffic Growth Factor
The existing traffic volumes were increased at an annual rate of 2.0 percent (2.0%) per year to
the year 2014 (i.e., the anticipated year of project build-out). The ambient growth factor was
determined in consultation with PPWD staff. It is noted that based on general traffic growth
factors provided in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (the
"CMP manual") for the Pomona area (RSA No. 27), it is anticipated that the existing traffic
volumes are expected to increase at an annual rate of less than 2.0% per year between the years
2010 and 2015 (i.e., approximately 1.62%). Thus, application of the 2.0% annual growth factor
allows for a conservative forecast of future traffic volumes in the area. Further, it is noted that
the CMP manual's traffic growth rate is intended to anticipate future traffic generated by
development projects in the project vicinity.

7.0        TRAFFIC FORECASTING METHODOLOGY
In order to estimate the traffic impact characteristics of the Holt Family Apartments project, a
multi-step process has been utilized. The first step is trip generation, which estimates the total
arriving and departing traffic volumes on a peak hour and daily basis. The traffic generation
potential is forecast by applying the appropriate vehicle trip generation equations or rates to the
project development tabulation.

The second step of the forecasting process is trip distribution, which identifies the origins and
destinations of inbound and outbound project traffic volumes. These origins and destinations are
typically based on demographics and existing/anticipated travel patterns in the study area.

The third step is traffic assignment, which involves the allocation of project traffic to study area
streets and intersections. Traffic assignment is typically based on minimization of travel time,
which may or may not involve the shortest route, depending on prevailing operating conditions
and travel speeds. Traffic distribution patterns are indicated by general percentage orientation,
while traffic assignment allocates specific volume forecasts to individual roadway links and
intersection turning movements throughout the study area.

With the forecasting process complete and project traffic assignments developed, the impact of
the proposed project is isolated by comparing operational (i.e., Levels of Service) conditions at
the selected key intersections using existing and expected future traffic volumes without and
with forecast project traffic. The need for site-specific and/or cumulative local area traffic
improvements can then be evaluated and the significance of the project's impacts identified.

7.1        Project Traffic Generation
Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the proposed Holt Family Apartments project
during the weekday AM and PM peak hours, as well as on a daily basis, were estimated using
rates published in the ITE Trip Generation manual. Traffic volumes expected to be generated by
the proposed project were based upon rates per number of dwelling units. ITE Land Use Code
220 (Apartment) trip generation average rates were used to forecast the traffic volumes expected
to be generated by the proposed project.

It is noted that there is an existing active land use on the project site (i.e., the trailer home park).
However, as the number of occupied units was indeterminate at this time and the units are
anticipated to be relocated, it was determined in consultation with PPWD staff to not employ an
existing use trip credit in the project trip generation forecasts. Further, this approach allows for a
conservative, worst case forecast of project-related trips.

The trip generation forecast for the proposed project is summarized in Table 7-1. The trip
generation forecast for the proposed project was submitted for review and approval by PPWD
staff. As presented in Table 7-1, the proposed project is expected to generate 32 vehicle trips (6
inbound trips and 26 outbound trips) during the weekday AM peak hour. During the weekday
PM peak hour, the proposed project is expected to generate 38 vehicle trips (25 inbound trips and

13 outbound trips). Over a weekday 24-hour period, the proposed project is forecast to generate
412 daily trip ends (206 inbound trips and 206 outbound trips) during a typical weekday.

7.2        Project Traffic Distribution and Assignment
Project traffic volumes both entering and exiting the site have been distributed and assigned to
the adjacent street system based on the following considerations:

      ·    The site's proximity to major traffic corridors (i.e., Holt Avenue, Dudley Street, Hamilton
           Boulevard, White Avenue, etc.);

      ·    Expected localized traffic flow patterns based on adjacent roadway channelization and
           presence of traffic signals;

      ·    Existing intersection traffic volumes;

      ·    Ingress/egress availability at the project site assuming the site access and circulation
           scheme described in Section 3.0;

      ·    Nearby population and employment centers as well as adjacent residential
           neighborhoods; and

      ·    Input from PPWD staff.

The general, directional traffic distribution patterns for the proposed project are presented in
Figure 7-1. The forecast weekday AM and PM peak hour project traffic volumes at the study
intersections associated with the proposed project are presented in Figure 7-2. The traffic
volume assignments presented in Figure 7-2 reflect the traffic distribution characteristics shown
in Figure 7-1 and the project traffic generation forecast presented in Table 7-1.

8.0        TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
The study intersections were evaluated using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method of
analysis which determines vehicular delays at intersections. The overall intersection control
delay is subsequently assigned a Level of Service (LOS) value to describe intersection
operations.

Levels of Service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of delay, which is a measure of
driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time. The delay experienced by a
motorist is made up of a number of factors that relate to control, geometrics, traffic, and
incidents. Total delay is the difference between the travel time actually experienced and the
reference travel time that would result during ideal conditions: in the absence of traffic control,
in the absence of geometric delay, in the absence of incidents, and when there are no other
vehicles on the road. Only the portion of total delay attributed to the control facility is
quantified. This delay is called control delay. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay,
queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. Control delay may also be
referred to as signal delay. Level of Service criteria for traffic signals are stated in terms of the
average control delay per vehicle. Delay is a complex measure and is dependent on a number of
variables, including the quality of progression, the cycle length, the green ratio, and the V/C ratio
for the lane group in question. A description of the HCM signalized method and corresponding
Levels of Service is provided in Appendix B.

8.1        Impact Criteria and Thresholds
The relative impact of the added project traffic volumes to be generated by the proposed project
during the weekday AM and PM peak hours was evaluated based on analysis of future operating
conditions at the study intersections, without and with the proposed project. The previously
discussed capacity analysis procedures were utilized to evaluate the future v/c relationships and
service level characteristics at each study intersection.

The significance of the potential impacts of project-generated traffic was identified using the
traffic impact criteria set forth in the City of Pomona Public Works Department Traffic Impact
Study Guidelines, February, 2012. According to the City's published traffic study guidelines, the
impact is considered significant if the project-related increase in the v/c ratio equals or exceeds
the thresholds presented in Table 8­1.

                                       INTERSECTION IMPACT THRESHOLD CRITERIA
                                                Signalized Intersections
Any study intersection that is operating at LOS `A', `B', `C' or `D' for any study scenario without
project traffic in which the addition of project traffic causes the intersection to degrade to a LOS `E' or
`F' shall mitigate that impact so as to bring the intersection back to at least LOS `D'.
Any study intersection that is operating at LOS `E' or `F' for any study scenario without project traffic
shall mitigate any impacts so as to bring the intersection back to the overall level of delay established
prior to project traffic being added.


                                              Unsignalized Intersections
An impact is considered significant if the study determines that either section a) or both sections b) and
c) occur:
      a) The addition of project related traffic causes the intersection to move from a LOS `D' or better
         to a LOS `E' or worse
OR
      b) The project contributes additional traffic to an intersection that is already projected to operated
         at LOS `E' or `F' with background traffic (per Section 3.2 b))
            AND
      c) One or both of the following conditions are met:
            1) The project adds ten (10) or more trips to any approach
            2) The intersection meets the peak hour traffic signal warrant after the addition of project
               traffic (per Section 3.2 c)).




The City's threshold criteria requires mitigation of project traffic impacts whenever traffic
generated by the proposed development causes an increase of the analyzed intersection v/c ratio
and/or delay by an amount equal to or greater than the values shown above.

8.2        Traffic Impact Analysis Scenarios
Pursuant to the City's traffic study guidelines, Level of Service calculations have been prepared
for the following scenarios for the study intersections:

           (a)        Existing (2013) conditions.
           (b)        Condition (a) with completion and occupancy of the project.
           (c)        Condition (b) with implementation of project mitigation measures where
                      necessary.
           (d)        Condition (a) plus two percent (2.0%) annual ambient traffic growth through year
                      2014 (i.e., future without project conditions)
           (e)        Condition (d) with completion and occupancy of the project.
           (f)        Condition (e) with implementation of project mitigation measures where
                      necessary.

The traffic volumes for each new condition were added to the volumes in the prior condition to
determine the change in capacity utilization at the study intersections.

9.0        TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
The traffic impact analysis prepared for the study intersections using the HCM methodology and
application of the City of Pomona significant traffic impact criteria is summarized in Table 9­1.
The HCM data worksheets for the analyzed intersections are contained in Appendix B.

9.1        Existing Conditions
9.1.1 Existing Conditions
As indicated in column [1] of Table 9­1, both study intersections are presently operating at LOS
B or better during the weekday AM and PM peak hours under existing conditions. The existing
traffic volumes at the study intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are
displayed in Figure 5­1.

9.1.2 Existing With Project Conditions
As shown in column [2] of Table 9­1, application of the City's threshold criteria to the "Existing
With Project" scenario indicates that the proposed project is not expected to create significant
impacts at either of the study intersections. Incremental, but not significant, impacts are noted at
the study intersections. Because there are no significant impacts, no traffic mitigation measures
are required or recommended for the study intersections under the "Existing With Project"
conditions. The existing with project traffic volumes at the study intersections during the
weekday AM and PM peak hours are illustrated in Figure 9­1.

9.2        Future Conditions
9.2.1 Future Without Project Conditions
The future without project conditions were forecast based on the addition of traffic generated by
the growth in traffic due to the combined effects of continuing development, intensification of
existing developments and other factors (i.e., ambient growth). The delay at the study
intersections is incrementally increased with the addition of ambient traffic growth. As
presented in column [3] of Table 9­1, both study intersections are expected to continue operating
at LOS B or better during the weekday AM and PM peak hours with the addition of growth in
ambient traffic under the future without project conditions. The future without project (existing
and ambient growth) traffic volumes at the study intersections during the weekday AM and PM
peak hours are presented in Figure 9­2.

10.0 CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TRAFFIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is a state-mandated program that was enacted by
the California State Legislature with the passage of Proposition 111 in 1990. The program is
intended to address the impact of local growth on the regional transportation system.

As required by the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County, a Traffic
Impact Assessment (TIA) has been prepared to determine the potential impacts on designated
monitoring locations on the CMP highway system. The analysis has been prepared in
accordance with procedures outlined in the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los
Angeles County, County of Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 2010.

According to Section D.9.1 (Appendix D, page D-6) of the 2010 CMP manual, the criteria for
determining a significant transportation impact is listed below:

           "A significant transportation impact occurs when the proposed project increases
           traffic demand on a CMP facility by 2% of capacity (V/C > 0.02), causing or
           worsening LOS F (V/C > 1.00)."

The CMP impact criteria apply for analysis of both intersection and freeway monitoring
locations.

10.1       Intersections
The following CMP intersection monitoring locations in the project vicinity have been identified:

     ·     CMP Station                 Intersection

           No. 124                     Arrow Highway/Garey Avenue

           No. 125                     Corona Expressway/Garey Avenue

           No. 126                     Corona Expressway/Mission Boulevard

The CMP TIA guidelines require that intersection monitoring locations must be examined if the
proposed project will add 50 or more trips during either the AM or PM weekday peak hours.
The proposed project will not add 50 or more trips during either the AM or PM weekday peak
hours (i.e., of adjacent street traffic) at the CMP monitoring intersections in the project vicinity,
which is stated in the CMP manual as the threshold criteria for a traffic impact assessment.
Therefore, no further review of potential impacts to intersection monitoring locations that are
part of the CMP highway system is required.

10.2       Freeways
The following CMP freeway monitoring location has been identified in the project vicinity:

     ·     CMP Station                 Location

           No. 1020                    I-10 Freeway at Dudley Street

The CMP TIA guidelines require that freeway monitoring locations must be examined if the
proposed project will add 150 or more trips (in either direction) during either the AM or PM
weekday peak periods. The proposed project will not add 150 or more trips (in either direction)
during either the AM or PM weekday peak hours to CMP freeway monitoring locations which is
the threshold for preparing a traffic impact assessment, as stated in the CMP manual. Therefore,
no further review of potential impacts to freeway monitoring locations that are part of the CMP
highway system is required.

10.3       Transit Impact Review
As required by the 2010 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County, a review has
been made of the potential impacts of the project on transit service. As discussed in Subsection
4.5 herein, existing transit service is provided in the vicinity of the proposed Holt Family
Apartments project.

The project trip generation, as shown in Table 7­1, was adjusted by values set forth in the CMP
(i.e., person trips equal 1.4 times vehicle trips, and transit trips equal 3.5 percent of the total
person trips) to estimate transit trip generation. Pursuant to the CMP guidelines, the proposed
project is forecast to generate demand for 2 transit trips during the weekday AM peak hour and 2
transit trips during the weekday PM peak hour. Over a 24-hour period, the proposed project is
forecast to generate demand for 20 daily transit trips. Therefore, the calculations are as follows:

     ·     AM Peak Hour = 32 × 1.4 × 0.035 = 2 Transit Trips

     ·     PM Peak Hour = 38 × 1.4 × 0.035 = 2 Transit Trips

     ·     Daily Trips = 412 × 1.4 × 0.035 = 20 Transit Trips

As shown in Table 4­1, two transit lines and routes are provided adjacent to or in close
proximity the project site. As outlined in Table 4­1, under the "No. of Buses/Trains During
Peak Hour" column, these two transit lines provide services for an average of (i.e., average of the
directional number of buses/trains during the peak hours) generally two buses/trains during the
weekday AM peak hour and roughly two buses/trains during the weekday PM peak hour.
Therefore, based on the above calculated weekday AM and PM peak hour trips, this would
correspond to no more than one additional transit rider per bus/train. It is anticipated that the
existing transit service in the project area will adequately accommodate the increase of project-
generated transit trips. Thus, given the low number of project-generated transit trips per

to occur as a result of the proposed project.

11.0 CONCLUSIONS
This traffic impact analysis has been prepared to evaluate the potential impacts to the local street
system due to the Holt Family Apartments project. Two intersections were identified and
analyzed in order to determine changes in operations following construction and occupancy of
the proposed project. Application of the impact threshold criteria from the City of Pomona
indicates that none of the study intersections would be significantly impacted by the forecast
project traffic. Incremental but not significant impacts are noted at the study intersections
evaluated in this analysis. As no significant impacts are expected due to the proposed project, no
traffic mitigation measures are required or recommended for the study intersections.

                                LEVEL OF SERVICE FOR SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS

In the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), published by the Transportation Research Board, 2000, level of service for signalized
intersections is defined in terms of delay, which is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and increased
travel time. The delay experienced by a motorist is made up of a number of factors that relate to control, geometrics, traffic, and
incidents. Total delay is the difference between the travel time actually experienced and the reference travel time that would
result during base conditions: in the absence of traffic control, in the absence of geometric delay, in the absence of incidents, and
when there are no other vehicles on the road. Only the portion of total delay attributed to the control facility is quantified. This
delay is called control delay. Control delay includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final
acceleration delay.

Level of Service criteria for traffic signals are stated in terms of the average control delay per vehicle. Delay is a complex
measure and is dependent on a number of variables, including the quality of progression, the cycle length, the green ratio, and the
v/c ratio for the lane group in question.

Level of Service (LOS) values are used to describe intersection operations with service levels varying from LOS A (free flow) to
LOS F (jammed condition). The following descriptions summarize HCM criteria for each level of service:

LOS A describes operations with very low control delay, up to 10 seconds per vehicle. This level of service occurs when
progression is extremely favorable and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle
lengths may also contribute to low delay values.

LOS B describes operations with control delay greater than 10 and up to 20 seconds per vehicle. This level generally occurs with
good progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of delay.

LOS C describes operations with control delay greater than 20 and up to 35 seconds per vehicle. These higher delays may result
from fair progression, longer cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number of
vehicles stopping is significant at this level, though many still pass through the intersection without stopping.

LOS D describes operations with control delay greater than 35 and up to 55 seconds per vehicle. At LOS D, the influence of
congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from some combination of unfavorable progression, long cycle
lengths, or high v/c ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are
noticeable.

LOS E describes operations with control delay greater than 55 and up to 80 seconds per vehicle. This level is considered by
many agencies to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle
lengths, and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.

LOS F describes operations with control delay in excess of 80 seconds per vehicle. This level, considered to be unacceptable to
most drivers, often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity of the lane groups. It may also
occur at high v/c ratios with many individual cycle failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also be major
contributing factors to such delay levels.

1.0    INTRODUCTION

LEA Consulting Limited (LEA) was retained by Dash Developments Inc. to prepare a traffic assessment
study for a proposed mixed use development at 143 Avenue Road. This report reviews the transportation
impacts associated with a redevelopment of the subject site in relation to a rezoning application with the
City. The subject site is situated on the east side of Avenue Road and south of Davenport Road in the
City of Toronto. Figure 1.1 provides a map of the site location while Figure 1.2 shows the proposed site
plan.

Figure 1.2: Proposed Site Plan Site


The subject site is currently vacant. The proposal includes 94 residential units and approximately 863.5
sq. m. or 9,294 sq. ft. of retail space. 67 parking spaces are proposed on-site in three (3) underground
parking levels. Vehicular access to the underground parking lot is provided via an unsignalized driveway
on Avenue Road approximately 82 metres south of Davenport Road.

This report is prepared in accordance with the Terms of Reference submitted to the City on August 8,
2012 and the directions received upon subsequent correspondence with City Staff (Appendix A). This
report was prepared in accordance with City of Toronto's Guidelines for the Preparation of
Transportation Impact Studies. This report examines the traffic scenarios associated with the existing
conditions, the 2018 future background traffic conditions and future total traffic conditions. Traffic
conditions in both the AM and PM peak hours were examined since these represent the peak traffic
conditions for the proposed residential use as well as for traffic on the main roads in the study area.

2.4     DATA COLLECTION

In order to assess the current traffic conditions, traffic counts were undertaken by LEA staff at the
following intersections:
       Avenue Road at Davenport Road; and,
       Avenue Road at Bernard Avenue.

The counts were conducted during the a.m. and p.m. peak periods (7:30 ­ 9:30 a.m., 4:00 ­ 6:00 p.m.) on
Thursday September 27, 2012. Northbound queues on Avenue Road were observed to determine if
vehicles queuing extend to the proposed site access.

Peak hour volumes for the entire study area were determined based on the peak hourly volumes at the
Avenue Road and Davenport Road intersection. The a.m. peak hour occurred from 8:15 ­ 9:15 a.m. and
the p.m. peak hour was from 5:00 ­ 6:00 p.m. The turning movement volumes are contained in
Appendix B.


2.5     EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

During the weekday a.m. peak hour northbound and southbound vehicular traffic volumes along Avenue
Road are in the order of 550 and 1,300 vehicles, respectively. The flow of traffic is generally heavier in
the southbound direction as this traffic generally is heading to the central business district (CBD) and
Downtown core. A reverse traffic flow is observed in the weekday p.m. peak hour a general range of
1,450 and 640 for the northbound and southbound traffic volumes.

During the weekday a.m. peak hour, traffic volumes along Davenport Road are in the range of 900-1,000
vehicles. A reverse traffic flow is observed in the weekday p.m. peak hour but with higher volumes. The
eastbound and westbound volumes are about 850 and 1,050, respectively. Figure 2.3 shows the existing
balanced traffic conditions.

2.6     INTERSECTION CAPACITY ANALYSIS

The signalized intersections in the study area were analyzed using Synchro Version 8 (Build 803,
Revision 743), which is based on the methodology outlined in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. The
analysis applies traffic signal timings were obtained from the City of Toronto. Intersection capacity
analyses were conducted using Synchro Software Version 8.0 based on the methodology outlined in the
Highway Capacity Manual (2000). Existing signal timing information was obtained from the City of
Toronto was used for the signalized capacity analysis and contained in Appendix B. An area type
Central Business District (CBD) was applied.

Table 2.2 shows the calculated PHF values by intersection and by individual movement. Detailed PHF
calculations can be found in Appendix B.

Table 2.2: Calculated Peak Hour Factors By Intersection

We assigned the default values as stipulated in the City Synchro guidelines for calculated values below
the default values. For any calculated PHF values above the City guidelines, we used the higher value in
the capacity analyses.

To account for the impact of the TTC buses, a bus blockage factor was applied in the analysis. Based on
our turning movement counts, Avenue Road has up to 8 buses during the weekday a.m. peak hour.
Davenport Road has 8 eastbound and 11 westbound buses. For the weekday p.m. peak hour, service
frequency decreases to 4 and 6 buses to the northbound and southbound directions, respectively. Only 5
buses were observed for each of the eastbound and westbound directions. These bus blockages were
applied to the right turn lanes in the capacity analysis.

The existing balanced traffic volumes include illegal left turn movements at the Avenue Road and
Davenport Road intersection. We reassigned these illegal left turns as through movements and
accordingly. We revised the movement intersection as a through movement only as oppose to a shared
left/through lane.

conditions. The detailed existing traffic conditions output summaries are provided in Appendix B.

Table 2.3: Existing Traffic Levels of Service ­ Signalized Intersections

Analysis results indicate that the Avenue Road/Davenport Road intersection currently operate at
acceptable levels of service during both peak hours. Vehicles heading towards the CBD (i.e. southbound
and eastbound directions) were the busiest during the A.M. peak hour has some congestion issues. The
southbound movement operates at overcapacity during the AM peak hour. It was observed that vehicles
in the shared through/left-turn lane would manoeuvre into the adjacent lane rather than wait for left-turn
vehicles to proceed in order to avoid being delayed. This behaviour is commonly observed at
intersections with shared turning lanes. The eastbound movement has a v/c ratio of 1.00 but the delay
time is about 50 seconds.

During the weekday PM peak hour, acceptable levels of service occur for all movements with no
capacity or delay issues. For the northbound movement, the 50th percentile queue length was calculated
at 76.0 metres. Since Bernard Avenue is located about located approximately 69 metres from the stop bar
at Davenport Road signalized intersection, the vehicle queues extend about 7 metres or one (1) car length
past Bernard Avenue. The detailed existing traffic conditions output summaries are provided in
Appendix B.

Table 2.4: Existing Traffic Levels of Service ­ Unsignalized Intersections

The eastbound movement from Bernard Avenue experience similar delay times during both peak hours.
This delay is due to the limited gap opportunities available when attempting to access Avenue Road.
Such conditions are typically observed at unsignalized minor street/arterial road intersections in the
Downtown during peak hours. The heavy southbound volumes during the weekday a.m. peak hour leaves
few only gap opportunities until traffic clears Bernard Avenue. After this, a sufficient gap in the
northbound traffic stream must be identified. For the PM peak hour, the left turn movement relies on
courtesy gaps due the heavy northbound volumes.

3.0    FUTURE BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

The following sections outline the assumptions for the future background traffic conditions and includes
existing traffic plus growth in traffic related to new developments within the immediate area and road
growth and is based on a five-year horizon (year 2018).

3.1    GENERAL CORRIDOR GROWTH

Typically, future background traffic includes: (1) growth in traffic along the abutting arterial roads to
reflect the general growth in the surrounding area; and, (2) the traffic that could be generated by nearby
approved and/or potential developments. The average annual growth rates per direction at the Avenue
Road and Davenport Road intersection was derived from peak hour turning movement counts from 1994
to 2013. The growth rate calculations are shown in Exhibit C1 of Appendix C. Table 3.1 summarizes
the growth rates.

                                Davenport Road                               Avenue Road
                         Eastbound           Westbound            Northbound           Southbound
  AM Peak Hour            -1.15%                0.57%               -1.26%                 -1.77%
  PM Peak Hour            -0.55%               -0.40%               -1.87%                 -1.70%
Table 3.1: Average Annual Growth Rates for Traffic at Avenue Road and Davenport Road
intersection.

The above review suggests a negative general increase in peak hour traffic volumes over the past 18
years. Understanding that the majority of study area is built-out and transit service is highly accessible
and frequent, we expect that any change in traffic patterns will be associated with specific background
developments. Consequently no general corridor traffic growth has been assumed with this study.


3.2    BACKGROUND DEVELOPMENT TRAFFIC

LEA was able to obtain detailed information on background development site traffic in the study area.
The background development site traffic incorporated within this study would represent the forecasted
future traffic growth along Avenue Road and Davenport Road. The potential developments considered in
the future background traffic forecast and their respective traffic studies are listed in Table 3.1 below.

3.3     BACKGROUND DEVELOPMENT TRAFFIC TRIP GENERATION

Background development site trips for all developments were taken from traffic impact studies where
available. No traffic impact study was available for the 25 Bellair Street and 55 Avenue Road
developments. Subsequently, trip generation calculations were estimated. These two developments are
located in the downtown area of Toronto and auto use would be lower compared to a suburban location
given the availability of other travel modes such as public transit or walking travel modes. Thus, site
generated trips would be subject to a modal split review to refine the site generated trip rate and trips.

As we understand it, the ITE trip rate calculations are derived from surveys carried out in suburban
locations with approximately 90% auto modal split. We reviewed the modal split rates in the subject area
and surrounding Toronto Transportation Survey (TTS) zones to refine the residential trip generation rate.
Exhibit C2 in Appendix C shows the modal split calculations for the residential land uses. Auto use
represents 47% of modal choice followed by transit at 29% and cycling/walking at 24% for home-based
work trips originating in the study area during the weekday AM peak period.

To calculate the number of residential site trips, we applied the ITE trip rate equation to the number of
residential units with each development. The resulting value was proportionally adjusted to reflect the
47% auto mode split. The balance of the residential generate site trips use transit, cycling or walking.
Figure 4.1 shows the calculation methodology in determining the residential site trips for the weekday
AM and PM Peak hours.

Figure 3.1: Adjusted ITE Trip Rate for Residential Trip Generation (143 Avenue Road)

For the proposed commercial use on the subject site, we assumed that the retail component will not be
open for business during the AM peak hour. Thus, no primary and pass-by retail trips included for the
weekday AM peak hour. We applied the ITE rates for shopping centre uses (Land Use #820) for the
commercial use. A pass-by trip rate of 34% for the weekday PM peak hour was applied. Similar to
residential land uses, we applied a modal split rate to the retail generated site trips. Exhibit C3 in
Appendix C shows the modal split calculations for the proposed commercial space which uses
discretionary type trips.

Trip generation for 25 Bellair Street development uses the ITE trip rate equation for Land Use #710
(General Office Building) for the office portion and ITE Land Use #820 (Shopping Center) for the retail
component. After accounting for site interaction trips and modal split, the total two-way site generated
trips is 25 (21 In, 4 Out) and 56 (13 In, 43 Out) for the weekday AM and PM peak hours; respectively.
Exhibit C4 summarizes the trip generation for this development proposal.

The 55 Avenue Road development proposal has a residential unit size of 50 square metres. To be
conservative, we assumed that this unit generates 1 auto trip for the outbound and inbound directions for
the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. For the 739.9 m2 retail space, we applied the ITE Code 820
(Shopping Center) average trip rate as oppose to the trip rate equation since the retail space is small and
would generate fewer site trips. As with the 25 Bellair Street trip generation calculations, a pass-by rate
of 35% was used for the PM peak hour. After accounting for site interaction trips, the total two-way site
generated trips for the AM and PM peak hours are 5 (3 In, 2 Out) and 16 8In, 8 Out). Exhibit C5
summarizes the trip generation for 55 Avenue Road.


3.4    TRIP DISTRIBUTION

The trip distribution for the 25 Bellair Street and 55 Avenue Road developments were estimated using
2006 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) Survey data. Both developments are situated in YYS zone
45. Trip distribution was determined for the residential and commercial component for each peak hour
during the weekday. It is expected that the majority of auto trips originating from the residential portion
of the development will be traveling to the destination of work during the AM peak hour. Therefore, the
trip distribution for the residential trips was calculated based on TTS data for home-based trips.

For the commercial component, the trip distribution was calculated based on TTS data for discretionary
based trips. We calculated the PM peak hour

Exhibit C6-7 of Appendix C calculates the trip distribution for the residential and commercial
components during the AM and PM peak hours. We understand that the 25 Bellair Street and 55 Avenue

Road developments would make uses of the immediate surround road network for both in and outbound
site trips. To be conservative, we assumed all site generated trips by these two developments uses
Avenue Road only for inbound and outbound site trips. Table 3.5 summarizes the directional
distribution for each peak hour.

Detailed site traffic diagrams of each background development and total background development site
traffic can be found in Appendix C. The future background traffic volumes, which combines existing
traffic and background development site traffic is shown as Figures 3.1. For the 25 Bellair Street and 55
Avenue Road development site trips, the number of trips on Avenue Road passing-by 143 Avenue Road
is less than what is indicated in Exhibits C4 and C5 of Appendix C for the A.M. peak hour. This
difference can be attributed to the development generated pass-by site trips near each subject site.

3.5      INTERSECTION CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Intersection capacity analysis was conducted for the future background traffic conditions based on traffic
volumes which incorporate background development site traffic and the reassignment of existing illegal
left turns as a through movement. Existing signal timing plans were utilized in the analysis.

Signalized Intersections

Table 3.4 below summarizes the levels of service at the signalized intersections under future background
traffic conditions with the detailed output summaries provided in Appendix D. Southbound movement
continues to experience heavy delay times with an increase of 43 seconds for the A.M. peak hour. The
eastbound movement still operates with some delay at 59 seconds, or increasing by 9 seconds compared
to existing traffic conditions. During the PM peak hour, the northbound movement operates with a v/c
below 1.00. However, the increase in delay time is eleven (11) seconds with an overall delay time of 36.8
seconds.

During the weekday PM peak hour, the northbound 50th percentile queue lengths increase to 94.6 metres.
Compared to existing traffic, the queue lengths increase by about 19 metres or 3 vehicles. Overall, these
queuing conditions are similar as with existing traffic.

Table 3.5 summarizes the levels of service at the unsignalized intersections under future background
traffic conditions with more detailed output summaries provided in Appendix D. Similar to existing
conditions, the outbound movements from Bernard Avenue have a delay time around 30 seconds with
v/c ratios of at most 0.23. The delay time for the eastbound left is about 3.2 seconds more than under
existing conditions. For the right turn movement, the additional delay is less than 1 second.

4.0     TRIP GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION
4.1     PROPOSED TRIP GENERATION

The proposed development includes 94 condominium residential units and approximately 865 m2 of
retail/commercial space. Residential trip generation uses ITE Land Use #230 (Residential
Condominium/Townhouses (Land Use #230) trip rate equation. No trip generation for the retail
component was applied as the proposed retail is for ancillary uses for the residents of the subject site.
Subsequently, the proposed retail component is not expected to generate any site trips.

A reduction in site generated trip to account for modal split was applied to the residential and retail site
trips generated. As the subject site resides in the same TTS zone as with 25 Bellair Street and 55 Avenue
Road developments, the modal split rates for the residential and retail portion were applied. The
remaining residential and retail generated site trips would use transit, cycling or walking travel modes.

The proposed development scenario generates a total of 23 and 27 two-way new site trips during
A.M. and P.M. peak hours, respectively. Table 4.1 summarizes the trip generation for the proposed
development.

4.2     TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT

The subject site is located in TTS zone 45 which is the same zone as with the 25 Bellair Street and 55
Avenue Road development proposals. Subsequently, the distribution calculations highlighted in Table
3.5 can be used for the subject site. The trip distribution was reviewed for site traffic passing through the
Avenue Road and Davenport Road intersection while observing the intersection turning restrictions.

The proposed site access is aligned with Bernard Avenue and is to operate with right-in/right-out
movements. As such, site traffic can only enter the site from the south and exit to the north. Trip
assignments for the proposed development were derived based on the general trip distribution logical
routing for vehicles to/from the proposed site and the turning prohibitions within the study area. A
circuitous route around the proposed site is required. For inbound site traffic originating from the north
and west, site traffic must travel east on Davenport Road east of Avenue Road, west on Berryman Street,
north on Hazelton Lane, west on Webster Avenue and then north on Avenue Road to the subject site.

For site traffic returning south after leaving the subject site, the travel path involves a northbound right at
Davenport Road followed by a southerly path one of Bay Street, Yonge Street or Church Street.

Table 4.2 summarizes the general trip distribution.

5.0      FUTURE TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

Future total traffic volumes were determined by adding the site generated traffic for the proposed
development to total future background traffic volumes. Figure 5.1 illustrates the assumed future lane
configuration with the proposed development. Future total traffic volumes are illustrated in Figures 5.2.
The existing signal timing plans were utilized for the Avenue Road and Davenport Road intersection.

Signalized Intersections

Table 5.1 below summarizes the levels of service at the signalized intersections under future total traffic
conditions with the detailed output summaries provided in Appendix F. During the weekday AM peak
hour, the southbound movement experience an increase in delay time from 140.2 to 142.9 seconds or a
nominal increase of about 3 seconds. The eastbound movement has a delay time increase of just over 3
seconds. Delay time for the other movements remains unchanged from future background conditions.

The additional delay to the northbound and southbound movements during the weekday PM peak hour is
under 1 second. Both movements have a v/c ratio below 1.00 with delay times less than 40 seconds.

The northbound 50th percentile queue lengths increases by about one (1) metre during the weekday AM
peak hour. For the weekday PM peak hour, the same queues increase by a maximum of 2.0 metres which
is less than one (1) vehicle. This increase in the northbound vehicle queuing is no different to the future
background traffic conditions.

If the northbound queues block the proposed site access, no vehicle can exit the site. Any outbound left
or right turn movement will experience a similar condition as the outbound movement uses a single
shared left/right turn lane. Subsequently, there would be no difference if the proposed site access is
designed as a full movement or with just right-in/right-out movements.

Table 5.1: Future Total Traffic Levels of Service ­ Signalized Intersections

Unsignalized Intersections

Table 5.2 summarizes the levels of service at the unsignalized intersections under future total traffic
conditions with detailed outputs provided in Appendix F. We reviewed the proposed site access as a full
movement access. The delay time for the eastbound left movement increases by about 16 and 11 seconds
for the weekday AM and PM peak hours, respectively. Despite this increase, the v/c ratio for this
movement is well below 1.00. No additional delay time was projected for the eastbound right turn
movement.

City of Toronto                                                                                                       20



Outbound development site traffic is projected to experience a maximum delay time of 32 seconds
amongst both peak hours with an acceptable level of service.

The inbound left movement is forecasted to experience a maximum delay time of about 2 seconds. This
movement is expected to operate in a similar manner as with the southbound left movement at the
Avenue Road /Davenport Road intersection. As indicated in section 2.6 (Existing Traffic Conditions),
vehicles in the shared through/left-turn lane would by-pass a waiting the left turning vehicle by
manoeuvring into the adjacent lane rather than wait for left-turn vehicles to proceed. We expect similar
type of movements to occur at the proposed site access should there be an inbound left vehicle waiting
for an opportunity to turn into the proposed site.

Moreover, the southbound left movement is minor in volumes. The maximum number of inbound left
turns is 15 or an average of about 1 vehicle every 4 minutes. Northbound Avenue Road is a busy
outbound route from downtown Toronto and other vehicle obstruction downstream on Avenue Road is
expected. Subsequently, the southbound left movement to occur when northbound traffic discharges at
the end of the green phase at the Avenue Road/Davenport Road intersection or through the use of
courtesy gaps. Overall, the proposed development does not adversely affect the operations at the Bernard
Avenue / site access intersection.

6.0     PARKING
The proposed development is located on the east side of Avenue Road south of Davenport Road and is
subject to the City of Toronto Zoning By-Law 438-86. It can also be noted that the surrounding
neighbourhood is an established area that has high pedestrian and transit use with numerous shops,
restaurants and other commercial uses within walking distance of the subject site where the need for
vehicle travel is not required. As such, the parking requirements for the proposed development have been
reviewed with the application of the Downtown Area parking rates.

Tables 6.1 summarize the residential parking requirements under Section 4(5) of the City of Toronto By-law
No. 438-86 for the Downtown Area.

Table 6.1: Residential Parking Requirements (Downtown Rate)

A total supply of 70 residential and visitor parking spaces are required. The development proposes a total
supply of 67 spaces comprising of 61 residential and 6 visitor spaces. This translates into a residential supply
ratio of 0.62 spaces per unit.

LEA had conducted a proxy site parking demand survey at 33 Charles Street East. This site is located just
south and east of the Yonge Street and Bloor Street intersection and two (2) TTC subway lines. Surveys were
conducted hourly beginning Friday September 7, 2012 at 9:00 p.m. and the last survey was undertaken on
Wednesday September 12, 2012 at 4:00 a.m. This proxy site has 420 units and a supply of 255 spaces,
corresponding to a supply ratio of 0.61 spaces per unit. Peak demand was for 178 spaces for a demand ratio of
0.42 spaces per unit (See Exhibit G1 in Appendix G)

The residential parking supply ratio at 33 Charles Street is very similar to rate proposed at the subject site.
The subject site is located in the downtown area and is within a reasonable walking distance to a subway
station or can be easily accessible to a subway station from two (2) of the TTC surface bus routes passing
through the Avenue Road and Davenport Road intersection. As such, it is evident that a reduced parking
demand is demonstrated in development in close proximity to transit use. As such, it is our opinion that the
proposed parking reduction at the subject site will be reasonable and it is supportable based on the observed
parking demand ratio of 0.42 spaces per unit at 33 Charles Street.

City of Toronto                                                                                             24

The proposed residential parking supply of 58 spaces or 0.62 spaces per unit at the proposed development will
be sufficient as it is demonstrated that more household can live in the urban downtown environment without
owning private automobile.

In accordance to by-law 438-86, retail parking is not to be supplied if the retail floor area coverage is less
than 1.0 times the lot area. Total retail floor area proposed is 863.5 m2 and the total lot area is proposed at
lot area is 1,022 m2. This translates into a value of 0.84 times the lot area. Therefore, no retail parking is
required.


7.0     LOADING

A total of 94 residential units and 863.5 m2 of commercial space are proposed with this development. A
review of the City of Toronto newly adopted zoning by-law require 1 Type "G" loading spaces for
development containing 31 to 399 dwelling units. For commercial space, the 1 Type "B" loading space is
required for a gross floor area of 500 to 1,999 m2.

One shared Type "B/G" loading space is proposed on-site which is accessible from the single site access
driveway at Avenue Road. Due to the infrequent usage of the Type "G" loading space, for garbage and
moving purposes, and the relative small retail loading requirement, one shared loading space will be
sufficient for the proposed development.

Due to the site's proximity to the Downtown Area, it is anticipated that applying the loading
requirements based on Section 4(5) of the City of Toronto Zoning By-Law No. 438-86 would be
appropriate for the proposed development. One (1) Type `G' and One (1) Type "B" loading spaces are
required for the proposed development when applying the Downtown rates. Table 9.1 below summarizes
the number of loading spaces required as per minimum requirements of the Downtown by-law.

                                                                           City of Toronto

As mentioned above, infrequent use of the Type "G" loading space, and a small retail loading area
requirements, one shared loading space can accommodate the entire site. As such, the proposed loading
facilities exceed the minimum requirements of the existing by-law.

8.0    CONCLUSIONS
       The proposed development will provide a total of 94 residential units and 863.5 m2 of retail
       /commercial space. The development will replace the site which is currently vacant. The
       development will be constructed with full build-out is expected to be complete in 2018.
       The existing traffic analysis indicates that signalized intersections in the study area generally
       operate at acceptable levels of service during the peak hours. The southbound movement at
       Avenue Road at Davenport Road operates with heavy congestion. The minor movements at
       unsignalized intersection of Avenue Road at Bernard Avenue experience some noticeable
       constraints during both peak hours.
       The future background traffic conditions in this study consider a five year horizon to 2018.
       The future background traffic volumes analyzed in this study incorporates the reassignment
       of illegal turn movement and background development site traffic.
       Under future background traffic conditions, the signalized and unsignalized intersections
       within the study area will continue to operate at similar levels of service compared to the
       existing traffic conditions.
       The proposed development is expected to generate a total of 23 and 27 two-way site trips
       during weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours, respectively. Under future total traffic
       conditions, the signalized intersections will operate at similar levels of service compared to
       the future background traffic conditions. The southbound and northbound movements at the
       Avenue Road/Davenport Road intersection is expected to receive an additional delay of at
       about 1 second from future background conditions.
       Since outbound site traffic uses a single shared left/right turn, the northbound vehicle queues
       will block outbound site traffic regardless if this access operates as a full movement or right-
       in/right-out only movements
       An inbound left vehicle is not expected to cause a major impact to southbound Avenue Road
       traffic. This movement will experience similar condition as with the southbound left turn at
       Davenport Road signalized intersection. Inbound left movement is made possible when
       northbound traffic discharges form the Davenport Road intersection or from using a courtesy
       gap.
       The site trips generated by the proposed development are not expected to result in any
       adverse impacts to the traffic operations in the study area.
       The proposed development is required to provide a minimum of 70 parking spaces (64
       residential and 6 visitor) when applying the City of Toronto minimum parking requirements for
       the Downtown Area. A supply of 67 spaces is proposed of which 6 spaces are reserved for
       visitor parking use.
       One (1) Type `G/B' loading space is required for the proposed development when applying
       the City of Toronto By-law requirements 359-2013. If the requirements are under the new
       City parking and loading requirements, one (1) Type `G/C' loading space is required. The
       proposed loading is for one (1) Type `G' space which exceeds the minimum requirements of
       the existing by-law.

Probably, but I would have to check with our Traffic Operations people first. Please note that comments on any
conveyance requirements will be provided once I hear from our Survey and Mapping people.

Thank Luigi.  I would assume if a RIRO restriction is required, it would be a peak hour condition?

Hi Ken.

Given the proposed development scale, your scope of work is generally acceptable.

The development will likely not generate a significant amount of trips. Nonetheless, given its location, please provide a
discussion in your report which speaks to site traffic infiltration into the nearby residential areas.

Please note that the lengthy northbound queues are often formed at the Avenue Road/Davenport intersection,
particularly during the PM Peak Hour. As a result, we may limit the operation of the proposed site access driveway to
right-in/right-out movements only.

Eddy do you have any issues/comments?

Hi Luigi, 

The site is located at 143 Avenue Road, just south of Davenport Road.  The proposal is for 76 units with 62 parking 
spaces. 

The proposed driveway access will be opposite from  Bernard Ave.  I'm proposing a study area of Avenue 
Road/Davenport Road and Avenue Road/Bernard/Proposed Driveway. 

Just south of the subject site, there's a pedestrian access to the residential development to the east. 

 

Let me know your thoughts. 

 

Thanks, 

 
Ken

Re:      Memorandum for the proposed The Village at Redwine
         Trip Generation Comparison and Turn Lane Determination
         City of East Point, Georgia


Dear Michael:

Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. is pleased to provide this memorandum
comparing the trip generation of the new proposed site plan for The Village at
Redwine. The approximate 16-acre development is located along the north side of
Redwine Road directly across from North Commerce Drive in the City of East
Point, Georgia. Proposed access to the development will occur by constructing the
4th leg (north leg) of the Redwine Road/North Commerce Drive intersection. This
site was reviewed by GRTA in 2008, named Village at Redwine DRI #1627
(approved in April 2008). The purpose of this memorandum is to demonstrate that
the current proposed site plan is projected to generate less traffic than the original
DRI density from 2008 and to determine whether or not additional left-turn or right-
turn lanes are warranted along Redwine Road at the proposed site driveway.


                   SITE OVERVIEW AND PROJECT TRAFFIC

A summary of the original DRI densities and the currently-proposed densities for
the overall project are provided in Table 1 below. Please note that the industry
standard for conducting trip generation analyses has been updated since the original
DRI approval in 2008 with the release of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition, 2012. For accurate comparison, the original DRI densities have been
reevaluated using equations from the new 9th Edition of the manual (previously
calculated using the 7th Edition), which includes revised equations based on more
recently-observed trip generation data. The land use for this development was
assumed to be ITE Code 220 ­ Apartments.

 Site Plan


   For the 9th edition comparison shown in Table 1, the proposed density changes
   (2014 site plan) will result in approximately 22% and 20% fewer vehicular trips
   expected during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively, when compared to the
   expected number of trips from the original DRI density in 2008, as well as
   approximately 21% fewer daily trips.

   Based upon traffic counts performed on January 8, 2014 at the proposed site
   driveway (Redwine Road @ North Commerce Drive) and at near-by intersections
   (Crestridge Drive @ Redwine Road and Creekside Grand @ Redwine Road), the
   distribution of traffic entering and exiting the proposed site was estimated. The PM
   peak hour was determined to be the most critical hour due to the fact that it has the
   highest entering volume for any one-hour interval into the proposed site. The
   distribution of traffic for the PM peak hour was estimated to be 30% entering the
   site from the east (right-turn into site), 20% entering the site from the west (left-turn
   into site), and 50% entering the site from the south (through movement into the
   site).

   Furthermore, intersection level-of-service analyses were performed at the
   intersection of Redwine Road and North Commerce Drive for the 2014 Existing
   AM peak hour and PM peak hour scenarios. The unsignalized T-intersection
   currently operates as an All-Way Stop controlled intersection. It was found that the
   intersection currently experiences an intersection delay of 9.4 s/veh (LOS A) during
   the AM peak hour and 22.6 s/veh (LOS C) during the PM peak hour. Both of
   which are acceptable levels-of-service.

                          DRIVEWAY TURN-LANE REQUIREMENTS

   Fulton County's Driveway Manual was used to determine if turn lanes are needed
   for the proposed site driveway based on the traffic volumes expected to be generated
   by the proposed development as depicted in Table 1.

   In order to evaluate if turn lanes are recommended, the Average Daily Traffic
   (ADT) along Redwine Road is needed. AM and PM peak hour traffic data collected
   on January 8, 2014 was used to determine the ADT. The ADT along Redwine Road
   (including the expected traffic to be generated by the proposed development) in the
   vicinity of the proposed driveway is approximately 7,800 vehicles per day. As
   stated earlier, the site is anticipated to consist of 258 apartment units. This equates
   to 844 trips exiting the site and 844 trips entering the site throughout a 24-hour day.

   The speed along Redwine Road in the vicinity of the proposed driveway is 35 mph.

   Right-Turn Deceleration Lane Requirement
   Fulton County states that a right-turn deceleration lane must be constructed if the
   daily site generated right-turn volumes (RTV) meet or exceed the values shown in
   Table 2. Applying the assumption that 30 percent of users will access the proposed
   site from the east along Redwine Road to the gross trip generation listed in Table 1,
   approximately 253 vehicles are expected to turn right into the proposed driveway
   during a 24-hour day.

                                             Table 2
                             Minimum Volumes Requiring Right-Turn Lanes

Posted Speed Limit                            35-40 MPH             > 40 MPH             35-40 MPH    > 40 MPH

Peak Hour Right Turning Volume                     15                    7                    15          7


   The threshold is 150 daily RTVs for a 2-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of
   35 mph. Additionally, the threshold for 15 peak hour RTVs is met. Based on Table
   2, a westbound right-turn lane from Redwine Road into the proposed driveway is
   warranted.

   Left-Turn Lane Requirement
   Fulton County states that a left-turn lane must be constructed if the daily site
   generated left-turn volumes (LTV) meet or exceed the values shown in Table 3.
   Applying the assumption that 20 percent of users will access the proposed site from
   the west along Redwine Road to the gross trip generation listed in Table 1,
   approximately 169 vehicles are expected to turn left into the proposed driveway
   during a 24-hour day.

   The threshold is 300 daily LTVs for a 2-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of
   35 mph. Additionally, the threshold for 30 peak hour LTVs is not met. Based on
   Table 3, an eastbound left-turn lane from Redwine Road into the proposed driveway
   is not warranted.


                          CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   It was found that the changes in land use densities for the currently-proposed site
   plan (258 apartments) will result in a reduction in projected trips generated by the
   project compared to the previously-approved DRI (2008). Per Fulton County
   Regulations, however, a westbound right-turn lane may be required along Redwine
   Road to serve the vehicles entering the proposed site. Also, the minimum right-turn
   deceleration lane lengths are 100 feet of full-width storage with a 50-foot taper, for
   a 35 mph roadway. With the installation of this right-turn lane at the proposed site
   driveway, it is recommended that adequate sight distance be provided. The level-of-
   service at this intersection currently operates at an acceptable level of LOS A and
   LOS C during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.


   I hope this information is helpful. Please contact me if you have any questions.

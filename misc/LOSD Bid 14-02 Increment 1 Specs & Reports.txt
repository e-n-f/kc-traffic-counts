         direction of flow.

   B.    Each pipe shall be laid true to line and grade and in such a manner as to form a close,
         concentric joint with the adjoining pipe and to prevent sudden offsets in the flow line.

   C.    As the work progresses, the interior of the sewer shall be cleaned of all dirt and debris.

   D.    Pipe shall not be laid when the condition of the trench or the weather is unsuitable.

   E.    When Work is not in progress, open ends of pipe and fittings shall be plugged.

3.06     SEWER LATERALS

   A.    Sewer laterals shall be installed in accordance with the Standard Details. All taps into existing
         sewer mains shall be made by machine taps ("Tap Tite"), or, for VCP only, utilize Mission Clay
         insertion wye with Band-Seal fittings. Stamp or grind an "S" on the curb face where a sewer
         lateral crosses under the curb if no "S" currently exists.

3.07     TESTING

   A.    Exfiltration/Infiltration Testing
         1.      Sewer pipe joints and manholes shall be so watertight that leaking into the sewer by
                 groundwater infiltration shall not exceed 0.039 gallons per minute, per inch diameter,
                 per one thousand feet (1,000') of main line sewer and sewer laterals being tested.
         2.      The measure of the infiltration shall be defined as the exfiltration out of the pipeline
                 when the lower end is plugged at the manhole and the upper end is filled at a manhole
                 so as to create a hydrostatic head in the line of a minimum four feet (4') and a maximum
                 five feet (5') above the invert at the upper end of the line. If groundwater is
                 encountered, the head above the invert of the pipe at the upper end of the line shall be
                 increased so that the net hydrostatic head shall be a minimum of four feet (4') and a
                 maximum of five feet (5').
         3.      The amount of exfiltration in one (1) hour measured through a water meter or other
                 convenient device by bringing the water level back up to the starting level at the upper
                 manhole shall determine the rate of exfiltration. The Contractor shall furnish and install
                 the necessary and required plugs for the tests. The length of the laterals entering the
                 section of main line being tested shall be included.

   B.    Air Testing
         1.     Air testing of sewer mains may be allowed in lieu of exfiltration/infiltration testing.
         2.     Air testing of vitrified clay pipe shall be in accordance with ASTM C-828, "Standard Test
                Methods for Low-Pressure Air Test of Vitrified Clay Pipe Lines."
         3.     Air testing of PVC pipe shall be in accordance with the requirements specified in the
                most current Uni-B-6 pamphlet, "Recommended Practice for Low-Pressure Air Testing of
                Installed Sewer Pipe" issued by the Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association or as per the pipe
                manufacturer's specifications.

3.08     ACCEPTANCE

   A.    During the testing and flushing operation, a wire screen with a one-quarter of an inch (1/4")
         mesh or smaller shall be placed over the downstream outlet of the lower manhole to prevent
         any debris from being washed into the existing sewer system.

   B.    In no case shall the Contractor place the newly constructed sewer in operation without the
         approval of the County Inspector.

   C.    In the event that infiltration or leakage exceeds the limits indicated above, the Contractor
         shall, at his own expense, immediately proceed to make necessary repairs, and no further
         payment shall be allowed, nor shall the project be finally accepted, until the tests indicate that
         the entire project meets the above requirements.

   D.    The Contractor shall furnish the necessary pumps, water, labor, equipment and materials and
         shall assist the Inspector in making tests of the completed sewerage project before the system
         is placed in operation or connected to other lines.

   E.     The Inspector shall designate the length or section of the sewer to be tested and may approve
         some portions or the entire project without testing.

3.09     FLUSHING AND CLEANING SEWER LINES

   A.    After all backfilling and pavement restoring operations have been completed, the Contractor
         shall flush and clean all sanitary sewer lines in the following manner, under the supervision of
         the Engineer or Inspector:
         1.      Heavy rubber ball, such as a "MacWane Ball," manufactured by Sidu Company, Long
                 Beach, California, or approved equal, inflated with air, and having an outside diameter
                 equal to the interior diameter of the pipe to be cleaned, shall be furnished by the
                 Contractor.
         2.      The ball shall be inflated so that it will fit snugly into the sewer line.
         3.      3. The ball shall be placed in the last (upper) manhole on the line and water introduced
                 into the manhole back of the ball.
         4.      The ball shall pass through the pipe with only the pressure of the water behind it.
         5.      The rate at which the ball is allowed to pass through the pipe shall be controlled by a
                 rope at all times.
         6.      Debris flushed ahead with the ball shall be removed at the lower manhole where its
                 presence is evident.
         7.      This cleaning shall be conducted on each section of pipe installed.
         8.      Care shall be exercised not to feed the ball too rapidly in order that all debris can be
                 removed at each manhole.
         9.      During the flushing and cleaning operation, a wire screen with a one-quarter of an inch
                 (1/4") mesh or smaller shall be placed over the downstream outlet of the lower
                 manhole to prevent any debris from being washed into the existing sewer system.

3.10     TELEVISION INSPECTION

   A.    After completion of the pipe installation, service connections, flushing and cleaning, the sewer
         line shall be televised with a color closed-circuit television with tilt-head camera recorded in
         VHS format.

   B.    The original videotape and log sheets shall be provided to the District Engineer.

             surface matches that of adjacent surface.
            McNICHOLS ECO-MESH®
                     Plant Screen Specifications

 F.    Form exposed connections with hairline joints, flush and smooth, using
       concealed fasteners where possible. Where exposed fasteners are required, use
       Phillips flat-head (countersunk) screws or bolts, unless otherwise indicated.
       Locate joints where least conspicuous.

 G.    Fabricate seams and other connections that will be exposed to weather in a
       manner to exclude water. Provide weep holes at 12" o.c. where water may
       accumulate.

 H.    Cut, reinforce, drill, and tap metal fabrications as indicated to receive finish
       hardware, screws, and similar items.

 I.    Provide for anchorage of type indicated; coordinate with supporting structure.
       Space anchoring devices to secure metal fabrications rigidly in place and to
       support indicated loads.

       1.     Where units are indicated to be cast into concrete or built into masonry,
              equip with integrally welded steel strap anchors, 1/8" by 1-1/2", with

      because of shipping size limitations. Do not weld, cut, or abrade surfaces of
      exterior units that have been hot-dip galvanized after fabrication and are for
      bolted or screwed field connections. At areas of removed finished, provide
      touch-up finish to match existing.

      3.     Remove welding flux immediately.

      4.     At exposed connections, finish exposed welds and surfaces smooth and
             blended, so no roughness shows after finishing and contour of welded
             surface matches that of adjacent surface.

 E.   Fastening to In-Place Construction: Provide anchorage devices and fasteners
      where metal fabrications are required to be fastened to in-place construction.

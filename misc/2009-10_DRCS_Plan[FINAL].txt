I.   Introduction

North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT)
project R-4708 calls for the widening of Dow Road from US
421 (Lake Park Boulevard) in Carolina Beach to US 421 (Fort
Fisher Boulevard) in Kure Beach. The purpose of this project
is to provide improved north-south access in both Carolina
Beach and Kure Beach by widening Dow Road from US 421
to K Avenue and extend Dow Road from K Avenue to US
421 in Kure Beach, a total of 5.3 miles. The widening and
extension are expected to reduce traffic congestion on US 421
and to provide improved pedestrian and bicycle facilities in
and around Carolina and Kure Beaches

In 2002 NCDOT completed a feasibility study that analyzed
several different cross-sections for the existing Dow Road
and proposed extension. This study recommended a four-
lane divided facility for the section between US 421 and K
Avenue and for a two-lane shoulder section for the proposed
extension between K Avenue and US 421.

In April 2008, Wilbur Smith Associates (WSA) was tasked by the Wilmington Metropolitan
Planning Organization (WMPO) to perform a corridor study for Dow Road from its northern
terminus at US 421 (Lake Park Boulevard) to K Avenue in Kure Beach and to determine the
feasibility and impacts of extending Dow Road from K Avenue south to Fort Fisher. The study,
as originally planned, involved close coordination with local municipalities and stakeholders,
extensive public involvement, a preliminary environmental screening of the study area, traffic
forecasts to determine future traffic volumes, and capacity analysis to determine future
roadway design characteristics.

WSA began the process by performing a preliminary environmental screening, and developing
several concepts for the extension of Dow Road. WSA met with representatives from Marine
Ocean Terminal Sunny Point (MOTSU), the United States Air Force, and the North Carolina
State Parks, the Towns of Carolina Beach and Kure Beach, and the North Carolina Department
of Transportation, and members of the public.

Through this analysis and meetings it became readily apparent that the proposed extension of
Dow Road faced many issues with gaining access to right-of-way from Sunny Point and the US
Air Force, and would be unlikely to receive the necessary permits due to significant
environmental impacts to both wetlands and endangered species and some impacts to
archeological sites. In addition, the Kure Beach's Town Council felt that the Dow Road
Extension would divert traffic around their community and could potentially lead to a decline
in visitor traffic. Comment letters from the US Air Force, Kure Beach Town Council, NC
Division of Water Quality, NC Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, NC
Department of Cultural Resources, and the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, as well as
comments from the public at June 2008 public meeting can be found in Appendix A.
                                                                                         Dow Road
                                                                               FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                            Page 2

Due to the Dow Road extension falling within an environmentally sensitive area and the lack of
support from multiple stakeholders, the WMPO passed a resolution on August 27, 2008
eliminating the extension of Dow Road from K Avenue to US 421 from further study. Based on
this resolution, the scope of this project was amended to focus solely on the forecasts of future
volumes along Dow Road from US 421 to K Avenue, and along K Avenue from Dow Road to
US 421 and the multi-modal transportation facilities needed to support these projected future
volumes and to improve safety along the corridor.

The purpose of this report is to present the environmental analysis performed for the extension
of Dow Road from K Avenue to US 421, to briefly discuss the public involvement portions of
this project, to examine 2008 existing conditions, 2030 "No Build" conditions without the Dow
Road traffic diversion, and 2030 "Build" conditions with the Dow Road traffic diversion, and to
recommend multi-modal transportation facilities needed to support these projected future
volumes and to improve safety along the corridor.

                                                                           FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                        Page 3

B.     Existing Conditions

The following section briefly describes the roadways in the study area.

Dow Road (SR 1573) is a two-lane, 24 foot wide shoulder section roadway. Dow Road serves
as an alternative route around downtown Carolina Beach with a connection from Snow's Cut
Bridge south to K Avenue and has a speed limit of 55 and 45 mph. The 2007 Annual Average
Daily Traffic (AADT) as counted by NCDOT
was 8,400 Vehicles per Day (vpd) just west of
the Lake Park Boulevard intersection and
2,700 vpd south of Ocean Boulevard. The
2008 Average Daily Traffic (ADT) as counted
by the WMPO was 8,473 vpd just west of the
Lake Park Boulevard intersection and 2,733
vpd south of Ocean Boulevard. Dow Road is
currently primarily used as a connector street
for residential subdivisions to the east as well
as an alternative route to get to Kure Beach
from north Carolina Beach. In addition, a 10
foot multi-use path currently exists along Old
Dow Road from Harper Avenue to the
northernmost end of Bridge Barrier Road and
crosses Dow Road just south of Harper
Avenue.                                                     Dow Road looking south


Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) is a four-lane roadway from Snow's Cut bridge to Carl Winner
Avenue in Carolina Beach where it changes to a two-lane roadway and continues south to Fort
Fisher. Lake Park Boulevard is a curb and gutter section roadway within Carolina Beach and
Kure Beach and provides a direct north ­ south connection between the Town of Fort Fisher and
Wilmington. US 421 travels from Bristol,
Tennessee and terminates at the Atlantic
Ocean / Cape Fear River and has a
varying speed limit of 25, 35, and 45 mph.
The 2007 AADT as counted by NCDOT
was 18,000 vpd and 12,000 vpd north and
south of the US 421 / Carl Winner
Avenue intersection, respectively. By
comparison, the 2008 AADT as counted
by the WMPO was 17,403 vpd and 15,281
vpd north and south of the US 421 / Carl
Winner Avenue intersection, respectively.
Lake Park Boulevard attracts on-street
parking, pedestrians and bicycles and
currently serves as a multimodal corridor
through the Town of Carolina Beach's
Central Business District and Kure Beach.

Carl Winner Avenue is a three-lane, 30
foot wide curb and gutter section
roadway located west of the proposed
development. Carl Winner Avenue
runs east to west from Canal Drive to
Lake Park Boulevard. Carl Winner
Drive was recently realigned by the
Town of Carolina Beach to provide a
larger pedestrian area on the north side
to accommodate the large numbers of
persons that may be waiting to board
cruise boats. In addition, Carl Winner
Drive serves several surface parking
lots and is the first access that serves
the northern peninsula. The posted
speed limit is 25 mph.
                                                   Carl Winner Ave looking west

Harper Avenue is a two-lane, 25 foot wide
roadway east of Lake Park Boulevard and a
two-lane median divided roadway west of
US 421. Harper Avenue provides an east to
west connection between Lake Park
Boulevard and Canal Drive and Carolina
Beach Avenue to the east and Dow Road to
the west. The posted speed limit is 25 mph.

                                                                                FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                             Page 6

Atlanta Avenue is a two-lane, 20 foot wide shoulder section roadway that serves primarily
residential uses. Atlanta Avenue runs east to west from Carolina Beach Avenue South to Dow
Road. The posted speed limit is 25 mph.

Ocean Boulevard (SR 1539) is a two-lane, 20 foot wide shoulder section roadway that serves
primarily residential uses. Ocean Boulevard runs east to west from Dow Road to Lake Park
Boulevard. The 2008 AADT as counted by the WMPO was 1,900 vpd east of Dow Road and
1,120 vpd west of US 421. The posted speed limit is 25 mph through the residential areas and 35
mph through the buffer zone.

K Avenue is a two-lane, 24 foot wide
shoulder section roadway that serves
primarily commercial and residential uses.
K Avenue runs east to west from Dow
Road to Lake Park Boulevard in Kure
Beach. The 2008 AADT as counted by the
WMPO on K Avenue was 3,160 vpd west of
US 421. The posted speed limit is 35 mph.




                                                               K Avenue looking west

Existing Lane Configurations and Traffic Control are illustrated on Figure 2.

C.     Projected Roadway Improvements

Currently, there are no known significant NCDOT transportation improvement projects in the
vicinity of the proposed development which are programmed to be constructed before the 2030
design year.

The Town of Carolina Beach is proposing roadway improvements along Lake Park Boulevard
as a part of their Streetscape Plan. Lake Park Boulevard is proposed to be reduced to a two-lane
roadway (commonly referred to as a "Road Diet") from Carl Winner Avenue to Atlanta
Avenue. This project will also include provisions for on-street vehicle parking with a center
median or possibly a center two-way, left turn lane. The streetscape project has no schedule for
completion at this time, but for the purposes of this study, this project is planned to be
completed by the 2030 design year.

In addition, the Town of Carolina Beach will be improving the east leg of the intersection of
Lake Park Boulevard and Carl Winner Avenue to include a shared left/right lane and an
exclusive right turn lane. These improvements are assumed to be completed by the 2030 design
year.

                                                                           FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                        Page 8

III.   Public Involvement

On June 30, 2008, WSA held a public
meeting at the Carolina Beach Elementary
School to discuss the scope of the corridor
study for Dow Road and gather public
input. At the time, the study was scoped to
include the analysis of widening and
extending Dow Road from K Avenue to
Fort Fisher. For display purposes, display
boards     of    environmental      features
(wetlands, etc), property owners (Sunny
Point, US Air Force, etc.), and a draft
representation     of     several   possible
alignments for the extension of Dow Road
were used when discussing the corridor
study.

In general, the Town of Kure Beach and their
residents were against the extension of Dow                     Public Meeting #1
Road due to the impacts to the environment and changing the corridor from a lightly used
minor thoroughfare to a heavily traveled, major thoroughfare highway. In contrast, some
residents of Carolina Beach were in support of the proposed extension of Dow Road. There was
however support from most attendees for improvements along Dow Road such as pedestrian
and bicycle provisions and straightening out the Dow Road / K Avenue curve. A comment
summary report from the public meeting is contained in Appendix A.

On September 28, 2009, WSA held a final public meeting at the Carolina Beach Town Hall to
discuss the findings of the revised Dow Road Corridor Study. In general, the public showed
                                                  much greater support for the revised
                                                  study     and    its    recommendations.
                                                  Residents showed interest and gave
                                                  positive feedback on the pedestrian and
                                                  bicycle improvements along Dow Road as
                                                  well as the proposed improvements to the
                                                  Dow Road / K Avenue curve. A
                                                  comment summary report from the
                                                  public meeting is contained in Appendix
                                                  A.

IV.    Environmental Analysis
When this study began, WSA started work on the environmental analysis for the Dow Road
Extension but due to the number of impacts, both environmental and community, the WMPO
directed WSA to stop work on the corridor study for the extension of Dow Road and look at
only what improvements can be accomplished within the existing alignment. The following
environmental analysis details only the areas which WSA studied for the Dow Road extension.

In an effort to identify potential environmental constraints to the proposed action of extending
and widening Dow Road from K Avenue south to Fort Fisher, WSA performed a preliminary
environmental screening. The purpose of the screening is to identify known and documented
environmental concerns within the Dow Road corridor that could be "project stopping."
Existing Geographic Information System (GIS) data from various local, state and federal
sources, augmented with limited field reconnaissance, was used to perform this preliminary
analysis. The pertinent environmental features, discussed below, are shown on Figure 3.

Wetlands & Surface Waters
The presence of wetlands in the Dow Road corridor was determined through a review of the
National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) mapping of the area coupled with direct field observation
by staff trained and experienced with the methods outlined in the United States Army Corps of
Engineers 1987 Wetland Delineation Manual. These wetlands areas, relatively permanent
waters (RPW) and the Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) buffers associated with them
should be considered when evaluating alternatives and the selection of the preferred
alternative. A key factor in the selection of a preferred alternative for the extension would have
been the avoidance and minimization of potential impacts to wetlands.

The NWI mapping indicates the presence of wetlands in the Dow Road corridor which is to be
expected in coastal area. Any temporary or permanent impacts, whether they are clear cutting,
filling, or draining, to either of the aforementioned wetland features would need to go through
the Section 404 and 401 permitting process. In the case of this project impacts would most likely
be permitted under a Nationwide 14 permit with the USACE in addition to requiring a 401
Water Quality Certification from the DWQ. Mitigation for these impacts would likely be
required.

The inventory of surface water features indicates that a creek traverses the potential alternatives
corridor. Any temporary or permanent impacts or crossing of the creek would have require a
Section 404/401 permit(s).

Contaminated Properties
A database report was obtained from Environmental Data Resources, Inc. which details all past
and present reported hazardous substance storage, release, generation, or transport in that has
occurred or is occurring in the Dow Road corridor. Based on the EDR report, field
reconnaissance, and Hazard Substance Disposal Site mapping developed by The North
Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources, Division of Waste
Management,       Superfund      Section    and      obtained      from       NC      OneMap
(http://www.nconemap.com) "areas of concern" were identified as having reported past
contamination or of having hazardous substance disposed on the site in the past.

The widening and extending of Dow Road has a strong
potential    to    encounter    hazardous     materials,
considering the past land uses that have taken place,
mainly in the southern portion of the project area, and
some of the present land use occurring along existing
Dow Road. Special consideration of the widening of
Dow Road in the areas of the water treatment plant and
landfill, as well as the Dow Bromine Chemical plant,
which is on the Environmental Protection Agency's
Superfund list, will need to be taken. Additionally, the
extension and the majority of the widening of Dow
Road will go through the Military Ocean Terminal
Sunny Point (MOTSU) buffer. The location of
Underground Storage Tanks (UST) containing diesel or

Appendix A for the executive summary to the EDR
report which details the known UST locations. UST removal will add to project costs and the
risk of remediation for a UST that has leaked exists. Further searches of all pertinent local, state,
and federal databases in order to identify any potential hazardous materials in the study area
will be needed. In addition, WSA staff performed limited field reconnaissance in an attempt to
verify database information and to identify any hazardous materials not uncovered during the
database search. The areas of concern indentified do pose a constraint to this project and should
be taken into consideration during alternative development.

Threatened or Endangered Species
According to information obtained from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which
organizes the information by county, New Hanover County is currently home to at least one
federally protected species, the loggerhead sea turtle. Federally Listed Threatened and
Endangered Species and their habitat are protected under federal law.

Natural Heritage Sites
The North Carolina Natural Heritage Program indicates that there are records of known rare
species, high quality natural communities, and significant natural areas occurring in the project
area. These include the phaeon crescent butterfly, coastal fringe evergreen forest, interdune
pond, coastal fringe sandhill, pond pine woodland, wet pine flats, and pine savanna. When
further evaluating project alternatives, coordination with the North Carolina Natural Heritage
program, the project steering committee, and the public are required to ensure that these
resources are considered and practical steps are taken to preserve these areas.

Soils
Digital soils mapping from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was obtained
and reviewed for the presence of hydric soils which are a good indicator for the presence of
likelihood of wetlands. Wetland features were identified in the corridor as hydric soils.

Cultural and Historic Resources
Potential impacts to Fort Fisher, which is a national historic landmark have to be taken into
consideration in any evaluation of alternatives for the extension of Dow Road portion of the
                                                                                            Dow Road

project. Additionally, due to the rich military history of the area potential significant
archaeological remains may be present in the areas considered for right-of-way acquisition.

Land Use
Land use considerations included the effects that the widening and extending of Dow Road will
have on the existing land use in the project area as well as how it may influence future land use
and development patterns. Since the majority of the project actions will occur in the MOTSU
buffer which is considered federal conservation lands and where future development is not
likely, the indirect effect of the project on land use should be closely evaluated.

Other
Other concerns that will need to be considered in the
evaluation of alternatives are Department of Defense
owned properties and the Carolina Beach and Fort Fisher
State Parks. DOD properties in the project area include
MOTSU buffer zone and the Air Force's Fort Fisher
Recreation Area. There are foreseeable difficulties in
eventually obtaining the needed right-of-way from the
DOD which will be considered. State park and recreation
lands carry special federal protection and converting
portions of these lands to roadway will require special
consideration and evaluations. Additionally, obtaining
right-of-way from the DOD may be difficult. The Military
Ocean Terminal Sunny Point will have safety and
security concerns that need to be addressed as well as
environmental concerns. The DOD is required to
consider all natural and human environment issues when
evaluating land transfers and agreements. The Fort
Fisher Air Force Recreation Area is a resort vacation spot
which is only open to DOD personnel, both military and
civilian. The evaluation of alternatives for the extension  Depiction of some of the important land owners in

unique design considerations that are sensitive to the
context of this site were looked at. Any extension to Dow Road will bisect this property with
anywhere from a 125'-150' right-of-way, which is not compatible with its existing land use. The
extension or widening of Dow Road requires close coordination with the Air Force, MOTSU,
and the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation.

Conclusion
Because of the wide range of environmental issues, along with the public objections from Kure
Beach residents and public officials to the project, involved with the extension of Dow Road,
WSA recommends that the corridor remain on its existing alignment and that the Dow Road
Extension should not be constructed. The rest of the report will detail the findings of the traffic
analysis for the existing alignment and the possible need for the widening of Dow Road from
Lake Park Boulevard to K Avenue. Impacts from any of the proposed improvements to the
existing alignment of Dow Road may require further study to reduce disturbance to the local
ecosystem, however any impacts should be minimal as any improvements are extremely likely
to be contained within the existing right-of-way.

V.       Projected Traffic Volumes
A.       Existing Traffic

Morning (7-9 am) and afternoon (4-6 pm) peak hour traffic counts were taken by WSA at the
following locations:

     ¾ Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / Federal Point Shopping Center (7/22/2008)

Morning (7-9 am) and afternoon (4-6 pm) peak hour traffic counts were taken by the WMPO at
the following locations:

     ¾   Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / Dow Road (4/29/2008)
     ¾   Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / Carl Winner Avenue (4/29/2008)
     ¾   Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / Harper Avenue (4/30/2008)
     ¾   Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / Cape Fear Boulevard (4/30/2008)
     ¾   Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / Atlanta Avenue (4/30/2008)
     ¾   Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / Ocean Boulevard (5/6/2008)
     ¾   Lake Park Boulevard (US 421) / K Avenue (5/6/2008)
     ¾   Dow Road / Harper Avenue (5/1/2008)
     ¾   Dow Road / Atlanta Avenue (5/1/2008)
     ¾   Dow Road / Ocean Boulevard (5/6/2008)

These traffic volumes are shown on Figure 1A in Appendix B.

Recognizing that traffic volumes collected during April and May 2008 will be lower than the
volumes typically seen during peak summer conditions; WSA multiplied the counts taken in
2008 by an adjustment factor. This factor was determined using 2004 and 2005 traffic data
supplied by NCDOT from an automatic traffic recorder (ATR) site located near Carolina Beach
just south of Wilmington.

Based on the ATR data, the WMPO traffic counts collected in April and May were multiplied by
1.25 to more accurately predict typical peak hour traffic experienced between June and August.
These seasonally adjusted traffic volumes are shown on Figure 4 with the 2008 WMPO ADT
traffic counts. Raw count data for these locations are included in Appendix B.

B.       Future Background Traffic Volumes

Based on historical AADT provided by NCDOT, ADT provided by WMPO, and projected
residential and retail development in Carolina Beach and Kure Beach, a 1.5% growth rate
percentage was applied to determine the projected 2030 "No Build" traffic volumes without the
Dow Road traffic diversion. Because of the nature of the surrounding land uses and the Sunny
Point Blast Zone along Dow Road, a 1.5% growth rate was determined to be a conservative
growth factor based on the lack of potential for any large future developments. Any future
growth in traffic will likely be due to pockets of redevelopment expected to occur within
downtown Carolina Beach or the gradual increase in visitor traffic going to the beach or Fort
Fisher. Projected 2030 No Build peak hour and ADT traffic volumes along Lake Park Boulevard
and Dow Road are illustrated on Figure 5.
                                                                                          Dow Road
                                                                                FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                            Page 16

C.     Future Traffic Volumes with Dow Road Diversion

In order to develop the 2030 Build alternative traffic volumes, a percentage of vehicles assumed
to divert from Lake Park Boulevard onto Dow Road was chosen. First, the amount of traffic that
uses Dow Road as an alternative route around Lake Park Boulevard had to be determined. This
was accomplished by examining the through traffic along Dow Road at the intersection of Dow
Road and Ocean Boulevard. This through traffic represents the individuals that are traveling
along Dow Road purely to bypass Carolina Beach and northern Kure Beach. In 2008 there were
257 and 340 vehicles during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively, that were assumed to be
using Dow Road to get from K Avenue to Lake Park Boulevard. At the intersection of Dow
Road and Lake Park Boulevard, there were 1,009 and 881 vehicles during the AM and PM peak
hours, respectively, on Dow Road. This shows that of the traffic that turns onto Dow Road from
Lake Park Boulevard, only approximately 30% of the traffic will continue south to Kure Beach.

An increase of 30% in the amount of diversion traffic was chosen to develop the 2030 Build
alternative peak hour traffic volumes. This percentage increase was selected based on the
current traffic patterns, the fact that only signage will be used to direct travelers along Dow
Road, the continued designation of Lake Park Boulevard as US 421, and the significant
attractions along Lake Park Boulevard between the intersection of Dow Road and K Avenue.
Therefore, the traffic that was estimated to use Dow Road as a "bypass" was increased by 30%
to assume the future "Build" traffic. The 30% was then subtracted from Lake Park Boulevard to
account for the shift of traffic onto Dow Road. Thus based on the 2008 WMPO ADT of 2,733 vpd
on Dow Road just south of Ocean Boulevard; approximately 820 additional vehicles are
expected to be diverted to Dow Road on a given weekday with installation of wayfinding
signage for bypassing traffic around Carolina Beach. This amounts to roughly 108 additional
vehicles on Dow Road in the AM peak hour and 144 additional vehicles in the PM peak hour.

The 2030 Build alternative peak hour and ADT traffic volumes with the Dow Road traffic
diversion are shown on Figure 6.

VI.   Traffic Analysis
The study area intersections were analyzed using the methods outlined in the Highway
Capacity Manual1, and Synchro Version 7.0. The Highway Capacity Manual1 defines capacity
as "the maximum rate of flow at which persons or vehicles can be reasonably expected to
traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a specified time period under
prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions, usually expressed as vehicles per hour or
persons per hour." Level of Service (LOS) is a term used to represent different traffic conditions,
and is defined as a "qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic
stream, and their perception by motorist / or passengers." Level of Service varies from Level A,
representing free flow, to Level F where traffic breakdown conditions are evident. Level B
represents good progression with minimal congestion. At Level C, the number of vehicles
stopping is significant, although many still pass through the intersection without stopping.
Level D represents more congestion, but the overall operations are acceptable. At Level E,
freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely difficult with driver frustration
being generally high.
                                                                                                             Dow Road
                                                                                                   FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                                               Page 18

Generally, Level of Service D is considered acceptable for signalized intersections in suburban
areas during peak periods. With the current method of reporting levels of service for
unsignalized intersections, it is not uncommon for some of the minor street movements to
operate at LOS F during the peak hours.

Overall, the proposed Dow Road traffic diversion plan can accommodate the projected future
traffic growth subject to the recommendations for turn lanes and other considerations described
in Section VI.

VII.   Recommendations

The results of this study indicate that there are no major existing traffic capacity concerns to
date at the analyzed intersections. This study shows that minor improvements should be
constructed to provide safe and efficient ingress and egress as well as to enhance vehicular,
bicycle, pedestrian and parking operations and public safety in the vicinity of the proposed
development. Because the projected 2030 ADT along Dow Road is expected to reach only 4,800
vpd just south of Ocean Boulevard and 12,600 vpd just south of Lake Park Boulevard, Dow
Road is recommended to remain a two-lane facility, the following improvements are
recommended to be implemented with the traffic diversion plan for Dow Road:

Dow Road / Harper Avenue
     ¾ Construct a southbound left turn lane on Dow Road with 100 feet of full width
        storage.

Dow Road /Cape Fear Boulevard
     ¾ Construct a southbound left turn lane on Dow Road with 100 feet of full width
        storage.

Dow Road / Ocean Boulevard
     ¾ Construct a southbound left turn lane on Dow Road with 100 feet of full width
        storage.

Lake Park Boulevard / Dow Road
      ¾ Provide wayfinding signs to direct southbound Kure Beach and Fort Fisher traffic
         from Lake Park Boulevard to Dow Road.

Lake Park Boulevard / K Avenue
      ¾ Provide wayfinding signs to direct northbound Wilmington traffic from Lake Park
         Boulevard to Dow Road.

                                                                               FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                           Page 23

Other Recommendations

Dow Road / K Avenue Curve

As currently designed, the Dow Road onto K
Avenue curve is approximately a 90 foot radius
curve with very little superelevation. While the
crash data from the past three (3) years shows that
there have been no reported vehicular crashes in
this vicinity, a closer site inspection suggests that
there may be a significant number of unreported
crashes due to the damaged roadway signs and
visible tire skid marks along Dow Road and K
Avenue.

As a part of the Dow Road traffic diversion plan,
WSA recommends that the Dow Road / K Avenue
curve be lengthened and super-elevated to allow
for safer vehicular and bicycle travel. At a minimum, WSA recommends that the curve radii be
increased from 90 feet to 250 feet. Based on AASHTO A Policy on Geometric Design of Highway
and Streets2, this would allow the signed 15 mph turning speed be increased to 25 mph. In
addition, the design should incorporate the addition of bike lanes as well as multi-use path. The
relocation of one (1) utility pole will likely be required with this improvement. Coordination
with Sunny Point Marine Ocean Terminal and NCDOT will be required to plan for and
construct this realignment. This proposed improvement is shown on Figure 8.

Bicycle Facilities

Bicycle lanes are proposed along both Dow Road
and K Avenue as a part of this plan. Bicycles are
an important element of multimodal, livable
streets. The proposed bike lanes provide
important linkages within Carolina Beach and
Kure Beach destinations, improved bicycling
environment and also acts as a buffer to
pedestrians. In addition, bike lanes allow space
for vehicles to temporarily store while emergency
vehicles pass, they add to turning radii, and they
improve sight distances.

Based on the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities3 and the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD4), WSA recommends the following be constructed and
incorporated into Carolina Beach's future pedestrian and bicycle plan:

    i Add an additional 5 feet of pavement for wide outside shoulders on both sides of Dow
      Road;
    i Bike lane pavement markings should be provided.
                                                                                         Dow Road
                                                                               FINAL Corridor Study
                                                                                           Page 24



Bike lanes should be striped, signed, and
marked in accordance with the MUTCD.
The MUTCD and the Institute of
Transportation Engineer's Traffic Control
Handbook recommend intersections with
bike lanes located the striped bike lanes to
the left side of right-turn only lanes.
Exhibit 1 shows this detail for bike lane
approaches to intersections.

Pedestrian Facilities

In an effort to reflect the recommendations from Carolina Beach's Master Development Plan,
WSA recommends that a 10 foot wide multi-use path be constructed along the west side of Dow
Road from the Carolina Beach State Park to approximately 1.0 mile south of Ocean Boulevard
then transition to the east side of Dow Road to K Avenue. The proposed bicycle lanes and 5 foot
grass buffer provide sufficient buffer distance for pedestrians utilizing the proposed path. Bike
lanes and multi-use paths will strengthen linkages and connect destinations within Carolina
Beach and Kure Beach.

Based on the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Pedestrian Facilities5 and the MUTCD, WSA
recommends the following considerations for bicycle facilities:

   i Construct a 10 foot wide multi-use path along the east side of Dow Road and K Avenue
     and connect with the existing multi-use path near the Carolina Beach State Park;
   i Provide crosswalks for the multi-use path at all the side street intersections along Dow
     Road;
   i Provide adequate pedestrian crosswalk signs to warn approaching vehicles;
   i Provide adequate pedestrian facilities to meet the requirements of the Americans with
     Disabilities Act (ADA);
   i Provide audible pedestrian crosswalk signals to accommodate visually impaired
     pedestrians;
   i Design and maintenance of landscaping to provide good visibility between pedestrians
     and approaching vehicles;

Boulevard corridors are illustrated on Figure 7. The conceptual design for the Dow Road / K
Avenue curve is shown on Figure 8 and the conceptual designs for the Dow Road / Harper
Avenue, Dow Road / Cape Fear Boulevard, and Dow Road / Ocean Boulevard left turn bays
are shown on Figures 9, 10, and 11. The recommended typical section for Dow Road is shown

VIII.    Conclusions
Based on the potential for significant environmental impacts and the lack of public support for a
new facility, WSA recommends that Dow Road not be extended from K Avenue to US 421. Due
to the lack of significant growth projected on the island, the traffic analysis indicates that the
Dow Road will function with a reasonable level of service as a two lane facility in 2030.
Improvements should be made to better accommodate cyclists and a multi-use path should be
added to better facilitate cyclists and pedestrians along this corridor. Finally the Dow Road / K
Avenue curve should be constructed to allow for safer travel through this intersection.

Introduction
The Wilmington Metropolitan Planning Organization (WMPO) held a Public Workshop for the
Dow Road Corridor Study on the following date:

Monday, June 30, 2008 ­ Carolina Beach Elementary School, Carolina Beach

The local public was notified of the workshop in advance in the following ways:

       x   Mailing of Newsletter via USPS standard mail (mailed to property owners and
           stakeholders) on June 12, 2008
       x   Newspaper advertisement in Island Gazette and Wilmington Morning Star on June
           25 and 29, 2008.
       x   Media press release submitted on June 26, 2008
       x   Email Notification to public officials and agencies.

The corridor study will analyze the widening of Dow Road from US 421 in Carolina Beach to
K Avenue in Kure Beach, as well as extending Dow Road from K Avenue to US 421 (Fort
Fisher Boulevard) on new location. Currently, Dow Road is a two-lane, undivided road that
extends through Carolina and Kure beaches to K Avenue and includes a multi-use path
along part of the road. The study will also consider extending this adjacent multi-use path.
The improved Dow Road will improve north-south access in both Carolina and Kure Beaches
and reduce congestion along US 421 (US 421 is designated a Hurricane Evacuation Route).
The area being studied is approximately 5.3 miles in length, bordered within the Military
Ocean Terminal, Sunny Point (MOTSU) Blast Buffer.

The purpose of the workshop was to review and discuss the widening and extension of Dow
Road, and to provide participants an opportunity to speak to WMPO and Consultant team
staff and make verbal and written comments.

As participants arrived, they were asked to sign in and provided a handout packet. Citizens
were provided a newsletter, project fact sheet and comment sheet regarding the Dow Road
Corridor Study. The Comment Sheet included three special topics of interest to write
comments, which included:

       x   Dow Road Route
       x   Neighborhood/Community Impacts
       x   Environmental or Other Issues

The format of the workshop provided citizens' an opportunity to learn about the project,
understand the social, environmental and economic character of the area, ask questions and
offer input to MPO staff and consultant team members. Maps, displays and other project
information were available for viewing to provide participants a good understanding of the
project.

Mr. Mike Kozlosky, WMPO Project Manager, Mr. Sun Temple Helgren, Consultant Team
Project Manager, other WMPO staff and consultant team members were available at the
workshop to answer questions.

A total of 97 people signed in at the workshop. Additionally, a total of 69 comment sheets
were completed at the meeting and/or received by mail or via email. A summary of all
written comments is presented below.

Summary of Comments

JUNE 30, 2008 ­ CAROLINA BEACH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CAROLINA
BEACH



Dow Road Route

FAVOR
  x Support expansion ­ include shoulders for bicycles and dedicated turn lanes.
  x Support widening of Dow Road in the least invasive way; keep it two lanes but add
     bike lane and wider shoulders.
  x Extension should utilize as much of Kure Beach town-owned property as possible;
     does not need to extend to Ft. Fisher.
  x Growth brings tax revenue and community project money (such as beach
     replenishment); new routes for access are needed.            ADVANCED planning is
     necessary. (3 comments received)
         o Homeowners along S. Ft. Fisher Blvd. would appreciate a bypass via Dow
            extender. Extender would decrease `thru traffic' in front yards.
         o Downtown, if cleaned up/spruced up, will be visited even with bypass in
            place.
  x Strongly support the extension of Dow Road so that we can reclaim the peaceful
     pace of a pedestrian, bike-friendly town and community. Seize the moment and
     secure our tranquil future values. (7 comments received)
         o Lower speed limit along Fort Fisher to 25MPH while lowering traffic volume.
         o If Davis Road folks are against it, consider extending to President Davis Road,
            as there are no houses directly on the road.
  x Support improvement through K Avenue ­ beyond that is a waste of money (few
     people live beyond this point). (5 comments received)
  x Three-lane road, bike path, and walking trail ­ YES. EXTENSION ­ NO.
         o Support improvements (shoulders, etc.) to existing Dow Road to K Avenue.
         o Support bike path (multi-use) along existing footprint of Dow Road/right of
            way.
  x Widen Dow Road to at least three lanes; straighten sharp curve just before Kure
     Beach; add bike route along Dow Road; extend Dow Road to Ft. Fisher Blvd. near the
     Fort.

OPPOSED
  x Road is dangerous and locals feel they will lose business with the change. (3
     comments received)
  x Currently an accident waiting to happen due to deer and fox population and
     speeding; making it four lanes, any longer would be a death trap! (3 comments
     received)
  x Heavy traffic is a negative impact for the economic health of this community. (4
     comments received)
        o Currently, a fairly pristine wooded area with no construction on Kure Beach
            section and not much in the Carolina Beach section. A four-lane road will end
            the Pleasure Island as we know it!
  x Proposed four lanes will take up our parking in front of our business.
  x Traffic flow to Snows Cut Bridge will back up on weekends, holidays and emergency
     evacuations. There is only one bridge off the island to handle traffic.
  x Not needed ­ would go through wetlands.

                                       Page 4 of 7
   x   Currently no congestion ­ leave it as is! (21 comments received)
           o Waste of money in these poor economic times.
           o Preserve our buffer zones.
   x   No more asphalt on this island!
   x   Oppose extending Dow Road beyond K Avenue through the Sunny Point Buffer Zone.
       (2 comments received)
           o Improve Dow Road from US 421 in Carolina Beach to K Avenue in Kure
              Beach, especially the shoulders and road condition.
           o Creating new right of way through Sunny Point Military Operations Terminal
              `buffer zone' poses additional security risks ­ outside of Town's jurisdiction
              creating patrolling and monitoring traffic issues.
           o Proposed route interferes with and infringes on the US Air Force Recreation
              Center at Fort Fisher. This facility contributes immensely to town's local
              economy and vital morale support issue for the Forces and families.
           o Proposed route diverts tourists away from Kure Beach business district and
              causes a negative economic impact.
           o Proposed route creates profound impacts on the environmental makeup of the
              surrounding Kure Beach area ­ it would degrade the environment and
              increase pollution and storm water issues.
   x   Opposed to bike path (multi-use) in existing MOTSU Buffer fire lane area.
   x   Opposed to dirt road or fire break in government-owned land between Dow Road and
       the residential community as an alternative.
           o Fire hazard concerns; concealment which draws possibility of robbery, rape
              and worse; reduction to habitat for wildlife; create foothold for future
              development of natural sanctuary; hidden from casual observation by drivers
              and police; accidents involving personal injury to solitary riders would go
              unnoticed until next biker happened along; cost is higher.
   x   Have yet to hear a good argument on why this study is needed ­ waste of money.

IDEA GENERATION or SUGGESTION
   x Add a bike path/pedestrian path the continuation of the one there now (all the way
      to K Street in Kure Beach). (34 comments received)
   x Currently sight distance is a problem making a right turn from Ocean Blvd. to Dow
      Road.
   x Add a light at Ocean Blvd.
   x Maintain two primary lanes ­ turn lanes might help.
   x Make improvements to Dow Road, K Avenue and through existing stop light, then
      north and south on US 421. Discourage through traffic on 7th, 6th, 5th, 4th, and 3rd
      streets in Kure Beach.
   x Make Dow Road a three-lane road using two lanes for exit in an emergency and keep
      the middle lane as a turning lane during normal use. (2 comments received)
   x Bike path should not be next to road or shoulder ­ 20 feet away is better. (4
      comments received)
   x Unnecessary expense ­ improve it by widening but not extending it.
          o Create a wide shoulder as an alternative.
   x Maintain Dow Road as a `through road' and widen so slow moving traffic is less of an
      inhibitor.
   x Improve the "blind corner" at Ocean Blvd/Dow Road.
   x Modify sharp turn at K Avenue.
   x Rebuild Dow road only to the capacity of Snow's Cut Bridge.
   x Design to accommodate residents, south end should be smaller ­ two lanes and grow
      as traffic load requires (south to north).
                                        Page 5 of 7
   x   Pleasure Island needs expansion and access to the south for both cars and bicycles.
   x   Any taking of land from Carolina Beach State Park would require an act of the state
       legislature.
           o Land owned by Carolina Beach State Park has routine prescribed burns on
               both sides of Dow Road (may cause occasional inconveniences for drivers
               using Dow as bypass).



Neighborhood/Community Impacts

FAVOR
  x Big plus, makes the street (Ft Fisher Blvd) much safer.
  x Would improve traffic flow off the island.
  x Bypassing K Blvd should help the local neighborhood. (4 comments received)
        o Improve quality of life; easy traffic congestion; will provide avenues for future
           economic resources.

OPPOSED
  x It would bypass the town's `business districts' (bad for businesses) ­ Carolina Beach
     and Kure Beach. (17 comments received)
        o Could change dynamics of business district to local dining destination and a
           pure destination for lodging.
  x It would mean more police patrol ­ who would this be? Who pays for it?
  x It would destroy wetlands for a road to be used three months out of the year. (3
     comments received)
        o Where would this road end ­ in Ft. Fisher, in the Ferry Terminal, near people's
           homes?
  x Business loss for locals. Will not decrease overcrowding of island traffic. (2
     comments received)
  x This is a quiet beach community ­ would increase traffic speed and noise. (4
     comments received)
  x Negative for residential (particularly children at play). (2 comments received)
  x Honor MOTSU commitment to keep buffer zone intact.

IDEA GENERATION or SUGGESTION
   x Try selling it by adding a bike trail. (5 comments received)
   x Not feasible since it is a hurricane evacuation route and two-lane bridge (Snow's Cut)
      would create bottleneck.

Environmental or Other Issues

FAVOR
  x None

OPPOSED
  x Do not ruin the little wetland and natural area on this island; do not abuse historic
     sites. (4 comments received)
  x Creates negative impact on storm water runoff with more asphalt, loss of trees and
     impacts wetlands. (3 comments received)
  x Just negative, negative, negative.
  x Storm water runoff and natural drainage will cause significant issues. (3 comments
     received)

   x   Will impact wildlife ­ deer, birds, etc. (7 comments received)
           o Deer overpopulated on Federal property causing accidents with cars (and you
              propose more cars?). Get the government to rid the deer and folks may think
              differently about it.
   x   According to geologists, all efforts must be made to reduce the erosion of our island
       by less development and less destruction of natural habitat.
           o Valuable wetlands that protect island from flooding, major east coast refuge
              for many migratory birds, carnivorous plants.
   x   Dow Road extension beyond K Avenue would negatively affect recreational area ­
       would require more safety (Fire & Police).


IDEA GENERATION or SUGGESTION
   x Bike lanes should be in the form of a very wide shoulder, not the narrow ones as on
      River Road. (2 comments received)
   x Need more representatives from Carolina and Kure Beach on your committee. (2
      comments received)
   x Spend our tax dollars elsewhere!
   x Visibility issues - cut back trees or vegetation for all turning lanes within five mile
      study area. (2 comments received)
          o Reduce speed limit.
   x Wildlife impact needs serious review (deer, etc.) (2 comments received)
   x Do a fly-over through the Air Force Recreation Center.
   x A large crosswalk from K Avenue to the pier area at the stoplight should be painted
      on the Big Daddy's side so that pedestrians can cross at the light without getting in
      the way of cars and trucks that turn right to go toward Fort Fisher.
   x If you want to use our taxpayer's money wisely, widen River Road and put a light at
      River and Carolina Beach Roads.
   x Concerned about getting off the island for a Category 3 or 4 Hurricane ­ US 421 is
      totally submerged following one of these storms. Create high routes to avoid
      flooding and possibly make a toll road like Hilton Head. This would defray the cost of
      construction.
   x Project should consider landscaping, choice of pavement, etc.; keeping it two lanes
      rather than four lanes would be far preferable.

Introduction
The Wilmington Metropolitan Planning Organization (WMPO) held a Public Workshop for the
Dow Road Corridor Study on the following date:

Monday, September 28, 2009 ­ Carolina Beach Town Hall, Carolina Beach

The local public was notified of the workshop in advance in the following ways:

       x   Newspaper advertisement in Island Gazette and Wilmington Morning Star
       x   Flyer posted on Carolina Beach / Kure Beach area businesses
       x   Email Notification to public officials and agencies.

The corridor study was to initially analyze the widening of Dow Road from US 421 in
Carolina Beach to K Avenue in Kure Beach, as well as extending Dow Road from K Avenue
to US 421 (Fort Fisher Boulevard) on new location. Due to lack of support from some
residents, the Town of Kure Beach, and some public agencies, the study was re-scoped to
study only the existing alignment of Dow Road and what improvements may be needed to
handle future projected traffic volumes and to accommodate pedestrians and cyclists.
Currently, Dow Road is a two-lane, undivided road that includes bike lanes and extends
through Carolina and Kure Beaches. The study recommends adding a multi-use recreational
path for bicycles, pedestrians, skaters and other users and additional turn lanes and signage
to provide for safe and efficient vehicular movements. The area being studied is
approximately 5.3 miles in length, bordered within the Military Ocean Terminal, Sunny Point
(MOTSU) Blast Buffer.

The purpose of the workshop was to review and discuss the findings of the Dow Road
Corridor Study, and to provide participants an opportunity to speak to WMPO and Consultant
team staff and make verbal and written comments.

As participants arrived, they were asked to sign in and provided a newsletter and comment
sheet regarding the Dow Road Corridor Study. The Comment Sheet included three special
topics of interest to write comments, which included:

       x   Dow Road Improvements
       x   Neighborhood/Community Impacts
       x   Environmental or Other Issues

The format of the workshop provided citizens' an opportunity to learn about the project,
understand the social, environmental and economic character of the area, ask questions and
offer input to MPO staff and consultant team members. Maps, displays and other project
information were available for viewing to provide participants a good understanding of the
project.

Mr. Mike Kozlosky, WMPO Project Manager, Mr. Matt Pickens, Consultant Team Project
Manager, Mr. Tim Owens of Carolina Beach, and consultant team members were available at
the workshop to answer questions.

A total of 10 people signed in at the workshop. Additionally, a total of 4 comment sheets
were completed at the meeting and/or received by mail or via email. A summary of all
written comments is presented below.

NOTES:
Steve Everhart called in response to the scoping letter information request he received via mail. I explained to Steve that at this point
the project is mainly a feasibility study. There is no federal funding in the project at present and the effort is being led by the
Wilmington MPO. Eventually there may be federal dollars and/or NCDOT may have more involvement but we are not to that point
yet. First we need to figure out if the project is even feasible and that is the purpose of this study.


Mr. Everhart explained that the only information/comment his agency has at this point in the project is that section of project on
existing US 421 may be within an area of environmental concern for ocean hazards and if so, a CAMA permit may be needed.


Mr. Everhart informed me that he will forward the scoping letter to Stephen Lane (NCDOT Representative for DCM) because he may
be able to offer more information or comments. His address is 400 Commerce Lane, Morehead City, NC 28557.

NOTES:
Gary Jordan called in response to the scoping/request for information letter he received for this project. He asked where the funding
for the project was coming from and if NCDOT was overseeing the project. I explained where we were at this point in the project and
that is was unclear where the funding would come from eventually or if the project would even get constructed. There is not TIP# for
the project at present.


After hearing this Gary explained that the USFWS may not comment on the project mainly due to their present workload and back
log. If this were a NCDOT administered project or had a TIP number than USFWS would be more involved.

                 Dear Ms. Helgren,

                      Reference your May 28, 2008 letter requesting comments and any known environmental impact
                 information associated with the Dow Road Extension through Fort Fisher Recreation Site (FFRS). My
                 planning staff completed a preliminary evaluation of this proposal and offered the following comments:

                           1. The proposed road extension requires a 150-foot corridor that would sever the main portion of
                 the installation from the existing recreational cottage area adjacent to Fort Fisher Blvd. In addition, it will
                 disrupt half of the existing recreational vehicle (RV) park area. Access by cottage occupants to the main
                 installation would have to be reestablished by an unimpeded overhead walkway or underpass and visual
                 buffers and physical barriers from the road to the cottages would have to be established. Finally,
                 provisions to reconstruct the RV and trailer park and provide visual buffers and physical barriers for the
                 main installation would be required. FFRS provides a major source of non-appropriated income to the
                 Seymour Johnson AFB morale, welfare, and recreation fund, which supports recreational activities for
                 military, DoD civilian, and retired personnel. In addition, FFRA supports a NC National Guard training
                 site. The proposed road extension is not desirable for maintaining a cohesive Air Force recreation and
                 Guard training site and detracts from providing an overall quality experience. Appropriate actions will be
                 required to mitigate these concerns.

                          2. The Air Force is currently in the process of conducting an enhanced use lease study for
                 privatizing the cottage area. Any resultant lease Request for Proposal/Agreement will have to be
                 coordinated with the corridor proposal. Affects on the viability and equitability of the resultant lease would
                 have to be evaluated.

                        3. There are water wells in the proposed 150 foot corridor that will have to be properly closed in
                 accordance with Federal and State policies and procedures.

                                  4. There are no known endangered species on FFRS proper.

                          5. There are known and potential cultural resources in areas on the south and west side of
                 FFRS, outside the proposed corridor. There is the potential for discovery of additional cultural resources
                 within the corridor and within the vicinity of FFRS.

                      Thank you for contacting us with this matter and requesting our comments. If additional information or
                 clarification is required, please contact Mr. Matthew Makdad, P.E., 4 CES/CECP, (919) 722-5531.

                 Dear Ms. Helgren,

                    Reference the May 28, 2008 letter requesting comments associated with the Dow Road
                 Extension through Fort Fisher Recreation Site (FFRS). My staff has completed a preliminary
                 evaluation of this proposal. There are a number of issues of operational concern as follows:

                         A. FFRS is used as a resort for the military to relax with their families. A four lane road
                            bisecting the site will effectively destroy that ambience, impacting their leisure. Even
                            with audio/visual buffers the atmosphere of a calm, quiet place to recreate will cease to
                            exist.

                         B. The road will create safety hazards for pedestrians, vehicles and bicyclists from the
                            cottages attempting to cross to reach the river, pool, restaurant, shop and equipment
                            rental, or for the personnel residing in the mobile homes, campers and tents to access
                            the beach.

                         C. Extending Dow Road through FFRS will adversely impact the ability of the facility to host
                            community/base recreational events. The road will bisect the field used for parking for
                            events such as the Seafood/Jazz festival, the Car Shows, etc, rendering it unusable.
                            Inability to host these events directly impacts the financial base of Seymour Johnson
                            AFB.

                    If additional information or clarification is required, please contact Ms. Linda Edsall-Huard.,
                 4 FSS/DD, (919) 722-5331.



                                                                               //signed, DAL, 31 Jul 08//

                                                                               TC2022443.1s EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2
                                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Elevations have been determined from the USGS Digital Elevation Model and should be evaluated on
a relative (not an absolute) basis. Relative elevation information between sites of close proximity
should be field verified. Sites with an elevation equal to or higher than the target property have been
differentiated below from sites with an elevation lower than the target property.
Page numbers and map identification numbers refer to the EDR Radius Map report where detailed
data on individual sites can be reviewed.

Sites listed in bold italics are in multiple databases.

Unmappable (orphan) sites are not considered in the foregoing analysis.


FEDERAL RECORDS
RCRAInfo: RCRAInfo is EPA's comprehensive information system, providing access to data supporting
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA) of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)
of 1984. RCRAInfo replaces the data recording and reporting abilities of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Information System(RCRIS). The database includes selective information on sites which generate,
transport, store , treat and/or dispose of hazardous waste as defined by the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA). Conditionally exempt small quantity generators (CESQGs) generate less than 100 kg of
hazardous waste, or less than 1 kg of acutely hazardous waste per month. Small quantity generators (SQGs)
generate between 100 kg and 1,000 kg of hazardous waste per month Large quantity generators generate over
1,000 kilograms (kg) of hazardous waste, or over 1 kg of acutely hazardous waste per month. Transporters are
individuals or entities that move hazardous waste from the generator offsite to a facility that can recycle,
treat, store, or dispose of the waste. TSDFs treat, store, or dispose of the waste.

   A review of the RCRA-SQG list, as provided by EDR, and dated 06/13/2006 has revealed that there is 1
   RCRA-SQG site within approximately 2 miles of the target property.

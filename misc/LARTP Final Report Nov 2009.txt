                                                                        and Process



1.1   Purpose of the Plan

      The four member jurisdictions (Village of Marvin, Town of
      Waxhaw, Town of Weddington, and Village of Wesley
      Chapel) of the Union County Local Area Regional
      Transportation Plan (LARTP) Group are collectively and
      individually feeling the strains of tremendous growth
      pressure from the greater Charlotte region. As one of the
      fastest growing counties in the state, Union County is
      challenged with trying to mitigate the many impacts of this
      rapid growth, while proactively planning for its future. This
      is especially true for the towns in the western portion of the
      county. While growth and development bring many benefits
      to the community (such as new investment and jobs), they
      also threaten many of the values the communities want to
      preserve, particularly their small town character and rich
      rural heritage. Some of the most immediate and significant
      impacts felt by area residents are on the region's transportation system. The member jurisdictions of
      the LARTP Group, together with the Centralina Council of Governments and the Mecklenburg-Union
      Metropolitan Planning Organization, have collaborated to create a unified transportation plan to put
      themselves in a position of knowledge and strength when confronting growth, rather than a position
      of reaction and catching-up.
      Past approaches to addressing the long-term transportation needs of the area have emphasized
      maintaining (or attempting to maintain) reasonable level of service for motorists. While impacts on
      quality of life have been recognized, the importance of accommodating traffic growth has typically
      dominated transportation decisions. Functional needs, which are obviously important, often override
      environmental, aesthetic, and even local economic implications. Widening a road in accordance with
      traditional design standards to accommodate projected traffic loads is a classic example. In many
      cases, there is no alternative but to increase the capacity of a road. However, the affected community
      may not have had an adopted plan to influence how the road is designed. Alternative modes of
      travel also often have been a secondary consideration, depending on available budgets and other



                                                        1
      constraints. New developments are sometimes approved without a true understanding of direct or
      cumulative impacts on the transportation system, and without considering future mobility
      challenges. This study offers the opportunity to develop an integrated and forward-thinking
      transportation and land-use plan.


1.2   Study Area

      Figure 1 shows the boundaries of the study area for the LARTP. In general, the study area is
      comprised of the Village of Marvin, the Town of Waxhaw, the Town of Weddington, and the Village
      of Wesley Chapel. Because this plan is a study of transportation systems, it is not confined to
      municipal boundaries. There are a number of locations between municipalities that fall under the
      jurisdiction of Union County. The plan also considers the area's transportation systems within the
      broader regional context, with special attention paid to how the LARTP area connects with and is
      impacted by neighboring Union County and Monroe, Mecklenburg County and Charlotte, and South
      Carolina to the west.


1.3   Summary of Key Elements

      The LARTP is a multimodal plan ­ it attempts to balance the needs of various modes of
      transportation, including vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, and transit. Since the area's roadways are
      currently experiencing congestion and safety issues, and because those issues are projected to get
      much worse in the future, the focus of the plan is on roadways and intersections. Creating viable
      options for using alternative modes may alleviate congestion as well as provide positive health and
      quality of life benefits for the community.

      The key elements of the LARTP are:

           · Roadways ­ Includes the Thoroughfare Plan, which plans for the area's long-range roadway
               needs, and the Intersection Plan, which makes recommendations for capacity and safety
               improvements for targeted intersections in the study area.
           · Bicycle and Pedestrians ­ Opportunities for improving bicycle and pedestrian facilities and
               amenities are identified.
           · Land Use Policies and Ordinances ­ Recommendations are made for new and amended land use
               policies and ordinances to understand and mitigate impacts of development and promote
               more efficient land use patterns.

      To facilitate discussion and analysis of these elements, this report is organized into the following
      sections:

            ·   Existing Conditions (Where We Are Now)
            ·   Future Conditions (Where We Are Headed)
            ·   Recommendations (Where We Want To Be), and
            ·   Implementation Plan (How We're Going To Get There)

1.4   Regional Planning Context

      Many transportation planning decisions are carried out at the regional level, especially where federal
      and state transportation improvement funds are being considered. The four LARTP member
      jurisdictions fall under the purview of the Mecklenburg-Union Metropolitan Planning Organization
      (MUMPO), one of seventeen metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) in North Carolina. MPOs
      are federally-mandated for communities with an urbanized population of greater than 50,000. They
      are comprised of local government and transportation authorities charged with ensuring that
      transportation funding is allocated to projects and programs in a "continuing, cooperative and
      comprehensive" manner. MUMPO serves the greater Charlotte urbanized area, of which western
      Union County is a part, and has seventeen voting member jurisdictions and bodies. The Village of
      Marvin is the only municipality of the four in the LARTP study area that is not a voting member of
      MUMPO because it does not yet meet the minimum population threshold of 5,000.

      MUMPO provides a number of services and administers a variety of programs, but perhaps the most
      visible is development of MUMPO's Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP). The LRTP is a long-
      range blueprint for defining the MUMPO region's future transportation needs and developing
      projects and programs to meet those needs. The LRTP is a comprehensive and multimodal plan,
      considering roadway, highway, transit, rail, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, as well as other
      programs designed to offset the impacts of growth. The MUMPO LRTP is a fiscally-constrained plan
      which includes projects that have been modeled and meet the transportation needs and air quality
      standards for the MUMPO region. The LRTP is adopted by MUMPO and the North Carolina
      Department of Transportation (NCDOT) as the long-term mobility blueprint for the MUMPO region.

      Another important project at the regional level is development of the MUMPO's Comprehensive
      Transportation Plan (CTP). The CTP is a relatively new plan developed by the NCDOT that is
      replacing the traditional thoroughfare plan. Like the LRTP, the CTP is a long-range multimodal plan.
      But unlike the LRTP, the CTP is not fiscally-constrained. Because it is not fiscally-constrained, the
      CTP includes more projects than the LRTP.

      MUMPO is currently in the process of updating the LRTP and developing the CTP (updating the
      MUMPO thoroughfare plan). The projects and recommendations developed as part of the Western
      Union County Local Area Regional Transportation Plan will feed directly into both of these MUMPO
      plans. Having a unified, adopted plan for this area will be beneficial for the four municipalities as
      they participate in developing the MUMPO's plans.


1.5   Public and Stakeholder Involvement

      The LARTP was developed with a significant amount of public and stakeholder involvement,
      recognizing that implementation of the plan will require buy-in from stakeholders from each of the
      four member communities. The following groups and activities were instrumental in development of
      the LARTP:

      Steering Committee: Elected and appointed officials from each of the four member jurisdictions,
      together with staff and representatives from the development community and other local interests
      met monthly to develop each of the components of the plan.




                                                        4
Technical Committee: Staff from each of the four member jurisdictions, the Centralina Council of
Governments, and the Mecklenburg-Union Metropolitan Planning Organization (MUMPO), met
regularly with the consultant team to develop the technical aspects of the plan and "reality check"
recommendations.

Public Meetings: Citizens in the study area were invited to participate at various points in the
process. Attempts were made to provide information and input opportunities at various locations
and settings to reach the widest audience possible. These were the main public events:

   ·   Public Workshops: Two public workshops were
       held in October and November of 2008, one in
       Wesley Chapel and one in Weddington.
       Participants worked in small groups to identify
       issues and discuss potential solutions. They
       also participated in a key pad polling exercise
       designed to gauge opinion on a number of
       transportation and land use concepts (the results
       of the key pad polling exercise are found in
       Appendix A).

   ·   Community Event Booths: On November 1, 2008,
       booths were set up at the Waxhaw Farmers
       Market and the Marvin Chili Cook-Off.
       Information was distributed about the plan and
       booth visitors had the opportunity to ask
       questions and provide feedback similar to the
       public workshops.

   ·   Public Meeting: A public meeting was held May
       27, 2009 to present the draft recommendations
       to the public and get feedback.

Project Website: A project website (www.lartp.org) was developed and maintained to disseminate
information and provide another outlet for public comments.

2.1   Introduction

      Union County is the fastest growing county in North Carolina and is one of the ten fastest growing
      counties in the United States. The western half of the county, and especially those communities
      adjacent to the Mecklenburg County line, has absorbed most of this growth. While this explosive
      growth can bring benefits to a community it can also take a tremendous toll on its infrastructure.

      The communities within the LARTP study area have a rich rural heritage. The area's roadways were
      developed for local, rural traffic, with many of today's major thoroughfares developed originally as
      farm-to-market roads. Now those roads (such as Providence Road/NC 16 and NC 84) are handling
      significant amounts of not only local traffic, but also commuter traffic, since most of the area's
      residents do not work within the study area. Many of the area's roads also continue to carry large
      farm vehicles, which can pose safety concerns as vehicles attempt to pass them on roads with no
      center turn lanes and narrow or nonexistent shoulders. One of the main challenges facing these
      communities is developing a transportation system that adequately serves the vehicular needs of
      their residents and workers without compromising the rural heritage and small-town atmosphere.

      This section details the existing transportation conditions in Western Union County, including
      describing the operating conditions of the existing transportation network in the project vicinity, the
      surrounding roadway network, weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes, intersection
      performance, and collision analysis. Additionally, this chapter describes the public bicycle facilities,
      pedestrian facilities, and the public transit network.

2.2   Travel Characteristics

      The communities within the study area include small towns that are rural in nature. While there is
      travel between different locations within the study area, there is a heavy focus of travel to and from
      Charlotte, which as a large urban area, attracts trips related to employment, recreation, and shopping.
      Based on US Census information, shown in Table 1, approximately three-quarters of all residents
      within the study area work outside the study area, with almost 60 percent working in Charlotte.
      Given the distance from the study area to outside locations of employment, the average travel time to
      work for residents living within the study area is approximately 30 minutes.

      As shown in Table 2, there are limited mobility options within the study area, as approximately 84%
      of all residents drive alone to work. Alternative modes, including carpool, walk, bicycle, and transit
      comprise 11% of all work-related travel. While the Census does not record information on travel
      mode use for any other trip purposes, anecdotal evidence indicates that an overwhelming majority of
      travel into, out of, and within the study area occurs via the use of private automobiles. This is based
      on a combination of the land use patterns in the area, distance between destinations, and the lack of
      viable alternative transportation options. As such, the primary focus of the following existing
      conditions sections primarily address vehicle traffic conditions.

2.3   Functional Classification

      Different streets in the overall roadway system are designed to perform specific functions with the
      goal of minimizing traffic and land use conflicts, improving safety, and enhancing mobility. The road
      classifications described below are based on the definitions used by NCDOT for the Comprehensive
      Transportation Plan and their Strategic Highway Corridors. The classifications are detailed below
      and summarized in Table 3.

      The main roadway classifications considered for the Western Union County LARTP are
      Thoroughfares (Major and Minor), Collectors, and Locals. There are possible sub-classifications
      within each. As higher-level roadways designed to carry more vehicles with more controlled access,
      there are no roads designated as freeways or expressways in the study area. The current functional
      classifications in the study area are illustrated in Figure 2. Note that in Figure 2, Boulevards are
      shown as Major Thoroughfares.

      Freeway
      Freeways feature characteristics of high mobility and low accessibility, with full control of access.
      Carrying through traffic and controlling access points are of supreme importance of roadways
      classified in this category. Typically, freeways have a minimum of four travel lanes, are median-
      divided facilities, and have posted speed limits of 55 miles per hour or greater. Traffic signals and




                                                                       7
driveways are not permitted, as access is only permitted at existing or new grade-separated
interchanges.

Expressway
Expressways feature characteristics of high mobility and moderate to low accessibility. Moving
through-traffic is an important element; however, access points are allowed, but limited. Traffic
signals are not permitted, but driveway connections are permitted. It is recommended that
driveways be consolidated if possible, and spaced at least 1,000 feet from one another. Typically,
roadways in this category have a minimum of four travel lanes, are median-divided facilities, and
have posted speed limits of 55-60 miles per hour.

Boulevard
Boulevards feature characteristics of moderate mobility and low to moderate accessibility. The
relationship between mobility and accessibility is more balanced than that of freeways and
expressways. Access control may range from limited to no control. Driveway connections are
permitted. These conflict points are recommended to be consolidated if at all possible, and spaced at
1,000 feet from one another. While signalized intersections may accommodate all movements,
driveways should be restricted to right-in/right-out facilities. Typically, roadways in this category
have a median, but may have as few as two lanes. They have posted speed limits of 30-55 miles per
hour. Traffic signals are allowed and recommended at ½ mile intervals.

Thoroughfare
Thoroughfares (major and minor) feature characteristics of moderate to low mobility and high
accessibility. There is no control of access in the category. Traffic signals are allowed and
recommended at ½ mile intervals. Driveways are allowed with full movement, but are still
recommended to be consolidated or shared if possible. This category includes all roads with a two-
way center left-turn lane, but no roads with medians. Speed limits are posted between 25-55 miles
per hour.

Collector
Collector roads feature characteristics of moderate to low mobility and high accessibility, and serve as
a link between through-roads and local roads. There is no control of access (i.e. no physical
restrictions on access). Traffic signals are allowed, at a recommended minimum spacing of ¼ mile.
Driveways are allowed with full movement, but are still recommended to be consolidated or shared
if possible. Roadways in this category generally will have neither a center left turn lane nor a median,
but may have dedicated left and right turn lanes. Speed limits are regulated at 25-45 miles per hour.

Local Road
Local roads are designed to provide final access to properties, rather than through movements. There
is no control of access (i.e. no physical restrictions on access). Traffic signals are allowed, at a
recommended minimum spacing of ¼ mile. Driveways are allowed with full movement, but are still
recommended to be consolidated or shared if possible. Roadways in this category generally will have
neither a center left turn lane nor a median, but have dedicated left and right turn lanes. Speed limits
are regulated at 35 miles per hour or less. Some residential neighborhoods have roads that function
as "local connectors". These roads are designed to provide better vehicular access through
neighborhoods with more limited access than typical local streets.

2.4   Roadway Traffic

      Roadway traffic conditions within the study area have rapidly changed over the past ten years. The
      conversion of the study area from primarily a rural region to one that is more suburban in nature has
      led to increased daily traffic levels. As shown on Figure 3, the roadways that are most heavily
      utilized include the following major routes:
                    · NC 16
                    · NC 75
                    · NC 84
                    · Rea Road
                    · New Town Road, west of NC 16
                    · Waxhaw Indian Trail
                    · Old Waxhaw Monroe
                    · Forest Lawn Road
      The level of traffic on each of the above roadways is directly related to the proximity to Charlotte,
      which represents the most predominant destination outside of the study area. For example, NC 16
      has approximately 17,800 daily vehicles along the section north of NC 84, while there are only
      approximately 9,000 daily vehicles along the section north of downtown Waxhaw. Additionally, the
      geography of the study area, which allows for many parallel east-west roads and fewer north-south
      options, leads to higher concentrations of traffic along the major north-south roads. Outside of the
      NC highway system, most of the roadways within the study area were not designed to handle the
      level of traffic that typical travel along them under current conditions.

2.5   Intersection Traffic

      Traffic operations at intersections are typically described in terms of "level of service" (LOS). LOS is
      a qualitative measure of the effect of several factors on traffic operating conditions including speed,
      travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, safety, driving comfort, and convenience. It is
      generally measured quantitatively in terms of vehicular delay and described using a scale that ranges
      from LOS A, the best operating conditions, to LOS F, the worst operating conditions. LOS D or better
      represents "acceptable" operations. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. When traffic
      volumes exceed capacity, stop-and-go conditions result, and operations are designated as LOS F.
      LOS standards and descriptions for intersections are shown in Table 4.

                                Table 4: Levels of Service Description for Intersections


             Level of Service              Description               Signalized Intersection   Unsignalized Intersection

                    A                   Little or no delay                 <= 10 sec.                 <= 10 sec.

                    B                   Short traffic delay                10-20 sec.                 10-15 sec.

                    C                  Average traffic delay               20-35 sec.                 15-25 sec.

                    D                   Long traffic delay                 35-55 sec.                 25-35 sec.

                    E                 Very long traffic delay              55-80 sec.                 35-50 sec.

                    F                  Unacceptable delay                  > 80 sec.                  > 50 sec.

session. LOS were calculated at each study intersection for the weekday AM and PM peak hour (see
Appendix A for detailed level of service calculations). Figures 5 and 6 show the results of the LOS
analysis.

As shown on Figures 5 and 6, all signalized intersections operate at acceptable LOS D or better during
both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Only two of the six signalized intersections perform at LOS D
during either the A.M. or P.M. peak, along Weddington Road at Twelve Mile Creek Road and
Weddington Road and Waxhaw Indian Trail Road. The two signalized intersections along New
Town Road, at Crane Road and Waxhaw Indian Trail Road, performed best, with LOS B conditions
during A.M. and P.M. peak hours in both cases.

Unsignalized intersections within the study area operate at acceptable levels of service during both
the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, with a few exceptions. The westbound Howie Mine Road approach to
Broome Street in downtown Waxhaw operates at a failing LOS E in the P.M. peak hour, for instance,
while the northbound Weddington Matthews Road approach to Tilley Morris Road operates at LOS F
during the A.M. peak hour.

Three unsignalized intersection approaches operate at unacceptable LOS (LOS E or F) during both
A.M. and P.M. peak hours, namely the southbound Deal Road approach to Weddington Road, the
northbound Waxhaw Marvin Road approach to New Town Road and the eastbound Potter Road
approach to Wesley Chapel Road. All of these intersections warrant traffic signals according to
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Peak Hour criteria, which uses travel time

2.6   Traffic Safety

      NCDOT collision records for a three-year period (October 2005-October 2008) were analyzed for 20
      study area intersections, most of which correspond to the previously identified intersection count
      sites. As shown in Figure 7, a total of 403 collisions occurred, of which 159 (39.5 percent) were
      reported as causing non-fatal injuries, 243 (60.3 percent) as causing property damage only and one
      (0.2 percent) as fatal. Figure 8 depicts the number of accidents at each study area intersection by type;
      overall, angle, left-turn and rear-end crashes were most common.

      The fatal collision occurred at Weddington Matthews Road and Beulah Church Road, an angled
      intersection of higher-speed two-lane roads with narrow shoulders at which most collisions were
      angle- or left turn-related. Here, wide right-turn radii may encourage motorists to execute faster
      turns without paying close attention to approaching traffic, while a hollow along Weddington
      Matthews Road to the north of the intersection may restrict the visibility of motorists turning left
      from that road. Also, rear-end collisions may occur due to abrupt deceleration when approaching the
      intersection.

      Several other intersections at which numerous injurious collisions occurred over the three-year
      period are configured similarly and experienced similar types of collisions, although angles of
      intersection and surrounding grades vary. In addition to the high travel speeds and scant shoulders,
      sight distances at some intersections are poor due to trees, shrubbery and tall field grass adjacent to
      the roads. Such intersections include Waxhaw Indian Trail Road and New Town Road, which
      recorded the greatest number of injurious collisions (24); Crane Road and New Town Road, where
      the second-highest number occurred (20), and where a new signal was recently installed; Antioch
      Church Road and Beulah Church Road, where one collision involved a roadside object; and New
      Town Road and Potter Road.

      Collision patterns at some intersections deviated from those of the overall study area. At
      Weddington Road and Twelve Mile Creek Road, for instance, right-turn collisions were more
      common and may be caused by motorists pulling too far into the intersection when seeking a gap in
      which to turn right. At Waxhaw Marvin Road and Kensington Drive, a greater incidence of head-on
      and runoff collisions may result from the intersection's odd turn lane configuration. Motorists
      traveling westbound through the intersection must correct their direction slightly to stay on the road,
      while those turning from westbound Kensington Drive onto southbound Waxhaw Marvin Road may
      not anticipate through traffic in the left lane of eastbound Kensington Drive. Finally, collisions
      tended to be less severe in downtown Waxhaw, perhaps due to lower travel speeds; a greater share of
      collisions classified as "other" occurred in this area as well.

2.7   Bicycles

      As noted previously, the area's rural heritage has played a major role in defining the development of
      its transportation systems. Just as the rural roads were not originally designed and built to carry
      today's traffic, they were also not designed to accommodate bicycle users. While advanced bicyclists
      may ride the roads, perhaps on group rides on weekends, most residents do not bicycle outside their
      neighborhoods, in large part because there are few dedicated bicycle facilities.

      Bicycle Facility Types
      There are two general classes of bicycle facilities: on-street (bike lanes, wide outside lanes, wide
      shoulders) and off-street (greenways and multi-use paths). There are currently no striped and
      marked on-street bike lanes in the study area. Rea Road west of Providence Road/NC 16 has wide
      outside lanes that accommodate bicycles on-street, and the new section of Providence Road/NC 16
      will have wide outside lanes with striped bike lanes through intersections when completed.

      A system of greenway trails can supplement on road bicycle facilities. Greenways often connect
      points of interest more directly than roadways and are designed for recreational uses. Greenway
      planning differs from on-street bicycle facility planning, however, because it typically involves
      developing and adopting a separate greenways master plan. To date, the only adopted greenways
      plan within the study area is the Village of Marvin Parks and Greenways Master Plan. The Village of
      Wesley Chapel's Master Plan includes some conceptual locations for potential greenways.

      Marvin Greenways
      The only existing greenway trail section within the study area is approximately 0.75 miles long,
      connecting residences along a portion of Joe Kerr Road and Marvin School Road toward Marvin
      Elementary School. The Marvin Parks and Greenways Master Plan calls for extension of this
      segment.

      Bicycle Riding Clubs
      Riding clubs are common recreational activities for urban and suburban communities. The purpose
      of these clubs is to promote awareness for on-road cycling in the area, demonstrate need for future
      bicycle facilities, and to meet individuals who share common interests in cycling. The NCDOT lists at
      least four participating bicycle clubs in the greater Charlotte area, and other internet resources
      identify meeting locations and information on specific bicycle clubs that regularly ride through the
      study area on weekends. Clubs with advanced riders often ride in groups on weekends. These
      advanced groups may take a full lane of traffic while riding and typically travel long distances.

      Existing Facilities in Neighboring Jurisdictions
      The City of Charlotte Bicycle Plan (2008) indicates several major and minor thoroughfares that are
      suitable for bicycle facilities, extending into the study area. Mecklenburg County also has an
      established greenway trail along the Six Mile Creek corridor, which serves as the county boundary
      between Union and Mecklenburg counties. The existing trail is 0.9 miles long, with future
      considerations for more than five miles of expansion and further connections with residential areas.
      Refer to Figure 9 for the existing (dark-green solid line) and potential (light-green dashed line)
      greenways within neighboring jurisdictions.




                                                       20
   Figure 9: Existing Greenway Facilities
Western Union County Local Area Regional Transportation Plan
2.8   Pedestrians

      Pedestrian facilities are essential elements of every transportation mode because every type of trip
      (vehicular, transit, or bicycle) begins and ends with some amount of walking. Pedestrian facilities are
      important to communities as a measure of walkability, which contributes to the overall health, safety,
      and quality of life of the community. Pedestrian facilities also serve to connect points of interest that
      may not be directly connected by roadways or other modes.

      Sidewalks
      Western Union County is predominantly rural, low-density residential in character. Many of the
      residential neighborhoods, and especially newer neighborhoods, have sidewalks, but many do not.
      There are also few sidewalk connections between neighborhoods, making it more difficult to make
      short walking trips and encouraging driving. Pedestrian connections to local schools from adjacent
      and nearby neighborhoods are also limited.

      Of the four municipalities in the study area, Waxhaw has the most developed downtown area.
      Downtown Waxhaw has a sidewalk network, as well as a pedestrian bridge over the railroad tracks,
      that moves people throughout the downtown. Some pieces of that network are incomplete, however,
      and street crossings, due to high vehicular, truck, and train traffic, can be difficult, especially during
      the peak hours. There are also stretches of sidewalk on Providence Road/NC 16 to the north of
      downtown Waxhaw, and the widened section of Providence Road/NC 16 in the northern section of
      the study area will have sidewalks on both sides.

      Intersections
      In general, intersections within the study area lack treatments to accommodate pedestrians safely,
      such as high visibility crosswalks, pedestrians signal heads, and other appropriate signage and
      markings. Recently improved intersections, such as those along the Providence Road/NC 16 corridor,
      have incorporated these treatments.



2.9   Transit

      Transit options within the study area are limited, as there is no fixed-route service available.
      However, Union County Transportation operates community transportation service, which is
      demand-responsive and primarily focused on human and social service agencies. Transit options for
      work trips include Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) vanpools (Waxhaw to Airport, 3rd Shift and
      Indian Trail to Uptown, 1st Shift) and ridesharing opportunities through various Charlotte area
      websites. Additionally, CATS operates the following bus lines near the northern edge of the study
      area:

                  ·   43 Local ­ US 521 @ Ballantyne Corp Plaza
                  ·   61 Express ­ Hwy 16 @ Promenade Shop Center
                  ·   62 Express ­ Rea Rd @ St. Matthew Church Park and Ride
                  ·   74 Express ­ US 74 @ Union Town Center Park and Ride




                                                         22
As is common in non-urban areas, residents of the study area must drive personal vehicles in order to
access transit service. Even if fixed-route bus service where available within the study area, the
bicycle and pedestrian facilities are limited and would likely still require the use of a personal vehicle
to access transit.

                                                  Where We Are Headed



3.1   Growth

      Western Union County has already experienced tremendous growth, which has created some of the
      transportation conditions detailed in Section 2. As the region continues to grow, and more
      particularly as Western Union County continues to offer a high quality of life, the issues faced today
      will become more exaggerated and more difficult to solve.

      Figure 10 illustrates the projected change in population from 2000 to 2030. The data is derived from
      the Metrolina Regional Travel Demand Model and is broken into geographic areas called Traffic
      Analysis Zones. Figure 11 shows projected change in employment levels for the same time period.

      The main points of these figures are:

          ·   Population and employment growth will continue to concentrate along major transportation
              corridors, particularly along NC 16 and NC 84.

          ·   The southern portion of the study area, and especially Waxhaw, will receive the highest
              proportionate amount of growth.

          ·   Weddington, and to a lesser extent Wesley Chapel, will have the lowest growth levels.

          ·   Western Union County will continue to be primarily residential, with few significant
              employment opportunities. The highest concentrations of new employment opportunities
              are expected to be in the Waxhaw area.

      These projections are based on a combination of factors, including approved and anticipated new
      development, vacant or underdeveloped land, and other constraints, such as environmental features.
      The land use policies, ordinances, and decisions discussed in Section 5 will have a direct impact on
      future development patterns.

Western Union County Local Area Regional Transportation Plan
3.2   Roadways

      The Mecklenburg-Union County Metropolitan Planning Organization (MUMPO), the lead
      transportation planning agency for the study area, is charged with developing future transportation
      plans, including the following:

          ·   Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP)
          ·   Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP)
          ·   Unified Planning Work Program
          ·   Thoroughfare Plan/Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP)

      These plans, developed at the local level and balanced with regional needs, are provided to NCDOT,
      which is responsible for developing statewide TIPs on a seven-year implementation basis. The
      planned transportation improvements in the area are shown on Figure 12, based on the current
      MUMPO LRTP and NCDOT 2009-2015 TIP.

      As shown, the planned transportation improvements are limited within the study area and focus on
      the major roadways. While there are some intersection and safety improvements, the main focus is
      providing additional capacity along the major east-west and north-south NC highways. These
      roadways handle both local and regional traffic (through the study area) and were identified for
      inclusion in the MUMPO LRTP and NCDOT TIP based on the desire to enhance regional travel
      options. It should be noted that the identified improvements do not have guaranteed sources of
      funding.

      As shown on Figure 13, traffic levels will greatly increase within the study area by the year 2030.
      Daily traffic along the major routes will increase as much as 100%, with some additional traffic
      attributed to future development within the study area, but predominantly due to increased regional
      travel though the study area.

      The planned widening and new construction projects will help to alleviate some congestion
      associated with the additional regional travel, but the minor routes and local roads will also
      experience traffic increases between 50 -100 percent. This traffic is exclusively local to the study area,
      from future development, or existing traffic that shifts from the major facilities to the minor ones due
      to the increase in regional traffic. Without the implementation of local roadway and intersection
      improvements, the existing roadway system in the study area will not be able to handle the future
      traffic levels.

3.3   Bicycles

      On-Street Bicycle Facilities
      It is anticipated that on-street bike lanes/wide outside lanes will be included as part of the NC 16 and
      NC 84 widening projects and the Rea Road Extension project that are part of the TIP and shown in
      Figure 12. There are also other smaller-scale widening projects in the TIP and MUMPO LRTP that
      would likely have on-street bicycle facilities, both within the study area and nearby. There are no
      other planned on-street bicycle facilities planned that are not part of this LARTP project.

      Off-Street Bicycle Facilities and Greenways

      Village of Marvin
      The Village of Marvin adopted its Parks and Greenways Master Plan in March 2008, identifying trails
      as either Tier I (8 miles of trails) , or Tier II (16 miles of trails). Tier I trails serve as the backbone of
      the proposed greenway system, whereas the Tier II trails would serve as connectors and loop trails.
      Greenway trail widths recommended by this plan range from 8' to 12' to accommodate bicyclists,
      pedestrians, and horses. These trails are illustrated on Figure 14.

      Village of Wesley Chapel
      The Village of Wesley Chapel Master Plan included concepts for a greenway system. While not a
      formally adopted greenway plan, the concepts are useful in planning for potential future facilities.
      These potential greenway corridors are illustrated on Figure 14.

      Carolina Thread Trail
      The Carolina Thread Trail is a plan for a regional, 15-county greenway trail network, centering on
      Charlotte and Mecklenburg County. The concept is to link regional parks, green space, and
      attractions by a series of greenway trails, and "weaving communities together." Since the
      organization is regional, and the trail alignments are meant to be conceptual at this stage, the exact
      locations of possible future trails have not been determined. All representations of the Carolina
      Thread Trail (see Figure 14) within this report and study area are conceptually illustrated.

3.4   Pedestrians

      Similar to the planned on-street bicycle improvements in Section 3.3, sidewalks and intersection
      improvements are planned for the study area's TIP and LRTP projects. The four municipalities are
      also working with the NCDOT on spot intersection improvement projects to enhance pedestrian and
      vehicular safety. The Town of Waxhaw was recently awarded a federal stimulus grant to make
      improvements to the intersection of NC 16 and NC 75 in downtown Waxhaw.

3.5   Transit

      There are no plans for extending mass transit into the study area, although planned future Charlotte
      transit extensions would come closer to the study area (to Matthews) and make it easier for Western
      Union County residents to use transit. An express shuttle from Waxhaw to downtown Charlotte has
      been discussed but is not currently funded.

                                               4 Recommendations:
                                                Where We Want To Be




4.1   Introduction

      This section provides recommended roadway, intersection, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit
      improvements that provide short-term fixes for current problems and long-term solutions for future
      concerns. The recommendations are brought together in Section 6 (Implementation Plan).

4.2   Thoroughfare Plan

      The recommended Thoroughfare Plan is illustrated in Figure 15. The Thoroughfare Plan was
      developed through an iterative process that involved: analysis of existing and projected traffic
      volumes and roadway capacities; analysis of existing and projected intersection conditions;
      examination of the functional classification system (described in Section 2); analysis of environmental
      issues and other constraints; and discussion, analysis, and review by the project's Technical and
      Steering Committees.

      The Thoroughfare Plan is a system plan ­ it is intended to improve roadway conditions across the
      entire study area. While the local needs of each of the four jurisdictions were an important part of the
      plan, the overriding concern was to develop a plan that benefited the study area as a whole. The plan
      also recognizes that the majority of the proposed roadway projects are not isolated within a single
      jurisdiction. Indeed, the nature of thoroughfares is that they are cross-jurisdictional.

      It is also important to remember that thoroughfare plans are long-range plans. The purpose of the
      plan is to comprehensively identify and define future roadway needs. It is recognized that not all of
      these projects can be built in the short-term. But having these projects on an adopted thoroughfare
      plan can:

            · Help communities work cooperatively to solve issues of joint concern;
            · Identify right-of-way needs to help plan and fund roadway improvements that are part of
                new development;



                                                        33
        · Raise the profile of regionally significant projects in the regional transportation planning
           process; and
        · Help create common expectations among local leaders, the development community, and
           residents and property owners.

Individual projects on the Thoroughfare Plan (Figure 15) are identified by numbers which correspond
to project descriptions on the recommendations table. The map illustrates three general roadway
classifications applicable to the study area: Boulevards; Major Thoroughfares; and Minor
Thoroughfares. The characteristics of these roadways types are described in detail in Section 2 of this
report. The Thoroughfare Plan does not include local roads, which are primarily streets in residential
neighborhoods.

Within each of the roadway classifications are three levels of projects:

    ·     Existing ­ Roadway facilities that are not recommended to be improved. They are shown as
          solid lines on the map to show how the recommended improvements tie into the broader
          system.
    ·     Needs Improvement ­ Roadway facilities that need to be improved for capacity, safety, or
          system continuity. The improvement to the facility may be widening, other operational
          strategies, increasing the level of access control along the facility, or a combination of
          improvements and strategies. "Needs Improvement" does not refer to the maintenance
          needs of existing facilities.
    ·     Recommended ­ Roadway facilities on new location that are needed in the future. It is
          important to note that the projects shown as "Recommended" on the map (with dashed
          lines) are conceptual alignments drawn to show needed connections and general locations.
          Further detailed design and engineering will be required to determine precise locations and
          alignments as those projects draw closer to development.

Figures 16 ­ 19 show the same Thoroughfare Plan magnified for each of the four municipalities.

Project Prioritization
Table 5 details each of the recommended roadway projects on the Thoroughfare Plan map and
prioritizes each as either High, Medium, or Low Priority projects. It is important for future planning
purposes to prioritize projects in order to maximize limited funding opportunities and ensure that
the highest impact projects receive first focus. The table is expanded further in Section 6
(Implementation Plan).

Following Table 5, Figure 20 illustrates the project prioritization. In general, the High Priority
projects include the widening projects of the major NC routes (NC 16, NC 84, and NC 75/Waxhaw
Parkway). As the major existing and future travel routes, these projects need to be improved first to
improve through travel and allow the secondary roads to function as they are intended. The Medium
Priority projects are those that, when, improved, will provide viable alternatives to driving on the
major routes, for both through and local trips. These include major east-west routes, such as New
Town Road, and north-south routes, such as Waxhaw-Indian Trail, and may include new and existing
collector streets that help connect local roads to the major routes. The Low Priority projects are
typically projects of local importance that may not have the same regional benefits as the High and
Medium Priority projects.

Street Design
While the location of future roadway improvements is obviously critical, just as important is defining
the design, character, and other attributes of those roadways. The cross-sections illustrated in Figure
21 detail five general types of roadways recommended in the Thoroughfare Plan:

    ·   4-Lane Divided with Wide Outside Lanes (Boulevard)
    ·   3-Lanes with Wide Outside Lanes
    ·   2-Lanes with Bike Lanes
    ·   2-Lanes with Paved Shoulders
    ·   2-Lanes with Off-Street Multi-Use Path

The cross-sections are designed to be multimodal, accommodating vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians
within the same right-of-way. Bicycles are either accommodated in wide outside lanes, striped bike
lanes, paved shoulders, or a separate multi-use path (each is described in more detail in Section 4.4).
Pedestrians are accommodated either on sidewalks or multi-use paths. It is recognized that in some
locations with rural 2-lane roads it may not be feasible to have sidewalks on one or both sides of the
road.

These cross-sections are intended to be customized to individual projects according to local context
and conditions. The right-of-way requirements are useful especially in working with the
development community in building new roadways and making improvements to existing roadways.

4.3         Intersection Plan

            An important companion to the Thoroughfare Plan is the Intersection Plan, illustrated in Figure 22
            and detailed below in Table 6. As shown in Section 2, some of today's intersections have capacity
            and safety issues while others are projected to have more serious issues in the future. These issues
            have a major impact on the overall function of the region's roadway network. Intersection
            improvements have two benefits over major roadway improvement projects; 1) they can have
            immediate impacts on improving capacity and safety without having to go through the same
            extensive planning, design, and funding process as road widening and new roads, and 2) they are
            considerably more cost-effective. While intersection improvements may not cure all of the system's
            capacity deficiencies in the long-term, they are an effective tool for making immediate short-term
            improvements.

            There are a variety of types of potential intersection improvements, including: adding turn lanes,
            improving signal timing and coordination, access management, realigning offset intersections,
            making geometric and sight distance improvements to enhance safety, and in some locations,
            installing roundabouts. Similar to the roadway projects, intersection projects were prioritized into
            High, Medium, and Low Priority projects for ease of implementation.

4.4   Bicycle Recommendations

      As noted in Section 2, the LARTP study area has been developed with rural roadways and lacks
      significant on-street and off-street bicycle facilities. One of the challenges of planning bicycle
      facilities in areas like Western Union County is attempting to balance the needs of bicyclists and
      making bicycling a viable alternative to driving with the strong desire to maintain the rural heritage
      of the community and its transportation system. It is recognized that formal bicycle facilities may not
      be appropriate on all Western Union County roadways. This Plan enhances bicycling, both for
      recreational and travel purposes, in two main ways: by developing on-street bicycle facilities (see
      types below) along major corridors (eg, NC 16, NC 84, Waxhaw Parkway, and in the Village of
      Marvin), and by proposing targeted off-street improvements, such as a multi-use path along New
      Town Road (see thoroughfare plan in Figure 15 and street cross-sections in Figure 21).

      In order to understand the recommended bicycle improvements it may be helpful to first understand
      the different types of bicycle users and the various facilities that can accommodate them.

      Typical Bicycle Users
      There are three general categories of bicyclists:

          ·   Advanced: The advanced cyclist may represent the smallest population group, however they
              will ride the greatest number of miles per year and will likely be advocates for cycling
              opportunities at all skill levels. This category of cyclist feels comfortable traveling along
              thoroughfares that are predominantly automobile-oriented, at higher vehicular speed and
              volume.

          ·   Basic: The basic cyclist is less confident or experienced as the advanced, and would therefore
              prefer to ride along on-street facilities with lower vehicular speed, or off-road path facilities.
              This category of rider will typically represent a greater population than then advanced,
              however will not ride as many miles or be as vocal in regards to community bicycle facilities
              and amenities.

          ·   Children: The child cyclist has limited speed, vision, and overall comfort with regard to
              riding along with vehicles. This category of riders will represent the greatest population,
              however they will ride the smallest number of miles, and typically choose off-road multi-use
              path facilities or subdivision sidewalks to ride along.

      Bicycle Facility Types
      Different types of facilities are designed to accommodate the three general categories of users. The
      following are common facility types and may be appropriately applied in the study area:

      Wide outside lanes
      These types of facilities are generally preferred by the advanced cyclists because they allow the rider
      to operate within the lane, as a vehicle, at the posted speed limit. This facility is not striped, and may
      or may not include a curb and gutter. The typical outer lane minimum width is 14' for a multi-lane
      roadway, or 15' minimum width for a two-lane roadway, and does not include the width of a curb




                                                          50
and gutter. Because the cyclist is allowed to operate as a vehicle, this type of facility is only
recommended for roadways with moderate vehicle speeds for safety.

Paved shoulders / Bike lanes
These types of facilities may provide improved bicycle safety and comfort by dedicating a (preferred)
minimum 4' of pavement, generally with striping, along the roadway. While bike lanes and paved
shoulders are different facility types, they are included together here for application in this study
area. Basic and advanced cyclist users may prefer this type of facility because of the perceived added
rider safety and comfort. There are a variety of design standards for bike lanes, depending on the
local context.

Signed bike routes
This facility type includes the installation of signage along lower speed or volume (neighborhood)
roadways that would otherwise not warrant extra pavement or striping. These facilities may not
always provide direct routes for cyclists, and therefore may not be preferred by advanced cyclists.
The signs are cost-effective treatments for slowing vehicular traffic along a neighborhood street,
improving rider safety, and even improving wayfinding between neighborhood links and greenway
trails.

Shared lane markings
This type of pavement marking is also commonly referred to as a "Share the road arrow" or its
contraction, "Sharrow." This application is used in combination with either a wide outside lane or a
striped bike lane in order to clearly indicate that bicycle riders are encouraged to ride `here,' and in
this direction. Sharrows may also be used to increase vehicular awareness of cyclists along roads that
do not meet the preferred minimum lane width of 14'.

Multi-use paths
This type of facility is a separated, paved pathway that is generally a 10' wide minimum width, and
excludes motorized vehicles through the use of gates or bollards. Multi-use paths are shared use,
mixing bicycle riders of all user groups with pedestrians, and usually located within the roadway
right-of-way. This type of facility can be utilized by all types of users, however may not be preferred
by an advanced cyclist, who may still choose to ride with traffic at a moderate posted speed limit.
Amenities such as benches, wayfinding signage, managed vegetation (shade), or designated restroom
locations are common along this type of facility. Frequent curb-cuts for driveways or intersections
should be minimized or bypassed, if possible, so that the flow of cyclists along the path is
maintained.

Ancillary bicycle facilities
There are additional considerations for improving bicycling, which extend beyond the on- or off-
street paved facilities. These ancillary facilities would include bicycle parking and/or storage lockers,
bike racks on transit buses, shower facilities within office buildings, or bike-friendly storm drain
inlets and railroad crossing treatments.

Bicycle parking
Bicycles, much like vehicles, need a place to park upon reaching a destination. Many bicyclists prefer
covered parking locations to uncovered ones, if available. Considerations for location, capacity,
security, and design should all be weighed when selecting and installing bike parking.




                                                   51
Complementary facilities for bike commuters
When specifically accommodating bicycle commuters, there are considerations to be made for transit
providers to include bicycle racks on buses. Some racks are front-mounted on the bus, while other
designs convert seating in the rear of the bus or train to accommodate a small bike rack. This type of
amenity will allow commuters to shorten the distance between a fixed bus stop location and their
office destination, and increase transit ridership potential. Additionally the inclusion of changing
and shower facilities at work support bicycle commuting possibilities.

Retrofit roadway opportunities
On-street barriers to bicycling include non-bicycle-friendly storm drain inlets, uneven railroad
crossings, and road debris collection along the curb and shoulder of roadways. Resources through
the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals and other state or federal organizations
provide design specifications that help communities design retrofit solutions to many of these
problems.

Recommendations
Bicycle facilities are recommended as part of the Thoroughfare Plan (see Figure 15), which includes
roadway improvements with wide outside lanes, bike lanes, paved shoulders, and multi-use paths.

Aside from these facilities, there are also a variety of off-street bicycling opportunity areas, primarily
in the form of greenways. Figure 23 illustrates some of these opportunities. The recommendations
that are part of the Thoroughfare Plan are shown in two shades of blue, and potential greenway
opportunities are shown in shades of green.

Potential greenway trail opportunities include major stream corridors within the study area, such as
Twelve Mile, Six Mile, or even Waxhaw Creeks. Larger streams provide greater regional connectivity,
accessing more places and people. They should also pose fewer development conflicts with respect
to land use zoning, non-buildable lands and soils, proximity to existing structures, and even cost.
Additional potential greenway trail opportunities exist along minor stream corridors to connect
residential areas, parks, schools, or additional recreational destinations.

Major opportunities for bicycle improvements
   · Boulevard roadway projects with wide outside lanes
   · New Town Road and Crane Road roadway projects with off road multi-use path construction
   · Major and minor thoroughfare roadway projects within and near the Village of Marvin
   · Major stream corridor areas, such as Twelve Mile Creek and Waxhaw Creek
   · Minor stream corridor areas connecting to (a) on-road bike facilities, (b) major stream
        corridor opportunity areas, or (c) adjacent municipality facilities.

Constraints
Development of greenway trail facilities can be constrained by numerous factors, including social,
environmental, financial, and land use issues. Within the Six Mile Creek and Waxhaw Creek
watersheds there is a federally-listed endangered species (Carolina Heelsplitter), which places
additional development restrictions within all supporting creeks, streams, tributaries and other
riparian areas of the watershed. A development buffer of 100' for all riparian areas, and 200' of
riparian areas with an associated 100-year FEMA-designated floodplain has been imposed to protect
the water quality and this species. The development of a greenway trail is subject to these
development restrictions, however is listed as "potentially allowable" by the NC Department of the




                                                   52
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) ­ Division of Water Quality (DWQ) through a
permitting process. These water quality protection rules have the effect of decreasing the total
amount of developable land surrounding streams, however, they may also increase the potential for
greenway trail construction as part of a land conservation and water quality preservation effort.

Other recommendations
The four member communities may also wish to consider adopting policies that support bicycle
travel as noted in the "Ancillary Bicycle Facilities" section. These may include provision of shower
and locker facilities in employment centers, better bike parking, and other amenities. These policies
can be adopted as part of the Land Use Policies and Ordinances in Section 5.

4.5   Pedestrian Recommendations

      Creating walkable communities is an important objective of any transportation plan, whether rural,
      suburban, or urban. Developing comprehensive and connected pedestrian systems can add
      numerous quality of life benefits to a community, in addition to providing another alternative to trips
      made by car.

      Major elements of walkable community

      Sidewalks
      One measure of a walkable community is the existence of connected sidewalks. Sidewalks are
      sometimes constructed as required by local development ordinances as lands are subdivided and
      developed. This can lead to a disconnected pattern of new and old sidewalks throughout an area.
      Recording, assessing, maintaining, and connecting sidewalks is an important process for filling in
      "missing links" in the sidewalk system and enhancing pedestrian connectivity.

      Safe intersections
      Intersection crossings are common conflict points between pedestrians and vehicles. The Intersection
      Plan that is part of this study makes recommendations for specific intersection improvements to
      enhance safety and increase capacity.

      Connected systems
      Walkability is also a reflection of the general connectivity between pedestrian systems and facilities.
      Physical barriers or gaps between constructed pedestrian facilities are major obstacles to the walking.
      When faced with such obstacles the options are generally to (a) walk in unsafe conditions, such as
      along roadways, or (b) select an alternative mode of transportation, typically driving. The emphasis
      should be on connecting pedestrian facilities and allowing them to work as a system rather than
      individual components.

      Intermodal connectivity
      Combining modes of transportation is another measure of walkability. This would include
      developing locations with considerations for not only vehicles, but also for pedestrians, bicycles, and
      transit. Some examples would include a development with:

              Vehicular considerations (parking, access, signage, traffic signals, turn lanes)
              Pedestrian considerations (connected sidewalks, direct routing, curb cuts and ramps, signage,
              lighting)
              Bicycle considerations (bicycle parking, curb cuts and ramps, access paths)
              Transit considerations (pick up/drop off location, signage, shelter, lighting)

      The ultimate goal of intermodal connectivity would be a reduction in the number of single-purpose
      and single-occupant vehicular trips made within a community. The benefits would be reduced traffic
      congestion along roads, increased safety and efficiency of the entire system, improved air and water
      quality, and a better quality of life for citizens.




                                                        55
      Recommendations
      Recommended pedestrian improvements include:

             Implement sidewalk improvements as part of roadway improvement projects on the
             Thoroughfare Plan
             Implement intersection improvements as part of Intersection Plan
             Develop a local sidewalk ranking system that identifies needed sidewalk projects and ranks
             them on a series of measurable criteria. Projects would be built as funding sources become
             available.

4.6   Transit

      The LARTP does not include recommendations for new mass transit service into the study area or
      local transit service within the study area. As the area continues to grow and the roadway system
      continues to develop, some transit along major corridors may be viable. The Steering Committee
      agreed that the most effective transit solution may be development of park-and-ride lots in targeted
      commercial areas within the study area to connect commuters to the Charlotte metro area and its
      various existing and planned mass transit options. The mechanism for developing these park-and-
      ride lots is detailed in Section 5 (Land Use Policies and Ordinances).




                                                      56
                                                                                                           5

      Transportation systems are built to provide opportunities for the movement of people and vehicles
      from one destination to another. The manner in which land is developed and designed along
      transportation routes plays a critical role in the effectiveness and efficiency of the transportation
      system. And the reverse is also true ­ the design and development of transportation systems affect
      land use patterns and the quality and character of developed areas and in turn directly affect quality
      of life.

5.1   Considering the Linkage Between Land Use and Transportation Planning

      One of the steps in the LARTP planning process has been to assess the linkage between transportation
      and land use planning in the western Union County study area and to identify ways to better
      coordinate planning efforts to achieve the desired goals in western Union County: decrease road
      congestion, provide safer roads and intersections, maintain rural character, provide safe routes for
      bicyclists, pedestrians, and others.

      The ways in which the four towns and the county develop their land directly impacts the local
      transportation network, including roadways and alternative modes such as transit, cycling, and
      walking. For example, development along NC 16/Providence Road, when combined with the high
      volume of through trips, has led to a decrease in the level of service along this corridor, particularly
      creating congestion during peak commuting hours. The land use plans of the four participating
      municipalities have played and will continue to play a critical role in determining the future
      transportation needs within the LARTP study area. These land use plans are discussed in this
      chapter.

      This chapter also provides a look outside of the study area to other North Carolina communities that
      have experienced similar growth and transportation issues. In particular, the transportation and land
      use planning efforts in Matthews, Huntersville, Cary and Charlotte, North Carolina, were reviewed
      to learn about the planning strategies in place in these communities and the lessons they have learned
      from implementation.

      Considering the current and future conditions of the LARTP planning area, the lessons learned from
      similarly situated North Carolina communities, and the implementation tools feasible for



                                                        57
      implementing this planning effort, this chapter goes on to provide recommendations for ordinance
      amendments for the four LARTP jurisdictions. This includes model ordinance language provided in
      the appendix to this plan. For consistency of planning and implementation in this local area, it is
      recommended that these standards should be as consistent as possible throughout the planning area.

5.2   Land Use Planning in the Study Area

      Union County has been one of the fastest growing counties in the state and the nation over the last
      decade. And much of that growth has taken place within this study area. The table below shows
      available population estimates for 1990, 2000, and 2007 for the four participating LARTP
      municipalities and Union County as a whole. Each municipality has seen steady population growth
      since 1990.

              **Accurate population estimates for 2007 for these municipalities are not currently available. The upcoming
              census will establish more accurate population figures for tracking growth.


      Growth has slowed in recent years due to infrastructure constraints in Union County and the national
      economic downturn, but is expected to continue into the future. As illustrated in figures 10 and 11
      shown previously, population growth is expected to occur throughout the study area with a focus
      along the NC-16 corridor in the Town of Waxhaw, north of Waxhaw Marvin Road near the state
      border, and south of Old Waxhaw Monroe Road at the southeast corner of the study area.
      Employment is expected to be focused along NC-16 within Waxhaw, along with a small pocket of
      employment along NC-84 between Twelve Mile Creek and Deal Roads.

      To prepare for future growth, all four communities have prepared plans to establish community
      visions, set goals for guiding new development, address needs for new infrastructure, and improve
      the character and quality of life in each respective community.

           The Town of Weddington adopted its Land Use Plan in 2002. The plan articulates the varied
           interests within the community and sets out a series of community goals, including planning
           for new low-density single-family residences and subdivisions, protecting open spaces and
           rural character within the community, and coordinating with neighboring jurisdictions on
           future infrastructure needs.

           The Village of Marvin adopted its Land Use Plan in 2004. Goals of the plan include
           maintaining its small town character and low-density land use pattern, preserving open spaces,
           providing new opportunities for recreation, and planning for community-oriented commercial
           developments to serve Village residents. The plan calls for the future Village Center to be



                                                                  58
           located in the vicinity of the existing Town Hall on New Town Road between Marvin Road and
           Marvin School Road.

           Wesley Chapel adopted its 2030 Vision Master Plan in 2008. The goals of the plan focus on
           protecting rural character, focusing more intense development with new housing options
           around a new Village Center to serve as the "heart of the community", and maintaining the
           rural character in the outer areas of the community through lower density subdivision designs.

           The Town of Waxhaw adopted its 2030 Comprehensive Plan in 2009. The plan sets a course
           for creating a more compact development form, increasing housing choices, coordinating the
           provision of new infrastructure with new development and population growth, increasing
           transportation options (bicycle, pedestrian, and transit), focusing commercial development
           within the heart of the community (downtown), improving community access to parks,
           greenways, and open spaces, and participating in regional coordination for infrastructure.

           Union County is also preparing a Comprehensive Plan. This plan acknowledges and plans for
           development around the municipalities and along major transportation corridors, such as
           Highway 74 and the future Highway 74 Bypass, and seeks to protect rural and lower density
           residential areas in the remainder of the county.

      As map on the next page illustrates, the future land use plans for the four towns and Union County
      set out a course for a predominantly low-density residential land use pattern surrounding small town
      centers within the study area. The majority of the denser development is likely to occur in and
      around the Town of Waxhaw where more dense development patterns already exist and where the
      new Waxhaw Comprehensive Plan encourages new development.

5.3   Community Case Studies

      There are communities in North Carolina that have experienced similar growth pressures and land
      use/transportation planning needs as western Union County. The Steering Committee for the LARTP
      selected three high growth municipalities that have undertaken proactive planning approaches in the
      last decade (Cary, Huntersville, and Matthews, North Carolina) and one model road corridor (Ardrey
      Kell Road in Charlotte, North Carolina) to investigate and ask the following four questions:

           How have these communities managed impending growth?

           How do they plan for and fund infrastructure needs?

           How do they address the land use / transportation nexus?

           Have they been successful at accommodating growth and maintaining community character?

      These case studies take a look at high-growth communities that are working to preserve their historic
      small town and rural character while accommodating new development and necessary transportation
      infrastructure improvements. Plans and ordinances from these communities were reviewed and
      planners from each community were interviewed. A summary of these findings is provided here and
      the full case study report is found in the appendix.

           Planning Coordination with Neighboring Jurisdictions. Each community interviewed
           worked closely with neighboring jurisdictions to coordinate land use planning, adopt



                                                       59
Figure 24: Municipal and County Land Use Plans
    Western Union County Local Area Regional Transportation Plan
annexation agreements, and develop infrastructure improvement plans. This was a common
theme across these communities and a necessity for planning success.

Implementing Plans into Ordinances. The Town of Huntersville has developed twelve small
area plans focused around key corridor areas. These small area plans are drafted in such a
manner that they can be directly implemented into the local zoning ordinance following
adoption of the plan. The Town of Cary has also implemented key land use policies by revising
residential zoning in rural areas to ensure rural character through density and design
provisions. The Town of Matthews has the authority from the North Carolina General
Assembly to use conditional zoning. This tool allows the local government and planners to
uphold local land use policies by working with developers to develop solutions to site specific
issues that may not be addressed directly in the zoning and subdivision ordinances.

Focus Land Use Planning Along Key Corridors. One way to ensure the coordination of
transportation and land use planning is to focus planning efforts along key corridors.
Matthews has developed a highway overlay zone for NC-51 to establish consistent access
management, streetscape, landscaping, land use, and parking standards along this developing
corridor. Huntersville uses the small area planning process and focuses on key growth
corridors.

Use of Official Maps. All three communities ensure the coordination of their transportation
plans and land use plans through official maps, including official zoning and thoroughfare
maps. Matthews actually depicts thoroughfare plans on its official zoning map to reinforce the
connections.

The Importance of Connectivity. These communities stressed the importance of creating
connected communities. Matthews is currently working through its Downtown Master
Planning effort to retroactively create more connectivity in downtown by developing new
intersections and connecting roads. Huntersville uses traditional town planning principles that
organize centers of development around existing and planned road and transit infrastructure,
ensuring internal and external connectivity to activity centers and residential areas.

Commitment to Planning. Given the growth challenges facing each of these communities, a
commitment to planning is critical to achieving success. Huntersville hired a transportation
planner and a liaison planner that works across the land use and transportation departments to
ensure consistency of planning efforts. The Town creates an annual list of priority
transportation improvement projects, including sidewalks and bikeways, and uses local general
funds and bonds to fund projects. Cary and Matthews have also used general funds and bonds
to fund local transportation projects and to provide bridge funding to the North Carolina
Department of Transportation for state initiated projects needing funding assistance.

Private Investments in Transportation Infrastructure.         Huntersville has adopted a
Transportation Impact Assessment ordinance that establishes transportation level of service
standards and a process for developments meeting a certain threshold to assess impacts on the
transportation system and mitigate those impacts through infrastructure improvements or
others means. The town designed the Ordinance to not only ensure that transportation impacts
were addressed before developments were completed, but also uses it as a tool to guide




                                           61
           development to targeted areas. Cary has adopted an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that
           requires that adequate public transportation facilities are in place to service a new development
           before it is constructed. The town also uses developer impact fees to pay for development of
           new water/sewer and transportation infrastructure.

           Standards for Design. Huntersville has adopted design guidelines that interpret plans and
           guide developers in designing for street connectivity, streetscape improvements, building and
           parking placement and orientation, and other design factors. Cary's zoning ordinance includes
           standards for rural collectors and rural thoroughfares to ensure that roads in rural areas are
           more in keeping with the agricultural and rural context. The Ardrey Kell Road in Charlotte
           was designed to provide "complete streets" within a rural and suburban development context,
           including sidewalks, wide development setbacks in rural areas, build-to lines in more densely
           developed areas, and internally accessed commercial sites to ensure road capacity through
           managed access.

      There is much to learn from communities that have been through similar growth periods. These
      ideas, combined with examination of the current policy and regulatory framework in Western Union
      County, can help create a foundation for coordinated land use planning.

5.4   Ordinance Review

      Land use ordinances are one of the most powerful tools that local governments have to shape future
      growth and development within their community. These zoning and subdivision ordinances
      provide specific standards for new development and redevelopment, and typically guide the amount
      of land that can be developed on a site, uses for the site, required site improvements, and design
      features.

      Marvin, Weddington, and Wesley Chapel each have individual sets of zoning and subdivision
      regulations. Waxhaw combines them into a unified development ordinance. Each community
      individually uses these ordinances to guide development. These four sets of regulations share some
      commonalities, but are generally lacking in consistency in terms of the types of standards and specific
      requirements. Key recommendations for implementation of the LARTP are to improve land use
      regulations within the key transportation corridors that serve and connect the municipalities, and to
      achieve more consistency in regulations among the jurisdictions for the rules that apply to each of
      these corridors.

      Following are descriptions of the transportation related land use regulations that are currently in
      place for the four participating western Union County municipalities. Table 8 at the end of this
      section summarizes these ordinance provisions.

      Marvin

5.5   Policy Recommendations

      Based on the lessons learned from other communities, including the case studies described above,
      and review of best planning practices for rural high growth communities, a list of land use planning
      principles and policy recommendations follows.

      The following principles are suggested here as key components of a transportation strategy for this
      study area. Policy recommendations are offered for consideration under each principle.

           Retain the rural and small town character of towns and villages through managed
           development. The municipalities should continue to undertake managed development
           approaches that allow the village/town to provide for expected new growth and development
           over the next 20 years while maintaining the rural nature and character of western Union
           County. Non-residential developments should be located and designed in a manner that
           upholds the rural character of the area.

           Ensure that public infrastructure improvements (such as transportation improvements and
           extension of water and sewer services) are consistent with future land use plans.
           Development of new roads and sewer infrastructure can be a trigger for additional growth and
           development. Adoption of Capital Improvement Plans that take a long-term approach to
           capital improvements at the local level and agreements with Union County regarding the
           extension of public services are two tools that can help ensure coordination of public
           improvements with local land use goals and policies.

           Guide development of new commercial and employment centers to locations that can
           maximize the existing roadway capacity, provide better accessibility to services and goods to
           local residents, encourage alternative transportation (pedestrian, bicycle, and future
           bus/transit) access to the development, and maintain the rural character of western Union
           County. A common pattern in the LARTP study area is to develop commercial businesses and
           retail centers along the major transportation corridors, particularly along NC-16. Traffic
           congestion is a daily occurrence because this road is used both for regional commuting into
           Charlotte as well as for local trips to commercial centers. Providing retail opportunities in
           specific centers, such as the planned Wesley Chapel Village Center can alleviate traffic demand
           on NC 16 and other roads while also creating better accessibility to goods and services for
           residents.    Commercial and employment centers should be designed at a scale that is in
           keeping with the character of the municipality and, to the extent possible, should be designed to
           encourage use of any future bus/transit service that may be provided within the study area in
           the future.

           Encourage development of master planned commercial/employment centers. Centers should
           be designed as "campuses" that integrate the development of multiple uses and structures into
           a cohesive framework, provide for multi-modal access to centers and between uses within
           centers, manage access to and from adjoining thoroughfares, and provide buffers between
           adjacent uses.

           Provide pedestrian and bicycle accessibility within and between adjoining neighborhoods.
           Residents of western Union County have expressed interest in having additional opportunities
           for walking, biking, and general recreation in close proximity to their homes. New

            developments should be designed to provide internal accessibility for multiple modes of
            transportation throughout the development, and particularly to points of interests, such as
            parks and schools.

            Protect rural open spaces. Protecting undeveloped farmlands and open spaces through private
            conservation easements or public acquisition of lands are two tools for ensuring that rural
            character is truly protected in western Union County.

      These should be considered by all four municipalities and Union County when updating land use
      and comprehensive plans in the LARTP study area.

5.6   Ordinance Recommendations

      In addition to adoption of policies and land use plans to guide decision-making and influence the
      form of new development and redevelopment within the study area, some of the land use ­
      transportation objectives of this initiative can be accomplished through regulatory requirements.
      Following is a table that summarizes potential ordinance provisions and model ordinances
      recommended for consideration.


                                            Table 9: Recommended Ordinance Provisions

                      Ordinance Provision                                            Summary Description
       1. Definitions of Roads                          Define characteristics of various classifications of roadways, such as
                                                        arterial, collector, and local streets, mirroring the classification system in the
                                                        LARTP.
                                                        E.g.: "In accordance with the Local Area Regional Transportation Plan
       2. Transportation Purpose Statement              developed in collaboration with and adopted by the Village of Marvin, the
                                                        Town of Waxhaw, the Town of Weddington, and the Village of Wesley Chapel
                                                        on <date>, the provisions of this section are intended to ensure: (a) an
                                                        integrated system of roads that provides safe and efficient traffic
                                                        circulation; (b) the efficient movement of through traffic by providing an
                                                        interconnected system of roads; (c) uncomplicated road layouts so that
                                                        emergency service personnel, public service personnel and visitors can find
                                                        their way to and from destinations; and (d) controlled access to
                                                        thoroughfares."
       3. ROW Dedication Provisions                     Require dedication of right-of-way, either new or expansion, for all new
                                                        residential and non-residential development, as called for in LARTP cross-
                                                        sections.
       4. TIA Threshold, Process, Information           Requires development of a Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) for
       Requriements                                     subdivisions and all other development proposals for which 100 peak hour
                                                        trips are generated by the proposed development. The municipality has
                                                        options for the TIA procedures: (1) the applicant prepares the TIA and
                                                        submits the TIA with the development application and (if necessary) pays a
                                                        fee to the municipality for review of the TIA, or (2) the municipality estimates
                                                        the cost to develop and review the TIA for a particular application, the
                                                        applicant pays the TIA fee, and municipality arranges for preparation and
                                                        review. TIAs should project additions to average daily trips and peak hour
                                                        trips, estimate current and projected levels of service (LOS), include
                                                        roadway improvement and right-of-way dedication needs that comply with
                                                        cross-sections in the LARTP, and consider non-automobile modes, including
                                                        bicycle, pedestrian, and transit needs.
       5. Incorporation/Reference of Street Cross-      Incorporates the cross sections from the LARTP for various street types,
       Sections in Ordinance                            including public right-of-way, number of lanes, lane width, planting
                                                        requirements, sidewalks, etc.) within the ordinance. This provision can also
                                                        be implemented by reference to the LARTP cross-sections.

 6. Access Management, Driveway Spacing and    Addresses access management, driveway spacing, and connectivity
 Non-Residential Connectivity                  requirements.
 7. Bicycle and Parking Amenities              Require bike racks to serve bicycle commuters for developments of a
                                               certain threshold and encourages development of additional bicycle
                                               facilities, such as on-site shower facilities.
 8. Parking Fund Payments-in-Lieu              This provision includes an option for new developments to substitute
                                               payments into a parking fund for provision of some or all required off-street
                                               parking, with funds to be used to help fund improvements such as park-and-
                                               ride lots. These types of provisions are often used in downtowns and town
                                               center areas.
 9. Transit-Oriented Development Standards     Model ordinances to provide examples for implementation of transit-
                                               oriented development districts and standards, such as minimum densities,
                                               transit-friendly building design/orientation, and walkways/bikeways in
                                               designated transit-oriented locations.
 10. Transportation Management Plan            Model ordinance requires all non-residential developments to provide
 Requirements                                  employer-sponsored and managed Transportation Management Plans
                                               (TMP), to encourage employees and patrons to walk, bike, and take transit
                                               instead of relying on automobiles for mobility. Similar provisions could also
                                               be adopted to specify a threshold (e.g., developments that will employ 100
                                               or more employees) that would trigger requirements for TMPs.



Sample ordinance language for each of these suggested provisions is included in Appendix C.
Achieving consistency among the jurisdictions for regulatory treatment of land use and roadway
corridors that traverse multiple communities is most important in the following areas:

                              Definitions of roads
                              Cross-section and ROW requirements
                              Traffic Impact Analysis required information
                              Access management provisions

Each of the four communities needs to determine which of these provisions is acceptable to include in
the regulatory array for that community.

                            How We're Going To Get There



6.1   The Key: Implementation

      One of the primary purposes of developing the LARTP was to give the four member communities the
      information, data, and plans to effectively solve today's problems and plan for tomorrow's. The
      recommendations in the previous section go a long way toward accomplishing this end. But those
      recommendations would be relatively worthless without an effective tool to implement them. The
      Implementation Plan in this section creates a unified and comprehensive approach to working on
      these problems both as a group of communities with common issues and as local communities
      planning for local needs.



6.2   Funding

      The LARTP is a long-range plan with a variety of projects which will be implemented over time
      through use of various funding options. While some of the large-scale projects will be constructed
      with federal and state funds distributed through the regional planning process, others will be built
      with local funds and through cooperation with the development community.

              Transportation Improvement Program (TIP): The state's Transportation Improvement Program
              supports local and regionally significant transportation projects through funding sources that
              include Federal Aid Construction Funds and State Construction Funds.
              Transportation Bonds: Transportation bonds are a traditional funding mechanism for local
              communities throughout North Carolina. Voters in communities of all sizes vote to improve
              their transportation system through self-assessment.
              NCDOT Division Funds: Each of the NCDOT division offices has discretionary funds to make
              transportation improvements for small-scale projects. Each of the four LARTP member
              communities has taken advantage of these funds, which are good sources of funding for
              projects like intersection improvements and access management projects.
              Developer Contributions: It is common for the development community to make contributions
              or construct improvements as part of the development approval process. While developers




                                                       71
             of new projects are typically not responsible for fixing existing deficiencies, they can help
             mitigate the potential impacts on the transportation system by their development.
             State Street-Aid (Powell Bill) Funds: Annually, state street-aid (Powell Bill) allocations are made
             to eligible and qualified incorporated municipalities. Powell Bill funds are used only for
             maintaining, repairing, constructing, reconstructing or widening of local streets that are the
             responsibility of the municipalities, or for planning, construction, and maintenance of
             bikeways or sidewalks along public streets and highways.
             Enhancement Grants and Congestion Management and Air Quality (CMAQ) Funds: These two
             funding sources are applicable to a variety of project types, but can be especially beneficial
             when applied to bicycle and pedestrian projects, greenway development, and beautification
             and streetscape enhancement projects.
             Other Funding Sources: These may include federal stimulus funds (may not be available in the
             long-term), impact fees (not currently widely used in North Carolina), and funds from non-
             profit or private organizations (such as Active Living By Design) intended to support planning
             and development of non-vehicular transportation systems. Other sources also include
             county-wide sales taxes, land transfer taxes, and targeted programs such as Safe Routes to
             School.

6.3   Implementation Plan

      Implementation Plan - Improvements
      The Implementation Plan on the following pages is the blueprint for making the various
      recommended improvements detailed in the LARTP. As shown in the Implementation Plan, some
      projects will require coordination among jurisdictions as well as coordination with regional
      transportation planning partners. Others are projects that will likely be part of future development
      proposals. And still others are projects that will be locally-determined and developed. The
      implementation plan for roadway projects is detailed in Table 10 and for intersections in Table 11.

      Implementation Plan ­ Policies and Regulations
      Section 5 identifies policy and ordinance changes that would promote mobility within this study area
      through land use policies and regulations. In addition to pursuing funding for roadway and
      intersection improvements as recommended above, the four participating municipalities should
      consider two additional areas for action:
         ·   Policy Statements: The municipalities should consider adopting policies to serve as guides to
             decision-making. One good way to do that would be to select policies from those offered in
             Section 5 and incorporate those into local municipal land use plans via amendment of those
             plans.

         ·   Ordinance Amendments: Section 5 offers a series of regulatory approaches to land use
             management that could be incorporated into local municipal zoning and subdivision
             ordinances. Appendix 3 offers specific model language that could be built into local
             ordinances.

Notes:
1. Mar = Marvin; Wax = Waxhaw; Wed = Weddington; WCh = Wesley Chapel; ** = Primary jurisdiction affected by improvements; * = Secondary jurisdiction affected by improvements
2. Since many projects cross multiple jurisdictions and may involve multiple funding sources, cooperation among municipalities, Union County, and the NCDOT will be critical. This is especially important as the recommended cross-sections are applied in
different jurisdictions within the same project. To the extent feasible, similar cross-sections, treatments, and other roadway and intersection facilities should be standardized within project limits.
3. Projects are not ranked within priority levels.

Appendix C: Possible Ordinance Provisions,
                               Provisions, Draft Sample Language,
                                                        Language,
and Model Ordinances Related to Transportation Management
The following possible ordinance provisions are intended to serve as a menu of options from which the LARTP
communities can choose from in updating their ordinances as part of the LARTP implementation. While the
four communities share many community character traits, each community has a unique development context
and may require tailored solutions. The options provided in this appendix are intended to serve as a starting
point for updating local ordinances. Model ordinance language provided here will need to be revised to fit the
specific context of individual ordinances and development contexts.

The information provided in this appendix comes in two forms: draft model ordinance language and example
model ordinances. For those provisions which are likely to be dealt with in a similar way among the four
communities, model ordinance language has been provided in the first section. The second section addresses
development issues that will likely require language crafted for each specific community context. For these
issues, examples of model ordinances that have been adopted in other communities are provided and serve as
a starting point for updating the development ordinances of the LARTP communities.

MODEL ORDINANCE PROVISIONS

1. Definitions of Roads
This provision defines characteristics of various classifications of roadways, such as major and minor
thoroughfares, collectors, and local streets, mirroring the classification system in the LARTP. A description of
the intent of the roadway classifications, including the character and nature of the road types, should be
included in this ordinance provision.

Sample Language
        Language
The characteristics, cross-sections, definitions, and classifications of roadways shall be as designated in the
Local Area Regional Transportation Plan, as adopted by the municipality.

In addition, local ordinances can include the specific definitions of these road classifications within the
"Definitions" section of the development ordinance.

2. Transportation Purpose Statement
This provision states the reason, intent, and justification for regulations that are to follow.

Sample Language
In accordance with the Local Area Regional Transportation Plan developed in collaboration with and adopted
by the Village of Marvin, the Town of Waxhaw, the Town of Weddington, and the Village of Wesley Chapel on
<date>, the provisions of this section are intended to ensure: (a) an integrated system of roads that provides
safe and efficient traffic circulation; (b) the efficient movement of through traffic by providing an
interconnected system of roads; (c) uncomplicated road layouts so that emergency service personnel, public
service personnel and visitors can find their way to and from destinations; and (d) controlled access to
thoroughfares.

3. Right-
   Right-of-
         of-Way Dedication Provisions
This provision requires dedication of public right-of-way, either new or expanded, for all new residential and
non-residential development, as called for in LARTP cross-sections.

Sample Language
Where a proposed development application includes any part of a street or thoroughfare, or includes frontage
on a designated street or thoroughfare as indicated on Figure 15: Highway Map of the Local Area Regional
Transportation Plan, right-of-way shall be dedicated in the location and configuration shown and described for
that classification of roadway in Figures 21 and 21b of the Local Area Regional Transportation Plan. This



Appendix C                                      Page 1 of 9                                              LARTP
right-of-way area shall be as measured from the centerline of the existing or proposed street or thoroughfare.
Any yard setbacks applicable to the development shall be measured from the boundary line that divides the
parcel and the dedicated right-of-way.

4. Transportation Impact Analysis (Threshold, Process, Information Requirements)
This provision requires development of a Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) for subdivisions and all other
development proposals for which 100 peak hour trips are generated by the proposed development. The
municipality has options for the TIA procedures: (1) the applicant prepares the TIA and submits the TIA with the
development application and (if necessary) pays a fee to the municipality for review of the TIA, or (2) the
municipality estimates the cost to develop and review the TIA for a particular application, the applicant pays
the TIA fee, and municipality arranges for preparation and review. TIAs should project additions to average
daily trips and peak hour trips, estimate current and projected levels of service (LOS), include roadway
improvement and right-of-way dedication needs that comply with cross-sections in the LARTP, and consider
non-automobile modes, including bicycle, pedestrian, and transit needs.

Sample Language

        (A)      Applicability

                 (1)      TIA Required for Development Generating Over One Hundred Peak Hour Trips
                          A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be required for any proposed development or
                          multiple phases of development (i.e., contiguous tracts under the same ownership)
                          anticipated to generate more than one hundred (100) peak hour directional trips.
                          Peak hour trips shall be measured as defined in the most recent edition of the
                          Institute of Transportation Engineer's Trip Generation Manual.

                 (2)      Redevelopment
                          In the case of redevelopment, trip generation will be defined as the number of net
                          new trips generated by the proposed use beyond the trips generated by the previous
                          use.

                 (3)      Exemptions
                          For projects that are not estimated to generate more than one hundred (100) peak
                          hour directional trips, TIA requirements can be waived upon providing a brief
                          technical memorandum to the municipality describing the reasons why the TIA should
                          not be required, including projections of peak hour trips, street capacity issues (LOS),
                          and other issues relevant to the exemption.

        (B)      TIA Submission for Projects with Cumulative Impacts
                 A TIA shall be required for development projects that do not otherwise meet the thresholds for
                 submission of a TIA if the application is for a project that:

                 (1)      Shares Features with Other Developments
                          Shares features such as site access, common ownership, or other infrastructure with
                          nearby undeveloped property for which future development can be reasonably
                          anticipated;

                 (2)      Can be Expected to Exceed Threshold
                          When complete, the cumulative impact of the overall development can be expected
                          to exceed the threshold for preparation of a TIA; and

                 (3)      Localized Safety or Capacity Conditions
                          A TIA may also be required for projects with at least one of the following
                          characteristics:




Appendix C                                    Page 2 of 9                                                  LARTP
                    (a)     The project is located in the vicinity of a high accident location per Figures 7
                            and 8 in the adopted Local Area Regional Transportation Plan;
                    (b)     The project abuts a major thoroughfare;
                    (c)     The project includes highway improvements that are in the Transportation
                            Improvement Program; or
                    (d)     When involvement with an active roadway construction project is necessary.

       (C)   Procedure

             (1)    The TIA shall be submitted along with applications for a Preliminary Plat for
                    Subdivision, Major Site Plan, Planned Development, Rezoning, and Conditional Use
                    Permit. [Alternate: The municipality shall prepare or have prepared a written Traffic
                    Impact Analysis for applicable projects, with cost of preparation of analysis and/or
                    review of the TIA made a component of the development application fee.]

             (2)    The applicant shall be required to participate in a pre-submittal conference with the
                    municipality and the engineering firm preparing the TIA to establish the study area,
                    trip distribution, traffic counts, approved developments in the area, pass-by and
                    internal capture percentages, and any other questions specific to the TIA. The
                    municipality may choose to not accept TIAs prepared without a pre-submittal
                    conference.

             (3)    The TIA shall, at a minimum:

                    (a)     Estimate the Traffic Generated
                                                  Generated
                            Estimate the peak hour traffic that will be generated as a result of the
                            proposed development. Trips should be estimated for all uses located within
                            the development using the standard Institute of Transportation Engineer's
                            Trip Generation Manual, including pass-by trips, internal trip assumptions,
                            and trip distribution assumptions;

                    (b)     Evaluate Site Access
                            Evaluate site access, sight distance, and internal circulation;

                    (c)     Evaluate Existing Capacity
                            Evaluate the ability of the street network to support the proposed
                            development;

                    (d)     Identify Specific Improvements
                            Identify specific improvements to the street network that are necessary in
                            order to support the traffic anticipated to be generated by the proposed
                            development and any adjacent areas being analyzed, such as intersection
                            improvements, signalization, turning lanes, etc.;

                    (e)     Identify Non-
                                     Non-Automobile Modes
                            Identify specific improvements or facilities provided for bicyclists and
                            pedestrians to support non-vehicular access and access to and within the
                            proposed project; and

                    (f)     Recommendations for Improvements

5. Incorporation/Reference of Street Cross-
                                     Cross-Sections in Ordinance
This provision incorporates the cross sections from the LARTP for various street types, including public right-of-
way, number of lanes, lane width, planting requirements, sidewalks, etc.) within the ordinance. This provision
can also be implemented by reference to the LARTP cross-sections.

Sample Language
Proposed developments adjoining an area within which Figure 15: Highway Map, in the adopted Local Area
Regional Transportation Plan (hereinafter referred to as "LARTP") recommends improvements to an existing
road or development of a new street are required to reserve public right-of-way consistent with the detailed
cross-sections for the subject street type per Figures 21 and 21b in the LARTP and may be required to make
improvements, if deemed appropriate.


6. Access Management, Driveway Spacing and Non-
                                           Non-Residential Development Connectivity
This provision addresses access management, driveway spacing, and connectivity requirements.

Sample Language

        (A)      Driveway Spacing and Access Management Standards
                 Driveway spacing and access management standards shall be required for developments
                 adjoining major and minor thoroughfares and shall be consistent with the North Carolina
                 Department of Transportation's Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina




Appendix C                                    Page 4 of 9                                                  LARTP
             Highways, July 2003. [The municipality is not limited by the Policy on Street and Driveway
             Access to North Carolina Highways and may choose to exceed these standards.]

       (B)   External Street Connectivity

             (1)     The arrangement of streets in a development shall provide for the alignment and
                     continuation of existing or proposed streets into adjoining lands in those cases in
                     which the adjoining lands are undeveloped and could possibly be developed in the
                     future or in which the adjoining lands are developed and include opportunities for
                     such connections.

             (2)     Street rights-of-way shall be extended to or along adjoining property boundaries such
                     that a roadway connection or street stub shall be provided for development at least
                     every one thousand-five hundred (1,500) feet for each direction (north, south, east,
                     and west) in which development abuts undeveloped lands.

             (3)     At all locations where streets terminate with no street connection, but a future
                     connection is planned or accommodated, a sign shall be installed at the location with
                     the words "FUTURE ROAD CONNECTION" to inform property owners.

             (4)     Stub street terminations shall be designed to allow for adequate emergency vehicle
                     access, including adequate turning radii required per local fire department standards
                     for vehicular access.

             (5)     The Final Plat for Subdivision shall identify all stub streets and include a notation that
                     all street stubs are intended for connection with future streets on adjoining
                     undeveloped property.

       (C)   Access to Individual Lots

             (1)     Access to Thoroughfares (Major and Minor)
                     Individual lots abutting major and minor thoroughfares are encouraged to achieve
                     access through the use of shared driveways, alleyways, or parallel access streets.
                     Direct access onto major and minor thoroughfares from individual lots with lot
                     frontages of less than 300 feet is discouraged.

             (2)     Limited Access to Collector Streets
                     Unless no alternative means of access exists, such as alleys or parallel access
                     streets, and it is unreasonable or impractical to require an alternative means of
                     access, direct driveway access to collector streets shall be limited to lots containing
                     multiple family dwellings, commercial, and industrial and related uses, provided that
                     driveway separation of two hundred (200) linear feet or more per street side is
                     maintained.

       (D)   Sidewalks

             (1)     Internal Pedestrian Access
                     All multi-family, public and institutional, commercial, and industrial and related uses
                     shall provide at least one (1) improved internal pedestrian access to connect all new
                     buildings to existing or planned sidewalks in the adjacent public right-of-way.

7. Bicycle Amenities
This provision requires bike racks to serve bicycle commuters for developments of a certain threshold and
encourages development of additional bicycle facilities, such as on-site shower facilities, and bicycle-friendly
drain grates.

Sample Language

        (A)      Bicycle Parking Requirement
                 All developments containing surface parking areas with 35 or more spaces shall provide
                 bicycle parking facilities, which shall comply with the following standards:

                 (1)     Bicycle parking spaces shall be conveniently located, but in no case shall such
                         facilities be located farther than 100 linear feet from the primary building entrance;

                 (2)     Bicycle parking spaces shall be provided at the following rates:

                         (a)      One bicycle parking space per every ten off-street parking spaces within
                                  downtown and town center districts;

                         (b)      One bicycle parking space per every 20 off-street parking spaces in all other
                                  districts; and

                 (3)     Bicycle facilities shall include a rack or other device to enable bicycles to be secured;
                         and

                 (4)      All non-residential developments are encouraged to provide shower facilities for
                          building users at the rate of 0.2% shower stalls per building occupant as measured at
                          peak building activity periods.
        (B)      Drain Grates
                 Per FHWA guidelines, care must be taken to ensure that drainage grates are bicycle-safe. If
                 not, a bicycle wheel may fall into a slot in the grate, causing the bicyclist to fall. Replacing
                 existing grates with bicycle-safe grates (see A and B in figure below, preferred methods) or
                 welding thin metal straps across the grate perpendicular to the direction of travel (see C in
                 figure below, alternate method) is required. These should be checked periodically to ensure
                 that the straps remain in place.




                                            Source: Oregon Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan

                 Note that grates with bars perpendicular to the roadway must not be placed at curb cuts, as
                 wheelchairs could get caught in the slots. The most effective way to avoid drainage grate
                 problems is to eliminate them entirely with the use of inlets in the curb face (see figure
                 below). If a street-surface grate is required for drainage, care must be taken to ensure that
                 the grate is flush with the road surface. Inlets should be raised after a pavement overlay to
                 within 6 mm (0.25 in) of the new surface. If this is not possible or practical, the pavement
                 must taper into drainage inlets so they do not cause an abrupt edge at the inlet.

8. Parking Fund Payments-
                Payments-in-
                         in-Lieu
This provision includes an option for new developments to substitute payments into a parking fund for
provision of some or all required off-street parking, with funds to be used to help fund improvements such as
park-and-ride lots. These types of provisions are often used in downtowns and town center areas.

Sample Language
Upon proposal by an applicant, the municipality may determine that a payment-in-lieu of providing required
parking is an appropriate form of compliance with the off-street parking standards in this ordinance. When a
payment-in-lieu is identified as an option, the payment amount shall be proportional to the cost of land and
construction required to produce the required number of parking spaces. Payments so made to the
municipality shall be used for constructing transportation-related improvements in the municipality.




MODEL ORDINANCES

9. Transit-
   Transit-Oriented Development Standards
The following model ordinances provide examples for implementation of transit-oriented development districts
and standards, such as minimum densities, transit-friendly building design/orientation, and
walkways/bikeways in designated transit-oriented locations.

Summary of Ordinance
             Ordinance Provision
Chapel Hill, North Carolina has adopted a zoning district to be applied in areas intended for transit-oriented
development (TOD). Land uses in the district are to be designed in a manner that reinforces transit use
through increased densities, limit conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles, provide pedestrian amenities,
and generally support transit use.

The TOD District is separated into two sub-districts:

      Transit-Oriented Development Core (TOD-C) can be designated in areas where 50% of the land area
      within the proposed district lies within ¼ mile of a transit station or bus boarding location.

      Transit-Oriented Development Periphery (TOD-P) can be designated in areas between ¼ and ½ mile of a
      transit station or bus boarding location as long as it adjoins an area designated as TOD-C.

See the following link for the full TOD ordinance.

Huntersville, North Carolina, has adopted zoning districts for Transit-Oriented Development-Residential (TOD-R)
and Transit-Oriented Development-Employment (TOD-E). The TOD-R district is established to support higher
density residential communities that include a mix of retail, restaurant, service, and small employment uses
within a pedestrian village format. The TOD-E is established to accommodate general office uses and offices
support services in a pedestrian setting. Specific uses are allowed and allowed through a special use permit in
each district according to the use's compatibility with the districts. Specific site design, block structure,
parking, floor area ratios, and other design aspects are outlined in the ordinance.

See the following link for the full TOD ordinance.

10. Transportation Management Plan Requirements
This model ordinance requires all non-residential developments to provide employer-sponsored and managed
Transportation Management Plans (TMP), to encourage employees and patrons to walk, bike, and take transit
instead of relying on automobiles for mobility. Similar provisions could also be adopted to specify a threshold
(e.g., developments that will employ 100 or more employees) that would trigger requirements for TMPs .




Appendix C                                   Page 8 of 9                                                LARTP
Summary of Ordinance Provision
The Town of Chapel Hill requires a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) be developed as part of all non-
residential development proposals. The TMP is a stipulation of the Special Use Permit or Site Plan approval
process and is submitted as part of the Zoning Compliance Permit. The following travel demand measures and
incentives are recommended for inclusion in Chapel Hill's TMP:

      Subsidized transit fares, distribution of transit service schedule and other information;
      Staggered work hours and flextime programs;
      Installation of bicycle racks, lockers and shower facilities to encourage people to bike or walk to work;
      Informal rideshare matching program;
      Funding for programs such as purchase of bicycles for employee use;
      Installation of bus shelters and similar amenities to enhance transit use;
      Parking management program including parking charges or designated rideshare/carpool spaces;
      Installation of transit information display and its continued maintenance; and
      Other measures: lunchroom facilities, direct deposit of paychecks, and employee use of company
      mailroom facilities.

Other options for inclusion in a Transportation Management Plan program can include:

      Carpool drop-off areas
      Shuttle service to mass transit

OVERVIEW
BACKGROUND
This is a report to the four member jurisdictions (Village of Marvin, Town of Weddington, Town of Waxhaw, and
Village of Wesley Chapel) of the Western Union County Local Area Regional Transportation Plan (LARTP) Group.
As part of one of the fastest growing counties in the country, these municipalities have undertaken a planning
effort to address the impacts of rapid growth and proactively plan for the future. Together with the Centralina
Council of Governments, the member jurisdictions of the LARTP Group have collaborated to create a unified
transportation plan for the study area (see figure to the right). The intent of the planning effort is to develop a
common framework for guiding future transportation and corresponding land use decisions within the four
jurisdictions. This effort is timely and corresponds with the update to the Union County Comprehensive Plan,
development of the Waxhaw Comprehensive Plan, and other local planning efforts.
                                                                                                                              Project Study Area
PURPOSE
One of the steps in this planning process is to assess the linkage between transportation planning and land use
planning in the study area and to identify ways to better coordinate planning efforts to achieve the desired goals in western Union County: decrease road
congestion, provide safer roads and intersections, maintain rural character, provide safe routes for bicyclists and pedestrians, and others. The way in
which the four towns and the county develop their land directly impacts the local transportation network, including roadways and alternative modes such
as transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. For example, development along NC-16/Providence Road has led to a decrease in the level of service along this
corridor, particularly during peak hours. This part of the planning process assesses different ways that these communities can manage land use to
better use the existing transportation system and identifies public and private methods to improve and enhance the system.

For this initiative, the Steering Committee chose to look outside the study area and learn from the planning practices of other communities that have
experienced similar growth and transportation issues. In particular, the committee suggested that the planning team learn more about transportation
and land use planning in Matthews, Huntersville, and Cary, North Carolina, specifically focusing on new ideas and lessons learned that could inform the
Steering Committee as it develops the implementation strategies for this planning effort. In addition, the planning team reviewed the development of the
Ardrey Kell Road Corridor in Charlotte, NC. This report provides case studies from these communities focusing on a few key questions:

   How have these communities managed impending growth?
   How do they plan for and fund transportation infrastructure needs?
   How do they address the land use / transportation nexus?
   Have they been successful at accommodating growth and maintaining community character?


The final section of this report draws upon the lessons learned from these communities and provides implementation recommendations for the Steering
Committee to consider.

MATTHEWS, NC CASE STUDY
BACKGROUND
The Town of Matthews is located in southeastern Mecklenburg County and borders the City of Charlotte, the
Town of Mint Hill, and Union County (including the Towns of Stallings and Indian Trail). As part of an agreement
each municipality in Mecklenburg County has with Charlotte, Matthews has a defined area, known as its Sphere
of Influence, from which it can annex. The town's Sphere of Influence and ETJ (extraterritorial jurisdiction)
share the same boundary, providing the town the ability to manage and plan for growth within its defined
growth area. The town also has an annexation agreement with the Town of Stallings. Through the early 1980s,
the town had predominantly relied on voluntary annexations, but by the mid-1980s it began using involuntary
annexations to incorporate complete phases of developments at a single time. Through this process the town
limits have grown substantially since 1986.

Matthews experienced a wave of growth in the 1980s and 1990s. The town's population in 1980 was 1,648.
By 2000 it grew to 22,127 and continues to grow, although at a slower rate. This growth coincided with the
location of several major employers locating in the area. The majority of land in the community is dedicated to        Matthews experienced a wave of
residential uses, with commercial and employment uses located along the main road corridors, such as                   growth in the 1980s and 1990s,
Independence Blvd/US-74, Trade Street, and Pineville-Matthews Rd/NC-51. While the town has not reached                 providing almost two decades of
full buildout, it has few remaining parcels left to develop, often with significant transportation and                     planning to learn from.
environmental constraints.

The town's land use planning is guided by its 2002 Land Use Plan. This is a policy-based plan that is implemented by amendments to the zoning
ordinance. The town has plans to develop a Future Land Use Plan in the fall of 2009 and is currently undertaking an update to its Unified Development
                                              Ordinance. Matthews recently adopted bicycle and pedestrian plans. The town adopts the MUMPOs
                                              (Mecklenburg-Union Metropolitan Planning Organization) Thoroughfare Plan as its own and uses this to
                                              guide road planning. Much of the town's current transportation planning efforts focus on creating better
                                              connectivity in developed areas, such as retrofitting downtown to provide better accessibility and mobility,
                                              improving existing roads, and providing more pedestrian and bicycle facilities.

                                                 The Land Use Plan focuses on the connection between land use and transportation planning in key
                                                 corridors. Through its zoning ordinance, the town has focused higher traffic volume commercial and
                                                 employment development to main transportation corridors. Public support is critical to these efforts. When
                                                 there was no support for the proposed Sardis-Weddington Connector because it would bisect existing
                                                 residential neighborhoods, the town built an alternative - Fullwood Road. Recently, the town has focused
                                                 attention on the transportation and land use planning along the NC-51 corridor. This corridor has rerouted

A light rail transit line paralleling the existing railroad line and connecting into Uptown Charlotte has been discussed for many years. Several studies
have been conducted for the Southeast Transit corridor. Currently, the transit planning continues and may eventually result in a new light rail line or a
BRT (bus rapid transit) line linking Matthews to Charlotte.

PLANNING PRACTICES
Matthews employs several land use planning tools that reinforce transportation planning objectives.

Special Highway Overlay Zone
To protect the traffic flow and the natural character along the NC-51 corridor, the
Town of Matthews adopted a Special Highway Overlay Zone. This zoning district acts
as an overlay on top of the base zoning districts that lie in the corridor and includes
more restrictive measures for lands within the district. The boundary for the district
is tied to the designated right-of-way as identified in the town's Thoroughfare Plan.
As the plan is updated and right-of-way is expanded, the overlay zone is also
amended. Provisions in the overlay zone include the following.                             Properties within a 50-1000 buffer of the road right-of-way along NC-51
                                                                                                are regulated by Special Highway Overlay Zone provisions.
   Natural Areas Protection. The purpose of this provision is to provide a natural
   protective buffer area on both sides of the roadway to reduce the visual impact of development in the corridor and protect natural areas. All
   properties within the overlay zone are required to have a natural buffer area along the NC-51 road frontage. This buffer, or setback, ranges from a
   30 foot to 25 foot buffer, depending upon whether it is accessed directly from the highway (30 foot) or by a service road (25 foot). All streets that
   connect to NC-51 are also required to have a 25 foot natural buffer within the overlay boundary.
   Landscaping. All non-single family developments within this area are required to develop a landscaping plan for areas within the protected buffer
   area and interior to the development. The ordinance provides specific provisions for the type, size, and location of landscaping materials that are
   used in both locations. Trees within the required protective buffer area that are of a certain type and measure either 3 caliper inches or 4 feet in
   height or greater are required to be protected. In addition, a 20 foot buffer is required of all non-residential uses abutting a residential use or
   zoned area. The landscaping must buffer the uses with at least a 75% opaque year round landscaping material. The ordinance provides specific
   options for complying with this provision.
   Access Control. Access control refers to access management. This provision limits the number of driveways and streets intersecting the road with
   the goal of having no more than one per every 500 feet. Given the fact that some parcels have less than 500 feet of road frontage, the minimum
   required distance between driveways is 200 feet. The town encourages landowners of adjacent smaller lots to develop plans to share driveways.
   In some instances, these driveways can be larger than a single driveway permit allows, depending on NC-DOT approval.
   Land Use. Land uses within the corridor are the same as those allowed under the base zoning district. Towards the center of the town, these uses
   are primarily commercial, employment and multi-family with lower-density residential uses at the periphery.
   Impervious Surface and Stormwater Management. Development within the overlay zone is limited to an impervious surface (rooftops, walkways,
   and paving) of 75%. Stormwater retention is required on all lots.
   Parking. Parking for all non-residential sites in the overlay zone has to be located to the side and rear of all principal structures. Parking cannot be
   any closer to the highway than the principal structures on the lot or 60 feet, whichever is less. Applicants can apply for exemptions and specific
   conditions for exemption are outlined in the ordinance.

Conditional Zoning
The Town of Matthews has been given the authority by the N.C. General Assembly to use conditional zoning. Under this statute, the town's zoning
ordinance can include conditional districts in which site plans and individual development conditions are imposed. Conditional zoning allows local
governments to tailor development regulations when rezoning to a more intensive land use. This zoning tool provides an opportunity for the town to
negotiate with developers to require better access management, connectivity with adjacent uses and roadways, greenways, sidewalks, road
improvements, and other features within the development.

In North Carolina, land may only be placed in a conditional zone upon petition by all landowners to be included in the rezoning. The enabling statute
limits the types of conditions that may be imposed on the new zone to (1) those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to
city or county ordinances and officially adopted plans, and (2) those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated from the
development or use of the site. To comply with N.C. statutory provisions, the local planning board must state in writing how the rezoning to a conditional
zoning district complies with the municipality's comprehensive plan and the deciding body must state
its reasons for voting to rezone to a conditional zoning district. The conditions agreed to by the
petitioning landowner(s) are then legally binding on both the landowner(s) and local government,
providing stability for the landowners' investment interests.1 Matthews has agreed to conditional
zoning for residential, business, office, and industrial zoning districts. This tool allows the town greater
flexibility in meeting their community goals as outlined in their land use, bicycle, and pedestrian plans.

Thoroughfare Plan
Once a roadway is included within the town's Thoroughfare Plan, the town can then use this plan to
require dedication of right-of-way as part of the development approval process. Existing and proposed
major and minor thoroughfares are designated on the town's zoning map to further reinforce the
importance of these roadway corridors. Using the conditional zoning process, the town can also                                               Hatch marked lines designate proposed minor

                                                                                                                                               campus in southern Matthews near I-485.
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING
Matthews has historically had political and community support to fund transportation improvements with local funding.

      Bonds. In 2004, Matthews passed a local bond referendum to allocate $5.5 million for specified road projects and $5 million for park & recreation
      projects.
      Funding Partnerships. Matthews has joined Mecklenburg County to finance development of a two mile segment of the 4-Mile Creek greenway.
      This project has been ten years in the making and will connect an elementary school, a community center, Squirrel Lake Park, Trade Street near
      Arthur Goodwin Park, and a neighborhood through the protection and enhancement of 4-mile creek stream buffers.
      Dedicated Annual Funding . For a number of years, Matthews has dedicated general fund revenues annually to construct one sidewalk project
      along a main corridor. In conjunction with sidewalks built as requirements of new development, this funding source has helped to build a network
      of sidewalks, particularly focused on filling in the gaps between sidewalk segments developed as a condition of new development.

   Tax Increment Financing (TIF). The town is now considering use of a TIF to fund road and streetscape improvements in designated areas of town.
   In addition, developers are considering using a synthetic TIF to fund property improvements. Developers would borrow against the future taxes
   paid on a property, assuming a certain property tax value in the future. This is a tool that is not used in many communities in North Carolina and
   should be fully vetted before entering into such an agreement.

LESSONS LEARNED
Three decades of land use and roadway planning in a high growth environment have led to
many lessons learned in Matthews.
   Plan now ­ implementation takes much time and effort.
   Road projects have been a stimulus for new development. Whether proposed or under
   construction, new roads and connections necessitate changes in zoning and land use
   policies to manage development and maintain levels of service.
   Start public improvement projects as soon as possible; costs will almost always increase
   the longer you wait to break ground. The main road project funded by the 2004 bond was
   stalled and is now estimated to cost more than double the original estimate.

   transportation system and the timeline for those improvements. Any other priorities              A new mixed-use development provides connectivity

HUNTERSVILLE, NC CASE STUDY
BACKGROUND
The Town of Huntersville is located in northern Mecklenburg County south of Cornelius and north of Charlotte.
It lies along I-77, just twelve miles north of Charlotte's center city. Once an agricultural community with a small
textile mill and a commercial area along the railroad, Huntersville has grown significantly, expanding its
planning jurisdiction (ETJ) and corporate limits to include approximately 64 square miles. The town's growth in
population has been significant in the last two decades. In 1990, its population totaled 3,014. This grew to
24,960 by 2000 and current studies estimate the town's population at 44,500. Residential development in
the town has almost doubled since 2000. Like Matthews, Huntersville partnered with Charlotte to adopt an
annexation agreement that designates the town's growth area. The town has adopted a similar agreement with
the Town of Cornelius. Approximately 12% of the town's planning area is within its ETJ and is generally more
rural in character. Huntersville has considered annexing the balance of its jurisdiction and currently accepts
voluntary annexations from within its ETJ.

The main road corridors of I-77, US-21, and NC-115 run parallel and north/south through the central areas of
town. The majority of development within the community is located along these main corridors. More rural
areas in the ETJ straddle the urbanizing areas to the east and west. The town has made a concerted effort to
focus and guide development along the central parts of the community to develop more sustainably, build on
the city's historic development pattern in a way that provides density for future transit use, and to preserve rural   Huntersville's proximity to Charlotte,

                                                               highly detailed plans for targeted areas in the community. The town takes a unique approach

                                                               Instead, the town relies on the market and local culture to determine what density of
                                                               development is appropriate. The town has been happy with the products of this approach -

three residential districts, three mixed-use districts, and three commercial districts.

The town's approach to transportation focuses on expanding multi-modal opportunities and dispersing traffic by emphasizing the connectivity of streets
so that travelers may have multiple routes to destinations. In 2007, the town adopted a Comprehensive Transportation Plan that incorporates its
thoroughfare plan, greenway, bicycle, and pedestrian plans into one. As new regional plans are
developed, Huntersville adopts MUMPOs thoroughfare plan as its own. Huntersville is currently
partnering with Charlotte and the five other municipalities in Mecklenburg County to develop an
integrated transit/land use plan for rapid transit.

PLANNING TOOLS
Transportation Planning Resources
Huntersville has made a concerted effort to conduct local level transportation planning and to
provide staff capacity to undertake these efforts. The town hired a transportation planner in the
1990s as development activities began to increase. The town also employs a traffic engineer who
was formerly with the Charlotte Department of Transportation and a principal planner that serves
as a liaison between land use and transportation planning. The town develops an annual list of
priority transportation improvement projects. In 2008, the town identified ten priority projects and
completed five. This year the town has expanded that list to include sixteen priority projects.
Decisions on transportation improvements made by the town are guided by a methodology that                 Small area plans guide development and design along

Development Review ­ Focus on Transportation
The Town of Huntersville uses three planning tools to exact transportation
improvements from private developers during the development review process and
to guide the specific designs of these improvements. These tools include the
Streets section of the Huntersville Zoning Ordinance, the town's Thoroughfare Plan,
and the town's Transportation Impact Assessment Ordinance.

   The Streets section of the Huntersville Zoning Ordinance focuses on street
   connectivity and designing streets to provide a pedestrian-scale environment
   that is conducive to walking and biking. Provisions within the ordinance are          Huntersville's Zoning Ordinance provides illustrations of street cross-
   designed to address rural and urban environments differently. For example,            sections that specify the exact configurations of street improvements by
   urban type districts are required to provide sidewalks on both sides of the                    type of road. A boulevard cross-section is shown here.
   street and in rural districts, sidewalks may only be required on one side of the
   street.

   The town uses its Thoroughfare Plan as an official map that designates where future road, bike, pedestrian, and greenway improvements will be
   made. If a developer has proposed a development on a site that includes portions of a future road, the town will require, at a minimum, that the
   road right-of-way will be reserved. Another option is for the landowner to designate the right-of-way and convey the land to the town. A final option
   is for the landowner to convey the land and develop the transportation infrastructure.

   Adopted in 2008, the town's Transportation Impact Assessment Ordinance sets out specific provisions for 1) the assessment of transportation
   impacts from new developments that are expected to generate a minimum number of vehicle trips within a defined impact area, 2) the level of
   service that is required on roadways within individual zoning districts, and 3) the forms of mitigation that are to be employed to maintain the
   existing level of service on impacted roadways. This ordinance provides the town with an opportunity to assess more holistically the transportation
   impacts that a single development can have on the transportation system.
The Transportation Impact Assessment Ordinance requires that all developments that are expected to generate 50 or more peak hour trips or an
average daily total of 500 or more trips (based on the current edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual) to conduct a transportation impact assessment
of the project. Based on the size, type, and uses within the proposed development, an "impact area" is defined. This impact area identifies the
segments of the road network that will be assessed for impacts from the development. These assessments take into account any planned travel
demand management techniques employed in the project. For example, a mixed-use project may actually receive a credit (i.e., increase road capacity
estimates) for a roadway in the impact area as many residents will have access to uses that will not require vehicle trips. For redevelopment projects, the
transportation impact assessment focuses on new trips generated by the development.

The town has established minimum levels of service (LOS) for roads by zoning district, ranging from "C" (better flowing traffic) to "E" (more traffic and
less flow). The town center and transit-oriented development district have an LOS "E," the rural and traditional residential districts have an LOS "C," and
all other districts have an LOS "D". This may seem counter-intuitive as the town has essentially allowed for lower levels of service in areas of higher
density development and intensive road use; however, this is by design. These levels of service help to reinforce the town's vision for land use by
encouraging development to occur in the central areas where road mitigation requirements are less costly and transit will be provided in the future, and
discouraging it from occurring in the rural areas where road mitigations requirements may be more costly. Mitigation is a requirement of development
approval if the TIA results show a decrease in LOS in the impact area. Mitigation can come from the developer in the form of the provision or funding of

pavement widening, turn lanes, median islands, access controls, traffic signalization, or other improvements. It is important to note that LOS standards
are set based on the existing level of service in the town. If the town wishes to improve the LOS on a roadway, it can not require a developer to mitigate
beyond the established LOS. However, the town can work with the developer to make improvements that will increase the LOS, and will likely require
public investment.

Design Guidelines
Huntersville's Design Guidelines Manual bridges the gap between the standards outlined in the
town's Zoning Ordinance and the vision expressed in the town's plans. It provides a graphic
representation that complements the zoning ordinance and helps to interpret its regulatory
provisions. Examples of design recommendations included in the Design Guidelines Manual include
the following.

         Connectivity should be created within and between developments. The zoning ordinance
         requires street stubs to be built to adjoining properties.
         Streets should be enclosed by buildings to create public spaces. The setbacks of
         buildings from streets will be dependent upon the context (downtown, neighborhood,
         rural, etc.) Larger setbacks can be allowed in urban settings as along as a row of
         maturing street trees aligns the edge of the street.
         Parking should be placed behind or to the side of buildings.
         Buildings should be designed to respect the human scale, including the character of
         pedestrian entrances along streets. Any uses that disregard the human scale should be             One section of the Design Guidelines Manual shows

TRANSPORTATION FUNDING
The Town of Huntersville has invested a significant amount of resources to transportation and land use planning, including the development of 12 highly
detailed corridor and small area plans, hiring professional transportation and land use planning staff, and public investments in transportation
infrastructure. The town has partnered with the North Carolina Department of Transportation to assist in roadway building. Development of the full NC-
73 roadway, a strategic east-west corridor in the town, was on the town's Thoroughfare Plan. In 2005, the town wished to pursue development of NC-73
roadway segments; however, the North Carolina Department of Transportation didn't have the funding at the time to move forward with the project. The
town provided bridge funding to the state allowing them to develop the road and was later reimbursed through state transportation funds. A local
developer also contributed money to the development of this road. Currently, the town has a project that is high on the list of potential federal stimulus
package projects. The town is also considering using bonds to pay for priority road improvements.

LESSONS LEARNED
A focus on the land use and transportation nexus in Huntersville has provided many learning
opportunities. Lessons learned from these experiences include the following.

   If a local government doesn't designate where dense development will go, then it will likely
   result in a haphazard development pattern that may impact the character of the
   community. The best way to preserve areas within a community is to have alternative
   choices for more dense development to locate and to set up zoning ordinance and road
   planning to reinforce that model.
   Developers don't wait for a thoroughfare plan to be adopted. It is important to put in place
   a thoroughfare plan and amend local ordinances accordingly to ensure that developers will
   provide their fair-share of needed improvements.
   Make sure that all plans become a reality. Huntersville has a good success rate at taking
   recommendations from small area plans and incorporating them into local ordinances.

CARY, NC CASE STUDY

BACKGROUND
Cary is located in the heart of the Research Triangle metropolitan area near Raleigh, Durham, and
the Research Triangle Park (RTP). Cary's proximity to these employment centers, three prominent
universities, freight and passenger rail, and to interstates and regional thoroughfares, has led to
significant growth over the last two decades. The town had a population of 25,000 in the early
1980s. By 1990, the population had almost doubled to 43,000. Current estimates project that the
town's population is more than 132,000.

In the 1980s, Cary qualified for a three mile ETJ extension that expanded the planning jurisdiction
of the town to the west of NC-55 to include historically rural/agricultural areas. Many landowners
within this area were opposed to being within Cary's jurisdiction and wanted to maintain the rural
community character west of town. In 2000, Cary and other municipalities in Wake County
participated in a joint planning effort that set out primary and secondary growth areas for the
municipalities and strategies for coordinating extension of services and transportation
improvements. This regional planning effort has been a critical step at managing growth within
Wake County. Today, the town is essentially "landlocked" by neighboring jurisdictions and the
Swift Creek Land Management Area, an impaired stream corridor.

Cary uses a tiered system of plans to direct growth and development in the town. In 2000, the              Cary's unique location at the heart of the Research
town adopted a community-wide Growth Management Plan that provides goals and policies for                  Triangle Region has made a fertile ground for both

and density, 4) cost, and 5) quality. This document provides the policies and implementation
strategies for coordinating the provision of public facilities and services with new development. The town's Land Use Plan, adopted in 1996 and revised
in 2003, articulates goals and objectives for development in the town. Like Huntersville, the town's land use plan focuses on creating a density
transition from the more dense central parts of the community to the more rural areas towards the west. This plan is further expanded through several
small area plans that focus on quadrants of the town. This case study focuses on the Southwest Area Plan that includes areas within the town's
corporate limits and ETJ that have historically been more rural in character and are bound by areas just east of NC-55 westward to the Chatham County
border. This area is the focus for several large transportation improvements: the development of the I-540 corridor, three I-540 interchanges, and road
improvements to provide capacity for projected traffic flowing through the region.

Cary is the third largest member of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO). Using CAMPO's regional transportation planning
model, Cary undertakes its own transportation planning and analysis to develop plans for transportation system improvements. In 2001, the town
adopted a Comprehensive Transportation Plan that includes all modes of transportation, including greenways and bike lanes. These plans were then
incorporated into CAMPO's Long Range Plan. The town is currently in the process of updating its Comprehensive Transportation Plan and will include
pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and street elements.

PLANNING TOOLS
Southwest Area Plan
The Southwest Area Plan (SWAP) is a master plan for more than 5,700 acres in
the southwestern portion of the Town of Cary's planning area. This plan is a
policy document which establishes the long-range vision and
recommendations for future land uses, transportation, parks, open space, and
the environment in that area. This area lies within a geologic region which
contains soils that are poor in permeability, limiting the application of septic
systems in some locations. Much of the nine square miles within the planning
area have historically been in agricultural use with rural homes and
farmsteads. The largely undeveloped Green Level area lies within the planning
area. This is one of the last expansive rural landscapes in the vicinity of the
Research Triangle Park. It is one of three historic districts within Cary's
planning jurisdiction that are on the National Register of Historic Places.

Driven by community concerns for the area, the focus of the Southwest Area
Plan is to preserve rural character in the community and to protect natural and
cultural resources, such as the Jordan Lake watershed. The plan focuses
services and development around NC-55 and I-540, the main north-south
corridors in the planning area, located in the eastern portion of the planning
area and away from more rural areas to the west. It sets out a density gradient
that transitions from higher density land uses in the east to rural density land
uses in the west.
                                                                                       The original vision for the Southwest Area Plan was to maintain rural

are slated to remain rural. The plan is complemented by the Rural Landscape
Preservation Project -- an effort to identify key natural and cultural areas for protection and to educate landowners on the tools available to them to
protect the important character of their lands.

The Southwest Area Plan sets out several implementation actions that the town has undertaken. One of the most critical steps for protecting rural areas
was the adoption of the Conservation Residential Overlay Zoning District which includes three subdistricts. This ordinance is applied on top of the R40
base zoning district that results in a density of one acre or less. The three overlay zoning subdistricts include:

         Conservation Residential - Low Density (1.0 acre gross density),
         Conservation Residential - Very Low Density (0.5 acre gross density), and
         Rural (0.5 acre gross density).

When the Southwest Area Plan was being developed, many landowners were not interested in
selling or subdividing their property for new development and the focus was on maintaining rural
character in this area. Times have changed, and many landowners are now more interested in
developing their properties. Much of the new development that has been built in this area has
resulted in a more suburban type character. The vision for the area may be changing. This area
is no longer experienced as solely rural and is becoming more suburban in character with each
new residential neighborhood. Staff planners determined that what most residents want in the
area is not necessarily rural development, but to limit visibility from the main thoroughfares into
new residential developments. The town is considering adoption of an 80 foot streetscape buffer
from thoroughfares to achieve this goal. If adopted, front setbacks would be applied in addition
to the streetscape buffer. There are concerns that at some point in the future, existing
neighborhoods will want suburban amenities, such as sidewalks and street lights. If this occurs,
the town will have missed its chance to have developers assist in the development and
construction of these types of amenities.

necessary to provide funding to build roads and make improvements to achieve its transportation
goals. For example, the town has invested in a red light synchronization system that improves traffic flow and has widened and built sections of road
that link developer built segments. The town has used bonds and general funds to make these improvements. When Davis Drive, a road exiting off of I-
40, needed widening and the state didn't have the funds to undertake the project, the town lent the state the money until such time that it could pay
back the town from state transportation funds.

There are three main sources from which the Town of Cary receives funding or transportation improvements from developers: exactions at the time of
rezoning, adequate public facilities exactions, and impact fees.

   Exactions. Developers are required to dedicate right-of-way to the town for any planned transportation improvements shown on the town's
   Comprehensive Transportation Plan and to construct these improvements. This is often called a developer exaction.
   Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance. In addition, the town has an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance. This ordinance requires that adequate
   public transportation facilities are in place to service a new development before it is constructed, often in the form of traffic signal and intersection
   improvements. This ordinance is applied by zone and may result in a developer making improvements to move forward with their development if
   an area is underserved.
   Impact Fees. The town also has authority from the North Carolina General Assembly to assess road and water/sewer impact fees on new
   developments. These fees are determined based upon an impact fee methodology that generates the number of new users that will require
   water/sewer and road capacity. Fees are then applied to offset those impacts. This is a tool granted to only a few municipalities in the state.

LESSONS LEARNED
Lessons learned from land use and transportation planning in Cary include the following.

   Development will happen. Communities need to be realistic about what type of development you want, what you want it to look like, and where you
   want it to go. The community's land use plan and ordinances need to reinforce the vision. The original vision for the Southwest Area may be
   changing based on changing property owner interests and the type of new development in the
   area.
   Reducing development densities along some roadways will not necessarily reduce future
   capacity demands on the road. During the Comprehensive Transportation Plan update
   process, the town identified regional transportation impacts along main thoroughfares, such as
   NC-55, that would require road improvements. The community supported dropping the density
   of development along the corridor to reduce demand on the road. Because the majority of
   traffic through this area is regional commuter traffic, lowering development densities had little
   effect on improving road capacity.
   It is critical to work with neighboring jurisdictions to plan for areas of joint interest. Part of south
   Wake County abuts Cary to the east. This area has particularly good soils and many
   subdivisions have been developed under the county's R-40 zoning. The original plan for this
   area was rural, but current development patterns are more suburban in character. Some of
   these areas are now within the town's planning jurisdiction and the town is now left with trying
   to retrofit rural roads and infrastructure to meet evolving suburban expectations.                         Residential development in south Wake County may
                                                                                                                  be more suburban than originally intended.
   Impervious surface is something to consider when trying to articulate what "rural" means for a
   community. Communities are wise to think not just about minimum lot sizes and low-impact
   development techniques, but should also think about the amount of hardscape within a development and how it will affect the character of the
   area.

   When developing clustered subdivision alternatives, make sure that bonus densities are feasible given all the developments standards (i.e.,
   setbacks, minimum lot size, etc.) This is an excellent tool for protecting critical open spaces, stream corridors, and historic properties. However,
   developers may not use the tool if density bonuses cannot be realistically achieved. Also, make sure that the required ratio of bonus densities to
   protected open space will have the result that is intended. Cary learned that the conservation subdivision option did not result in protection of
   enough open space and that it is now hard to distinguish these developments from conventional subdivisions. The proposed revised ordinance
   lowers the density bonus in order to achieve more open space protection.

ARDREY KELL ROAD (CHARLOTTE, NC) CASE STUDY
BACKGROUND
Ardrey Kell Road is an NC-DOT maintained two lane road in southeast Mecklenburg that
runs east-west between NC-16/Providence Road and Bridge Hampton Club Drive, just
north of the LARTP study area. The road connects US-521 and NC-16 and has
intersections with Tom Short Road, Rea Road, and Community House Road. It is estimated
that the road carries 10,000-15,000 vehicles per day. Ardrey Kell serves one regional
park, two Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools, four shopping centers and approximately 2,000
dwelling units. Speed limits along the roadway range from 35-45 miles per hour.

Development of the road was a priority for Charlotte-Mecklenburg. Ardrey Kell was
completed in 2002 and links several individual road segments, many built by developers of
large tract residential neighborhoods along the corridor. The county's "hook" for rezoning
approvals along the corridor was developer investment in road corridor improvements.

Following Charlotte's centers/corridors/wedges land use planning approach, the corridor
has been designed to cluster non-residential development at specific nodes or
intersections as opposed to strip commercial development with undifferentiated retail
along the corridor. Many of the neighborhoods along the corridor are designed to connect            Non-residential standards along the corridor include "build
                                                            to adjoining roads and                  to" instead of "setbacks" from the road. Note the curb cut
                                                            neighborhoods, creating                    and the right-in / right-out access to the development.

                                                            throughout the corridor.

                                                                  MUMPOs Thoroughfare Plan calls for Ardrey Kell Road to extend across Providence Road to

   Street trees and sidewalks line much of the corridor. 95% of it has paved
   shoulders or bike lanes.
   Preserved mature trees and natural swales protect the rural character along the
   corridor.
   Commercial sites are internally accessed.
   East of Rea Road, right-of-way is preserved for future road widening.
   The 3-lane cross section is common. It preserves capacity and may reduce
   accidents.

LESSONS LEARNED
The greatest traffic problems along the corridor are located at Pineville-Matthews Road
and Rea Road where cul-de-sac neighborhoods have only one main road that funnels
neighborhood traffic to Ardrey Kell. This creates public safety concerns if this access
point becomes blocked.

                                                                                                  The 3-lane cross section preserves capacity and may reduce

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the current conditions in the LARTP planning area and consideration of the land use and transportation planning tools outlined in this report,
the planning team recommends that the LARTP Steering Committee consider including the following strategies as part of the LARTP implementation
program. It is recommended that these standards should be consistent throughout the planning area and be adopted by all participating jurisdictions.

  1. Upgrade access management standards (e.g., requirement to have shared driveways on adjacent lots, required stub-outs to vacant property when
     land is developed).
  2. Require Transportation Impact Assessments and mitigation for projects generating a threshold number of trips.
  3. Require dedication of right-of-way and construction of improvements as conditions of development approval, including construction of sidewalks
     and bike lanes/wide shoulders.
  4. Adopt development standards that require:
         Internal access for commercial developments located at nodes or intersections, along with connectivity to adjacent developments.
         Encourage/require stub-outs of residential streets to undeveloped adjacent properties, along with notification provisions for purchasers of
         property and/or posting of signs.
         Limited use of cul-de-sacs.
         Tree protection requirements along major arterials to include:
             o   Required identification of significant trees and tree stands.
             o   Enhanced requirements for vegetative buffers along major arterials (wider buffers, with enhanced preservation/planting requirements).
             o   Enhanced provisions for protection, during construction, of trees identified for saving.
  5. Prepare corridor overlay zoning districts for key roads that traverse multiple jurisdictions. Include baseline standards to be considered for
     adoption by each jurisdiction involved.
  6. Work with the Charlotte Area Transit System to identify locations for park and ride lots, and pursue funding options to develop such lots in advance
     of future transit.
  7. Work with NCDOT to enhance coordination of signal timing.
  8. Identify changes to future land use patterns that would enhance use of transit and possibilities for shortening / combining automobile trips.
  9. Work with the Union County School System to identify sites for new school facilities that will avoid adding peak-hour congestion to already
     congested areas, and that offer opportunities for walking / biking to school.
  10. Encourage mixed-use development in key locations, such as downtown areas and activity nodes.
  11. Consider formalized joint planning activities with neighboring jurisdictions to coordinate development activity and share information.
  12. Develop small area plans and corridor plans to study land use and transportation issues at a more detailed level.

INTRODUCTION

Trans Associates (TA) has been tasked with performing a traffic analysis of the intersection of
US-41 & 14th Street (milepost #19.619) located within the City of Sarasota, Florida to determine
if the intersection may justify traffic signal control. Currently, this 4-leg intersection is stop
controlled on the minor street approaches (14th Street) and free flowing along the main
approach (US-41).

According to the Florida Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies, traffic signal justification should be
based on the most recent edition of the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) signal warrants. These warrants are viewed as
guidelines, not necessarily as an absolute justification if the signal warrants are met.
Engineering judgment should be exercised in all circumstances evaluating delay, congestion,
crash history, driver confusion, geometrics, etc.

The following sections of this report summarize the traffic signal warrant study including: data
collection, field observation, MUTCD signal warrant analyses, and alternatives evaluation.




DATA COLLECTION

A continuous 72-hour period of Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) counts were previously
obtained at the study intersection on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday during February of
the peak season. The ATR counts were used to identify the peak eight hours of traffic volumes
at the intersection. Based upon the ATR counts the following eight hours were selected to
perform eight hours of turning movement counts: 7:00 ­ 10:00 AM, 11:00 ­ 1:00 PM, and 3:00
­ 6:00 PM.


In addition to the turning movement counts, the numbers of pedestrians and bicycles crossing at
this intersection have been tabulated for the same time periods.

Historical crash data from 2005 ­ 2008 has been provided by the City of Sarasota for the
intersection of US-41 & 14th Street.

Summaries of the turning movement count data, pedestrian and bicycle count data, and the
historical accident data are included with this report.

INTERSECTION GEOMETRY

Trans Associates performed a field reconnaissance of the study intersection to confirm the
existing intersection geometry, lane configuration, posted speeds, intersection control, and other
pertinent features.

US-41 is a four-lane north-south state maintained arterial roadway with a posted speed limit of
40 miles per hour (mph) within the vicinity of the study intersection. At the intersection with 14th
Street, the US-41 northbound approach consists of an exclusive left turn lane, through lane, and
a shared through/right turn lane. The southbound approach of US-41 consists of an exclusive
left turn lane, through lane, and shared through/right turn lane.

14th Street is a two-lane local access roadway. At the intersection with US-41, the 14th Street
eastbound approach consists of an exclusive left turn lane, and a shared through/right turn lane.
The westbound approach of 14th Street consists of a shared left/through/right turn lane.

The traffic control at the intersection is currently maintained by two-way stop sign control for the
minor approach (14th Street). A span-wired flashing beacon is mounted above the intersection
to facilitate driver awareness of the intersection controls.

SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSES

The signal warrant analyses have been prepared in accordance with the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) 2009 Edition.
Each of the eight MUTCD warrants have been evaluated for this study. Table 1 summarizes
the results of the warrant analysis.

Based on MUTCD warrants, the intersection of US-41 & 14th Street does not warrant the
installation of traffic signal at this time. Detailed signal warrant analyses and summary sheets

CRASH EXPERIENCE

Additional analysis of the crash history was undertaken regarding signal warrant #7 ­ Crash
experience. According to the MUTCD, "Traffic control signals that are properly designed,
located, operated and maintained will reduce the frequency and severity of certain types of
crashes, especially right-angle collisions....Improper or unjustified traffic control signals can
result in significant increases in the frequency of collisions, especially rear-end collisions."

According to the crash history at this intersection a total of 19 vehicular and 1 bicycle accidents
have occurred between 2005 ­ 2008 resulting in a total of 7 personal injuries (approximately
37% of crashes). The distributions of vehicular crashes are as follows:




INTERSECTION DELAY

Detailed traffic operations analysis was undertaken to determine the average vehicle delay,
stopped delay, and number of stops per vehicle for the intersections of US-41 & 14th Street as
part of the Bayfront Connectivity Study which was approved by FDOT. The analyses were
performed for the 2008 existing conditions, 2011 design year conditions, and 2021 design year
conditions. For each analysis scenario, the results were calculated for both existing geometrical
conditions versus roundabout control at the intersection. Table 2 presents the results of the
VISSIM PM peak hour average vehicle delay, stopped delay, and number of stops analyses for
the study intersection.


June 2010                                                                                       10

The vehicular delay represents the average expected delay experienced per vehicle in terms of
seconds per vehicle. Delay is calculated as the total amount of time a vehicle is below the
desired speed. This includes time spent during acceleration, deceleration, and stand still.

Roundabouts provide yield control on all approaches for vehicles. This provides more time for
vehicles to traverse the intersection. The benefit of the yield control is noticeable during peak
hour conditions; however, the off-peak conditions will benefit the most from yield control.
Vehicles are permitted to enter/exit the roundabout intersection during available gaps in the
traffic stream. This eliminates the unnecessary delay experienced at most signalized
intersection side streets.

As presented in Table 1, the VISSIM analysis presents significant reductions in vehicular delays
for the roundabout versus the existing conditions. Most noticeable are the side street delays.


The analysis also measured stopped delay at the intersections. This value represents the delay
incurred when a vehicle is at a complete stop. This time spent at "stand still" is the most
inefficient aspect of intersection operation. With either traffic signal control or roundabout
control, stopped delay is unavoidable. Therefore, the goal of intersection control is to keep the
vehicles moving efficiently, while also accommodating pedestrians by reducing their wait time to
cross US-41.

PEDESTRIAN INFLUENCE

Pedestrian and bicycle count data was collected for the study intersection of US-41 & 14th
Street. Bicycle counts included all bicycles on sidewalks or traveling on the roadway.

Based on the existing count information, there are a relatively few number of pedestrians and
bicycles crossing the intersection of US-41 & 14th Street.

At signalized intersections, pedestrians cross the roads perpendicular to the approaches during
an approved signal cycle phase. This pedestrian phase is designed to provide a WALK and
DON'T WALK phase that are timed to comply with the required crossing distance assuming a
walking speed of 3-4 ft/sec. This pedestrian phase can be triggered by a push-button which
may place all approaches into a "red" phase to allow an all-way pedestrian crossing condition.
However, more commonly, the pedestrian phase is incorporated to coincide with the adjacent
parallel traffic movement (can also be push-button activated). Signalized pedestrian control
requires that either all traffic movements are required to stop or certain approaches are required
to stop for pedestrian signal phases. Most notably, minor streets signal phase lengths may be
increased to accommodate the walk/don't walk time for the parallel pedestrian movements
which may greatly increase the main street delay.

At roundabouts, pedestrians cross each approach with the aid of a splitter island which serves
as a pedestrian refuge area. This allows for pedestrians to cross only one direction of travel at
a time, which provides greater opportunities for acceptable gaps in the traffic stream and
minimizes vehicle pedestrian conflicts. Removal of the traffic signal indication provides a
number of benefits including: removal of illegal "jay-walking" offenses for pedestrians crossing
against the traffic signal, removal of exclusive all pedestrian phases, and removal of extended
side street signal phase lengths to accommodate pedestrians. These benefits provide lesser
impacts on the delay incurred by vehicles.

The effect of pedestrians on the existing intersection and proposed roundabout were measured
by making general assumptions for the numbers of pedestrian and bicycles. First, the
intersection was analyzed assuming the existing numbers of pedestrians. Three subsequent
analyses were then performed each considering an addition of 25 pedestrians per approach per
direction.

For example, for one analysis scenario the NB approach of US-41 at 14th Street is assumed to
have 25 additional pedestrians crossing US-41 in the eastbound direction and an additional 25

pedestrians crossing US-41 in the westbound direction. This method was applied to each
intersection approach and each direction for the study intersection. It should be noted that the
number of pedestrians assumed for the +50 and +75 scenarios represent numbers of
pedestrians that are typically consistent with extremely large and dense urban cities (ex. New
York). These values are not expected for the City of Sarasota and have been calculated for
analysis purposes only.

Based on the VISSIM analyses, the benefits for roundabouts with pedestrians are evident for
the existing and +25 scenarios (which are the most likely scenarios for this location). However,
the results are reversed for the +50 and +75 pedestrian scenarios. This is likely due to the
benefit of pedestrian platooning with a signalized crossing at the intersection as opposed to
vehicle gap acceptance for pedestrians. Table 3 presents the average vehicular delay with
pedestrian influence at the intersection of US-41 & 14th Street.

ALTERNATIVE COUNTERMEASURES

Without justification to install a traffic signal at the intersection of US-41 & 14th Street, a
roundabout alternative has been suggested for consideration and further detailed evaluation.

According to the Florida Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies (MUTS), roundabout justification
may be determined through three general questions.

    1. Will a roundabout be expected to perform better than other alternative control modes?
       In other words, will it reduce delay, improve safety, or solve some other operational
       problem?
    2. Are there factors present to suggest that a roundabout would be a more appropriate
       control, even if delays with a roundabout are slightly higher?
    3. If any contraindicating factors exist, can they be resolved satisfactorily?              A
       contraindicating factor for selecting a roundabout as an intersection control device would
       be any condition that might reduce the effectiveness of a roundabout.

Other alternatives to consider at this location include turn restrictions on the minor street
approach (14th Street) since alternative routes are available. This may consist of right turn only
restrictions for 14th Street that can be enforced 24 hours a day or only during peak travel
periods.

The existing intersection design contains a median between the northbound and southbound
lanes along US-41. However, this design does not adequately allow for two-stage-gap
acceptance for left turning vehicles from the minor street (14th Street) approach. Geometric
mitigations may be considered to improve the median width and placement of the existing four
feet raised medians which encroach upon the intersection further than necessary. These
improvements may improve the ability for vehicles to navigate the intersection.

SUMMARY

Based on the MUTCD signal warrant analyses performed for the intersection of US-41 & 14th
Street in the City of Sarasota, a traffic signal is not warranted based on the existing vehicular
volumes, pedestrians, and crash history.

Although the intersection of US-41 & 14th Street does not meet the MUTCD signal warrant
criteria at this time, several relevant observations regarding traffic control still exist at this
location. These observations recommended for further evaluation are:

    1. Vehicular crash history at this intersection that averages approximately 5 per year.
    2. Concerns for pedestrians to safely cross US-41.
    3. Desire to reduce vehicular delay and increase access opportunities on the minor street
       approaches (14th Street).
    4. Reduction of speeds along US-41 within the City of Sarasota limits to reduce injury
       severity for crashes, allow greater access opportunities for side street vehicles and
       pedestrians.

Therefore, one recommendation is to consider constructing a roundabout at this intersection as
an alternative to signalization. As detailed in the Florida Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies,
roundabout justification can be determined by answering the following questions:

    1. "Will a roundabout be expected to perform better than other alternative control modes?
       In other words, will it reduce delay, improve safety, or solve some other operational
        problem?"
           a. Construction of a roundabout may reduce delay compared to the existing two-
               way stop control at this location. In general, roundabouts may be safer than
               other forms of intersection traffic control because vehicle-vehicle crossing
               conflicts are eliminated by converting all movements to right turns. Roundabouts
               also force vehicles to travel at lower speeds which increases the safety for
               pedestrians, bicyclists, and other motorists. The lower speeds can also reduce
               the severity of crashes and injuries.


    2. "Are there factors present to suggest that a roundabout would be a more appropriate
       control, even if delays with a roundabout are slightly higher?"
           a. Based on the analysis results, a roundabout at this location will actually reduce
               delay. In addition the safety benefits and pedestrian crossing opportunities

               gained through use of a roundabout as detailed in this report support the desired
               outcomes of the community and its transportation network.
    3. "If any contraindicating factors exist, can they be resolved satisfactorily?             A
       contraindicating factor for selecting a roundabout as an intersection control device would
       be any condition that might reduce the effectiveness of a roundabout."
           a. There are no significant factors present that would absolutely prohibit
              construction of a roundabout at this intersection.

This concludes the signal warrant analyses for the intersection of US-41 & 14th Street in the
City of Sarasota, Florida.

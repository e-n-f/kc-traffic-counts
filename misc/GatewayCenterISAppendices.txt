Subject:        Preliminary Geotechnical Evaluation
                Proposed Lowe's of Salinas
                Northeast Corner of East Boronda Road and San Juan Grade
                City of Salinas, Monterey County, California
                EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Dear Mr. Mandel:

As requested, EEI has completed a preliminary geotechnical evaluation for the proposed Lowe's Home
Improvement Warehouse, Inc. (Lowe's HIW, Inc.) site in Salinas, California. The scope of work
associated with this preliminary geotechnical evaluation is based upon discussions with Lowe's staff, our
review of a preliminary site plan, and our limited field exploration of the subject property. EEI conducted
this preliminary geotechnical evaluation to assess the overall feasibility of the project and to provide
preliminary recommendations for planning purposes. In order to satisfy Lowe's Development Criteria,
and to provide appropriate recommendations for design and construction of the proposed improvements at
the site, an additional design-level geotechnical evaluation will be warranted.

This evaluation is based upon the review of a preliminary site plan of the Salinas Retail Project (of which
Lowe's is a part) by AMS Associates, Inc. (dated January 13, 2010) provided by the Client, as well as
EEI's research of readily available regional geologic reports and maps, our recent limited field
exploration (April 23 and 24, 2010) and our experience in the area. A summary of preliminary findings,
conclusions and recommendations are provided herein.

Based upon our review of the aforementioned site plan by AMS Associates, Inc., existing elevations
and/or proposed finish grade elevations are not provided; therefore, the amount of cut and fill grading is
unknown. For the purpose of this limited evaluation, however, the existing plans are considered to be
appropriate. Based upon this limited geotechnical evaluation, EEI will propose additional field studies
pertaining to site development, which should be based upon more detailed civil engineering plans.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                                  EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Site Location and Description

The subject site is situated in northern Monterey County roughly 8-miles east of the Pacific Ocean and
approximately ¾-mile east of Highway 101 in the northern portion of the City of Salinas, California. The
property, located at the northeast corner of East Boronda Road and San Juan Grade Road, is presently
being cultivated for agricultural purposes. Current access to the site is via East Boronda Road and San
Juan Grade Road, which bound the property to the southwest and northwest, respectively. The site is
bounded on the north and east by agricultural land, and to the south and west predominantly by residential
and a shopping center (Harden Plaza). A school is located in the vicinity to the east. Based on our
conversations with the farm manger, we understand that a well was present along the western margin of
the property as recently as the 1980s, and a buried water line is still present beneath the property,
extending southeast from the former well location.

Our review of a preliminary site plan prepared by AMS Associates, Inc. (dated January 13, 2010)
indicates that the Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse (HIW) store (i.e., Parcel 1) is planned for the
northern portion of the Salinas Retail Project and consists of 11.65 acres within the 17-acre project. The
Lowe's structure, which is to be comprised of 120,944 square feet of retail space, will have an attached
31,384 square-foot garden center on the western side of the building. The main parking area is planned
south of the building with the loading dock in the northwesterly corner of the structure. A storm water
detention area is planned for the northwestern section of the property. "Bioswales" are also planned
within the parking lot islands. We understand that development of the remainder of the retail project will
include four (4) retail out-parcels located on the southern (i.e., Parcels 2 and 3) and western (i.e., Parcel 4)
perimeter of the project. The aforementioned site plan notes that storm drain retention areas are proposed
for the development off the easterly side of the future retail center. We anticipate that all proposed retail
development will be of slab-on-grade construction. While no grading plans have been provided for our
review, it is anticipated that grading at the site will likely include cut and fill of less than ten feet across
the site (exclusive of any remedial grading).


SITE PHYSICAL DATA

Topography

The subject property is located on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Salinas, California 7.5
Minute Quadrangle map. This topographic/geographic map indicates that elevations on the subject
property range from approximately 100 feet above mean sea level (amsl) to 95 feet amsl. The ground
surface at the site gently slopes toward the southwest. Based on topography, surface drainage generally
appears to flow in a southwesterly direction, ultimately into Markeley Swamp (City of Salinas, 2004).

Soil Characterization and Erosion

Soils classification onsite was determined using the United Stated Department of Agriculture Natural
Resources Conservation Service website (Web Soil Survey). The subject property falls within the soil
survey for Monterey County, California. The survey area data is based upon Version 9, dated April 14,
2009, with aerial images dated June 13, 2005. The dominant soil map unit is the Chualar loam (0 to 2
percent slopes).




                                                       2
Preliminary Geotechnical Evaluation                                                            May 17, 2010
Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                                 EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


This soil type is not reported by the soil survey to contain calcium carbonate or gypsum. The soil is listed
with a pH in the range of 6.1 to 7.8, and contains 45 to 60 percent sand and 10 to 25 percent clay to a
depth on the order of 5 feet below the ground surface (bgs). The Plastic Index, which indicates the
plasticity of the soil, is listed to range from non plastic to 15 within the same depth. The United Soil
Classification System (USCS) for the Chualar loam is noted by the soil survey report to be typically
comprised of silty sand (SM) and clayey sand (SC). The American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) classification is listed as A-1 to A-6. The erosion factor for whole
soil (Kw), which indicates the susceptibility of a soil to sheet or rill by water, is listed in the soil survey
report as ranging from 0.24 to 0.32. The Kf factor, or the erodibilty of the fine-earth fraction of soil, is
listed at 0.32 to 0.43. Values of K range from 0.02 to 0.69. All factors being equal, the higher the K
value, the more susceptible the soil is to sheet or rill erosion by water. The saturated hydraulic
conductivity (Ksat) is rated at 10.95 micrometers per second (µm/s) by the soil survey report. The wind
erodibility index, a numerical value indicating the susceptibility of a soil to wind erosion, for the Chualar
loam is reported as 56 (tons per acre per year). The sewage lagoon absorption rating is listed in the soil
survey with limitations, with permeability listed as ranging from 0.6- to 2-inches per hour.

The City of Salinas Stormwater Master Plan (2004) and the development standards (2008) list the Chualar
loams within the B-low hydrologic soil group, or soils having moderate infiltration rates when thoroughly
wetted.

Regional and Local Geology

The property lies within the Coastal Ranges geomorphic province of California (CGS, 2002), a northwest
­ southeast orientated system of mountains and valleys along the central and northern California coast.
The Coast Ranges are comprised predominantly of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary units. West of
the San Andreas Fault zone, which is located near the eastern boundary of the province, is the Salinian
Block underlain by granitic bedrock.

Regional mapping (Wagner, Greene and Pridmore, 2002) indicates the subject property is underlain by
Pleistocene-age alluvial fan deposits. Previously, the Salinas area east of Highway 101 was mapped as
Quaternary-age (i.e., Recent) alluvium (CDMG, 1959).

Regional and Local Hydrogeology

The project area lies within the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) Salinas Valley Basin
of the Central Coast Hydrologic Region. In this region, 1995 data indicates groundwater provides
approximately 80 percent of agricultural and suburban use. Due to marine sedimentary units in this
region, groundwater is typically characterized by elevated levels of calcium sulfate and calcium sodium
bicarbonate sulfate. Aquifers affected by seawater intrusion have elevated concentrations of calcium
chloride and sodium chloride exceeding 500 milligrams per liter (DWR, 2003).

According to the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast Region (Region 3)
Basin Plan (1994), the subject site is located within the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin of the Central
Coastal Hydrologic Study area. Groundwater in this sub area has been designated as beneficial for
municipal and domestic supply, agricultural, and industrial process supply. Surface water in the
immediate vicinity of the subject property is located within the Chualar Hydrologic Area of the Salinas
Hydrologic Unit; however, there appears to be no surface water bodies within or in the immediate vicinity
to the subject property.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                               EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


EEI reviewed the City's stormwater master plan (City of Salinas, 2004), which shows the subject property
in future development areas. The maps suggest that the subject property (north of Boronda Road) is
within the Markeley Swamp watershed. Markeley Swamp is noted to be a tributary to the Reclamation
Ditch system, flowing northwesterly through south-central portion of the City of Salinas. The report notes
that existing drainage problems occur at the City boundary where runoff from farmlands impacts the
cities' stormdrain system(s). The area north of the City along Boronda Road is referenced in the report as
a problem area.

EEI's field observations detected no groundwater wells within the subject property boundaries; however,
research indicates that there is a buried water well near the edge of San Juan Grade Road. According to
statements made by the current farm manger, we understand that this well was present along the western
margin of the property as recently as the 1980s. It is our understanding that a buried concrete irrigation
line (12-inches in diameter) trends northeast from the west edge of the site through the proposed Lowe's
building envelope. Indications are that the line is buried within 4 feet of the existing ground surface.
There are no public records that this well has been properly abandoned. Our site observations indicate that
per the guidelines of the local jurisdiction other surface irrigation lines are visible onsite which convey
irrigation water to the subject property from a private well situated offsite to the northeast. As noted
during our recent field exploration, groundwater was not encountered to a maximum explored depth of
51½-feet below the ground surface (bgs). Our discussions with the current property farmer indicate that
groundwater is at depths on the order of 160 to 220 feet bgs

EEI reviewed an electronic copy of the City of Salinas General Plan (dated September 2002) to determine
whether the subject property is located within an area designated as a Flood Hazard Zone. According to
the information reviewed, the subject property is not situated within an area identified as a 100-year flood
zone. The General Plan does note, however, that potential flood risks exist within Salinas Valley due to
development within 100-year floodplains, levee failure, local drainage problems and dam failure. The
Salinas River Valley and the Carmel River Valley, both located southwest of the subject property, are
considered to have the greatest risk of dam failure in Monterey County.

Mass Wasting and Landslides

Mass wasting is related to processes by which surficial soils and/or bedrock materials move "down
gradient" as a result of gravity. Due to the relatively level ground surface at the subject site, surface
expressions of landsliding, slumps, creep, or other surficial failures were not observed within the subject
property during our field reconnaissance. Graded slopes (if proposed), should be evaluated for their
stability once finalized grading plans become available.


FAULTING

There are a number of faults in central California that are considered active and would likely generate
ground shaking should they be the source of an earthquake. Active faults in the immediate site area
include (but are not limited to) the San Andreas Fault zone (to the north-northeast), the Calaveras Fault
zone (to the northeast), the Palo Colorado-San Gregorio Fault zone (offshore to the northwest), and the
Monterey Bay Fault zone (offshore to the northwest).

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                               EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Our research indicated that there are known active faults crossing the site (Jennings, 1994) and the subject
property does not lie within a Fault-Rupture Hazard Zone (Hart & Bryant, 1997). The California
Geological Survey (CGS) index of earthquake fault zones (CDMG, 2002), formerly known as the
California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG), indicates that there are no active fault/fault zones in
Monterey County.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program website was queried
regarding regional data pertaining to fault parameters. Using 2008 National Seismic Hazard Maps, the
maximum magnitude credible earthquake (Mw) listed for the Monterey Bay (Tularcitos) Fault zone (11.8
miles west) ranges from 7.2 to 7.3. The Mw for the San Gregorio (connected) Fault zone (20 miles west)
is listed to range from 7.4 to 7.5. The Mw for the San Andreas Fault zone (13.6 miles northeast) is listed
to range from 7.9 to 8.05. The Mw for the Calaveras Fault zone (19 miles north-northeast) is listed to
range from 6.3 to 6.5.

Preliminary Seismic Parameters

The California Geological Survey (CGS) Probabilistic Seismic Hazards Mapping Ground Motion website
was queried regarding probabilistic ground motion values for the subject property, utilizing a coordinate
of N36.721 Latitude, W121.648 Longitude. The Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) for the subject
property, considering a 10 percent probability in 50 years, was interpolated as 0.44g for alluvium.

Maximum considered ground motion maps provided in the California Building Code (CBC, 2007) were
utilized with coordinates of 34.721° north latitude and 121.648° west longitude, to determine the site
seismic parameters. EEI utilized seismic design criteria provided in the CBC, 2007.

In accordance with the guidelines of the CBC, 2007, the spectral parameters for the site (based on a Site
Class B soil) are estimated to be Ss = 1.490g and S1 = 0.600g, utilizing 2005 ASCE 7 Seismic Design
Provisions (ASCE, 2005). Review of the geotechnical data obtained during our subsurface exploration,
however, indicates that the site should be classified as Class D per the CBC (Table 1613.5.2).
Consequently, Site Coefficients Fa= 1.0 and Fv = 1.5 appear to be appropriate for the site. Based on this
information, the adjusted maximum considered earthquake spectral response parameters SMS = 1.490g and
SM1 = 0.900g are recommended for seismic design of the project. Assuming an occupancy category of II
(Table 1604.5), a SDs value of 0.993g and a SD1 value of 0.600g, the proposed Lowe's HIW building at the
site can be assigned a seismic design category of D [Table 1613.5.6 (1) and (2)]. Final selection of the
appropriate seismic design coefficients should be made by the structural consultant based on the local
laws and ordinances, expected building response and desired level of conservatism.

Liquefaction

Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a soil is reduced by earthquake
shaking or other rapid loading. Liquefaction and related phenomena have been responsible for substantial
structural damage in historical earthquakes, and are a design concern under certain conditions.
Liquefaction occurs in saturated soils, that is, soils in which the space between individual particles is
completely filled with water. This pore water exerts a pressure on the soil particles that influences how
tightly the particles themselves are pressed together.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                               EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Based upon our preliminary evaluation and limited field exploration, the subject site does not appear to be
susceptible to earthquake induced liquefaction or significant amounts of seismic induced ground
settlement, based on the nature of the encountered subsurface materials and the observed lack of
groundwater to the maximum explored depth of 51 ½ fee bgs.


FIELD EXPLORATION

The purpose of our preliminary subsurface field evaluation was to characterize the overall geologic and
geotechnical conditions to assist Lowe's HIW in evaluating the feasibility of the proposed construction at
the site. Five (5) borings were advanced on the Lowe's property (Parcel 1) and six (6) borings were
drilled on the overall property (Parcel's 2, 3 and 4), at the general locations as noted on the boring
location map (Figure 3).

Field exploration was conducted by EEI on April 23 and 24, 2010. Due to the preliminary nature of the
requested geotechnical study, and as approved by Lowe's project management, the field study presented
herein was not in general accordance with Lowe's Site Development Specifications. The borings were
evaluated for near-surface geologic conditions for the construction of the Lowe's building. Borings were
logged under the supervision of an EEI registered professional engineer.

Since the subject property is presently cultivated for agricultural purposes, the ground surface within the
site was soft, and would not accommodate a conventional truck-mounted drill rig. As a result, borings
were advance using a limited access drill rig.

Small diameter (i.e., 8-inches) hollow stem auger borings were advanced within the site to obtain the
subsurface data. Borings advanced within the proposed Lowe's HIW building envelope extended to
depths between 31½ and 51½ feet bgs. Within the parking lot, borings were drilled to a depth of 16½
feet bgs.

Our field studies included soil sample collection and laboratory testing to provide data for preliminary
geotechnical evaluation and the development of preliminary soils engineering recommendations regarding
the proposed site development, including foundation design recommendations and pavement design
considerations.

Blow count (N) values were determined utilizing a 140 pound automatic hammer, falling 30-inches onto a
Standard Penetration Test (SPT) split-spoon sampler and a Modified California split-tube sampler. The
number of blows (N value) required to advance the 18-inch long SPT and 12-inch long Modified
California split-tube samplers a distance of 12-inches was measured at various initial depths followed by
5-foot intervals (recorded on the boring logs), and are presented in Appendix A-Soil Classification Chart
and Boring Logs. Relatively "undisturbed" samples were collected in a 2.42-inch (inside diameter)
California Modified split-tube sampler for visual examination and laboratory testing. Representative bulk
samples were collected for appropriate laboratory testing. The soils were classified in accordance with
the Unified Soil Classification System (ASTM, 2008).

Subsurface Conditions

Pleistocene-aged (i.e., Recent) alluvial fan deposits were encountered in our exploratory borings to the
maximum explored depth of approximately 51½ feet bgs. Where encountered, these deposits were
observed to be comprised commonly of brown and orange-brown silty sands to a depth of approximately
15 feet bgs, where sandy and silty clays interbedded with silty sands were found. The sandy portions of
these materials were noted to be typically slightly moist to very moist and loose to medium dense at the
time of our subsurface exploration. The clayey portions were observed to be moist and medium stiff to
stiff at the time of our subsurface exploration. As is typical with active farmlands, elevated
concentrations of organic materials were observed within the upper topsoil layer, where it was observed
to be on the order of 1(+/-)-foot in thickness; however, soil disturbance due to cultivation was observed to
be on the order of 2-foot bgs. A more detailed description of the encountered soils is provided on the
boring logs included as Appendix A.

Groundwater

Groundwater was not encountered in any of our exploratory borings that were drilled to a maximum depth
of 51½ feet below the existing ground surface. It should be noted, however, that variations in
groundwater may result from fluctuations in the ground surface topography, subsurface stratification,
rainfall, irrigation, and other factors that may not have been evident at the time of our exploration.


LABORATORY TESTING AND CLASSIFICATION

Representative samples were selected for laboratory testing to confirm their field classifications. Field
descriptions and classifications were visually classified according to the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM) D-2488, which classifies soils under the Unified Soil Classification System
(USCS). Representative soil samples were tested in the lab for grain size distribution, liquid limits, and
plastic limits to determine actual classifications by ASTM D-2487-Standard Practice for Classification of
Soils for Engineering Purposes in accordance with the USCS. Final classifications of soils can be found
on the boring logs in Appendix A and the laboratory test data in Appendix B.

Grain Size Distribution

To check classifications of soils and to help evaluate liquefaction potential at the site, grain size
distribution of representative soil samples was determined. In order to find the percentages of different
sized particles in a particular soil stratum, soils were tested in general accordance to ASTM D-422-
Standard Test Method for Particle-Size Analysis of Soils. Grain size distribution curves and gradation
results are presented in Appendix B.

Liquid Limits, Plastic Limits, and Plasticity Index

The liquid limit, plastic limit, and plasticity index (PI) of soils were determined to aid in the classification
of soils (i.e., distinguishing clay from silt) and to evaluate the potential for expansion and seismically-
induced liquefaction. The tests were performed in general accordance to ASTM D-4318. The results are
presented in the Appendix B.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                              EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Moisture Content and Dry Density

The in-situ moisture content and dry density of soils were determined for soil samples obtained from the
borings. Moisture contents and dry densities of soils help to determine engineering design parameters for
foundations, retaining walls, and other engineered structures. Moisture content on soil samples was
conducted in general accordance with ASTM D-2216, and was recorded as a percentage. In-place
moisture content and dry density information for soil samples retrieved from the field can be found on the
boring logs located in Appendix A.

Maximum Dry Density and Optimum Moisture Content

The maximum dry density and optimum moisture content was determined from representative bulk soil
samples obtained within the upper five feet of existing grade. Our testing was performed in general
accordance with ASTM D-1557, Method B. Results of our testing are presented in Appendix B.

Direct Shear

Direct shear testing was conducted on representative soil samples that were remolded to 92 percent of
their maximum dry density (based on ASTM D-1557) to measure their shear strength characteristics for
engineering purposes. The samples were then inundated for at least 18 hours. The samples were placed
in a shear box and a normal load was applied (10, 20, and 40 kilogram weights were used). The sample
was then sheared at a controlled strain rate in a direct shear apparatus that measures horizontal
displacement and shear resistance. Shear testing was run in general accordance to ASTM D-3080. The
results of our testing are presented in Appendix B.

Expansion

Two (2) soil samples obtained from within the upper five feet of existing grade within the 17-acre site as
a whole were tested for their expansion potential. Clayey soils can be expansive with the introduction of
water and can cause heaving. Our expansion index (i.e., EI) testing was conducted in general accordance
to ASTM D-4829. The result of our expansion index testing is presented in Appendix B.

Expansion index testing should be completed at the conclusion of rough grading, and should consist of
the evaluation of soils within four feet of finish grade. Additional testing, therefore, is recommended
after completion of rough building pad grade.

R-Value

A representative bulk sample from the upper five feet of earth materials encountered within the proposed
parking area was collected for R-Value testing. Pavement design is based upon these test results. The
samples were sent to the GeoSoils, Inc. soils laboratory in Carlsbad, California. Test procedures were
conducted in general accordance with the Department of Transportation, State of California, and
Materials & Research Test Method No. 301. The R-Value test results are presented in Appendix B.
Verification testing is recommended at the conclusion of grading on samples collected at (or near) finish
grade.

Sulfate/Corrosion

Two representative samples of onsite earth material were collected for analysis for corrosion/soluble
sulfate potential, consisting of minimum resistivity and pH by California Test Method 643, electrical
conductivity by AWWA 2510-B and ASTM D-125, alkalinity by U.S. EPA 310.1, AWWA 1320-B, and
ASTM D -13, and sulfate, chloride, and nitrates by U.S. EPA 300.0. This testing was performed by
Schiff Associates' laboratory in Claremont, California. Results of these tests are presented in
Appendix B.

It should be understood that the results provided in Appendix B are based upon pre-development
conditions. Verification testing is recommended at the conclusion of grading on samples collected at (or
near) finish grade.

Consolidation Testing

Consolidation properties of soils were determined to evaluate soil potential for compression and long-
term settlement. The consolidation test method includes measuring the amount and rate of consolidation
of soil when subject to loading. The test was run with relatively undisturbed soil samples in 1-inch thick
brass rings, collected from the Modified California sampler. The samples were placed in a
consolidometer with porous stones at the top and bottom of the sample and placed in a loading frame.
Weights were added and measurements of height were recorded from a dial indicator as the sample was
compressed. Measurements of height were also recorded during the "rebound" period of removal of the
weights. Consolidation testing was performed in general accordance to ASTM D-2435. Results of our
consolidation testing are presented in Appendix B.


PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS

Based on our limited field study and cursory research of regional and local geologic reports and maps, the
subject property in Salinas, California appears feasible for the proposed commercial development from a
geotechnical engineering and geologic viewpoint, provided the preliminary recommendations contained
in the following sections of this report are properly incorporated into design of the site improvements.
Based upon the scope of this limited geotechnical evaluation, additional field studies and evaluation
pertaining to site development are recommended, which would be based upon more detailed project plans.
As a result, EEI is providing the following preliminary conclusions:

        ·   The 11.65-acre Lowe's of Salinas property is a part of a 17-acre retail project planned at the
            northeastern corner of San Juan Grade Road and East Boronda Road. The property is
            currently being actively farmed with recently harvested and/or cultivated sections. Due to
            seasonal precipitation, surface water was observed onsite during our limited field study.
            Agricultural development of the site has created an organic topsoil layer on the order of
            1(+/-)-foot in thickness. Cultivation appears to have disturbed the upper 2 feet of soils onsite.
            Buried concrete irrigation lines exist within the site.

Preliminary Geotechnical Evaluation                                                         May 17, 2010
Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                              EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4



        ·   The site is relatively level, with the ground sloping gently to the southwest. Without the
            benefit of existing or proposed elevations, it is impractical to estimate the amount of grading
            that will be needed to create a building pad for a 120,944 square-foot building, an attached
            31,384 square-foot garden center, and associated parking lot. EEI anticipates, however, that
            typical cut and fill grading operations will be used to develop the property. Standard heavy
            duty grading equipment (in proper working order) may be utilized to conduct earthwork
            onsite without significant difficulty associated with groundwater and/or over-sized rock
            fragments.

        ·   At this time, there appears to be no unmitigatible geologic hazards that would place unusual
            constraints on the project; however, additional field exploration is recommended to check the
            uniformity of subsurface conditions within the subject property. Additional borings within
            the Lowe's parcel are also recommended to comply with Lowe's HIW, Inc. specifications
            and criteria.

        ·   The subject property is underlain by recent alluvial fan deposits with the upper portions
            consisting of fine- to coarse-grained sands with minor silt. Below a depth of approximately
            15 feet bgs, clayey alluvial soils are commonly interbedded with sands and silts.
            Groundwater was not encountered in any of our exploratory borings that were drilled to a
            maximum depth of 51½ bgs within the property. Additionally, the cohesionless nature of
            sandy alluvial soils may represent trench safety issues that will require consideration.

        ·   According to the current farm manger, a water well was present along the western margin of
            the property as recently as the 1980s, and a buried water line is still present beneath the
            property, extending northeasterly from the former well location through the proposed Lowe's
            building envelope. Another line also is thought to trend along the western edge of the site,
            near San Juan Grade Road. This well should be properly abandoned following State of
            California Department of Water Resources standards (1991). Well abandonment should be
            completed by a licensed water well drilling contractor.

        ·   The site is located in a seismically active area and strong ground shaking from earthquakes
            should be anticipated and incorporated into project design.

        ·   Buried concrete irrigation lines exist within the site that will require removal and offsite
            disposal during earthwork. Care should be taken during initial removals to verify that the
            concrete pipes do not contain asbestos. The pipes should not be broken or crushed before
            evaluation by an experienced environmental professional.

        ·   To provide relatively uniform foundation support underlying the future building envelope and
            to reduce the potential for excessive post-construction settlement, remedial earthwork appears
            to be warranted to provide a sufficient layer of engineered fill beneath the
            footings/foundations.

        ·   Earthwork and development of the subject Lowe's parcel should comply with Lowe's
            Criteria Development guidelines which provide specific criteria for engineered fill (Lowe's
            Division 02 Civil, Section 02300-Earthwork, 2009) or the City of Salinas standards (2008;
            2007) whichever is more stringent.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                              EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4



        ·   According to City documents (City of Salinas, 2004; 2010), the subject property is located in
            a future development area described as having existing drainage problems. The site appears
            to be within Priority 4 Improvements, Regional Detention Storage Area 4-2. Stormwater
            improvement projects (i.e., detention storage) in this area would be undertaken as needed for
            new developments.

        ·   Laboratory testing indicated that native soils are highly corrosive to buried ferrous metals
            with a minimum resistivity of between 1,200 and 1,920 ohm-cm. Buried ferrous metal lines
            should be provided with appropriate protection from direct soil contact in accordance with the
            recommendations of a qualified corrosion consultant.

        ·   Laboratory test results indicated soluble sulfate concentrations of between 47 and 80
            milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and chloride concentrations of between 31 and 55 mg/kg.
            As a result, onsite soils appear to have a negligible corrosion potential to concrete. Based on
            this information, Type II cement can be used in concrete that will be in contact with the
            encountered soils.

        ·   Results of laboratory testing indicated nitrate concentrations between 188 and 387 mg/kg,
            while no ammonium was detected in the tested samples. The tested nitrate levels may be
            potentially corrosive to copper piping, as nitrate levels greater than 50 mg/kg are generally
            considered to pose a threat as such, we recommend that a qualified corrosion engineer be
            consulted to further evaluate these conditions and to provide appropriate mitigative
            recommendations, as warranted.


PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on our preliminary geotechnical evaluation, it is EEI's opinion that geotechnical conditions are
favorable for the use of conventional shallow foundations for the support of the proposed retail
structure(s). To provide relatively uniform foundation support underlying the future building envelope
and to reduce the potential for excessive post-construction settlement, remedial earthwork appears to be
warranted to provide a sufficient layer of engineered fill beneath the footings/foundations.

General

Grading and site development plans should conform to the guidelines presented in the 2007 California
Building Code (CBC, 2007) and the requirements of the City of Salinas (2008; 2007) and County of
Monterey, as well as guidelines presented in Lowe's Development Criteria (see reference list), and the
recommendations provided herein. Footings should be founded entirely in compacted fill material.

During earthwork construction, removals and reprocessing of fill materials, as well as general grading
procedures of the contractor should be observed and the fill placed should be selectively tested by
representatives of the geotechnical engineer. If any unusual or unexpected conditions are exposed in the
field, they should be reviewed by the geotechnical engineer and if warranted, modified and/or additional
remedial recommendations will be offered. Guidelines and comments pertinent to the planned
development are provided herein.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                                 EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


The preliminary recommendations presented herein have been completed using the limited information
provided to us regarding site development. If the information concerning the proposed development is
revised, or any changes in the design and location of the proposed property improvements are made, the
preliminary conclusions and recommendations contained in this report shall not be considered applicable
unless the changes are reviewed and conclusions of this report modified or approved in writing by this
office. Further, we recommend that a supplemental, design-level geotechnical evaluation be performed at
the site. This supplemental evaluation would include additional subsurface exploration, laboratory testing
and engineering evaluation of field and laboratory data. It should be understood that based on the results
of the design-level geotechnical evaluation, recommendations that would supercede those presented
herein would be provided.

Site Preparation and Grading

Debris and other deleterious material, such as vegetation and organic topsoil, should be stripped from the
site prior to the start of grading. Only soils containing 3 percent organic content (or less) may be re-used
as fill soils onsite. Tentatively, our limited field evaluation has noted that organic-rich topsoil extends to
a depth on the order of 1 (+/-)-foot bgs; however, shallower and deeper areas should be anticipated. EEI
recommends that all concrete irrigation lines and underground utilities, septic systems, cisterns, and
cesspools be completely removed or abandoned following the City of Salinas and/or Monterey County
Department of Health guidelines. Subsurface areas disturbed by irrigation lines and utility demolition
should be properly backfilled. Initially, existing concrete irrigation lines should be carefully exposed and
evaluated for asbestos prior to removal and offsite disposal. The conduits should not be broken or
crushed prior to evaluation by an experienced environmental professional.

Areas to receive fill should be properly benched in accordance with current industry standards of practice
and guidelines specified in the CBC, 2007.

If unanticipated, subsurface improvements (utility lines, septic systems, wells, utilities, etc.) are
encountered during earthwork construction, the geotechnical engineer should be informed and appropriate
remedial recommendations would then be provided. Subsurface utilities (if any) should be properly
removed and abandoned.

Preliminary Removal and Remedial Earthwork

Based upon the limited subsurface data collected from the five (5) borings drilled within the Lowe's
parcel, removals are recommended to reprocess existing earth materials disturbed by farming and
cultivation. Additionally, remedial earthwork is anticipated to reprocess the upper portions of soft and
compressible alluvial soils within the building envelope and parking area. As discussed previously,
existing and proposed elevations have not been provided to this office; therefore, providing specific
removal and remedial earthwork depths are not practical for this limited geotechnical evaluation. Based
upon our field exploration, EEI estimates that the upper 2 feet of soils within the subject site have been
disturbed by long-term cultivation. Tentatively, EEI estimates that an additional 3 feet of native soils will
require reprocessing to limit the amount of settlement due to building and traffic loads, for an estimated
remedial earthwork depth of 5 feet of existing onsite soils within the building envelope. Independent of
remedial earthwork, EEI recommends that building foundations, including loading dock walls, should be
underlain by at least 2 to 3 feet of compacted fill.

Over-excavation and/or removals should be extended at least 10 feet outside the edge of
footings/foundations, as well as 10 feet outside the edge of entryways and canopies, loading docks, drive-
through approaches and other appurtenances attached to the main building. The limits of any over-
excavation should be further evaluated once a precise grading plan for the site with finish grade
elevation(s) is made available. Buried irrigation lines should be completely removed within the subject
development.

Following remedial earthwork, the bottom of the resulting excavations should be proof-rolled with a
tandem-axle dump truck, a water truck or similar rubber tired vehicle. Soils which are observed to rut or
deflect excessively under the moving load should be undercut and replaced with properly compacted fill.
The proof-rolling and undercutting activities should be observed by a representative of EEI and should be
performed during dry weather. It should be understood that based on our field representative's
observations, localized deeper removals may be recommended. Once removals are completed and
observed by EEI, the exposed bottom should be reprocessed/scarified to a depth of at least 6-inches,
moisture conditioned to at least optimum moisture content and compacted to a minimum of 92 percent (or
95 percent within 1½ feet of finish grade) of the maximum dry density (based on ASTM D-1557) prior to
placement of additional fill soils (Lowe's, 2009). Where not affected by existing surface improvements
boundaries, removals should be completed below a 1:1 projection down and away from the edge of any
settlement sensitive structure and/or limits of proposed fill.

Following removal of the disturbed soils within pavement areas (i.e., parking lot), the bottom of the
resulting excavation(s) should be observed by a representative of EEI to check that the unsuitable
materials have been sufficiently removed. It should be understood that based on our field representative's
observations, localized deeper removals may be recommended. Once removals are completed and
observed by EEI, the exposed bottom should be reprocessed/scarified to a depth of at least 6-inches,
moisture conditioned to at least optimum moisture content and compacted to a minimum of 92 percent (or
95 percent within 1½ feet of finish grade) of the maximum dry density (based on ASTM D-1557) prior to
placement of additional fill soils (Lowe's, 2009).

Decreasing the recommended depth of remedial earthwork within the building envelope may increase the
amount of total and/or differential settlement to levels that exceed Lowe's Development Criteria
tolerances; therefore, EEI should further evaluate settlement and the preliminary removal depths once
additional field borings are completed and grading plans are available.

Fill Placement

Lowe's guidelines, Section 02300 - Earthwork dictate that "clean" fill should consist of well graded
granular soils which are non-expansive and non-collapsible, and should have less than 20 percent by
weight passing the No. 200 sieve (Lowe's, 2009). EEI's laboratory evaluation and field observations
indicates that native soils are relatively easy to excavate, slightly moist to moist near the ground surface,
have a very low expansion potential and are non-collapsible below a depth of 5 to 5½ feet below the
existing ground surface. It is EEI's opinion that onsite non-organic native soils may be reused as fill
soils. Lowe's criteria allows for the use of onsite soils as fill materials provided they are moisture
conditioned (as needed) and blended with native finer-grained soils to create a blanket of compacted fill
with between 5 percent fines (soils passing the No. 200 sieve), and 20 percent fines (per Lowe's
guidelines). Based on our preliminary geotechnical evaluation, EEI recommends footings/foundations
should be underlain by at least 2 feet of compacted fill.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                               EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Lift thickness should be no more than 6-inches (uncompacted), and individually tested. Lowe's
Development Criteria indicates that fill materials placed at depths below 1½-foot of finish grade are to be
compacted to a minimum of 92 percent maximum density according to ASTM D-1557. We recommend
that these soils be compacted with moisture content of at least optimum (based on ASTM D-1557). Fill
materials placed within 1½ feet of finish pad grade should be moisture conditioned to at least optimum
moisture content and recompacted to at least 95 percent of the laboratory standard (ASTM D-1557)
within the building envelope, walkways, and pavement areas. All structural fill material should be free of
organic matter and have very low expansion potential.

Lowe's Development Criteria indicates that native earth materials containing rock fragments less than 6-
inches in one dimension can be placed within the building envelope up to 3 feet below proposed finish
grade, and up to 1½ feet below proposed subgrade outside the building envelope. Lowe's Development
Criteria also state that no fill materials should contain rock fragments exceeding 2-inches in one
dimension within 3 feet of proposed finish grade within the building envelope and within 1½ feet of
subgrade outside the building envelope.

If import soils are needed, the earthwork contractor should ensure that all proposed fill materials are
approved by the geotechnical engineer prior to use. Representative soil samples should be made available
for testing at least 10 working days prior to hauling to the site to allow for laboratory tests.

Shrinkage and Bulking

Shrinkage/bulking for the site has been estimated based upon our laboratory testing, visual site
observations during our subsurface exploration, and experience with similar soils, based on the results of
our preliminary evaluation. Tentatively, EEI estimates approximately 10 to 15 percent shrinkage of
native soils during earthwork onsite. These factors may vary with the method employed by the
contractor. Subsidence is estimated to be on the order of 0.15 feet. Losses from site clearing and removal
of disturbed and cultivated soils may affect earthwork quantity calculation and should be considered.
While not anticipated at the site, layers containing oversize cobble and boulder size materials within the
native alluvial soils can also be expected to affect earthwork quantities.


PRELIMINARY FOUNDATION RECOMMENDATIONS

General

The following conclusions and recommendations contained in this report are considered preliminary in
nature, and shall not be considered final. The preliminary foundation recommendations provided herein
may be used solely for planning purposes. Foundation recommendations are subject to further evaluation
and revision based upon EEI's findings during the design-level geotechnical evaluation.

Anticipated Structure Loads

Based on our review of the Lowe's Development Criteria, anticipated building design loads are as
follows: wall loads of 6 kips per foot; column loads of 100 kips; and floor slabs of 300 pounds per square
foot (psf) maximum live load.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                               EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Preliminary Foundation Design

The proposed structure can be supported on conventional continuous and isolated spread footings that are
bearing upon at least 24-inches of engineered fill compacted to at least 92 percent relative compaction
(ASTM D-1557). In preparation for foundation construction, the earthwork contractor should ensure that
the site has been prepared as recommended, and that field density tests have been performed to document
the relative compaction of all structural fill.

For preliminary purposes, footings can be designed to impose dead plus long term live load bearing
pressures of 3,000 pounds per square foot (psf). The allowable soil bearing value is based on a footing
having a minimum width of 12-inches and a minimum depth of 18-inches embedment below lowest
adjacent finish grade. The allowable soil bearing pressure can be increased by 300 psf for each additional
foot of embedment or width to a maximum value of 4,000 psf. The allowable soil bearing value can also
be increased by one-third when considering load combinations that include transient loading, including
wind or earthquake loads.

Horizontal loads acting on foundations and stem walls cast in open excavations against properly placed
and compacted fill will be resisted by friction acting along the base of the footing and by passive earth
pressures against the side of the footing and stem wall. The frictional resistance acting along the base of
footings founded on suitable foundation soils may be computed using a coefficient of friction equal to
0.35 with the normal dead load. Passive earth pressures acting against the side of footings and stem walls
may be assumed to be equivalent to a fluid weighing 300 pounds per cubic foot, provided the ground
surface in front of the footings is level. Passive pressure in the upper 1.0-foot should be neglected unless
confined by concrete slabs-on-grade or asphaltic pavement. The values given above may be increased by
one-third for transient wind or seismic loads.

Footing Setbacks

All footings should maintain a minimum 7-foot horizontal setback from the base of the footing to any
descending slope. This distance is measured from the outside footing face at the bearing elevation.
Footings should maintain a minimum horizontal setback of H/3 (H=slope height) from the base of the
footing to the descending slope face and should be no less than 7 feet, and it need not be greater than
40 feet.

Footings adjacent to unlined drainage swales or underground utilities (if any) should be deepened to a
minimum of 6-inches below the invert of the adjacent unlined swale or utilities. This distance is
measured from the outside footing face at the bearing elevation. Footings for structures adjacent to
retaining walls should be deepened so as to extend below a 1:1 upward projection from the heel of the
wall. Alternatively, walls may be designed to accommodate structural loads from buildings or
appurtenances as described in the retaining wall section of this report.

Construction

The following preliminary foundation construction considerations are presented as minimum
recommendations from a soils engineering standpoint. Laboratory test results indicate the onsite soils'
swell (expansion) potential is very low (i.e., EI  20). During grading of the site, we recommend that
expansive soil material (i.e., EI > 21) encountered should not be placed within 5 feet of finish grade, if
possible. Design parameters provided herein, therefore, assume that finish grade soil materials will have
a very low expansion potential.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                                EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4



Recommendations by the project's design-structural engineer or architect, which may exceed the soils
engineer's recommendations, should take precedence over the following minimum recommendations.
Final foundation design should be checked based on the expansion potential of the near surface soils
encountered during grading.

Concrete Slab-on-Grade

Cast-in place concrete guidelines are provided in Lowe's Development Criteria, Section 03300 (2008d).
Interior slabs should be supported solely by competent structural fill possessing a very low expansion
potential, whose placement has been observed/tested by the EEI (i.e., the project soils
engineer/engineering geologist). Lowe's building design criteria (Section 300; Lowe's, 2005) specify that
the concrete slab shall be at least 5-inches in thickness. The concrete slab should have steel reinforcement
designed by the structural engineer, per Lowe's requirements, or in accordance with the guidelines of the
local governing jurisdiction. For slab-on-grade concrete areas that will be impacted by heavy storage
racks and fork-lift traffic, a modulus of subgrade reaction of 200 psi/in can be used in design. The
concrete slab should be placed over at least 4-inches of free draining, crushed rock or gravel or Caltrans
Class 2 aggregate base material compacted to 98 percent relative compaction (ASTM D-1557) (Lowe's,
2006, 2009). To reduce the potential for potential buildup of hydrostatic pressures, the free draining
material under the slabs should have positive drainage with no depressions created. In-place density
testing of the aggregate slab base should be completed no more than 48 hours prior to concrete placement
(Lowe's, 2008d).

Floor slabs should be suitably reinforced and jointed (in accordance with the Structural Engineer's
recommendations) so that a small amount of independent movement can occur without causing damage.
The contractor should take the appropriate precautions to make sure the reinforcement is placed and
maintained within the middle one-third of the slab.

Exterior slabs, such as walkways and driveways, can be adequately supported on approved structural fill,
which is a minimum of 12-inches in thickness, compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction
(ASTM D-1557) with at least optimum moisture content.

In preparation for slab or flatwork construction, the earthwork contractor shall ensure that the onsite soils
have been prepared as recommended and that field density tests have been performed to document the
relative compaction of all structural fill. Preparation of the native soils should be documented prior to
placement of aggregate, structural components and/or fill.

Lowe's Development Criteria (2006) dictate that Portland Cement Concrete should have a minimum 28-
day compressive strength of at least 4,000 pounds per square inch (psi). Laboratory test results from two
representative samples of the upper soils indicated soluble sulfate concentrations of 47 and 80 milligrams
per kilogram (mg/kg) and chloride concentrations of 31 and 55 mg/kg. As a result, onsite soils appear to
have a negligible corrosion potential to concrete. Based on this information, Type II cement can be used
in concrete that will be in contact with the encountered soils.

All dedicated exterior flatwork should conform to standards provided by the governing agency including
section composition, supporting material thickness and any requirements for reinforcing steel. Concrete
mix proportions and construction techniques, including the addition of water and improper curing, can
adversely affect the finished quality of the concrete and result in cracking and spalling of the slab. We
recommend that all placement and curing be performed in accordance with procedures outlined by the
American Concrete Institute and/or Portland Cement Association. Special consideration should be given
to concrete placed and cured during windy, hot or cold weather conditions. Proper control joints and/or
reinforcing steel should be provided in accordance with the structural engineer's requirements to reduce
the potential for damage resulting from shrinkage.

Due to the potential for lateral vapor migration to occur associated with seasonal moisture change and
differences between the building interior and exterior ambient conditions, we recommend the use of a
vapor inhibitor in areas of the building where floor coverings are proposed. Consideration should be
given to utilizing at least 10 mil visqueen in these areas. For slabs-on-grade, the visqueen layer should be
placed below the crushed gravel or aggregate base and protected from puncturing by a minimum 2-inch
layer of sand.

Retaining Walls

The geotechnical design parameters provided below are considered preliminary, and assume that non-
expansive granular material (such as gravel wrapped in filter fabric) is used to backfill any retaining
walls. If expansive soils are used to backfill the proposed walls, increased active and at-rest earth
pressures will need to be utilized for retaining wall design, and may be provided upon request. Building
walls below grade should be water-proofed or damp-proofed, depending on the degree of moisture
protection desired. The foundation system for retaining walls should be designed in accordance with the
recommendations presented in the preceding sections of this report, as appropriate. Footings should be
embedded a minimum of 12-inches below lowest adjacent finish grade (excluding 6-inch landscape
layer). There should be no increase in bearing capacity for footing width.

If planned, mechanically-stabilized earth (MSE) walls should comply with guidelines provided in the
most recent version of Lowe's Development Criteria, Section 02800. MSE wall design should neglect
apparent cohesion within these soils.

For preliminary design purposes, the design active earth pressure on a standard retaining wall may be
considered equivalent to that produced by a fluid weighing 35 pounds per cubic foot (pcf). This design
equivalent fluid pressure of 35 pcf is appropriate for cantilevered walls retaining non-expansive soils
having a level ground surface, subject to lateral deflection at distances above grade due to earth pressure.
A safety factor for sliding and overturning of 1.5 is typically incorporated into the design of a cantilevered
structure as described. All retaining structures should be fully free draining. Restrained walls, with a
level backfill, should be designed for an equivalent fluid pressure of 55 pcf for at rest pressure.

For resistance to lateral loads, an allowable coefficient of friction of 0.35 between the base of the
foundation elements and underlying material is recommended. In addition, an allowable passive
resistance equal to an equivalent fluid weighing 300 pcf acting against the foundation may be used to
resist lateral forces, assuming a level ground surface in front of the wall. Passive pressure in the upper
1.0-foot should be neglected unless confined by concrete slabs-on-grade or asphaltic pavement. These
values can be increased by one-third for transient wind or seismic loads.

Lowe's of Salinas, Monterey County, California                               EEI Project No. LOW-71058.4


Adequate sub-drainage should be provided behind all retaining walls. The sub-drainage system should
consist of a minimum of a four-inch diameter perforated PVC pipe (schedule 40 or approved equivalent)
placed at the base of the retaining wall and surrounded by 3/4-inch clean crushed rock wrapped in a
Mirafi 140N filter fabric (or approved equivalent). The crushed rock wrapped in fabric should be at least
12-inches wide and extend from the base of the wall to within 2 feet of the ground surface. The upper 2
feet of backfill should consist of compacted native soil. The retaining wall drainage system should be
directed by gravity to an outlet, into the storm drain system or other appropriate facility.

The City of Salinas does not provide retaining wall standard drawings (City of Salinas, 2008); therefore,
retaining wall plans should to be designed by a structural engineer and approved by the City Engineer.


PRELIMINARY PAVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Deleterious material, excessively wet or dry pockets, concentrated zones of oversized rock fragments, and
any other unsuitable yielding materials encountered during grading should be removed. Once existing
compacted fill and/or native soils are brought to proposed pavement subgrade elevations, the subgrade
should be proof-rolled in order to check for a uniform firm and unyielding surface. All grading and fill
placement should be observed by representatives of the project geotechnical engineer.

As indicated in the Lowe's Development Criteria, the upper 18-inches of pavement subgrade soils should
be moisture conditioned to at least optimum moisture content and compacted to at least 95-percent of the
laboratory standard (ASTM D-1557). Rock fragments over 2-inches in one dimension are not allowed
within the upper 18-inches of subgrade (Lowe's, 2009). If loose materials are encountered during
subgrade preparation, evaluation should be performed by the project geotechnical engineer at that time.
Class 2 aggregate base used in the pavement structural section should be properly prepared (i.e.,
processed and moisture conditioned) and compacted to at least 98 percent of the representative laboratory
standard ASTM D-1557 (Lowe's, 2006; 2008b). Aggregate base material should conform to Caltrans
specifications for Class 2 aggregate base (minimum "R" value = 78).

All pavement section changes should be properly transitioned. Although not anticipated, if adverse
conditions are encountered during the preparation of subgrade materials, special construction methods
may need to be employed. A representative of the project geotechnical engineer should be present for the
preparation of subgrade and aggregate base.

As noted above, a representative bulk sample of the existing near-surface earth materials obtained from
Boring B6 was found to possess an R-Value of 34 (Appendix B). A modulus of subgrade reaction (k-
value) was estimated at 100 pounds per square inch per inch (psi/in) for an R-Value of 34
(Lindeburg, 1994).

Pavement design was calculated for the parking lot structural section requirements for asphalt concrete
using Lowe's Development Criteria guidelines. In accordance with Lowe's Development Criteria, traffic
loading consisting of 2,500 passenger vehicles per day was assumed for standard duty pavement areas,
and traffic loading consisting of 2,500 passenger vehicles and 25 loaded trucks was assumed for the
heavy duty pavement areas (including trash dumpster and truck loading dock areas). These loadings
equate to Traffic Index (TI) values of 5.5 and 7.0 for these areas, respectively. Based upon the use of the
existing upper materials found on site as a subgrade and the anticipated traffic loadings for a fifteen-year
design life, EEI proposes the recommended pavement sections presented below

The recommended pavement sections provided are intended as a minimum guideline. If thinner or highly
variable pavement sections are constructed, increased maintenance and repair could be expected. If the
ADT (average daily traffic) or ADTT (average daily truck traffic) increases beyond that intended, as
reflected by the assumed and provided traffic indices used for design, increased maintenance and repair
could be required for the pavement section. Final pavement design should be checked by testing of soils
exposed at subgrade after grading has been completed. This final pavement design could result in thinner
or thicker pavement structural sections than the preliminary recommendations presented above.

Hot-mix asphalt paving should conform to the most recent version Lowe's criteria Section 02741
(Lowe's, 2008b) or the requirements of the local governing jurisdiction, whichever is more stringent.
Portland Cement Concrete pavement, curb and gutter construction should conform to the most recent
version of Lowe's Criteria Section 02751 (Lowe's, 2008c) or the requirements of the local governing
jurisdiction, whichever is more stringent.

DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

Landscape Maintenance and Planting

Water is known to decrease the physical strength of earth materials, significantly reducing stability by
high moisture conditions. Surface drainage away from foundations and graded slopes should be
maintained. Only the volume and frequency of irrigation necessary to sustain plant life should be applied.

Consideration should be given to selecting light weight, deep rooted types of landscape vegetation which
require low irrigation that are capable of surviving the local climate. From a soils engineering viewpoint,
"leaching" of the onsite soils is not recommended for establishing landscaping. If landscape soils are
processed for the addition of amendments, the processed soils should be re-compacted to at least 90
percent relative compaction (based on ASTM D-1557).

Site Drainage

Positive site drainage should be maintained at all times. Drainage should not flow uncontrolled over
slopes or the subject parcel. Runoff should be channeled away from slopes and structures and not
allowed to pond and/or seep uncontrolled into the ground. Pad drainage should be directed toward an
acceptable outlet. Although not required from a geotechnical viewpoint, roof gutters and down spouts are
recommended to control roof drainage, discharging a minimum of 10 feet from proposed structures, or
into a subsurface drainage system. Consideration should be given to eliminating open bottom planters
directly adjacent to proposed structures for a minimum distance of 10 feet. As an alternative, closed-
bottom type planters could be utilized, with a properly designed drain outlet placed in the bottom of the
planter.

Stormwater Disposal Systems

It is EEI understanding that current plans call for runoff generated from the project to be disposed of in
engineered subsurface features onsite, such as a detention area off the western portion of the garden
center. Percolation testing and other subsurface permeability testing was not a part of EEI's preliminary
evaluation of the subject property. The City of Salinas requires new development to provide stormwater
detention or retention systems for runoff (City of Salinas, 2004). As a result, future studies should
include a proper evaluation of the suitability of native soils for subsurface disposal of stormwater runoff.
EEI can provide these services upon request. Storm water disposal systems should be designed in
accordance with the City of Salinas Stormwater Development Standards (City of Salinas, 2010) and
Storm Water Master Plan (City of Salinas, 2004).

Additional Site Improvements

Recommendations for additional grading, exterior concrete flatwork design and construction can be
provided upon request. If in the future, additional property improvements are planned for the site,
recommendations concerning the design and construction of these improvements would be provided upon
request.

Trenching

Vertical excavations will be unstable, and should be properly shored and/or sloped at a minimum
temporary gradient of 1:1 (horizontal to vertical) to a maximum height of 10 feet without further
evaluation, unless loose, running sands and/or gravel/cobble/boulder layers are encountered. Temporary
excavations over 5 feet in height should be evaluated by the project engineer, and will likely require
shoring, sloping, or a combination thereof. All excavations should conform to OSHA and local safety
codes.

Footing trench excavations for structures and walls should be observed and approved by a representative
of the project soils engineer prior to placing reinforcement. Footing trench spoil and excess soils
generated from utility trench excavations should be compacted to a minimum relative compaction of 92
percent; (based on ASTM D-1557) if not removed from the site. All excavations should conform to
OSHA and local safety codes.

Backfill

Fill around the pipe should be placed in accordance with details shown on the drawings, and should be
placed in layers not to exceed 8-inches loose (unless otherwise approved by the geotechnical engineer)
and compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density as determined in accordance with
ASTM D-1557 (Modified Proctor), pursuant to the City of Salinas Standards (2008). The geotechnical
engineer should approve all backfill material. Select material should be used when called for on the
drawings, or when required by the geotechnical engineer. Care should be taken during backfill and
compaction operations to maintain alignment and prevent damage to the joints. The backfill should be
kept free from stones, chunks of highly plastic clay, or other objectionable material. Although allowed in
certain cases by the City of Salinas, EEI recommends against utilizing jetting to compact utility trenches.

All pipe backfill areas should be graded and maintained in such a condition that erosion or saturation will
not damage the pipe bed or backfill. Heavy equipment should not be operated over any pipe until it has
been properly backfilled with a minimum 2 to 3 feet of cover. The utility trench should be systematically
backfilled to allow maximum time for natural settlement. Backfill should not occur over porous, wet, or
spongy subgrade surfaces. Should these conditions exist, the areas should be removed, replaced and
recompacted.

Utility line backfill and construction procedures should adhere to the most recent versions of Lowe's
Development Criteria (Sections 02300; 02510; 02530; and 02630) or the City of Salinas Standards
(2008), whichever is more stringent.


PLAN REVIEW

Once detailed site and grading plans are available, they should be submitted to this office for review to
reduce the potential for discrepancies between the preliminary site plan (AMS, 2010), future detailed
site/grading plans and preliminary recommendations presented herein. The detailed plans would also be
used during the design-level geotechnical evaluation. If conditions are found to differ substantially from
those stated, appropriate recommendations would be provided. Additional field studies in conjunction
with a design-level geotechnical evaluation are warranted to comply with Lowe's Development Criteria.

OBSERVATION AND TESTING DURING CONSTRUCTION

It is recommended that EEI be retained to provide geotechnical observation and testing services during
site preparation, site grading, utility construction, foundation excavation and other earthwork
construction. This is to observe that the design concepts, specifications and recommendations have been
adequately completed during construction and to allow for possible changes in the event that subsurface
conditions differ from those anticipated prior to the start of construction.

It should be understood that if another firm performs these functions without working under the direct
supervision of EEI, that firm would then assume responsibility as Geotechnical Engineer-of-Record for
the project. In such a case, the firm should provide Lowe's with a letter indicating they have reviewed
EEI's geotechnical report and accept the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report. The
letter should also provide any revisions to the recommendations deemed appropriate by the firm.


LIMITATIONS

This preliminary geotechnical evaluation has been conducted in accordance with generally accepted
geotechnical engineering principles and practices; however, as authorized by Lowe's project
management, this study was not completed in accordance with Lowe's HIW Site Development Criteria
and Specifications. Additional field studies are needed. Findings provided herein have been derived in
accordance with current standards of practice, and no warranty is expressed or implied. Standards of
practice are subject to change with time. This report has been prepared for the sole use of Lowe's
(Client), within a reasonable time from its authorization. Site conditions, land use (both onsite and
offsite), or other factors may change as a result of manmade influences, and additional work may be
required with the passage of time.

This preliminary evaluation should not be relied upon by other parties without the express written consent
of EEI and the Client; therefore, any use or reliance upon this geotechnical evaluation by a party other
than the Client shall be solely at the risk of such third party and without legal recourse against EEI, its
employees, officers, or directors, regardless of whether the action in which recovery of damages is
brought or based upon contract, tort, statue, or otherwise. The Client has the responsibility to see that all
parties to the project, including the designer, contractor, subcontractor, and building official, etc. are
aware of this report in it's complete form. This report contains information which may be used in the
preparation of contract specifications; however, the report is not designed as a specification document,
and may not contain sufficient information for use without additional assessment. EEI assumes no
responsibility or liability for work or testing performed by others. In addition, this report may be subject
to review by the controlling authorities.

Cloverfield Management LLC is proposing development of an approximately 20.23-acre site in
the City of Salinas. Approximately 17.49 acres would be developed with a retail shopping center,
with a storm water detention/retention facility planned on the remaining 2.74 acres. The site has
historically been in agricultural row crop production. A specific plan is being prepared to provide
guidance on how the site is to be developed.

The proposed project consists of approximately 207,500 square feet of retail commercial space.
The anchor tenant is anticipated to be a Lowe's home improvement store, with 121,000 square
feet of indoor retail space and 31,500 square feet of outdoor garden center space. Satellite retail
building pads are planned which total approximately 55,000 square feet. Planned ancillary
improvements/infrastructure include a parking field, internal site pedestrian walkways and
trails, landscaping, storm water management facilities including bioswales and a stormwater
detention/retention pond, transit stops and bicycle lanes along the project frontage, and on- and
off-site circulation improvements. The City of Salinas has discretionary approval authority for
the proposed project.

This Gateway Greenhouse Gas Analysis Report (hereinafter "Report") has been prepared to
support the City's California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analysis process. This Report
includes the following four sections:

2.1      C LIMATE C HANGE B ACKGROUND AND C ONTEXT
Human induced climate change is a global phenomenon. It is the result of the cumulative
activities of humans over time that release greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere and
remove vegetation, forests, and other biological resources that naturally absorb carbon. Because
the range of GHG generating activities is large, the geographic distribution of those activities is
global, and the actual physical changes created by global warming are variable and complex, it is
difficult to determine the magnitude of effect of any one project or GHG emitting activity on
global climate change. For this reason, the CEQA analysis of any one project's impact on
climate change is inherently an evaluation of its cumulative impact. If a project's contribution of
GHG is considered cumulatively substantial, the project would have a cumulatively significant
impact on climate change.


Recognition and Response

The international scientific community has concluded with a high degree of confidence that
human activities are causing an accelerated warming of the atmosphere. The resulting change in
climate has serious global implications and consequently, human activities that contribute to
climate change may have a potentially significant effect on the environment. In the past several
years, concern about climate change and its potential impacts have risen dramatically. That
concern has translated into a range of international treaties aimed at diminishing the rate at
which global warming is occurring. The federal government has begun to tackle concerns about
climate change through a range of initiatives and regulatory actions. Many states and local
agencies, private sector interests, and other public and private interests have also taken the

initiative to combat climate change. At the state level, California has taken a leadership role in
tackling climate change, as evidenced by the programs outlined in the Regulatory Setting section
below.


Causes and Effects of Climate Change

Temperatures at the Earth's surface increased by an estimated 1.4°F (0.8°C) between 1900 and
2005. The past decade was the warmest of the past 150 years and perhaps the past millennium.
The warmest 22 years on record have occurred since 1980, and 2005 was the warmest on record.
Scientific consensus is that this warming is largely the result of emissions of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases from human activities including industrial processes, fossil fuel
combustion, and changes in land use, such as deforestation.

Unaddressed, climate change will have significant impacts across the United States and around
the world. The generalized potential effects of climate change in California have been
summarized in the Climate Action Team Report to Governor Schwarzenegger and the Legislature
(California Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] 2006). Among the key effects are:
substantially reduced availability of water supply; economic impacts resulting from reduced
winter recreation; temperature increases projected at 8.0 to 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit under more
severe emissions scenarios; exacerbation and acceleration of coastal erosion; impacts on surface
water quality from seawater intrusion into the Sacramento Delta; general decline in agricultural
production resulting from increased scarcity of water supply; increased vulnerability of natural
areas and agricultural production from rising temperatures and increases in potential pest
infestation; increased growth rates and expanded ranges of weeds, insect pests, and pathogens
with elevated temperatures; and increased energy demand especially during hot summer
months. Two more recent studies provide further related information: Climate Action Team Draft
Biennial Report (California EPA 2009) and The Future is Now: An Update on Climate Change Science
Impacts and Response Options for California (California Climate Change Center 2009).


Greenhouse Gases

Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. GHG are emitted by natural
processes and human activities. The human-produced GHG most responsible for global
warming and their relative contribution it are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), near surface
ozone (O3), nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The relative contribution of
these types of GHG to global warming is summarized in Table 1.

California ranks as the 12th to 16th largest emitter of CO2 in the world and is responsible for
approximately two percent of the world's CO2 emissions. Within California, 82 percent of the
GHG emissions, generated in the form of CO2, are from combustion of fossil fuel, primarily in
the transportation and electricity generation sectors. About 41.2 percent of all GHG emitted

come from the transportation sector. Industry emissions and electricity generation are the second
and third largest categories. Emissions by sector in California are presented in Table 2, Sector
Shares of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (California Energy Commissions June 2005 and EPA
2006).

Greenhouse Gas Global Warming Potentials

Each type of GHG has a different capacity to trap heat in the atmosphere and each type remains
in the atmosphere for a particular length of time. The ability of a GHG to trap heat is measured
by an index called the global warming potential. Carbon dioxide is considered the baseline GHG
in this index and has a global warming potential of one. Methane has a global warming potential
of 21 times that of CO2 and N2O has a global warming potential of 310 times that of CO2. The
families of chlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons have a substantially
greater global warming potential than other GHG, generally ranging from approximately 1,300
to over 10,000 times that of CO2. While CO2 represents the vast majority of the total volume of
GHG released into the atmosphere, the release of even small quantities of other types of GHG
can be significant for their contribution to climate change.

                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Transportation Impact Study (TIS) document is intended as a supplemental to the
overall development submittal for the proposed Restaurant Depot development project,
located in the City of Greenwood Village, Colorado. The following is a summary of the traffic
information and findings included in this report.
   1. Restaurant Depot, a national membership-only wholesale supplier of restaurant goods
      and products, is proposing to construct a new store to be located at 6875 South
      Clinton Street in the City of Greenwood Village, Colorado. The site is located in the
      northwest corner of the S Clinton Street and E Costilla Avenue intersection bound by
      S Clinton Street on the north and east sides of the property, E Costilla Avenue along
      the south and an adjacent commercial property to the west.
   2. The project concept site plan has been provided and is shown on Exhibit 2, herein.
      There are currently two accesses to the property--one along S Clinton Street and the
      other on E Costilla Avenue. The E Costilla Avenue driveway, located approximately
      175 feet west of the S Clinton Street intersection, is expected to be relocated
      approximately 50 feet to the west, while the S Clinton Street driveway is expected to
      be relocated approximately 80 feet to the north, with an additional driveway access
      proposed for service vehicles and trucks to be located further to the north along S
      Clinton Street. The northern driveway along S Clinton Street will be a ¾ movement
      access for service vehicles and trucks only, providing access to the loading docks
      along the backside (west side) of the store. The southbound right-turn in, northbound
      left-turn in and eastbound right-turn out movements will be allowed. The relocated
      driveway will be a public driveway located between the service access and S Clinton
      Court. The driveway will be a ¾ movement access with the southbound right-turn in,
      northbound left-turn in and eastbound right-turn out movements allowed.
   3. The approximately 6.5 acre parcel, previously occupied by the Country Dinner
      Playhouse, is proposed to be development by Restaurant Depot as an exclusive land
      use for the property. The 55,341 square foot (SF) facility will not be open to the
      general public but to members only. The store hours of operation will be 7:00 AM to
      6:00 PM Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM on Saturdays and 8:00 AM to
      3:00 PM on Sundays. Surface parking is proposed on the site adjacent to the
      roadway, with the single building setback on the property. At the time of this report,
      construction of the store is anticipated, upon approval by the City of Greenwood
      Village, to be completed in 2012.
   4. Based on existing trip data collected at the similar sized and functioning Portland,
      Oregon Restaurant Depot store, the proposed Greenwood Village location is
      anticipated to generate 545 daily trips, with 35 of those trips occurring during the AM
      peak hour, 58 during the noon hour and 27 during the PM peak hour. Of the daily
      trips, 73 are anticipated to be trucks (a combination of inbound and outbound trips),

Executive Summary                                                             October 2011


     with 7 truck trips during the AM peak hour, 12 during the noon hour and none during
     the PM peak hour.
  5. The analysis horizons considered and evaluated in this report include: the existing
     conditions; the long range no project conditions, which represents the future without
     the proposed project in the Year 2030; the short-term with project conditions, which
     represents the future Year 2012 including the Restaurant Depot store; and the long
     range with project conditions, which represents the future Year 2030 including the full
     build-out of the development project.
  6. With a level of service D as the target operation for signalized overall intersections
     and unsignalized minor street approaches, the existing study area intersections were
     reported to currently be operating at acceptable levels during the weekday AM, noon
     and PM peak hours. The queue analysis results were reviewed to determine if the
     vehicle stacking along the approaches to the study area intersections would be
     expected to extend back to adjacent intersections. The queues were also evaluated to
     determine if vehicle stacking is expected to extend out of turn lane storage bays or if
     the through lane queues would be expected to block access to turn lanes. Queue
     deficiencies were identified at three existing study area intersections.
  7. The long range no project conditions include the addition of ambient growth in the
     area over the next 19 years. No capacity deficiencies were reported at the study area
     intersections. Deficient queues were reported at each of the study area intersections
     with the exception of E Costilla Avenue & S Dayton Street.
  8. The short-term with project conditions include the ambient growth in background traffic
     for one year plus the addition of trips related to the Restaurant Depot project.
     Roadway modifications associated with providing the project driveways include:
            The ¾ movement access for the service driveway along S Clinton Street will be
            accommodated by the addition of a center two-way left-turn lane contained
            within the existing striped center median for the northbound left-turn in and
            signage and striping to restrict the left-turn out movement. The new striping
            along S Clinton Street would allow for the existing northbound left-turn lane at
            the Target access to be maintained.
            The ¾ movement access for the public driveway along S Clinton Street will be
            accomplished with the northbound left-turn in also being serviced with the
            addition of a center two-way left-turn lane and signage and striping to restrict
            the left-turn out movement. The new striping along S Clinton Street would allow
            for the existing southbound left-turn lane at S Clinton Court to be maintained.
            Full movement access for the south driveway along E Costilla Avenue, which is
            proposed to be shifted approximately 50 feet to the west, will be
            accommodated with some minor centerline restriping.
     The resulting capacity analysis indicated the intersections are expected to continue to
     operate at acceptable levels for the short-term with project conditions. The same three
     intersections as for the existing conditions are expected to have queue deficiencies in
     the short-term with project condition.

Executive Summary                                                                October 2011


  9. For the long range with project conditions, the study area intersections will continue to
     function at the same level as identified for the long range no project conditions, with all
     of the study area intersections operating at acceptable levels. Deficient queues are
     expected at the same three study area intersections as for the long range no project
     conditions.
  10. No roadway improvements were identified since there were no capacity deficiencies
      reported for the study area intersections and the queue deficiencies reported were
      either the same as for the no project conditions or minor.
  11. The results of the sight distance evaluation conducted along S Clinton Street at the
      two proposed project driveways found that the current site plan layout does not
      conflict with the horizontal sight lines required. S Clinton Street has a positive grade
      traveling north to south, placing both the service driveway and the public driveway at a
      higher elevation than the conflicting traffic. As a result, there are no roadway
      interferences due to the topography. In addition, gaps are expected to be created by
      the adjacent signalized intersection at Target for the few trucks per hour using the
      service driveway access and for cars exiting out of the public driveway.
  12. No additional mitigation measures were identified as a result of the proposed project
      traffic in addition to the S Clinton Street and E Costilla Avenue modifications to
      accommodate site access movements. The result of the roadway modifications to
      accommodate the three site accesses, if implemented, is expected to be all of the
      study area overall signalized intersections and unsignalized intersection approaches
      operating at LOS D or better.
  13. Based on the analysis, findings and conclusions discussed in this report, the
      recommendation to the City of Greenwood Village staff is that the site plan and land
      use proposed for the Restaurant Depot project be approved for development with the
      roadway improvements and site access design modifications identified in this report.
  14. The recommended improvements associated with the proposed project are
      summarized in Table 11 as part of the Summary & Recommendations chapter at the
      end of the report.

Project Overview
Restaurant Depot, a national membership-only wholesale supplier of restaurant goods and
products, is proposing to construct a new store to be located at 6875 South Clinton Street in
the City of Greenwood Village, Colorado. The site is located in the northwest corner of the S
Clinton Street and E Costilla Avenue intersection bound by S Clinton Street on the north and
east sides of the property, E Costilla Avenue along the south and an adjacent commercial
property to the west. The approximately 6.5 acre parcel, previously occupied by the Country
Dinner Playhouse, which was recently closed and the building demolished and cleared of the
site, is proposed to be development by Restaurant Depot as an exclusive land use for the
property. The 55,341 square foot (SF) facility will not be open to the general public but to
members only. The store hours of operation will be 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through
Friday, 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM on Saturdays and 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM on Sundays. Surface
parking is proposed on the site adjacent to the roadway, with the single building setback on
the property. At the time of this report, construction of the store is anticipated, upon approval
by the City of Greenwood Village, to be completed in 2012.

Customers and service vehicles for the Restaurant Depot are expected to be regional. Direct
access to the site will be provided by S Clinton Street, which intersects Arapahoe Road to
the north of the site and Dry Creek Boulevard to the south, and by E Costilla Avenue.
Regional access to the area is provided primarily by Interstate 25 (I-25), with the closest
interchange accesses via Arapahoe Road (approximately ½ mile north of the site) and Dry
Creek Road (approximately 1.5 miles to the south of the site), and by Arapahoe Road.
Arapahoe Road is an east-west, six-lane principal arterial roadway north of the project site,
which extends continuously for approximately 16 miles through the City of Greenwood
Village, between the Cities of Littleton and Centennial. S Clinton Street, which is adjacent to
the proposed development, is a continuous four-lane roadway between Arapahoe Road and
Dry Creek Road.

There are currently two accesses to the property--one along S Clinton Street and the other
on E Costilla Avenue. The E Costilla Avenue driveway, located approximately 175 feet west
of the S Clinton Street intersection, is expected to be relocated approximately 50 feet to the
west, while the S Clinton Street driveway is expected to be relocated approximately 80 feet
to the north, with an additional driveway access proposed for service vehicles and trucks
further to the north along S Clinton Street. The northern driveway will be for service vehicles
and trucks only, providing access to the loading docks along the backside (west side) of the
store, while the relocated driveway will be a public access located between the service
driveway and S Clinton Court. A ¾ movement access is proposed for both the service
driveway and the public driveway, with no left-turns out allowed. A center two-way left-turn
lane would be required to accommodate the northbound left-turn movement at the new
service driveway and at the public access along S Clinton Street.

Introduction                                                                       October 2011



Purpose of Report
The purpose of this study is to review, assess and identify potential traffic related impacts
that the proposed project may have on the transportation network and recommend mitigation
to minimize these impacts where necessary and possible. Exhibit 1 shows the general
vicinity of the project in the City of Greenwood Village. The site plan is still being refined but
the most recent concept has been provided as Exhibit 2, which shows the building location
on the property and the proposed location of driveway accesses.

The City of Greenwood Village staff has indicated that a Transportation Impact Study (TIS) is
required to be submitted as part of the development process for the Restaurant Depot
development project. The assumptions utilized in conducting the traffic analysis are based on
direction received from City of Greenwood Village staff via a scoping meeting on June 8,
2011 and subsequent conversations and e-mail correspondence with City staff, as
established in the Transportation Impact Study Analysis Assumptions Memorandum,
prepared by Martin/Martin and sent to Tom Reiff of the City of Greenwood Village, dated
June 29, 2011. In addition, modifications to the analysis assumptions were identified with the
City staff in a conference call on August 31, 2011 to discuss comments on the draft traffic
study, as documented in the project team response to comments, and through subsequent
phone conversations and e-mail correspondence.

This report includes an evaluation and assessment of the study area for the existing
conditions, short-term conditions and the long range conditions. The short-term conditions
considered the potential impact within the study area related to completion of the
development by evaluating the year the land use is anticipated to be occupied (Year 2012).
The long range conditions considered both the potential impact of any planned changes
within the study area and related to the project approximately 20 years into the future (Year
2030).

Resources
The key resources referenced in completing this TIS included the following:
   1. The City of Greenwood Village Transportation Impact Study Standards, which is a
      document in draft form currently being developed to provide the criteria and
      requirements for analysis to be conducted and information to be included in a

Study Conditions
Study Area
The project study area for the TIS was determined in the traffic scoping discussion with the
City of Greenwood Village staff. As a result, the report includes an evaluation of the
roadways immediately adjacent to the property: S Clinton Street, E Costilla Avenue, S
Clinton Court and S Dayton Street. Consequently, the following seven intersections (four
existing, one proposed new site access and two slightly relocated site accesses) were
evaluated and included in the analysis:
    1. The S Clinton Street & Target existing signalized intersection.
    2. The S Clinton Street & Service Driveway Access proposed side-street stop-controlled
       T-intersection.
    3. The S Clinton Street & Public Driveway Access side-street stop-controlled T-intersection.

Analysis Horizons
The following four conditions were analyzed as part of this study during the AM, noon and
PM peak hours, with the corresponding volume and network configurations as indicated:
   1. Existing Conditions
      Analysis of the existing conditions at the study area intersections were based on the
      turning movement volumes collected in June of 2011, signal timing provided by City of
      Greenwood Village staff and the intersection geometry and traffic control as observed
      in the field.
   2. Long Range No Project Conditions
      The long range conditions included the best available information for projecting the
      situation approximately 20 years into the future for the study area to the Year 2030. A
      long range no project condition analysis, without the proposed land use and
      associated trip additions, was performed as a comparison for the with project (build)
      condition. The City of Greenwood Village staff informed the project team that the most
      recent report for the I-25/Arapahoe Road Interchange project proposes no changes in
      the Restaurant Depot study area. As a result, the analysis included no planned
      roadway improvements.
      The long range no project condition volumes were calculated by applying growth
      projections developed from a variety of sources including City of Greenwood Village
      historic count data and ongoing studies of the I-25/Arapahoe Road Interchange, which
      include the roadways within the project study area. Factors ranging from negative
      growth to as high as 1.4% average annual growth rates were identified. Different
      growth rates for the roadways within the project study area were determined and
      applied to future projections already being developed for the area.
      A short-term no project condition was not analyzed as the Restaurant Depot
      development is anticipated to be completed within a year. Instead, the existing
      conditions were utilized as a comparison to the short-term with project conditions to
      determine project-related impacts to the transportation system.
   3. Short-Term With Project Conditions
      The short-term future year analysis included the same roadway geometry as for the
      existing conditions, with the exception of the new driveway access and relocated
      driveway access along S Clinton Street for the proposed project, and the associated
      proposed striping modifications along S Clinton Street, and the slightly relocated
      driveway access along E Costilla Avenue. The forecast volumes were calculated by
      applying a growth rate for one year to the existing volumes and adding the trips
      associated with the proposed Restaurant Depot development project.
   4. Long Range With Project Conditions
      The long range future year analysis included the same roadway geometry as for the
      long range no project conditions, with the addition of the service driveway and
      relocated public access along S Clinton Street and the relocated driveway access
      along E Costilla Avenue as discussed for the short-term with project conditions. The

       forecast volumes were calculated by combining the long range no project volumes
       with the site-generated trips related to the proposed Restaurant Depot development
       project.

Analysis Methodology
The various analyses conducted and reported on in this document include intersection
capacity analysis, intersection queuing analysis and site access sight distance evaluations.

Capacity Analysis

The analyses described in this report were performed in the Synchro, Version 7 traffic model
in accordance with the procedures in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and as described
below. The analysis and procedures conducted are based upon the worst case conditions
that occur during a typical weekday. Therefore, most of each weekday and the weekends will
experience traffic conditions better than those described within this document, which
represent the peak hours of operation only.

Level of Service (LOS) is an empirical premise developed by the transportation profession to
quantify driver perception for such elements as travel time, number of stops, total amount of
stopped delay, and impediments caused by other vehicles afforded to drivers who utilize the
transportation network. LOS has been defined by the Transportation Research Board in the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual. This document has quantified level of service into a range
from "A" which indicates little, if any, vehicle delay, to "F" which indicates significant vehicle
delay and traffic congestion that may lead to system breakdown due to volumes that may far
exceed capacity.

The calculation of level of service at both signalized and unsignalized intersections are
examined in the HCM. The HCM defines the level of service for a signalized intersection as
the average delay per vehicle (amount of time a vehicle must spend at the intersection) for
the overall intersection. For unsignalized intersections that include both stop-controlled and
uncontrolled approaches (known as through/stop controlled), the HCM defines the level of
service as the average delay per vehicle for the worst approach, not the overall intersection.

The level of service letter grades as defined by the Transportation Research Board and the
associated amount of delay in seconds per vehicle, as well as a brief description of the
operating condition, for both signalized and unsignalized intersections are included for
reference in Table 1 on the next page.

The City of Greenwood Village has established level of service D as the target intersection
operating condition. Analysis results indicating operations worse than the target level were
considered for roadway improvements in the no project conditions and for mitigation
measures in the with project conditions. In the cases where existing conditions currently
operate at or future background conditions are projected to operate at states poorer than the
target level, the future with project conditions will be evaluated to maintain the current or
projected operating conditions.

Queuing Analysis

The queuing analyses in this traffic study were reported as the 95th percentile calculated
length in feet. The analysis was conducted by transferring the model developed in Synchro to
the compatible SimTraffic simulation software. The calculated lengths were then compared to
the available actual storage length for each movement at the study area intersections.
Roadway improvements for no project conditions and mitigation measures for with project
conditions were considered for the analysis results that indicated queue lengths for turn lanes
that exceed the available storage lengths, queues that extend back through adjacent
intersections or queues that block access to turn lanes.

Sight Distance Evaluation

At the request of the City of Greenwood Village staff, the sight distance available at the two
proposed site access driveways along S Clinton Street were evaluated. The American
Associations of State Highway and Transportation Officials' (AASHTO) Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets (2004) was used to determine the required sight distances for each
location. The requirements were calculated based on a speed of 30 mph, which is the signed
speed limit for S Clinton Street. With no left-turn out movements allowed at the service
driveway and the public driveway, sight distances associated with right turns from a stopped
condition were the only movements necessary to be evaluated.

                     EXISTING CONDITIONS

The purpose of this section is to document the existing conditions within the study area for
the proposed Restaurant Depot development project. The aerial photography and roadway
images were obtained via the Internet from Google Maps or from photos taken in the field.

Land Use
The property at 6875 South Clinton Street is
currently vacant. The previous occupant of the
property was Country Dinner Playhouse; however,
the business was closed and the building
demolished and cleared of the site.

Roadway Conditions
The following is a list of the surrounding streets, their functional classification, and general
geometry.

S Clinton Street is a north-south collector
roadway that provides connectivity over the 1.5
miles between Arapahoe Road and Dry Creek
Road. The four-lane roadway provides two lanes
in each direction, with left-turn lanes at all
intersections and driveway accesses. The
roadway is signed at 30 mph within the study
area.

E Costilla Avenue is an east-west collector roadway that extends approximately ¾ mile from
just west of S Clinton Street to S Havana Street.
The roadway provides one lane in each direction
and a center left-turn lane between S Clinton
Street and S Fulton Street and two lanes in each
direction and a center left-turn lane from S Fulton
Street to S Havana Street. The roadway is signed
at 30 mph within the project study area.

S Clinton Court is a one-block long north-south
local roadway that extends between S Clinton
Street and Arapahoe Road. The two-lane roadway
accommodates on-street parking and has a
posted speed limit of 30 mph.

S Dayton Street is a north-south collector
roadway that extends approximately three miles to
the north from E Costilla Avenue. The two-lane
roadway has a posted speed limit of 30 mph in the
study area.

Study Area Intersections
The project study area intersections were identified through a scoping discussion with the
City of Greenwood Village staff. The study encompasses five existing intersections, which
are illustrated in Exhibit 3 and described as follows.

S Clinton Street and Target Access meet at a
four-legged signalized intersection. The S Clinton
Street northbound and southbound approaches
both provide one left-turn lane, one through lane
and one shared through/right-turn lane. The          N                         Bank of the
northbound approach left-turn lane provides                                    West Access
approximately 125-feet of storage, while the
southbound approach left-turn lane offers 150-
feet. The eastbound approach is an access to a
retail center including a Target and provides one
shared left-turn/through lane and one right-turn         Target
lane with about 60-feet of storage. The westbound        Access
approach is an access to a Bank of the West and                                 S Clinton St
provides one shared lane.



S Clinton Street and S Clinton Court meet at a                               S Clinton Ct
three-legged intersection with no eastbound
approach and stop-control for the westbound
approach. Along S Clinton Street the northbound
approach provides a through lane and a shared
through/right-turn lane, while the southbound
approach includes a left-turn lane with
approximately 50-feet of storage and two through
lanes. The S Clinton Court westbound approach is
one left-turn lane and one right-turn lane with        N              S Clinton St
approximately 50-feet of storage.

Traffic Volumes
Traffic volumes were collected by All Traffic Data Services, Inc. under the direction of
Martin/Martin. Roadway morning (7:00 ­ 9:00 AM), noon (12:00 ­ 1:00 PM) and afternoon
(4:00 ­ 6:00 PM) peak period traffic volumes were collected on Tuesday, June 21, 2011 at
each of the study area intersections. In addition, 2010 daily volumes were obtained from the
City of Greenwood Village website along S Clinton Street between S Clinton Court and
Target (15,605) and south of E Costilla Avenue (8,170), and along E Costilla Avenue east of
S Clinton Street (6,475).

The daily and peak hour volumes are shown in Exhibit 4. The raw count data is provided in
the Technical Appendix.

Signal Timing
The existing signal timing for the two signalized intersections within the study area were
obtained from the City of Greenwood Village. The S Clinton Street & Target Access
intersection currently operates with protected/permissive phasing for the S Clinton Street
northbound and southbound left-turn movements, with the eastbound and westbound
accesses to Target and Wells Fargo Bank, respectively, split phased. The existing cycle
lengths are 60 seconds during the AM peak, 90 seconds during the noon hour and 100
seconds during the PM peak. The S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue intersection currently
operates as a two-phase system with a 60 second cycle length during the AM and PM peaks
and 50 seconds during the noon hour.

Intersection Capacity Analysis
The existing levels of service at the study area intersections were calculated applying the
methods from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, as implemented in Synchro, Version 7 to
the existing volumes, geometry and traffic control shown in Exhibits 3 and 4. The existing
levels of service for the intersections within the study area are summarized in the following

    The delay and LOS results reported are for the worst approach for unsignalized controlled intersections and
    the overall intersection for signalized controlled intersections.

According to the City of Greenwood Village, a level of service D should be used as a
guideline to maintain for overall intersection operations. Roadway improvements should be
considered for overall signalized intersection or unsignalized approaches reported to be
operating at LOS E or F. All of the existing study area intersections are currently operating at
acceptable levels during the AM, noon and PM peak hours. In addition, all movements were
found to be operating at LOS D or better.

The level of service reports for the existing conditions are provided in the Technical
Appendix.

Queuing Analysis
In addition to the capacity analysis, the queue results were reviewed to determine if the
vehicle stacking along the approaches to the study area intersections are expected to extend
back to adjacent intersections. The queues were also evaluated to determine if vehicle
stacking is expected to extend out of turn lane storage bays or if the through lane queues are
expected to block access to turn lanes.

The results indicate that there are deficient existing queues at three of the four study area
intersections.
      S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection
         - The eastbound shared left-turn/through lane queue extends back into the
             parking lot and the right-turn queue extends out of the turn bay at times during
             both the noon hour and PM peak hour.
         - The northbound through lane queue will extend back and block access to the
             left-turn lane at times during the noon hour.
      S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection
         - The westbound right-turn lane queue extends out of the storage bay at times
             during the noon hour and PM peak hour.
      S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection
         - The westbound left-turn lane queue extends back out of the storage bay at
             times during the noon hour and the PM peak hour.
         - The westbound shared through/right-turn lane queue will extend back and block
             access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour.

The queuing results for the existing conditions are provided in the Technical Appendix.

       FUTURE NO PROJECT CONDITIONS

A long range no project conditions analysis representing the Year 2030, without the
proposed Restaurant Depot development project and associated trip additions and
redistributions, was performed as a comparison to the with project (build) condition.

Geometry & Traffic Control
There are no roadway or intersection modifications currently planned within the project study
area. As a result, no changes to the geometry or traffic control were analyzed as part of the
future long range conditions. The anticipated long range no project condition geometry and
traffic control was assumed to be the same as for the existing conditions, as previously
shown in Exhibit 3. The existing phasing and signal timing were maintained for the future
conditions analysis.

Volumes
Multiple sources were consulted in order to establish an appropriate growth rate for the
roadways within the study area. First, the past 10 years of historic counts available on the
City of Greenwood Village website were reviewed, which indicate the volume along S Clinton
Street has decreased by between 40% and 50%, while the volume on E Costilla Avenue has
declined by about 20%. Second, the Arapahoe Road/I-25 Interchange Final System Level
Feasibility Study, prepared by David Evans Associates dated June 2008 was referenced,
which implies a 24-year growth factor of 1.0 during the AM peak and 1.3 during the PM peak
along S Clinton Street immediately south of Arapahoe Road when comparing the existing
(Year 2006) volumes with the 2030 no build traffic forecasts. These factors equate to
average annual growth rates of between 0.1% and 1.2%. Third, the most recent forecasts
being developed as part of the on-going I-25/Arapahoe Road Interchange Environmental
Study, currently being prepared by Felsburg Holt & Ullevig, were inquired. This source
indicates an average annual growth rate of between 0.8% to 1.4% along S Clinton Street,
0.5% along E Costilla Avenue and 0.0% along S Dayton Street.

Based on these various sources, different growth rates were identified for the roadways
within the project study area. The following average annual growth rates were utilized:
        1.0% for S Clinton Street
        0.5% for E Costilla Avenue, S Clinton Court & S Dayton Street
        0.0% for the Target & Wells Fargo Bank Access Approaches (and any other driveway
        or minor accesses in the study area)

Since according to the City of Greenwood Village staff the latest version of the I-25/Arapahoe
Road Interchange Environmental Assessment does not include improvements along any of
the roadways within the Restaurant Depot study area, no additional adjustments were made
to the future volume projections.

The long range no projects condition volumes were calculated by applying 19 years of
background growth to the existing (Year 2011) volumes along the study area roadways. The
resulting Year 2030 projected peak hour volumes are shown in Exhibit 5.

Intersection Capacity Analysis
The level of service calculations for the no project condition were based on the study area
roadway network and future volumes described above. Table 3 shows the anticipated level
of service and delay at the study area intersections.

    The delay and LOS results reported are for the worst approach for unsignalized controlled intersections and
    the overall intersection for signalized controlled intersections.

In general, the operations are expected to remain the same as for the existing conditions with
no deficient conditions reported. The operations are expected to decrease by one letter
grade when compared to the existing conditions at the following three locations:
      At the S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court intersection, during the PM peak hour the
      westbound approach is expected to decline from LOS B to LOS C.
      At the E Costilla Avenue & Dayton Street intersection, the southbound approach is
      expected to decline during both the noon and PM peak hours from LOS C to LOS D.

The level of service reports for the long range no project conditions are provided in the
Technical Appendix.

Queuing Analysis
The queuing analysis for the long range no project conditions indicated the potential for
vehicle stacking continuing to impact the traffic operations. The results indicated that there
are expected to be deficient queues at three of the study area intersections.

The following are the queues expected to continue to be deficient as is the case for the
existing conditions and additional deficient queues when compared to the existing conditions.
      S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection
         - The eastbound shared left-turn/through lane queue is expected to continue to
             extend back into the parking lot and the right-turn queue to continue to extend
             out of the turn bay at times during both the noon hour and PM peak hour.
         - The northbound through lane queue is expected to continue to extend back and
             block access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour, and also during
             the PM peak hour.
         - The southbound through lane queue is expected to extend back and block
             access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour.
      S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection
         - The westbound right-turn lane queue is expected to continue to extend out of
             the storage bay and be blocked by the queue for the left-turn lane at times
             during the noon hour and PM peak hour.
      S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection
         - The westbound left-turn lane queue is expected to continue to extend back out
             of the storage bay at times during the noon hour and the PM peak hour.
         - The westbound through lane queue is expected to continue to extend back and
             block access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour, and also during
             the PM peak hours.

The queuing results for the long range no project conditions are provided in the Technical
Appendix.

Roadway Improvements
Queuing deficiencies were identified at three of the study area intersections. The following
considerations and approaches to potential roadway improvements at each intersection are
addressed below.
      S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection
      Deficiency: Several movements are expected to have deficient queues including the
                  eastbound approach lanes and the northbound and southbound through
                  lanes blocking access to the left-turn lanes.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified are either the same as are present
                   for the existing condition or minor, so no improvement was identified.
      S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection

Future No Project Conditions                                                  October 2011


      Deficiency: The westbound right-turn lane queue is expected to extend back out of the
                  storage bay or be blocked by the left-turn lane queue.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified are either the same as are present
                   for the existing condition or minor, so no improvement was identified.
      S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection
      Deficiency: The westbound left-turn lane queue is expected to extend back out of the
                  storage bay or be blocked by the through lane queue.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified are either the same as are present
                   for the existing condition or minor. In addition, access to the left-turn
                   bay is delineated by striping only with a center two-way left-turn lane
                   further to the east allowing additional space for queuing or to access
                   the turn bay. As a result, no improvement was identified.

     PROPOSED PROJECT INFORMATION

Restaurant Depot is proposing to construct a new 55,341 SF store to be located at 6875
South Clinton Street in the City of Greenwood Village, Colorado. The site is located in the
northwest corner of the S Clinton Street and E Costilla Avenue intersection bound by S
Clinton Street on the north and east sides of the property, E Costilla Avenue along the south
and an adjacent commercial property to the west. The business is not open to the general
public but requires membership. The store hours of operation will be 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM
Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM on Saturdays and 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM on
Sundays. Surface parking is proposed on the site adjacent to the roadway, with the single
building setback on the property. The latest concept site plan for the project was previously
shown in Exhibit 2.

Project Site Geometry
The most recent site plan for the Restaurant Depot development identifies three driveways
for access to the property. There are currently two accesses to the property--one along S
Clinton Street and the other on E Costilla Avenue. The E Costilla Avenue driveway, located
approximately 175 feet west of the S Clinton Street intersection, is expected to be relocated
approximately 50 feet to the west. The S Clinton Street driveway is expected to be relocated
approximately 80 feet to the north, with one new service driveway access proposed further to
the north along S Clinton Street. The northern driveway will be for service vehicles and trucks
only, providing access to the loading docks along the backside (west side) of the store, while
a public driveway will be located between the service driveway and S Clinton Court. A ¾
movement access is proposed for both of the site driveways along S Clinton Street, with the
left-turn out restricted by striping and signage. A schematic roadway design will need to show
the segment of S Clinton Street can be restriped such that the existing northbound left-turn
lane at the Target access and the existing southbound left-turn lane at S Clinton Court can
be maintained, while providing appropriate access to the two site driveways.

The proposed external roadway network for both the short-term and long range with project
conditions is illustrated in Exhibit 6.

Proposed Project Information                                                                          October 2011


Sight Distance Evaluation
The sight distances available at the two proposed project driveway accesses along S Clinton
Street were evaluated to ensure there will be adequate horizontal and vertical clearance for a
safe operation for access onto the roadway. The American Associations of State Highway
and Transportation Officials' (AASHTO) Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (2004)
was used to determine the required sight distances for each location evaluated. For the sight
distances along S Clinton Street, the requirements were calculated based on a speed of 30
mph, which is the signed speed limit for the roadway. The necessary design sight distance
for a passenger car to make a right-turn from a stop (AASHTO Exhibit 9-58, page 664) is 290
feet. The sight distances for a single unit truck to make a right-turn from a stop (AASHTO
Exhibit 9.57, page 664) is 380 feet.

Exhibit 7 illustrates the most recent site plan to scale with an aerial image in the background
to show the necessary sight distances according to AASHTO for the two site accesses along
S Clinton Street. For the customer access, the 30 mph sight line shows no conflict with the
current site plan. In addition, the sight line for the service driveway does not conflict with the
current site plan layout.

While the sight triangles address the horizontal curvature of the roadway, the vertical
curvature was also assessed for both driveways. Since this stretch of S Clinton Street has a
positive grade traveling north to south, both the service driveway and the public driveway are
located uphill of the sight lines required. As a result, there are no roadway interferences due
to the topography (see photos below). In addition, gaps are expected to be created by the
adjacent signalized intersection at Target for the few trucks per hour using the service
driveway access and for cars exiting out of the public driveway.




Looking West from Future Public Driveway   Looking West from Future Service Driveway   Looking East from Target Access


Based on the sight distance evaluation and the proposed roadway striping modifications,
both project driveways along S Clinton Street should operate safely as ¾ movement
accesses with the left-turn out movements restricted.

Trip Generation Analysis
The Restaurant Depot development is proposed to accommodate a single land use on the
property. Of the numerous existing Restaurant Depot stores across the United States, the
Greenwood Village site will be the smallest store at just over 55,341 SF. The latest site plan
shows the store to be located near the middle of the 6.5 acre parcel with a surface parking lot
along the east side of the property and a four-bay loading dock on the west side of the
building. A separate driveway along S Clinton Street is proposed to provide exclusive access
to the docks for service vehicles and customer trucks loading large purchases. Two other
driveways are proposed for public access to parking, with one access along S Clinton Street
and the other access along E Costilla Avenue. The store hours of operation will be 7:00 AM
to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM on Saturdays and 8:00 AM to 3:00
PM on Sundays.

Site-Generated Trips

The Institute of Transportation Engineer's Trip Generation, Eighth Edition (2008) is the most
widely relied upon resource for determining land use trip rates. However, the type of
commercial retail represented by the Restaurant Depot store did not match exactly with any
of the land uses. Yet, at the request of the review agency, the most similar land uses
available were evaluated as a comparison. Four land uses were identified including:
      Specialty Retail Center (Land Use Code 814)--This land use is intended more for
      smaller retail developments with multiple stores.
      Free-Standing Discount Store (Land Use Code 815)--This land use is similar to the
      proposed Restaurant Depot in the sense that developments included in the data
      assimilation were for a single user. However, a Restaurant Depot has a much more
      specific customer base than most of the developments included for this land use.
      Discount Club (Land Use Code 857)--This land use is similar to the proposed
      Restaurant Depot from the standpoint of a membership is required, but the
      developments included in this land use tend to sell a larger variety of goods, attracting
      a larger customer base.
      Wholesale Market (Land Use Code 860)--This land use is similar to the proposed
      Restaurant Depot in that merchandise may be stored and, in the case of some
      facilities such as the Denver location, distributed. However, the Greenwood Village
      Restaurant Depot is not proposed to function this way.
The rates and corresponding project-related trips were determined for this project based on
the square footage of each space, with the fitted curve equation utilized, where available and
appropriate, and the average rates elsewhere for the daily and peak hours of the adjacent
street traffic.

The trip generation rates for each of the four land uses from the Trip Generation manual
were applied to the size of the Restaurant Depot facility proposed in Greenwood Village. The
results are included in Table 4 on the next page.

KSF ­ 1,000 Square Feet

As part of the Fife Restaurant Depot Trip Generation Study, prepared by Jake Traffic
Engineering, Inc. dated February 9, 2009, trip data was collected from an existing Restaurant
Depot store located in Portland, Oregon. The Portland facility was found to be of similar size,
access, services and operations to the proposed Greenwood Village project. The information
was converted into a trip rate and then seasonally adjusted by applying rates from the
Institute of Transportation Engineer's Parking Generation, 3rd Edition (2004) to account for
the data being obtained in January of 2009. These adjusted rates were then applied to the
size of the Greenwood Village store to determine the anticipated trip generation for the
project.

The trip generation rates and trips for the existing Portland Restaurant Depot are shown in
Table 5 below. The information is divided into the peak hour of the roadway and peak hour of
the generator, and also by car and truck to show the variations in trip generation for the land
use. A seasonal adjustment was applied to these rates to account for the trip data being
collected in January, as identified in Table 6 on the next page.

There is one existing Restaurant Depot store in the Denver area that was considered for
comparison to the Greenwood Village project. However, this location was determined to be
significantly larger and operate more as a regional warehouse facility. Comparatively, the
Greenwood Village site will be the smallest store in the Restaurant Depot national chain. As
a result, the Denver location was determined not to be a comparable facility.

The Portland facility trip rates were applied to the size of the proposed Greenwood Village
Restaurant Depot as revealed in Table 7.

When the trip results are compared to the various Trip Generation estimates in Table 4, the
only use that has anywhere near comparable rates for each of the time periods to the data
obtained from Portland is Wholesale Market. However, this use is based on a limited sample
size for facilities two to six times larger than the store proposed in Greenwood Village, and
the description for this land use indicates more of a distribution center with little drive-in
business, whereas Restaurant Depot is a customer based store. The other three land uses
indicate daily generations of four or more times the trips and PM peak hour generations of
five to ten times the number of trips found at the Portland facility.

As a result, the trip generation proposed to be utilized for the Restaurant Depot project are
those developed from the Portland location trips, seasonally adjusted and applied to the size
of the Greenwood Village site. These trips are summarized in the attached Table 8 for the
peak hour of the roadway analysis, which are presumed to be the time periods of utmost
concern to the City. As the table shows, the proposed Restaurant Depot store is anticipated
to generate 545 daily trips, with 35 of those trips occurring during the AM peak hour, 58
during the noon hour and 27 during the PM peak hour. Furthermore, 73 of the daily trips are
expected to be trucks (a combination of entering and exiting maneuvers), with 7 truck trips
occurring in the AM peak hour, 12 during the noon hour and none in the PM peak hour.

Of the approximately 36 trucks anticipated to enter and exit the Greenwood Village
Restaurant Depot on a daily basis, about 20 are expected to be service trucks providing
deliveries, picking up trash, etc., while the remainder will be customers retrieving large
purchases.

Trip Reductions

Potential reductions are typically considered at development projects for transit use, internal
trips between compatible mixed-use facilities, or pass-by trips.
       Transit Trip Reductions--An RTD bus line does currently operate along E Costilla
       Avenue to the east and S Clinton Street to the south of the proposed project.
       However, the only potential transit users would be the employees of the store, so no
       transit trip reductions were applied.
       Internal Trip Reductions--This is not a mixed-use development, so there will be no
       internal trips. As a result, no internal trip reductions were applied to this project.
       Pass-by Trip Reductions--While there is the possibility of some pass-by or diverted
       trips for the proposed project, with a select customer base and required membership,
       no reductions were applied.
As a result, no trip reductions were applied.

Trip Distribution
The land use for this project will be expected to primarily attract a regional customer.
Consequently, the directional distribution for how site-generated trips will be accessing the
development need to be based on the most convenient and direct access to the regional
roadway system.

Based on the location of the site within the Denver area and information from previous
studies, the regional distribution for the area was determined to be as follows:
       I-25 North of the Site--30%
       I-25 South of the Site--30%
       Arapahoe Road East of the Site--20%
       Arapahoe Road West of the Site--15%
       Dry Creek Boulevard West of the Site--5%

The regional distribution is not expected to change between the short-term and long range
conditions. These regional distributions are illustrated in Exhibit 8.

Distributions for direct site access are expected to be dependent on the direction vehicles are
oriented and whether the vehicle is for service or a customer. The site distribution for the
study area access intersections are estimated to be as follows for inbound and outbound
traffic:
         Public Driveway to/from S Clinton Street (Cars Only)--87% In (70% from the north &
         17% from the south) & 30% Out (to the south)
         Driveway to/from E Costilla Avenue--13% In (from the east) & 70% Out (to the east)
         Service Driveway to/from S Clinton Street (Trucks Only)--100% In (80% from the
         north & 20% from the south) & 100% Out (to the south)

The site distribution is expected to remain the same for the short-term and long range
conditions. The site access distributions for the intersections within the study area are also
provided in Exhibit 8.

Trip Assignment
The trips associated with the Restaurant Depot development project were distributed
throughout the study area roadway network based on the distributions and the location and
accessibility of the site driveways. The project site-generated trips were assigned to the
roadway network during the AM, noon and PM peak hours. The resulting project-related trips
assigned as turn movement volumes at the study area intersections are illustrated in Exhibit
9.

     FUTURE WITH PROJECT CONDITIONS

This section documents the analysis conducted for the future short-term and long range
conditions that included the proposed Restaurant Depot development project. With the short-
term analysis representing the near term future condition after the proposed development is
completed, the analysis was conducted for the Year 2012 and compared to the existing
conditions to determine the potential impact of the development project on the study area
roadway network. The long range analysis with the full build-out of the proposed
development was conducted and compared to the future no project conditions. The long
range represented any roadway improvements and the forecast volumes for the Year 2030
conditions.

Geometry & Traffic Control
The only change to the external roadway network for either the short-term or long range
future conditions from the existing conditions is the addition of the service driveway along S
Clinton Street, the slight relocation of the public driveway along S Clinton Street and the
relocation of the site driveway along E Costilla Avenue. Modifications to the paint markings
along S Clinton Street is necessary to accompany the addition of the site accesses in order
to accommodate ¾ movements in and out of the project site, with the left-turns out restricted.
A slight striping adjustment along E Costilla Avenue is also necessary to accommodate the
relocated site driveway.

Based on the Colorado Department of Transportation's State Highway Access Code (March
2002), assuming S Clinton Street is considered a non-rural highway or frontage road with a
posted speed limit of 30 mph, the design of a northbound left-turn lane for either of the
proposed site driveway accesses would require an 8:1 taper (96-feet for a 12-foot wide lane)
and a storage length based on the expected turn volumes. The minimum storage for both
driveways would be 25-feet; however, the storage length is based on passenger cars. This is
acceptable for the public driveway, but the expectation is that only trucks will be utilizing the
service access, which in passenger car equivalents would be a minimum storage length of
60-feet to accommodate one truck. There is adequate space in the roadway to allow the
necessary turn bay lengths required for both site access driveways. However, the City staff
has indicated the desire to paint a center two-way left-turn lane between the existing
northbound left-turn lane to Target and the existing southbound left-turn lane to S Clinton
Court to accommodate the movements to the site driveways.

A schematic roadway striping plan has been developed to add a two-way center left-turn lane
along S Clinton Street in between the northbound left-turn lane to Target and the southbound
left-turn lane to S Clinton Court. In addition, a minor modification along E Costilla Avenue
west of S Clinton Street will be necessary to identify the gap in the center line striping for the
relocated site driveway. These modifications were overlaid on an aerial image of the existing
S Clinton Street, along with the site concept design, and illustrated in Exhibit 10.

Volumes
Future volumes were developed for the short-term and long range with project conditions.
The short-term with project condition volumes were calculated by applying one year of the
average annual growth rates to the existing volumes and then adding the proposed
Restaurant Depot development site-generated trips. The resulting short-term with project
condition volumes are illustrated in Exhibit 11.

The long range with project condition volumes were calculated by combining the long range
no project volumes with the site-generated trips associated with the Restaurant Depot
development project. The long range with project condition volumes are illustrated in Exhibit
12.

Intersection Capacity Analysis
Short-Term Condition

The short-term with project conditions intersection capacity analysis was conducted. The
level of service calculations were based on the study area roadway network shown in Exhibit
6 and the future volumes including the project trips presented in Exhibit 11. The existing
phasing and signal timing were maintained for the future conditions analysis. Table 9 shows
the anticipated level of service and delay at the study area intersections during the AM, noon
and PM peak hours.

    The delay and LOS results reported are for the worst approach for unsignalized controlled intersections and
    the overall intersection for signalized controlled intersections.

The level of service is expected to remain the same compared to the existing conditions at
each of the study area intersections during the AM, noon and PM peak hours, with the
exception of the S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court intersection, where the westbound
approach operations are expected to decline by one letter grade from a LOS B to LOS C


                                Restaurant Depot Transportation Impact Study                                  44

during the PM peak hour. However, all of the intersection movements are expected to
operate at LOS D or better.

In some instances the operations reported for the short-term with project conditions show
improvements compared to the existing conditions. There are a couple of reasons such a
decrease in delay is realized. For a signalized control the level of service and delay are
reported for the overall operations, which is an average of all the vehicles accessing the
intersection. As a result, in the future if more vehicles are added to the movements with the
least delay and few if any to the movements with higher delay, the overall average can be
reduced. Similarly, at stop-controlled locations where the operations are reported for the
worst approach, if there is more than one movement on that approach and more traffic is
added to the better of the two movements, the result can be a reduction in the average delay
per vehicle on the approach. The locations where this occurs include:
              S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection--The delay during the noon hour
              and PM peak hour declined by about ½ second on average per vehicle entering
              the signalized intersection.
              S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection--The delay during the noon
              hour declined by about ½ second on average per vehicle for the stop-controlled
              westbound approach.
              S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection--The delay during the AM
              peak hour declined slightly on average per vehicle entering the signalized
              intersection.

The level of service reports for the long range no project conditions are provided in the
Technical Appendix.

Long Range Condition

The long range with project conditions intersection capacity analysis was conducted. The
level of service calculations were based on the study area roadway network shown in Exhibit
6 and the future project build-out volumes presented in Exhibit 12. The existing phasing and
signal timing were maintained for the future conditions analysis. Table 10 shows the
anticipated level of service and delay at the study area intersections during the AM, noon and
PM peak hours.

    The delay and LOS results reported are for the worst approach for unsignalized controlled intersections and
    the overall intersection for signalized controlled intersections.

The level of service is expected to remain the same as for the long range no project condition
for the overall signalized intersections and unsignalized intersection worst case approaches
at each of the study area intersections. In addition, all of the intersection movements are
expected to operate at LOS D or better.

As was reported for the short-term with project conditions, in some instances the operations
for the long range with project conditions show improvements compared to the long range no
project conditions. The locations where this is reported include:
               S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection--The delay during the AM peak
               hour, noon hour and PM peak hour declined by about ½ second on average
               per vehicle entering the signalized intersection.
               S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection--The delay during the noon
               hour and PM peak hour declined slightly to as much as two seconds on
               average per vehicle for the stop-controlled westbound approach.

Queuing Analysis
Short-Term Condition

The queuing analysis for the short-term with project conditions indicated the potential for
vehicle stacking continuing to impact the traffic operations. The results indicated that there
are expected to be deficient queues at the same three study area intersections as for the
existing conditions.

The following are the queues expected to continue to be deficient as is the case for the
existing conditions and additional deficient queues when compared to the existing conditions.
      S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection
         - The eastbound shared left-turn/through lane queue is expected to continue to
             extend back into the parking lot and the right-turn queue to continue to extend
             out of the turn bay at times during both the noon hour and PM peak hour.
         - The northbound through lane queue is expected to continue to extend back and
             block access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour and PM peak
             hour.
      S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection
         - The westbound right-turn lane queue is expected to continue to extend out of
             the storage bay and be blocked by the queue for the left-turn lane at times
             during the noon hour.
      S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection
         - The westbound left-turn lane queue is expected to continue to extend back out
             of the storage bay at times during the noon hour and the PM peak hour.
         - The westbound through lane queue is expected to extend back and block
             access to the left-turn lane at times during the PM peak hour.

The queuing results for the short-term with project conditions are provided in the Technical
Appendix.

Long Range Condition

The queuing analysis for the long range with project conditions indicated the potential for
vehicle stacking continuing to impact the traffic operations. The results indicated that there
are expected to be deficient queues at the same three study area intersections as for the
long range no project conditions.

The following are the queues expected to continue to be deficient as is the case for the long
range no project conditions and additional deficient queues when compared to the no project
conditions.

         - The eastbound shared left-turn/through lane queue is expected to continue to
             extend back into the parking lot and the right-turn queue to continue to extend
             out of the turn bay at times during both the noon hour and PM peak hour.

             block access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour and PM peak
             hour, and the left-turn lane extend out of the turn bay at times during the noon
             hour.
         - The southbound through lane queue is expected to extend back and block
             access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour.

             during the noon hour.
      S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection
         - The westbound left-turn lane queue is expected to continue to extend back out
             of the storage bay at times during the noon hour and the PM peak hour, and
             also during the AM peak hour.
         - The westbound through lane queue is expected to continue to extend back and
             block access to the left-turn lane at times during the noon hour and PM peak
             hour.

The queuing results for the long range with project conditions are provided in the Technical
Appendix.

Pedestrian & Bicycle Accommodations
The proposed Restaurant Depot development is improving the pedestrian and bicycle
circulation in the area surrounding the project as well as providing accommodations on site.
Pedestrian and bicycle mobility and safety along S Clinton Street and E Costilla Avenue will
be enhanced with the completion of the sidewalk through the area. The project will be
installing the missing pieces of the sidewalk along the southwest side S Clinton Street and
along the north side of E Costilla Avenue. In addition, the project site plan includes a
connection from the new sidewalks to the Restaurant Depot store door for pedestrians and
bicyclists, as well as a bike rack for parking bicycles.

Mitigation
No capacity deficiencies were reported; however, queuing deficiencies were identified at
three of the study area intersections for the short-term with project conditions and at three
intersections for the long range with project conditions. However, these queuing deficiencies
are carried forward either from the existing conditions for the near term or from the long
range no project conditions for the long term. The following considerations and approaches
to potential mitigation at each intersection are addressed below.

Short-Term Conditions
      S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection
      Deficiency: Several movements are expected to have deficient queues including the
                  eastbound approach lanes and the northbound through lane blocking
                  access to the left-turn lane.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified for the eastbound approach are part
                   of a private shopping approach, while no modifications can be made to
                   the northbound approach without interfering with the future project
                   service access. However, with access to the left-turn bay delineated by
                   striping and the introduction of a two-way center left-turn lane further to
                   the south along S Clinton Street will allow additional space for queuing
                   or to access the Target access turn bay. As a result no improvement
                   was identified.
      S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection
      Deficiency: The westbound right-turn lane queue is expected to extend back out of the
                  storage bay or be blocked by the left-turn lane queue.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified are either the same as are present
                   for the existing condition or minor, so no improvement was identified.
      S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection
      Deficiency: The westbound left-turn lane queue is expected to extend back out of the
                  storage bay or be blocked by the through lane queue.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified are either the same as are present
                     for the existing condition or minor. In addition, access to the left-turn
                     bay is delineated by striping only with a two-way center left-turn lane
                     further to the east allowing additional space for queuing or to access
                     the turn bay. As a result, no improvement was identified.

Long Range Conditions
      S Clinton Street & Target Access Intersection
      Deficiency: Several movements are expected to have deficient queues including the
                  eastbound approach lanes and the northbound and southbound through
                  lanes blocking access to the left-turn lanes.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified for the eastbound approach are part
                   of a private shopping approach. The southbound approach is restricted
                   by the raised center median and back-to-back left-turn configuration
                   with the adjacent intersection to the north. Furthermore, no
                   modifications can be made to the northbound approach without
                   interfering with the future project service access. However, with access
                   to the left-turn bay delineated by striping and the introduction of a two-
                   way center left-turn lane further to the south along S Clinton Street will
                   allow additional space for queuing or to access the Target access turn
                   bay. As a result no improvement was identified.
      S Clinton Street & S Clinton Court Intersection
      Deficiency: The westbound right-turn lane queue is expected to extend back out of the
                  storage bay or be blocked by the left-turn lane queue.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified are either the same as are present
                   for the existing condition or minor, so no improvement was identified.
      S Clinton Street & E Costilla Avenue Intersection
      Deficiency: The westbound left-turn lane queue is expected to extend back out of the
                  storage bay or be blocked by the through lane queue.
      Improvement: The queue deficiencies identified are either the same as are present
                   for the existing condition or minor. In addition, access to the left-turn
                   bay is delineated by striping only with a two-way center left-turn lane
                   further to the east allowing additional space for queuing or to access
                   the turn bay. As a result, no improvement was identified.

       SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS

The potential impacts associated with the proposed Restaurant Depot development project
were analyzed in this report. Based upon the analysis, data collected, assumptions,
methodologies and results which are provided in the body of this document, the necessary
roadway modifications were identified for the project study area.

Summary of Analysis & Results
      Capacity Analysis -- With an established level of service D as the target level for
      signalized overall intersections and unsignalized minor street approaches, the existing
      study area intersections were reported to currently be operating at acceptable levels
      during the weekday AM, noon and PM peak hours. The intersections are expected to
      continue to operate at acceptable levels for the future no project and with project
      conditions. The operations are expected to decline by one letter grade at the S Clinton
      Street & S Clinton Court and the E Costilla Avenue & S Dayton Street intersections,
      but all movements are expected to operate at LOS D or better. A summary of the
      capacity analysis is provided in Table 12 at the end of this section.
      Queuing Analysis -- The queue analysis results were reviewed to determine if the
      vehicle stacking along the approaches to the study area intersections would be
      expected to extend back to adjacent intersections. The queues were also evaluated to
      determine if vehicle stacking is expected to extend out of turn lane storage lengths or
      if the through lane queues would be expected to block access to turn lanes. Queue
      deficiencies were identified at three existing study area intersections and three long
      range no project condition intersections. These queuing deficiencies are carried
      forward with the same three intersections as for the existing conditions expected to
      have deficiencies in the short-term with project conditions and the same three
      intersections as for the long range no project conditions are expected to have
      deficiencies in the long range with project conditions.
      Roadway Improvements -- No planned improvements were identified within the study
      area by the City of Greenwood Village staff. In addition, with no capacity deficiencies
      and only minor queuing deficiencies identified for the long rang no project conditions,
      no roadway improvements were deemed to be necessary.
      Site Access Design -- Based on the capacity and queuing analysis along with a sight
      distance evaluation at the S Clinton Street project driveways, the three site access
      locations were found to operate adequately with minimal impact to the background
      operations. This includes the following key components:
         -   A ¾ movement access for the service driveway along S Clinton Street,
             restricting the left-turn out movement. The northbound left-turn in movement
             will be accommodated with the addition of a two-way center left-turn lane along
             S Clinton Street between the existing northbound left-turn lane at the Target
             access and the southbound left-turn lane at S Clinton Court.


                         Restaurant Depot Transportation Impact Study                     51
Summary & Recommendations                                                       October 2011


         -   A ¾ movement access for the public driveway along S Clinton Street, with the
             left-turn out movement not allowed. This access will be the relocated existing
             driveway approximately 80 feet to the northwest. As for the service driveway,
             the northbound left-turn in movement will be accommodated with the addition of
             a two-way center left-turn lane along S Clinton Street between the existing
             northbound left-turn lane at the Target access and the southbound left-turn lane
             at S Clinton Court.
         -   Full movement access for the south driveway along E Costilla Avenue. This
             access will require only a slight modification to the striping along E Costilla
             Avenue to identify the gap in the center line striping for the relocated site
             driveway approximately 50 feet to the west.
      Sight Distances -- The two proposed project driveway accesses along S Clinton
      Street were evaluated to ensure there will be adequate horizontal and vertical
      clearance for a safe operation for access onto the roadway. Since both site accesses
      will only accommodate the right-turn out exiting movement, sight distances were
      evaluated for a right turn from a stop condition. The requirements based on the 30
      mph signed speed limit for a passenger car were found to be 290 feet for a right turn
      from a stop, while a single unit truck needs 380 feet for a right turn from a stop. The
      sight lines show no horizontal conflict with the current site plan layout at either the
      customer access or the service driveway. The location of both the public driveway
      access and the service access are uphill from the direction conflicting traffic is
      traveling, resulting in no grade issues or vertical clearance concerns. In addition, gaps
      are expected to be created by the adjacent signalized intersection at the Target
      access for the few trucks per hour using the service driveway access and the cars
      turning south onto S Clinton Street. Based on the sight distance evaluation and the
      proposed roadway striping modifications, both project driveways along S Clinton
      Street should operate safely as ¾ movement accesses.
      Project Mitigation -- No additional mitigation measures were identified as a result of
      the proposed project traffic in addition to the S Clinton Street and E Costilla Avenue
      modifications to accommodate site access movements. All of the study area overall
      signalized intersections and unsignalized intersection approaches are expected to
      operate at LOS D or better provided the roadway modifications to accommodate the
      three site accesses are implemented .

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, findings and conclusions discussed in this report, the
recommendation to the City of Greenwood Village staff is that the site plan and land use
proposed for the Restaurant Depot project be approved for development with the roadway
improvements and site access design modifications identified in this report. A summary of
the recommended improvements are shown in Table 11 on the next page.

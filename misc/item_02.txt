BACKGROUND
The project site is within the boundaries of the Midtown Specific Plan, which was approved by the city in
2002. The approval of the Midtown Specific Plan included an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) with
associated General Plan amendment and rezoning to residential on the site. On October 24 and November 27,
2007, the Planning Commission and the City Council approved, respectively, a Mobile Home Conversion
report for an existing mobile home park on the site.

On November 7, 2007, Trammell Crow Residential, LLC, submitted this application to construct 387
condominiums on the east side of South Main Street at Cedar Way. The application is made in accordance
with the following review requirements of the Municipal Code:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project involves the redevelopment of six parcels on 5.9 acres located at 1556 S. Main St., on the east
side of the intersection of S. Main and Cedar Way. The project will relocate existing residents and demolish
structures in the mobile home park, a motel and auto repair. Besides the associated structures for these uses,
the site contains a variety of concrete pads, fences, signs, and trees that are in various stages of disrepair.

Alexan South Main is a 387-unit condominium project to be constructed as three buildings with a density of
66 units per acre. Building 1 will be four stories with 192 units and an attached 6.5-story garage. Building 2
will be a four-story podium with a two-level parking garage and 107 units. Building 3 will have 88 units in
four stories. The project includes a density bonus to exceed the maximum of 60 units per acre. The project
will have an affordable housing component through a partnership with Aspen Apartments, the adjacent project
to the south and currently under construction at 1666 South Main Street with 101 affordable apartments. The
project also requests approval of a Use Permit to allow exceptions to the building setback, height and parking
requirements.
                                                                               Figure 2 - Current Zoning
Surrounding Land Uses
North and south of the site, existing land uses are multi-
                                                                                            R4TOD-S
tenant quasi-commercial/industrial buildings with primarily
auto-related service businesses. Also, adjacent to the
southeast corner of the site is Aspen Family, a 101-unit
apartment building currently under construction.                     R1-6

On the east side of the site is a single railroad track and an
                                                                                                            MP-S
industrial park. To the west is S. Main Street and primarily
single-family homes. Just northwest of the site is a single
liquor store. At the southwest corner of the site is another
industrial park complex.
                                                                    MP-S
The site is located in an area of transitional land uses. Figure

density residential. In fact, a portion of the land south of the     N
site is already under construction with an apartment project.

 Additionally, east of the site and the railroad is an existing     R4-S Multi-Family High Density Residential
industrial park that lies within the boundaries of the draft        R4-TOD-S Multi-Family High Density
Transit Area Specific Plan (TASP). The TASP proposes to             Residential with Transit Oriented Development

Relationship to Neighboring Residential Project
The developers of the adjacent residential project under construction, Aspen Family Apartments by Global
Premier Development, has partnered with the applicant for affordable housing credit and construction of street
improvements. The recommended special conditions and the City's legal agreements with both developers
have incorporated this partnership and insure that if one project is not constructed the appropriate obligations
for affordable housing and street improvements are still met.

Architecture
The proposed project offers three residential buildings in a contemporary design with wood-frame
construction and a variety of exterior finish materials: plaster, siding, scored concrete, metal paneling and
split-face blocks. The exterior walls are well articulated by changes in roof heights and vertical planes,
recessed windows, balconies, and five-foot deep sunshades. The body building color is various shades of
beige with white, gold and brown accent colors.

The project's design underwent design review by the City's architectural consultant of the Cannon Design
Group. The review acknowledged that the project was well designed and made some suggestions regarding
parking design, interior circulation, building scale, entrances and relationship to the Aspen project, adjacent to
the south. The applicant in their final submittal package satisfactorily addressed all of the recommendations
by the Cannon Design Group.

Circulation
The new public streets are a continuation of the street grid system developed for the east side of South Main
Street. The streets are designed to connect with those approved for the Aspen project on the south side of the
site. A pedestrian paseo encourages walking by providing car-free but attractive and open access through
Building One. The new streets will comply with the Midtown streetscape design guidelines for street trees,
ten-foot sidewalks and decorative lighting.
                                                                    Table 1 ­ Parking Requirements

Landscaping and Recreation
Building 1 provides two courtyards and a pedestrian paseo that will be available for the general public to use.
The larger of the two courtyards will feature a pool, barbecue area and patio with trellises and fire dish. The
smaller courtyard will have a passive garden area with seating. The paseo will provide a large pathway with
special paving, seating areas and shade gardens. Building 2 will host a fitness center for project residents, an
Internet café, outdoor seating, media room, and demonstration kitchen. There would also be an upper floor
courtyard with passive open space featuring planters with bamboo. Building 3 will have an open courtyard at
grade with aesthetically shielded seating around a fire dish. Other unique landscape features of the project
include small shade gardens within hallway intersections and a shaded garden paseo shared between Building
3 and the Aspen project to the south.

Landscape materials include trees that are primarily 24-inch box size and larger, accent palm trees, shrubs,
grass and a variety of groundcovers. Hard surfaces in paseo and garden areas will be a colored concrete;
special paving will accent pedestrian street crossings.

Each dwelling unit in the development will have some variation of private open space. Ground floor units
will have patios or stoops with direct access to the adjacent street or paseo and upper floor units will have
balconies. Balcony sizes range from 33 to 88 square feet. Stoops range in size from 30 to 90 square feet.

Vesting Tentative Map
The applicant proposes to reconfigure six lots into three parcels with street dedications to create
condominiums.
                                                                   Table 4 ­ Tentative Map

constructed on the north property line will be shared with    1          2.55               192
the adjacent property. The Alexan project will install the    2          1.04               107
street to provide two-way traffic flow with no on-street      3          0.66                88
parking. When the adjacent property is developed, the        A           1.69          Not applicable
remainder of the shared street will be constructed and      Total        5.94               387
parking will be available on one side of the street.

The pedestrian paseo will be privately owned but available for public access. The masonry wall on the east
property line of the site will be maintained by the homeowner's association. An infrastructure of new storm
drain lines, sanitary sewer lines and water lines will be installed to support the development. Stormwater
infiltration will be addressed through planters and mechanically equipped storm drains.

Affordability / Density Bonus
The applicant proposes to meet affordability goals and obtain a density bonus by exchanging credit for 18
very low-income units being built in the adjacent Aspen Apartments project by providing $1 million in
financial assistance to the Aspen project. Once complete, Aspen Apartments will provide 101 very-low
income rental units and has stated a need for the financial assistance from Trammell Crow in their letter dated
December 18, 2007. These 18 units represent 5% of the 356 units allowed on the site with the R4-TOD-S
zoning district. Providing 5% very low-income units qualifies a project for a 10% density bonus and one (1)
development concession pursuant to MMC XI-10-54.20-3(B)(2). The applicant is requesting approval of a
9% density bonus for 31 additional units and, as the city's required incentive, permitting Building One to
exceed the maximum number of five stories with a 6.5 story parking garage.

The Housing Element of the General Plan, the Midtown Specific Plan, and the Zoning Ordinance contain
goals encouraging projects to provide 20% of the units as affordable. State redevelopment law requires the
Redevelopment Agency to ensure that 15% of the housing units constructed in the Project Area are affordable
with 6% of those units being affordable to very low-income households. The combination of the Aspen
Apartments 101 units and the 387 units proposed in the Trammell Crow project would result in 488 units, 101
or 21% of which would be affordable to very-low income households.

Use Permit Exception
The applicant requests to modify required building setbacks from public streets, as indicated in the previous
Table, to meet Fire Department access needs and large public street dedication requirements.

A second exception, to the development standards in Table 6, is for building height. Under state density
bonus law, the City is required to provide a development incentive or concession that is requested by the
density bonus applicant. According to the Zoning Ordinance:
       "When an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development...the city shall provide
       the applicant incentives or concessions for the production of housing units and childcare
       facilities as prescribed in this section." MMC XI-10-54.20-3

       "Any project that meets the minimum criteria...for a density bonus is entitled to concessions..."
       MMC XI-10-54.20-4
The applicant for the Alexan project requests an incentive that allows them to exceed the maximum building
height of five stories in the R4-TOD-S district, with a 6.5 story parking garage in Building One.

Midtown Specific Plan
The project is consistent with the intent and specific requirements of the Midtown Specific Plan. With the
exception of building setbacks, height and parking as indicated in Table 3, the project complies with the
development standards of the "R4-TOD-S" zoning district. The project conforms to the Midtown Specific
Plan's Land Use Goals 2 and 3, and Residential Policies 3.1 and 3.4 through 3.6 in that it provides a
significant amount of new high-density housing that addresses needs for multifamily housing and
affordability. In addition, the proposed project is consistent with Park and Open Space Policy 3.24,
Circulation Goals 1 and 2, Circulation Policies 4.5 and 4.9, Parking Policy 4.19 and Community Design Goal
4 in that the in-lieu park fee will be used to improve public parks and the new streets and streetscape improves
the pedestrian orientation and character of the streets.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
The proposed project is exempt from further environmental review pursuant to Article 8, Section 65457
(CEQA Exemption) of the State Planning and Zoning Law and Article 11, Section 15168(c)(2) (Program EIR)
of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines. The proposed project is consistent with the
Midtown Specific Plan Program EIR and no new effects or new mitigation measures are required.

Mitigation measures for hazardous materials, traffic, noise and trees from the Midtown Program EIR apply to
the project and are carried over in the form of conditions of approval, as discussed below.

Hazardous Materials Contamination
The parcels within the project site have limited contamination of soil and water due to previous land uses.
Phase I and II Environmental Assessments were performed. 2
 No contamination concerns exist at the two northernmost parcels (1504 and 1556 South Main Street with
   the existing mobile home park and motel).
 Elevated levels of metals were found in near-surface soil at the remaining vacant parcels on the site (1600
   and 1630 South Main Street). Diesel and motor oil were also detected. Mitigation measures require
   excavation, additional testing and removal from the site prior to construction.

    Discarded asbestos containing building materials were identified at 1600 and 1630 South Main Street.
    Mitigation requires abatement prior to any site demolition.
    No elevated petroleum hydrocarbons were bound in soil or groundwater at 1620 South Main Street
    (Worldwide Auto site).
    All existing structures require further testing for asbestos and lead prior to demolition.

Traffic
The proposed project will generate new trips throughout the area. As identified in the Midtown specific Plan
EIR, most traffic impacts cannot be mitigated over the long term. The City adopted overriding considerations
for these impacts. A Traffic Impact Analysis specific to the project was prepared. 3

With credit for existing residential and commercial uses on the site, the project will generate 1,555 daily trips,
124 AM and 133 PM peak hour trips. The project's impacts on fourteen intersections were analyzed.
Thirteen of the intersections will operate at acceptable levels of service. However, a significant impact from
the project is projected at the Montague/South Main intersection, which already operates at a Level of Service
(LOS) F. During the AM peak hour the impact is mitigated to less-than-significant levels by the addition of a
fourth through lane in each direction on Montague and a second southbound left turn lane on Main Street.
The applicant will be required to make a "fair share" contribution to fund the improvements already identified
in the Valley Transportation Plan 2030. Additional mitigation measures include payment of the Midtown
Specific Plan Traffic Impact Fee and constructing street improvements, including street median, per the South
Main Street Plan Line Project.

Vibration and Noise
The City's noise criteria are contained in the Milpitas General Plan. 4 The project site was analyzed for noise
impacts from traffic on South Main Street and for noise and vibration from the Union Pacific railroad tracks. 5

No mitigation measures are required for vibration impacts. With mitigation, noise impacts for the residential
units from traffic on South Main Street and the railroad tracks will not exceed the City's noise criteria. Noise
mitigation measures are:
 Units within 100 feet of South Main Street and the railroad tracks will have windows and doors with a
    Standard Transmission Classification (STC) of at least 30.
 Balconies facing South Main Street and the railroad will be protected by a partial glass enclosure up to six
    feet high.
 An eight-foot high sound wall will be provided on the east property line.
 Ventilation or air conditioning system required providing closed window conditions.

Trees
The City's requirements for Heritage Trees are outlined in the Municipal Code. 6 An arborist report was
prepared to assess the existing trees on site. 7 The report evaluated 58 existing trees; 33 are classified as
"Protected" trees. The report concluded, and City Public Works staff concurs, that "most of the trees...are
volunteers, have poor form and growth patterns and have not been cared for properly...No trees on the

property are in good enough condition to warrant saving." 8 Mitigation measures provide a similar tree
canopy within ten years with the planting of new nursery stock and the issuance of a tree removal permits for
all trees larger than 12 inches in diameter.

PUBLIC COMMENT/OUTREACH
Staff publicly noticed the application in accordance with City and State law. A neighborhood meeting
regarding the project was held in November 2007 to provide information about the proposed project, gather
neighborhood comments and create a dialogue with the existing community. The applicant also met with the
executive board of the Pines homeowners association to answer questions regarding the project. One written
comment was received and is included as an attachment to this report.

CONCLUSIONS
Staff recommends approval of the Alexan South Main project. Located in the TOD overlay zone, this is the
type of high-density residential development that is envisioned by the Midtown Specific Plan. Because of its
proximity to transit facilities and its design, the project will help reinforce the use of transit and alternative
modes of transport. The project meets and exceeds density requirements with 31 additional units under the
density bonus request. In addition, the overall development is an in-fill project replacing existing substandard
and nonconforming uses and aggregating six privately owned parcels into one cohesive project.

The site, landscaping and building design is compatible and aesthetically harmonious with adjacent and
surrounding development. The recommendations of the City's architectural consultant were incorporated into
the design of the development. The Alexan project is consistent with the Zoning Ordinance and Midtown
Specific Plan, with approval of the use permit for building setback standards.

The Alexan project will help the City meet Regional Fair Sharing Housing goals, required by the Association
of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), by providing housing for small families and households, with studio and
one and two bedroom units. The applicants' proposal to transfer affordability rights from the neighboring
Aspen project will exceed the affordable housing requirements of the Redevelopment Agency and the
Midtown Specific Plan. Between the two projects, the redevelopment affordability requirements of 63 units
will be exceeded with a total of 101 units for very low-income households. Both projects combined will
increase opportunities for renters and homeownership for Milpitas residents. Also, through the agreement
between the two developments, the Alexan project will be able to provide financial assistance to assure the
Aspen project's successful completion. In addition, a contingency plan has been developed in the event that
the Aspen project is not completed. The plan requires that the Alexan project provide 15% of units for
moderate-income households in exchange for a 10% density bonus.

The applicant has held meetings to answer questions and respond to concerns from both the Pines
homeowners' association and the Pines neighborhood residents. Lastly, the developers have met the
requirements of the mobile home conversion ordinance, obtained approval from the Planning Commission
and City Council for the conversion plan, and are in the process of implementing the plan to provide for the
fair and expedient conversion of the park.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the Planning Commission:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed Alexan
South Main multi-family housing complex in the City of Milpitas, California. The developer proposes
constructing 397 apartment units to replace an existing mobile home park, auto service center and smaller
apartment building at South Main Street and Cedar Way. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the likely
impacts of the proposed development on the surrounding transportation system and to identify improvements
to mitigate any potential impacts.

Project impacts were estimated following the guidelines of the City of Milpitas and the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA). The analysis evaluated the operations of 14 key intersections under Existing,
Background, and Project Conditions during the AM and PM peak hours. Peak-hour roadway impacts under
Year 2030 Cumulative Conditions were analyzed based on projected roadway segment operations.

PROJECT TRIPS
Trip generation rates for the apartment land use category identified in San Diego Traffic Generators (San
Diego Association of Governments, 2002) were used to estimate the total project trip generation. A nine (9)
percent reduction in the total number trips was applied to account for the project's location near the Great
Mall/Main Transit Center. Trips associated with the existing site uses were subtracted from the trips
associated with the new apartment complex. The proposed apartment complex is estimated to generate
approximately 1,555 net new daily trips, including 124 net new AM peak-hour trips, and 133 net new PM
peak-hour trips.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND IMPROVEMENTS
The results of the analysis indicate that the proposed project would result in less-than-significant impacts at
13 of the 14 study intersections under Project Conditions. The project contributes to already unacceptable
operations at the intersection of Montague Expressway and South Main Street/Oakland Road during the AM
peak hour. The Valley Transportation Plan 2030 proposes widening the roadway and making at-grade
improvements to the intersection; these actions would mitigate the project's impact at the intersection to a
less-than-significant level.

CUMULATIVE ROADWAY IMPACTS
The addition of traffic from the proposed project under Cumulative Conditions would result in significant
impacts on two (2) of the study roadway segments during the AM peak hour and on three (3) segments during
the PM peak hour. The roadway segments significantly affected by the project are summarized below:

    ·   Main Street Southbound ­ Cedar Way to Montague Expressway (AM Peak Hour)

    ·   Main Street Northbound ­ Cedar Way to South Abel Street (AM Peak Hour)

    ·   Main Street Southbound ­ S. Abel Street to Cedar Way (PM Peak Hour)

    ·   Main Street Northbound ­ Montague Expressway to Cedar Way (PM Peak Hour)

    ·   Serra Way Westbound ­ S. Abel Street to Calaveras Boulevard (PM Peak Hour)



                                                                                                              i

However, to mitigate anticipated cumulative impacts of new development traffic on future roadway operations,
the City of Milpitas requires project applicants to pay their "fair share" of the traffic improvement costs.
Accordingly, because the proposed project will contribute traffic to already deficient intersections on
Calaveras Boulevard and Montague Expressway, the developer will be required to make a "fair share"
contribution towards planned improvements along these two corridors. Consequently, any cumulative project
impacts will be mitigated to a less-than-significant level.

SITE ACCESS, ON-SITE CIRCULATION, AND PARKING
The project's primary site driveway will create a fourth leg at the intersection of South Main Street and Cedar
Way. The project applicant will be required to fund and implement traffic signal modifications at this
intersection prior to any occupancy. To minimize potential conflicts, the eastbound approach should be re-
striped with one left turn lane and one shared, through-right lane. Under Project Conditions, the driveway at
Cedar Way is expected to operate at acceptable levels of service. Another driveway will be located at the
north end of the project site and should be consistent with the Main Street Plan Line Study.

The proposed site will include two-way circulation that provides access to two parking structures. The
entrances to the garages are expected to provide acceptable ingress and egress.

According to the Midtown Milpitas Specific Master Plan, developments along the Main Street must prepare a
coordinated development plan (Precise Plan) to ensure development of individual parcels will be part of a
coherent overall site plan for the larger area, including the coordination of circulation and access. Based on
the proposed site plan, the new on-site circulation roads allow access to the intersection at Cedar Way and
Main Street from any new development on the parcel immediately to the south of the new apartment
buildings.

The proposed on-site parking supply exceeds the City's parking code requirements. Thus, no changes to the
parking supply are proposed.

BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN, AND TRANSIT IMPACTS
Bicycle racks or lockers should be provided in the apartment complex to accommodate bicycle storage.
Bicycle parking outside the apartments should be in high-visibility areas to encourage bicycle travel and to
discourage theft and vandalism. Pedestrian areas and crosswalks between buildings and parking areas
should be clearly marked to ensure pedestrian safety. With these recommendations, impacts to the bike and
pedestrian facilities are expected to be less-than-significant.

The project is located near a major transit center hub and the average load factors for VTA Route 66 can
accommodate additional transit demand. Thus, impacts to transit facilities are expected to be less-than-
significant.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis (TIA) conducted for the proposed Alexan
South Main residential project, located within the Midtown Milpitas Redevelopment Area at South Main Street
and Cedar Way in Milpitas, California. The proposed project consists of replacing an existing mobile home
park, auto service center and smaller apartment building with a 397-unit apartment complex. This project
replaces a previous proposal for 390 condominium units to be built on the same parcel. The project location is
shown on Figure 1, and the proposed site plan is illustrated on Figure 2.

The purpose of the TIA is to identify potential significant adverse impacts of the proposed residential
development on the transportation system and to recommend mitigation measures, if needed. Project impacts
were evaluated following the guidelines of the City of Milpitas and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA), the congestion management agency for Santa Clara County.

The following 14 key intersections were evaluated:

    1. Calaveras Boulevard (SR 237) / Abel Street*
    2. Calaveras Boulevard (SR 237) Westbound Off-Ramp / South Main Street
    3. Calaveras Boulevard (SR 237) Eastbound On-Ramp / South Main Street
    4. Serra Way / South Abel Street
    5. Serra Way / South Main Street
    6. Curtis Avenue / South Abel Street
    7. Curtis Avenue / South Main Street
    8. Tasman Drive / I-880 Southbound Ramps
    9. Great Mall Parkway / I-880 Northbound Ramps
    10. Great Mall Parkway / South Abel Street
    11. Great Mall Parkway / South Main Street
    12. South Abel Street / South Main Street
    13. South Main Street / Cedar Way
    14. Montague Expressway / South Main Street*

*Designated CMP intersection

All of the key study intersections are within the City of Milpitas. The intersection of Montague Expressway and
South Main Street is located partially within the City of San Jose, where the south leg of South Main Street
becomes Oakland Road. Montague Expressway is under Santa Clara County's jurisdiction, and SR 237 is a
Caltrans facility. Impacts of the proposed development on pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities are also
considered.

The study intersections were evaluated during the weekday morning (AM) and weekday evening (PM) peak
hours for the Existing, Background and Project Conditions. Roadway segments located in the study area were
analyzed to develop the Year 2030 Conditions Scenario. The report presents the following four scenarios:



                                                                                                             1

    Scenario 1:   Existing Conditions - Existing volumes obtained from counts, representing peak one-
                  hour traffic conditions during the morning and afternoon commute periods.

    Scenario 2:   Background Conditions - Existing volumes plus traffic from approved but not yet
                  constructed developments in the area. This scenario forms the basis from which project
                  impacts are determined.

    Scenario 3:   Project Conditions ­ Existing traffic volumes, plus traffic from approved but not yet
                  constructed developments in the area, plus traffic generated by the proposed apartment
                  complex.

    Scenario 4:    Year 2030 Conditions ­ Cumulative traffic operations were evaluated using a peak-hour
                   roadway segment analysis per City of Milpitas Guidelines. Year 2030 Cumulative
                   Conditions were evaluated using volumes from the City's travel demand model and the
                   project trip assignment.

The remainder of this report is divided into four chapters. The existing transportation system serving the
subject property including the current operating conditions of the key intersections and freeway segments are
described in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 discusses operations with traffic from approved but not yet constructed
developments under Background Conditions. Chapter 4 describes Project Conditions, including the
methodology used to estimate the amount of project traffic added to the surrounding roadways and its impact
on the transportation system. This chapter also includes a discussion of site access, on-site circulation, and
parking. Cumulative Conditions are described in Chapter 5.

2. EXISTING CONDITIONS
This chapter discusses the existing roadway network and operations of the study intersections and describes
the bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities located in the project study area. This chapter also includes a
discussion of the methods used to calculate intersection levels of service and the corresponding results.

EXISTING ROADWAY NETWORK
This section describes the existing roadway network, which is illustrated on Figure 1. Regional access to the
project site is provided by I-880, SR 237, and Montague Expressway. Local access to the site is provided by
Great Mall Parkway / Tasman Drive, Main Street, and Abel Street.

I-880 is a north-south freeway located west of the project site extending north to the City of Oakland and
south to the City of San Jose. In the vicinity of the project site, the freeway includes eight lanes north of State
Route (SR) 237/Calaveras Boulevard and six lanes to the south. The I-880/SR 237 interchange includes
direct ramp connections for High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes between the west and north legs of the
interchange. Regional access to the project site is provided via interchanges at Great Mall Parkway and at
Montague Expressway.

SR 237 is an east-west roadway that includes two distinct facilities: a six-lane freeway extending from I-880
west to US 101, and a four- to six-lane arterial roadway between I-880 and I-680 with an elevated section
over the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. The arterial section is locally designated as Calaveras Boulevard, and
includes six lanes except on the bridge where it is four lanes wide. Calaveras Boulevard serves as a major
commuter route linking I-680 to I-880 and beyond, with heavy directional travel during the peak hours
(westbound in the morning and eastbound in the afternoon). Regional access to the project site is provided
via an intersection at Abel Street.

Montague Expressway is an east-west, six- to eight-lane, limited access, divided arterial roadway extending
from US 101 in San Jose to I-680 in Milpitas. This facility is designated San Tomas Expressway west of US
101 and Landess Avenue east of I-680. Montague Expressway includes directional HOV lanes during peak
periods (westbound during the morning and eastbound during the afternoon). Montague Expressway
connects with I-880 and I-680 via full cloverleaf interchanges.

Tasman Drive is an east-west, six-lane divided arterial roadway extending from I-880 west into the Cities of
San Jose, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale. Tasman Drive is designated Great Mall Parkway east of I-880 and
extends to Montague Expressway. Great Mall Parkway is an east-west, six-lane divided arterial roadway
extending from I-880 east to Montague Expressway and becomes Capitol Avenue east of Montague
Expressway. VTA operates light-rail transit (LRT) service in the median of Tasman Drive/Great Mall
Parkway/Capitol Avenue.

Main Street is a north-south, two- to four-lane, minor arterial roadway that extends parallel to Abel Street and
extends between Railroad Avenue and Montague Expressway. Main Street is designated as Marylinn Drive
north of Railroad Avenue, and as Oakland Road south of Montague Expressway. The study intersection at
Montague Expressway and S. Main Street/Oakland Road is partially located within the City of San Jose.

Abel Street is a north-south, two- to four-lane, minor arterial roadway extending between Milpitas Boulevard
and Main Street (south of Great Mall Parkway). The section of Abel Street between Corning and Curtis
Avenues includes four travel lanes plus a two-way left-turn lane.




                                                                                                                 5

Milpitas Boulevard is a north-south, four-lane arterial roadway extending from the Milpitas-Fremont city limit
south to Montague Expressway.

EXISTING TRANSIT FACILITIES
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) operates bus and light rail service in Santa Clara
County. Figure 3 shows the existing transit facilities in the study area. The Great Mall/Main Transit Center is
located north of the project site and is a major transfer point for bus and light rail service.

A VTA light rail line provides service between Alum Rock Station in the southeast and Santa Teresa station in
the southwest. Bus routes 33, 46, 47, 66, 70, 71, 77, 104, 140, 180, 321, and 217 (operated by AC Transit)
provide bus service from the study area to locations throughout Santa Clara County. Route 66 provides
service north of Calaveras Boulevard to downtown San Jose via the Great Mall/Main Transit Center, and it
has a stop on South Main Street at the project site. Table 1 summarizes the terminals, hours of operation, and
service frequencies for routes serving the study area.

EXISTING PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE FACILITIES

Pedestrian Facilities

Pedestrian facilities comprise sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals. Sidewalks are provided along
South Main Street, South Abel Street, Tasman Drive/Great Mall Parkway, Calaveras Boulevard and local
roadways. Signalized crossings are provided at all signalized intersections in the study area. Sidewalk
locations near the project site are shown in Figure 4.

Bicycle Facilities

Bicycle facilities comprise paths (Class I), lanes (Class II), and routes (Class III). Bicycle paths are paved
trails that are separate from roadways. Bicycle lanes are lanes on roadways designated for bicycle use by
striping, pavement legends, and signs. Bicycle routes are roadways designated for bicycle use by signs only.

Figure 4 presents existing bicycle facilities in the study area. Class II bike lanes are provided along Great Mall
Parkway, Main Street, McCandless Drive, and Milpitas Boulevard north of Yosemite Drive. Abel Street,
Calaveras Boulevard, and McCarthy Boulevard are classified as Class III bike routes and are rated "Extreme
Caution" according to the VTA. This classification recognizes the road's heavy traffic volumes, traffic speeds
greater than 35 miles per hour (mph), and sudden and rapid lane changes. Striped bike lanes are provided on
Montague Expressway; however, the VTA warns cyclists to exercise caution on this facility due to high
speeds and high traffic volumes.

Field Observations

Based on field observations, the documented facilities near the project site are in good condition and serve
the current demand. Bicycle routes or lanes serve all local areas of the projected trip distribution except for
travel on SR 237, west of I-880, and trips on I-680 and I-880.

EXISTING VOLUMES AND LANE CONFIGURATIONS
The operations of the key intersections were evaluated during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.
Intersection operations were evaluated for the highest one-hour volume counted between 7:00 AM and 9:00
AM and between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. New traffic counts were obtained for 11 of the study intersections in
September 2007. Traffic counts conducted in 2006 and 2007 were used to evaluate the intersections at
Calaveras Boulevard/SR 237 and Abel Street, Tasman Drive and I-880 Southbound Ramps, and Great Mall
Parkway and I-880 Northbound Ramps. The new traffic counts are included in Appendix A.

Figure 5 presents the existing AM and PM peak-hour turning movement volumes at the study intersections.
Figure 5 also includes the existing intersection lane configurations and traffic control devices.

LEVEL OF SERVICE METHOD
The operations of roadway facilities are described with the term level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative
description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six
levels are defined from LOS A, with the best operating conditions, to LOS F, with the worst operating
conditions. LOS E represents "at-capacity" operations. Operations are designated as LOS F when volumes
exceed capacity, resulting in stop-and-go conditions.

The City of Milpitas has established a minimum acceptable operating level of LOS D for intersections
excluding those monitored by the VTA's Congestion Management Program (CMP). The minimum acceptable
level for CMP-designated intersections is LOS E.

Signalized Intersections

The LOS method for signalized intersections approved by the City of Milpitas and VTA analyzes intersection
operations based on average control vehicular delay, as described in Chapter 16 of the 2000 Highway
Capacity Manual, with adjusted saturation flow rates to reflect conditions in Santa Clara County. Control delay
includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final acceleration delay. The
average control delay for signalized intersections is calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software and is
correlated to a LOS designation as shown in Table 2.

Unsignalized Intersections

Operations of the unsignalized study intersections are evaluated using the method contained in Chapter 17 of
the 2000 HCM and calculated using TRAFFIX analysis software. LOS ratings for stop-sign controlled
intersections are based on the average control delay expressed in seconds per vehicle. At two-way or side-
street stop-controlled intersections, control delay is calculated for each movement, not for the intersection as
a whole. For approaches composed of a single lane, control delay is computed as the average of all
movements in that lane. For all-way, stop-controlled locations, a weighted average delay for the entire
intersection is calculated. Table 3 summarizes the relationship between delay and LOS for unsignalized
intersections.

EXISTING INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Existing intersection lane configurations, signal timings, and peak-hour turning movement volumes were used
as inputs for the LOS calculations. The results of the LOS analysis for Existing Conditions are presented in
Table 4. Appendix B contains the corresponding calculation sheets.

All of the study intersections operate at acceptable levels of service according to their designated standard.

INTERSECTION FIELD OBSERVATIONS
Field observations were conducted at the study intersections during the AM and PM peak periods in
September, 2007. In general, observations indicated that the study intersections are operating at or near the
calculated levels of service.

Construction was noted in two areas. The median was under construction along Abel Street, beginning at
Great Mall Parkway. The fourth leg of the intersection of Main Street and the Calaveras Off-Ramp (Study
Intersection 2) was being constructed as part of the new library project site..

3. BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
This chapter discusses the operations of the key intersections with existing traffic volumes plus traffic
generated from surrounding projects that have been approved but are not yet constructed or occupied.
Background Conditions serve as the basis for identifying project impacts as described in Chapter 4.

BACKGROUND TRAFFIC ESTIMATES
Traffic volumes for Background Conditions were estimated by adding traffic generated by approved but not
yet constructed or occupied developments to existing traffic volumes. A list of approved projects and available
traffic projections were provided by Milpitas City staff. Approved trips from San Jose were added to Milpitas
approved trips to develop background volumes at the intersection of Montague Expressway and S. Main
Street/Oakland Road. Trips were then distributed to adjacent intersections to account for the added San Jose
trips.

Figure 6 illustrates the traffic volumes at the key intersections under Background Conditions. Appendix C
contains the list of approved projects included in this scenario.

No near-term roadway improvements where identified or included in this scenario.

BACKGROUND LEVELS OF SERVICE
Level of service (LOS) calculations were conducted for the study intersections to evaluate operations under
Background Conditions. Table 5 presents the LOS results, and the corresponding calculation sheets are
included in Appendix B. Under Background Conditions, added traffic at the intersection at Montague
Expressway and S. Main Street/Oakland Road is expected to degrade operations to LOS F. All other study
intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels according to their designated standard.

4. PROJECT CONDITIONS
The impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding roadway system are discussed in this chapter. First,
the methodology used to estimate the amount of traffic generated by the project is described. Then, the
results of the level of service (LOS) calculations for Project Conditions are presented. Project Conditions are
defined as existing traffic volumes, plus trips from approved but not yet constructed developments
(Background Conditions), plus traffic generated by the proposed project. A comparison of intersection
operations under Background and Project Conditions are presented and the impacts of the project on the
study intersections are discussed. Site access, on-site circulation, parking and impacts to non-automobile
travel modes are also addressed in this chapter.

PROJECT TRAFFIC VOLUMES
The amount of traffic added to the roadway system by the proposed apartment complex is estimated using a
three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip assignment. The first step estimates
the amount of traffic added to the roadway network. The second step estimates the direction of travel to and
from the project site. The trips are assigned to specific street segments and intersection turning movements in
the third step. The results of the process for the proposed project are described in the following section.

Trip Generation

The amount of traffic added to the surrounding roadway system by the proposed project was estimated using
trip generation rates appropriate for the development proposal. Trip generation rates for the apartment land
use category identified in San Diego Traffic Generators (San Diego Association of Governments, 2002) were
used to estimate project-generated trips. According to VTA guidelines, a nine (9) percent reduction in the total
number of trips was applied to account for the project's location near the VTA light rail station at Great Mall
Parkway/Main Street. Trips associated with the existing uses on-site were also estimated using SANDAG
rates and those trips were subtracted from the trips associated with the new apartment development. The net
project trips and generation rates are presented in Table 6.

The proposed apartment complex is estimated to generate 1,555 net new daily trips, 124 net new AM peak-
hour trips (13 inbound and 111 outbound), and 133 net new PM peak-hour trips (103 inbound and 29
outbound).

Trip Distribution

The directions of approach and departure for the proposed project were estimated using VTA's travel demand
forecasting model, existing travel patterns, and the relative locations of complementary land uses. The major
directions of approach and departure form the project trip distribution pattern, as illustrated in Figure 7.

Trip Assignment

The trips generated by the project were assigned to the roadway system based on the directions of approach
and departure discussed above. Figure 8 shows the AM and PM peak-hour project trips assigned to each
turning movement at the study intersections. Project trips were added to background traffic volumes to
establish intersection volumes for Project Conditions, as shown on Figure 9.

PROJECT INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
The results of the intersection LOS calculations for Project Conditions are presented in Table 7. Appendix B
contains the corresponding calculation sheets. The results for Background Conditions are included for
comparison purposes, along with the projected increases in critical delay and critical volume-to-capacity (V/C)
ratios. Critical delay represents the delay associated with the critical movements of the intersection, or the
movements that require the most "green time" and have the greatest effect on overall intersection operations.
The changes in critical delay and critical V/C ratio between Background and Project Conditions are used to
identify significant impacts per VTA and City impact analysis guidelines.

Thirteen of the 14 study intersections are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service according to
their designated standard under Project Conditions. Some intersections have no change or improve in their
operations. This can occur when trips are being added to movements with lower delays or to non-critical
movements.

The already unacceptable operations at the intersection at Montague Expressway and South Main Street are
expected to worsen under Project Conditions.

INTERSECTION IMPACT CRITERIA
The impacts of the project were evaluated by comparing the results of the level of service calculations under
Project Conditions to the results under Background Conditions.

City of Milpitas Intersections

Significant impacts at signalized City of Milpitas intersections occur when the addition of project traffic causes
one of the following:

    ·   Operations to degrade from an acceptable level (LOS D or better) under Background Conditions to an
        unacceptable level (LOS E or F) under Project Conditions.

    ·   Unacceptable operations are exacerbated by increasing the critical delay by more than four (4)
        seconds and increasing the critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by 0.01 or more.

    ·   The critical V/C ratio increases by 0.01 or more at an intersection with unacceptable operations (LOS
        E or F) when the change in critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases). This can occur if the critical
        movements change.

Valley Transportation Authority CMP Intersections

Significant impacts at CMP intersections occur when the addition of project traffic causes one of the following:

    ·   Operations to degrade from an acceptable level (LOS E or better) under Background Conditions to an
        unacceptable level (LOS F) under Project Conditions.

    ·   Unacceptable operations are exacerbated by increasing the critical delay by more than four (4)
        seconds and increasing the critical volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio by 0.01 or more.

    ·   The critical V/C ratio increases by 0.01 or more at an intersection with unacceptable operations (LOS
        E or F) when the change in critical delay is negative (i.e., decreases). This can occur if the critical
        movements change.

INTERSECTION IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Based on the impact criteria listed above, the proposed project will have a significant impact at one study
intersection. Project trips are expected to contribute to already unacceptable conditions at the intersection of
Montague Expressway and South Main Street/Oakland Road during the AM peak hour. The project will
increase the critical V/C ratio by more than 0.01 and increase the critical delay by more than four (4) seconds.
The project will have a less-than-significant impact at the remaining 13 key intersections.

Mitigation Measure

Montague Expressway / South Main Street-Oakland Road ­ Traffic from the proposed project contributes to
already unacceptable LOS F operations during the AM peak hour. Adding a fourth through lane in each
direction on the expressway and a second southbound left turn lane on Main Street, which is consistent with
improvements identified in the Valley Transportation Plan 2030, provides acceptable operations during the
AM peak hour. The mitigation has a negligible effect on operations during the PM peak hour. With these
improvements, the project impact will be mitigated to a less-than-significant level. Per City staff, the project
applicant will be required to make a "fair share" contribution to fund this improvement.

                                                                                                               23

PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE AND TRANSIT FACILITIES
The project will cause a significant impact to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities and services if an
element of the proposed project conflicts with existing or planned pedestrian, bicycle, and transit services, or
if the project creates hazardous conditions that currently do not exist for pedestrians or bicyclists.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities

The project will generate new demand for pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities. As described in Chapter 2,
existing sidewalks are provided adjacent to and in the vicinity of the site. Crosswalks are provided at all study
intersections in the study area. Bicycle lanes are provided on Main Street, adjacent to the site. The proposed
project has adequate pedestrian and bicycle access.

Bicycle racks or lockers should be provided in the apartment complex to accommodate bicycle storage.
Bicycle parking outside the apartments should be in high-visibility areas to encourage bicycle travel and to
discourage theft and vandalism.

The Main Street Plan Line Study Project identifies the Main Street corridor as appropriate for median island
and streetscape enhancements. The proposed project appears to conform to pedestrian and transit
connectivity plans for the area. The proposed project does not conflict with existing or planned bicycle and
pedestrian facilities, and no additional off-site bicycle and pedestrian facilities are recommended. Overall,
impacts to bicycle and pedestrian facilities are considered less-than-significant.

Transit Service

Impacts to transit are considered significant if the proposed project impedes the development or operation of
existing or planned transit facilities or generates potential transit trips without adequate transit capacity or
adequate facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists to access transit stops. The development's proposed trip
generation includes a reduction in vehicular trips, as shown in Table 6, for person trips occurring via light rail
service instead of private automobile. These additional transit trips are expected to use VTA light rail service
at the Great Mall/Main Transit Center, as well as VTA Route 66.

According to the VTA, the average load of Route 66 buses leaving the bus stops at Main Street and Cedar
Way is approximately 12 people in the northbound direction and 10 people in the southbound direction. A
VTA bus typically has 38 seats, so adequate capacity would still be available even if all 14 directional transit
trips from Table 6 used a single bus in the peak hour. Average load factors along other portions of the line
may be higher or lower. Additional bus and light rail service is available at the Great Mall/Main Transit Center.

The existing transit service at the site, along with additional service provided at the Great Mall/Main Transit
Center, will be able to accommodate the increased demand; therefore, the project's impact on transit service
is anticipated to be less-than-significant.

SITE ACCESS, ON-SITE CIRCULATION AND PARKING

Vehicular Site Access

Site access for the proposed project was reviewed based on the site plan provided by Trammell Crow
Residential. The entrance to the project will create a fourth leg at the intersection of South Main Street and
Cedar Way. One outbound left-turn lane and one shared through/right-turn lane is proposed. The project
applicant will be required to fund and implement traffic signal modifications at this intersection prior to any
occupancy. To avoid potential conflicts, the eastbound approach of Cedar Way should be re-striped with one

                                                                                                               24

shared, through-right and one left-turn lane. Under Project Conditions, the driveway is expected to operate at
acceptable levels of service.

Another entrance and exit is located at the north end of the project site. This driveway will permit right-in,
right-out, and left-in turning movements. These improvements should be consistent with the Main Street Plan
Line Study and the Midtown Milpitas Specific Master Plan.

Site Circulation

The proposed site will include two-way circulation that provides access to two parking structures as shown in
the site plan. One six-story garage is located behind Building One and a second, two-story garage is located
behind Building Two. As designed, the entrances to the garages are expected to provide acceptable ingress
and egress.

Based on the current site plan, most residents of Building Three would be required to exit the parking
structures at Buildings One and Two and cross to Building Three to enter their apartments. Pedestrian areas
and crosswalks between buildings and parking areas should be clearly marked to ensure pedestrian safety.

According to the Midtown Milpitas Specific Master Plan, developments along the Main Street must prepare a
coordinated development plan (Precise Plan) to ensure development of individual parcels will be part of a
coherent overall site plan for the larger area, including the coordination of circulation and access. Based on
the proposed site plan, the new on-site circulation roads allow access to the intersection at Cedar Way and
Main Street from any new development on the parcel immediately to the south of the new apartment
buildings.

Parking

The proposed project contains 30 studio apartments, 191 one-bedroom apartments, and 176 two-bedroom
apartments. Based on City requirements, the new apartment complex must provide 615 parking spaces
allowing for a 20 percent reduction due to proximity to the Great Mall/Main Transit Center. The site plan
includes 629 parking spaces, which exceeds City requirements. Table 11 summarizes the parking
requirements at the site.

Parking is located in two parking structures and in ground spaces parallel to building three and the eastern
boundary of the site. The parking structure behind Building One will provide 435 stalls on 6.5 parking levels;
the structure behind Building Two will provide 152 spaces on 2 levels. Forty two (42) spaces will be provided
along the interior streets of the site.

5. YEAR 2030 CONDITIONS
This chapter discusses the analysis of two Year 2030 scenarios (Year 2030 No Project and Year 2030 Plus
Project), which were conducted using projected roadway link volumes per City of Milpitas guidelines. Peak-
hour roadway segment volumes are used for this long-term analysis since estimating intersection turning
movement volumes in 2030 would be speculative.

YEAR 2030 TRAFFIC VOLUMES

Year 2030 No Project Volumes

Year 2030 AM and PM peak-hour roadway segment traffic volumes were obtained by Hexagon
Transportation Consultants from the VTA Congestion Management Program (CMP) Year 2030 Travel
Demand Forecast (TDF) model. The Year 2030 No Project volumes assume that the future McCarthy Ranch
parcel along the west side of McCarthy Road has a 0.35 floor-area ratio (FAR).

Year 2030 Plus Project Volumes

The net new trips generated by the proposed apartment complex were manually added to the Year 2030 No
Project volumes to establish Year 2030 Plus Project volumes. Tables 9 and 10 present the Year 2030 AM and
PM peak-hour roadway segment volumes.

YEAR 2030 NETWORK ASSUMPTIONS
The Year 2030 roadway network includes any planned transportation improvement that has a high probability
of receiving funding or has already received funding. Within the study area, the following improvements were
identified:

    ·   I-880 Widening Project ­ I-880 will be widened to include a high-occupancy vehicle lane and auxiliary
        lane in each direction from Montague Expressway south of the site into Alameda County to the north.

    ·   Calaveras Boulevard ­ Calaveras Boulevard will be widened to six lanes between Milpitas Boulevard
        and Abel Street. Operational improvements are also planned for intersections along Calaveras
        Boulevard between I-680 and I-880.

    ·   Montague Expressway ­ Montague Expressway will be configured to provide eight mixed-flow lanes
        between I-680 and I-880.

YEAR 2030 ROADWAY SEGMENT LEVELS OF SERVICE
As shown in Tables 9 and 10, the addition of project traffic is anticipated to result in significant impacts on two
(2) roadway segments in the AM peak hour and three (3) roadway segments in the PM peak hour under Year
2030 Plus Project Conditions. The impacted roadway segments are identified in bold in Tables 9 and 10.




                                                                                                                27

YEAR 2030 ROADWAY SEGMENT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
The cumulative impacts of the project were evaluated by comparing the results of the level of service
calculations under Year 2030 Plus Project Conditions to the results under Year 2030 No Project Conditions.
Significant impacts to roadway segments are identified if one of the following criterion is met:

    ·   The addition of traffic from the proposed project degrades operations under Year 2030 No Project
        Conditions from an acceptable level to an unacceptable level.

    ·   The proposed project adds trips that are more than one percent of the segment's capacity to a
        segment that is projected to operate unacceptably under Year 2030 No Project Conditions.

Acceptable operations are defined as LOS D or better for City roadway segments and LOS E or better for
CMP roadway segments. Unacceptable operations are defined as LOS E or F for City roadway segments and
LOS F for CMP roadway segments.

Based on the impact criteria listed above, the proposed project will have a significant impact on the
following roadway segments:

    ·   Main Street Southbound ­ Cedar Way to Montague Expressway (AM Peak Hour)

    ·   Main Street Northbound ­ Cedar Way to South Abel Street (AM Peak Hour)

    ·   Main Street Southbound ­ S. Abel Street to Cedar Way (PM Peak Hour)

    ·   Main Street Northbound ­ Montague Expressway to Cedar Way (PM Peak Hour)

    ·   Serra Way Westbound ­ S. Abel Street to Calaveras Boulevard (PM Peak Hour)

The City of Milpitas requires project applicants to pay their "fair share" of the improvements costs to mitigate
the anticipated cumulative impact of traffic from new developments on future deficient roadways. The project
applicant will be required to pay an impact fee to provide mitigation for future deficiencies in traffic operations.
The project applicant will be required to make a "fair share" contribution toward the Montague Expressway
and Calaveras Boulevard (SR 237) widening improvement projects because the project adds traffic to these
corridors. Consequently, any cumulative project impacts will be mitigated to a less-than-significant level.

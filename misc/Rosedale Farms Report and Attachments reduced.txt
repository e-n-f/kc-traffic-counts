Re:     Rosedale Farm ­ 1600 and 1220 Graves Mill Road
        Rezoning: R-1, Low Density Residential District, and B-5C, General Business
        District (Conditional), to B-3C, Community Business District (Conditional)
        Conditional Use Permit (CUP): Cluster Commercial Development (CCD)


I. PETITIONER
   Rosedale Farm LLC, 1600 Graves Mill Road, Lynchburg, VA 24502 and
   Bella Rose Plantation LLC, 1220 Graves Mill Road, Lynchburg, VA 24502
   Representative: Ron Cox and Bryant Hare, Hopkins Brothers Legacy Planning &
   Development, P.O. Box 753, Lynchburg, VA
II. LOCATION
    The subject property includes two (2) tracts totaling approximately seventy and eighty-six
    thousandths (70.086) acres located at 1600 and 1220 Graves Mill Road. Forty-three and two
    tenths (43.2) acres are proposed to be rezoned and for Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for the
    Cluster Commercial Development (CCD).
    Property Owner: Rosedale Farm LLC and Bella Rose Plantation LLC
III. PURPOSE
     The purpose of this petition is to rezone approximately forty-three and two tenths (43.2) acres
     to allow for the construction of a mixed use commercial and residential development at 1600
     Graves Mill Road and to allow a variety of uses for the existing historic buildings at 1220 Graves
     Mill Road, such as art studios, shops, and space for outdoor receptions and events, which is not
     included in the Zoning Ordinance.
IV. SUMMARY
     Petition agrees with the Zoning Ordinance which permits uses allowed by right in R-3 through
      B-5 districts in a CCD by approval of a CUP.
     The Comprehensive Plan 2013-2030's Future Land Use Map recommends a Mixed Use and a
      Resource Conservation use for the subject property.
     The proposed development density would be an average of one (1) residential unit per acre
      plus 165,000 square feet of commercial space (mixed with residential and separate) and
      approximately eight and eight tenths (8.8) acres of open space. Preserved open space
      includes onsite amenities of a lawn/park area and a system of trails.
     The site layout follows development principles for connectivity, mixed use, and building
      placement as called for by the Comprehensive Plan 2013-2030's Goals and Policies or Chapter 6:
      Land Use Development & Community Design.
     The property is one of few remaining vacant large tracts of land in the City of Lynchburg.
     The property falls within the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.
     Outdoor events are not mentioned in the zoning ordinance and are therefore not allowed
      unless deemed compatible with the uses in B-3, B-4, or B-5 by the Lynchburg City Council.

       The petition would exacerbate and accelerate level of service (LOS) issues with the
       Lynchburg Expressway interchange.
The Planning Division recommends approval of the rezoning and CUP petitions.

V. FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Comprehensive Plan. The property is indicated for Mixed Use and Resource Conservation
   use on the Future Land Use Map (FLUM).
   The Comprehensive Plan 2013-2030 provides that Mixed Use developments do not fit into any
   single use category as they are planned for a mix of uses carefully designed so as to mitigate any
   potential land use conflicts. The mixed use areas generally consist of large undeveloped or
   greenfield areas that are intended to be developed for a balanced mix of residential,
   neighborhood commercial, civic uses, parks and open spaces. The mix of uses in these areas is
   intended to be determined at the time of development review and approval. (pg 76)
   Land use decisions made by the City should take into account not only the land uses depicted on
   the FLUM, but also the Plan Framework Map and Goals and Policies contained within the
   Comprehensive Plan. The Plan Framework Map shows the tract of land as within the Graves Mill
   Business / Technology Area and states that given the size and location of the Graves Mill Area,
   a mixed use core with higher density residential development and retail uses is appropriate for
   the area south and west of the interchange of Graves Mill Road and the Lynchburg Expressway.
   (pg 70)
   The Comprehensive Plan contains goals specific to new development and policies to follow to
   achieve those goals. Those applicable from the Land Use and Development section are listed
   here:
   Goal LU-1: Land Availability. Make efficient use of land and resources in the City to serve the
   needs of the region through new development, redevelopment and infill that accomplishes the
   Plan's goals. (pg 13)

   Goal LU-1.4: Consider the Planning Framework, land availability, existing land use and zoning
   patterns, site constraints, transportation capacity, utility availability and natural systems when
   evaluating zoning and Future Land Use Map amendments. (pg 14)

   Goal LU-1.6: When the FLUM allows for greater density than allowed by existing zoning,
   determine whether a zoning change would be appropriate pursuant to policy LU-1.4 or whether
   the site is appropriate for density bonuses based on community benefits specified in the City's
   zoning ordinance. (pg 14)

   Goal LU-3: Compatibility, Character and Design. Reinforce Lynchburg's unique character
   through public and private strategies that preserve historic elements, enhance transportation
   options, use existing infrastructure and improve access between land uses. (pg 15)

   LU-3.2 Coordinate site and building design with the design of streets and public facilities.(pg 15)

   LU-3.5 Facilitate creative residential, commercial and mixed-use development designs that create
   vibrant, healthy neighborhoods. (pg 15)
Planning Commission: Rezoning / CUP ­ 1220 and 1600 Graves Mill Road ­February 26, 2014                     3

    LU-3.6 Ensure that developments and public improvements within Scenic Conservation Areas
    are designed to protect or enhance the areas' scenic and environmental qualities. (pg 16)

    LU-3.7 When addressing compatibility and connectivity between adjacent land uses, ensure that
    building orientation, building location, parking locations, parking design, lighting, walkways and
    other building and site design factors provide safe and convenient access to sites for drivers,
    pedestrians, bicyclists and transit riders. [See design discussion in Chapter 6] (pg 16)

    LU-3.10 Encourage the development of built environments that support the integration of
    healthy and active living in day-to-day life and foster human interaction. (pg 16)

    Goal NH-2: Neighborhood Character. Promote well-designed mixed-use residential
    neighborhoods that incorporate a variety of housing types and densities with pedestrian-oriented
    streets, small-scale neighborhood oriented services and parks to where residents are able to live,
    work and play close to home. (pg 25)

The proposed Rosedale Development has a desirable mix of land uses that meet the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan's FLUM, Framework Map, and text by providing a combination of retail,
residential, and office uses within a single site. Mixed use developments called for by the goals in the
Comprehensive Plan should follow "Main Street" design conventions. Buildings following this style
are pedestrian oriented with facades and main entrances facing streets, human-scale massing and
fenestration, and contain a mix of uses within individual buildings, where lower floors are used for
commercial uses and the upper floors are used for residential. Buildings should have unified design
characteristics with similar height and massing to create a "street wall," an essential component of a
walkable design. Parking should be accommodated by on street parking and disguised in the rear of
buildings, rather than having large open parking lots depleting the character from a development.
Rosedale's site plan meets many of the above concepts and sets the stage for future development of
both adjacent undeveloped areas, as well as providing the framework for more density within the
existing site plan as the market dictates. The Planning Division sees providing that framework,
which involves building a connected street grid with multimodal facilities, and creating a context
where buildings are human scale and placed close to the streets as the most crucial goal of site
planning. Rosedale meets those goals and it is envisioned that through time, Rosedale will become a
hub for this area of the city and the future development of the remaining vacant land on site and off.

Additionally, the proposed development provides both public needs and amenities. These include
right of way connections, trails, sidewalks, shared use paths for walkers and bikers, and a bus pull off
for potential bus routes, offering a choice of travel modes for trips within and out of the site. The
trail and lawn / park area are also highly valued as needed public spaces for recreation and social
interaction.

2. Zoning. The subject property was annexed into the City in 1976 and the existing R-1, Low-
   Density Residential zoning was established in 1978 with the adoption of the current Zoning
   Ordinance.
    The proposed B-3, Community Business District and Cluster Commercial Development (CCD),
    would allow for all uses permitted by right in R-3 through B-5 districts and all uses illustrated on
    the site plan. The Zoning Ordinance characterizes CCD districts with three key features: an increased
    public amenity, shared parking areas between land uses, and a general "clustering" of
    development on site. The proposed site plan provides for amenity areas, but could make better
Planning Commission: Rezoning / CUP ­ 1220 and 1600 Graves Mill Road ­February 26, 2014                  4

   use of the provisions for clustering and sharing parking. "Clustering" refers to placing buildings
   close together on a single site. Clustering buildings automatically leads various uses to share
   parking. If the mix of land uses work together, then fewer parking spaces would be necessary
   on site, a desirable outcome for a number of reasons including stormwater management,
   maintenance, and a general flexibility for future development of the site.
   CCDs are permitted in places consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and in areas where public
   services certified to be adequate for the proposed development by the Director of Planning for
   the City of Lynchburg. Consideration should be given to the effects of the development on the
   ramps with the Lynchburg Expressway (see section below on Traffic).
3. Proffers. The petitioner has voluntarily submitted the following proffers:
       The property will be developed as a Cluster Commercial Development (CCD). With regards
       to setbacks, the front setback from Graves Mill Road will be 30'. All other setbacks for
       front, side and rear yards will be zero feet. Excluding Graves Mill Road, the maximum
       setback shall be 15' from the public right of ways or back of sidewalk on private streets.
       Buildings labeled "A," "B," "C," "D," "E," and "F" are exempt from the maximum setback.
       The property will be developed with a combination of sidewalks, bike path and walking trails
       to promote interconnectivity.
       The property will be developed with a park area with a combination of lawns and trees.
       The property will be developed with two public rights of way access to promote connectivity
       with adjoining properties (PIN 23405002 and 23902005). The connection points are subject
       to adjustment to accommodate changes with the projects internal layout.
       The project will be developed to accommodate bus stops for mass transit. The project will
       include a bus shelter and turn-out.
       The property will be developed such that all exterior lighting will be glare shielded and
       designed to prevent illumination beyond the external developments property lines.
       Turn lanes will be installed along Graves Mill Road as determined necessary by the current
       traffic study dated January 2014 or as determined by an updated traffic study provided by the
       developer.
       Streets will have ornamental street lights.
       Uses shall be as permitted by right in B-3 and lesser intense districts. However, the following
       uses will not be included within the development of the site: billboards, building material and
       construction or farm equipment sales, contractors' establishments, exterminators, kennels,
       storage, warehouses and yards, manufacturing uses, automobile oriented uses, including
       automobile, trailer, and truck rentals and sales, tire retail sales, painting/body repair shops
       and service stations, excluding fueling stations, which will be allowed within the
       development.
       The property will be developed in substantial compliance with the approved site plan dated
       February 20, 2014.

Planning Commission: Rezoning / CUP ­ 1220 and 1600 Graves Mill Road ­February 26, 2014                 6

        On August 13, 2002, Council approved the petition of Miller-Motte Technical College for a
        CUP for a technical college for up to 250 students in a B-5C, General Business District
        (Conditional), at 1011 Creekside Drive.
        On January 11, 2005, Council approved the petition of Millside Development LLC for a
        CUP to allow the construction of a Cluster Commercial Development (CCD) in a B-1,
        Limited Business District at the corner of Graves Mill Road and Lillian Lane.
        On September 13, 2011, Council approved the petition of the Lynchburg Humane Society
        to amend the FLUM from Resource Conservation and Medium Density Residential to
        Regional Commercial and to rezone the property from R-2 Low-Medium Density Single
        Family Residential District to B-5C, General Business District (Conditional) to allow the
        construction of a new animal shelter and associated parking at 1211 Old Graves Mill Road.
6. Site Description. The subject property is two (2) tracts of land totaling approximately seventy
   and eighty-six thousandths (70.086) acres located at 1600 and 1220 Graves Mill Road. Forty-
   three and two tenths (43.2) acres are proposed to be rezoned and for Conditional Use Permit
   (CUP) for the Cluster Commercial Development (CCD).
   The property is bounded to the north by low density residential and currently underdeveloped
   land, zoned R-1, Low Density Residential, and B-5C, General Business District (Conditional), to
   the west by the Millside Development Center, to the east by Tomahawk Creek and vacant
   property owned by First Assembly of God Church, and to the south by Graves Mill Road.
   Across Graves Mill, property is largely undeveloped and zoned R-C, Resource Conservation
   District. The site had significant topographic challenges associated with it, rising over 100 feet
   from the east side of the property where Tomahawk Creek lies to the western ridge designated
   for future development. As you enter the site from Graves Mill Road, the site rises up and
   follows the contours of the hillside, parallel to Tomahawk Creek.
7. Proposed Use of Property. The purpose of these petitions is to rezone the property from R-1,
   Low Density Residential District and B-5C, General Business District (Conditional) to B-3C,
   Community Business District, and for a CUP to allow the construction of a CCD. The CCD
   would allow the construction of 165,000 square feet of commercial space, 35 apartments, and a
   system of trails, parks and open space on the 1600 Graves Mill Road Tract. It would also allow
   the use of the historic buildings and property at 1220 Graves Mill Road as art studios, shops, and
   an outdoor reception venue (if Council finds the outdoor reception and event use compatible
   with B-3 uses).
8. Traffic, Parking and Public Transit.
   Expressway. A traffic study was required detailing the internal and external trips, internal and
   external traffic circulation, necessary travel lane requirements, and impacts on Graves Mill Road.
   As the property is adjacent to a major city corridor, Graves Mill Road, and approximately a half
   mile from the Lynchburg Expressway, impacts to these facilities should be closely considered.
   The provided traffic study indicates there are existing operational issues at the Expressway
   interchange and that improvements will be needed to accommodate natural growth of the city
   occurring outside of this proposed development. However, the Rosedale CCD will exacerbate
   and accelerate issues already projected. All ramp movements currently function at a level of
   service (LOS) C or better (except for the southbound off ramp right turn which functions at a
   LOS D). The northbound off ramp will fall to a LOS F in both the AM and PM peak hours, and
   the southbound off ramp will fall to a LOS E in the PM peak hour. The developer does not
   intend to address these issues as they will happen naturally over time. The traffic study was also
Planning Commission: Rezoning / CUP ­ 1220 and 1600 Graves Mill Road ­February 26, 2014                     7

   done for a more intense version of the development, and it is believed that the immediate
   impacts on the ramps will be reduced due to a reduction of trips created by the revised site plan.
   Graves Mill Road. The traffic study also indicates the need for dedicated turn lanes for the
   Rosedale development on Graves Mill Road. At the build out of the site, two left turn lanes and
   a right turn lane will be required on Graves Mill Road, which will require widening the road. As
   this development will be phased, lanes can be added as needed with phases. The developer has
   agreed to provide the turn lanes as phasing indicates their need.
   Internal Traffic. The site plan has gone through numerous iterations, and the proposed internal
   layout satisfies technical traffic concerns, and illustrates an extra effort to provide pedestrian and
   cycle infrastructure. Further street connectivity could potentially decrease the demand for such a
   large intersection at Graves Mill Road, reduce pressure on immediately adjacent intersections,
   and set the stage for creating a more complete street grid, improving large scale traffic issues
   over a long term. While pedestrian and cycle facilities are provided on site, the development
   layout could promote walkability further by clustering uses into one area of the site to create a
   compact walkable core.
   Parking. One tenet of Cluster Commercial Zoning (CCD) is that uses within a development
   should share parking facilities with the intent of reducing the number of total parking spaces
   needed. The Planning Division believes this could be met better by a further clustering of
   buildings and parking. Parking is separated by use on the provided site plan and the excess
   parking spaces do not represent an efficient use of Lynchburg's limited land resources. It is
   preferred that parking be accommodated by on-street facilities, as well as in lots placed behind
   buildings, disguised from the street.

   Public Transit. Greater Lynchburg Transit Company Route 7 runs along Graves Mill Road in
   front of this property. The site plan provides for a bus pull off within the development, though
   discussions with GLTC will be needed to coordinate potential routing into the development.
9. Stormwater Management. A stormwater management plan addressing both quantity and
   quality of stormwater related to the entire development of the property will be required at time
   of individual site plan submittal. The stormwater management pond currently shown within the
   floodplain will need to be adjusted during the site plan review process.
10. Emergency Services. The City's Fire Marshal and Police Department had no comments of
    concern.
11. Impact. The submitted rezoning petition would allow the construction of 165,000 square feet
    of commercial space, 35 apartments, and a system of trails, parks and open space on the 1600
    Graves Mill Road tract and allow the use of the historic buildings and property at 1220 Graves
    Mill Road as art studios, shops, and an outdoor reception venue (if Council finds the reception
    use compatible with B-3 uses).
   The proposed land uses agree with the Comprehensive Plan, which recommends a mix of uses
   for the site. The site plan both uses design concepts outlined in the Comprehensive Plan and
   sets the stage for future development to follow those same desired features. The provision for
   multimodal facilities, park / recreation space, and street connectivity is highly valued by the
   Planning Division and a desired use for the subject property.
   Impacts to the ramps of the Lynchburg Expressway are a critical concern. The ramps will need
   significant improvements in the long term, and should the proposed development be approved,
   the ramps will demand costly infrastructure investments sooner. As this development just
Planning Commission: Rezoning / CUP ­ 1220 and 1600 Graves Mill Road ­February 26, 2014                   8

   happens to be the tipping point and the site plan and land uses are desired by the
   Comprehensive Plan, the Planning Division recommends approving the rezoning and CUP
   petition.
12. Design Review Board. CCDs require review by the Design Review Board (DRB) upon a
    complete submittal of the sketch plan, however the Design Review Board's Review shall be
    restricted to the following elements by Section 35.1-42.5 (3) of the Zoning Ordinance:
   a. Aesthetic and architectural relationships with the surrounding communities;
   b. Conclusions regarding on-site amenities and improvements;
   c. On-site arrangement of improvements and structures;
   d. Consistency with the Housing Assistance Plan for Federal and/or State funded projects. (The
   project is not State or Federally Funded)
   The DRB reviewed the sketch plan on December 3, 2013. The more recently proposed site
   plans have a reduced footprint from the plans that went through DRB's review, with most of the
   residential portions of the site being removed from the rezoning. Future development of the
   portions to remain R-1, Low Density Residential will be determined at a later date. Comments
   from the DRB centered on the proposed architectural style, phasing concerns, traffic, and
   parking.
   Architecture. It was noted specifically that the architecture of the proposed buildings have severe
   contrasts. The two glass office buildings seem to be of a modern style while other buildings on
   site have rustic or neoclassical architecture derived from the historic farm and mill structures. It
   was noted by board members that the sketches do not necessarily match what is proposed.
   Phasing. Phasing was a concern due to the size of the development. With a development this
   large and the community amenities being part of the agreement of the rezoning, there was fear
   that part of the development would be built but the amenities would fall by the wayside if the
   development never reached full completion. The conditions of the CUP should address phasing
   and when the amenities will be installed.
   Parking. The board also noted that the plan appears to have excess surface parking and that it
   was a large quantity of asphalt concentrated in single locations. The board recommended on-
   street parking as a way to mitigate the need for that amount of parking. The developer noted
   that the parking would likely need to be a combination of asphalt and permeable pavers.
   Traffic. Though not an explicit subject for DRB comment, board members expressed concern
   over the single entrance to the development and what kind of traffic that might cause within the
   development during peak traffic times and on the adjacent Graves Mill Road. The DRB
   commented on how a connection to Breezewood Drive and other adjacent stubbed right-of-way
   through the back of the development would improve traffic flow.
13. Technical Review Committee. The Technical Review Committee (TRC) reviewed the
    preliminary rezoning plan on October 22, 2013. The plans have gone through numerous
    iterations since TRC review, but all technical comments related to the proposed development
    have been or will be addressed prior to final approval.

VI.   PLANNING DIVISION RECOMMENDATION(s)
      Based on the preceding Findings of Fact, the Planning Commission
      recommends to City Council approval of the petition of Rosedale Farm
      LLC and Bella Rose Plantation LLC to:
      1. Waive the twenty-one (21)-day submittal requirement for proffers.
      2. Rezone approximately forty-three and two tenths (43.2) acres at 1220
         and 1600 Graves Mill Road from R-1, Low Density Residential
         District, and B-5C, General Business District (Conditional), to B-3C,
         Community Business District (Conditional), subject to the following
         voluntarily submitted proffers:
              a. The property will be developed as a Cluster Commercial
                 Development (CCD). With regards to setbacks, the front setback
                 from Graves Mill Road will be 30'. All other setbacks for front,

       Bella Rose Plantation will consist of several different concepts... nested on 6 acres,
the estate formally known as the ROSEDALE MANSION will play a very intricate part to be
the anchor of this plantation, as it will be used as a 19th century backdrop for weddings and
events . The name "Bella Rose Plantation" is derived from Bella meaning `beautiful" and
Rose for the Rosedale Estate. The property truly lends itself to an overall grand Master
plan.

        It will serve as a designer decor exhibit for furnishings and furniture as well as wall
art techniques which will be open to the public Monday thru Friday. On the weekends it
will serve as a Bridal Haven for brides to use to make their wedding dreams come true.
The top floor of the house will be renovated to have an elaborate expansive wedding suite
for brides to use to get ready on their special day, and can be used for wedding portraits
taken throughout the week. Caretakers will live on site to manage the plantation.

        We will use vintage style themed lighting throughout the estate and the
grounds....Circa 18th century design elements will be used to preserve and create a
Williamsburg type feel for the property. An EXPERIENCE of the bygone era will attempt to
be created on the property while bringing the elements of grandeur to the property with
manicured landscaping to include the MILL being operational with the wheel turning by an
electric motor. The main house can serve as the anchor for a wedding venue either in the
front yard or in the backyard for events that need to serve larger groups. The back of the
house will be cleared and re-landscaped to create a large area for larger groups and large
tents can be used to cater special events.

        There will be water flowing in the ponds that will be flowing over the waterwheel
and through tiered garden areas for the brides to be married with an active mill as their
backdrop. THE MILL will be used as a fully operational event venue for wedding receptions
and several other special occasion rentals. The bottom of the mill will still be used a wood
working shop for the furniture that is being sold inside the mansion to be restored and
refinished on site. The carriage house will be kept and used as signage again to create the
Williamsburg type feel for the plantation and provide great visibility for the venue.

        The Christopher Johnson Cottage will be used possibly as a coffee/bakery shop and
also an art studio for the caretaker who is an artist to display her work in this beautiful
historic cottage. Walkways of pea gravel will be created throughout the grounds to again
tie into the 19th century era. We will plan to have an artist exhibit on the estate grounds
once a year to reach out to the artist in the area which should be a great response from the
artist community. The venue will also hopefully host numerous civic and cultural events
throughout the year for the community.

Traffic Impact Analysis

Rosedale Farms, Lynchburg, Virginia



1. Introduction

This technical memorandum summarizes the traffic analyses conducted to evaluate
potential traffic impacts of a proposed Rosedale Farms development in Lynchburg, VA.
The development is generally located north of Graves Mill Road and west of the
Expressway.
This memo includes analyses of existing conditions, future no build conditions, and
future build conditions for the horizon (full build) year 2024.


2. Description of site, site plan, and the study intersections

The proposed development is located just west of the existing Home Depot side off of
Graves Mill Road in Lynchburg, VA. The proposed site includes three entrance locations
on Graves Mill Road ­ one right in only, one right out only and one full entrance. Figure
1 provides the illustration of the site location and its vicinity. The development concept
plan is provided on the aerial map in Figure 2.

In the development concept prepared to date, the site is planned to be constructed in
three phases with an ultimate build-out year of 2024. Note that this study evaluates one
total future build year (Build Year 2024). The proposed development land use is
identified in Table 1.

3. Existing conditions

AM and PM peak hour (7-9AM and 4-6PM) traffic counts were conducted for the four
existing intersections on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday between October 9, 2013
and October 16, 2013.

See Figure 4 for the illustration of the existing traffic volumes at the study intersections.
The original traffic count reports are provided in Appendix A.


Traffic Analysis
Synchro and SimTraffic models (ver 7) were utilized to evaluate existing traffic
operations at the study intersections. For existing conditions, we used optimized timings
since we are aware that the field timings will be updated soon. We do however provide
a comparison between the optimized and the actual existing timings, within the
discussion. The delay, level of service (LOS) and queuing (from both Synchro and
SimTraffic) are summarized in a series of tables in Appendix B. The Synchro and
SimTraffic reports are provided in Appendix C.


Graves Mill Road and Expressway Ramps
The analyses indicate that the two ramp junction intersections, from an intersection
capacity standpoint, can currently operate at acceptable levels of service with all
movements operating at LOS C or better, with the one exception of the southbound exit
ramp right turn movement which operates at LOS D during the PM peak hour. Note that
if using existing signal timings then we see LOS F for the northbound off-ramp in both
the AM and PM peak hours, and LOS E at the southbound off ramp right turn in the PM
peak hour. While this (southbound) right turn movement is fairly high at 295 vph, the
westbound through movement is very high with 1,052 vph thus limiting opportunities for
right turns on red. However, the SimTraffic model indicates queuing along the heavy
volume approaches, particularly the northbound off ramp, southbound off ramp,
eastbound right turn to the on ramp and westbound through movement between the
ramps. Field observations indicate that the queuing has negative impacts on the corridor.
Note that under existing timings the northbound queues are shown to be excessively
long in the AM and PM peak hours. The northbound left turn queue is 440 feet in the AM
and 450 feet in the PM peak hours. The northbound right is 874 feet in the AM and 942

feet in the PM peak hour. The tables in Appendix C show the optimized queues which
are less than these existing condition lengths by approximately 200 feet.

Graves Mill Road and Creekside Drive (Home Depot)
During the AM peak hour, the analyses indicate that all movements currently operate at
LOS D or better. The SimTraffic model indicates considerable queuing (547 feet ­
existing timings result in 200 feet longer queue) in the eastbound direction as motorists
are destined for the Expressway. A right lane bias (motorists utilizing the right through
lane in anticipation of the right turn downstream onto the Expressway southbound on
ramp) increases the queuing at this intersection.
During the PM peak hour, the analyses indicate that all movements currently operate at
LOS C or better. Again, the SimTraffic model indicates very heavy queuing (751 feet) in
the eastbound direction.

Graves Mill Road and Old Graves Mill Road
During both peak hours, the analyses indicate that all movements operate at LOS D or
better. The SimTraffic model indicates the AM and PM peak hour queuing along the
eastbound approaches as 177 feet and 415 feet respectively as the lane bias
approaching the Expressway starts to affect driver behavior. Note that under existing
(actual existing signal timings) the model indicates the eastbound left to operate at LOS
E in the PM peak hour. Also the eastbound approach is 353 feet in the AM and 894 feet
in the PM.


4. No build conditions

Historical traffic volume data from the Virginia Department of Transportation was
evaluated to determine a reasonable background traffic growth rate for the study
intersections. This evaluation resulted in the following background growth rates:


   o   Graves Mill Road west of Old Graves Mill Road ­ 1%
   o   Graves Mill Road east of and inclusive of Old Graves Mill Road ­ 1.5%
   o   All turns to / from Graves Mill Road (except Expressway Ramp movements) ­ 0.5%
   o   All turns to / from Expressway Ramps ­ 2%


These background growth rates were utilized to increase the background traffic volumes
to the horizon year 2024.

See Figure 5 for the illustration of the no build traffic volumes at the study intersections
in 2024.

SimTraffic) are summarized in a series of tables in Appendix B. The Synchro and
SimTraffic reports are provided in Appendix D.


Graves Mill Road and Expressway Ramps ­ Northbound Ramps on East Side of
Interchange
During the AM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS C or
better based on the Synchro analysis, which only considers the individual intersection.
However, the SimTraffic model projects an increase in queuing, particularly on the
northbound off ramp and for the eastbound through movement.
During the PM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS C or
better with the exception of the left turn movement from the off ramp that is expected to
operate at LOS D. The SimTraffic model projects significant increases in queue lengths,
especially for the northbound off ramp (over 900 feet which is near the Expressway
mainline) and the westbound through movement (also over 900 feet which queues
beyond the next intersection to the east).
Graves Mill Road and Expressway Ramps ­ Southbound Ramps on West Side of
Interchange
During the AM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS C or
better with the exception of three movements that are projected to operate at LOS E ­
the eastbound right turn movement, the southbound shared left / through movement,
and the southbound right turn movement. The SimTraffic model projects an increase in
queuing, particularly for the eastbound movement (through movement over 600 feet and
right turn movement over 400 feet) and the westbound through movement between the
ramp intersections (595 feet).

During the PM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS D or
better with the exception of two movements. The eastbound right turn movement is
projected to operate at LOS E and the southbound right turn movement from the off
ramp is projected to operate at LOS F. Again, the SimTraffic model projects an increase
in queuing, especially for the westbound through movement. This queue is projected to
be 749 feet which results in a queue back to the adjacent ramp intersection.

Graves Mill Road and Creekside Drive (Home Depot)
During the AM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS D or
better with the exception of two side street movements. The southbound left movement
and the southbound shared through / right movement are both projected to operate at
LOS E. These movements are low volume with a total of only 41 vehicles for both lanes
for the entire hour and a resulting queue of 70 feet. The SimTraffic model projects an
increase in the eastbound queue to total 766 feet which results in a queue back to the
Old Graves Mill intersection.

During the PM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS D or
better with the exception of three side street movements. The southbound left
movement, the southbound shared through / right movement and the northbound shared
left / through movement are all projected to operate at LOS E. The southbound
movements are low volume with a total of only 153 vehicles for both lanes for the entire
hour and a resulting queue of 159 feet. The northbound movement is also low volume

                                 637 B ERKMAR C IRCLE , C HARLOTTESVILLE , VA 22901
with a total of only 82 vehicles for the entire hour. Again, the SimTraffic model projects
considerable queuing in the eastbound direction (665 feet, slightly lower than during the
AM peak hour, but still significant).

Graves Mill Road and Old Graves Mill Road
During the AM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS D or
better with the exception of two side street movements. The northbound shared left /
through movement and the right turn movement are expected to operate at LOS E.
These movements are relatively low volume (shared left / through volume is 125 vph
combined and the right turn volume is 60 vph) and the projected queues are modest
(209 feet and 88 feet respectively). The SimTraffic model projects an increase in
eastbound queuing (530 foot total queue) as the heavy movement towards the
Expressway plus the right lane bias causes traffic to slow down and queue through the
Creekside Drive signal and through the Old Graves Mill Road signal.

During the PM peak hour, it is projected that all movements will operate at LOS D or
better with the exception of two movements. The eastbound left turn movement and the
northbound shared left / through movement are projected to operate at LOS E. The
eastbound left turn movement is very low volume (only 1 vehicle in the PM peak hour) so
with a short green time, the average delay (spread over just one vehicle) is high. The
northbound movement is also relatively low volume (147 vph) and the resulting queue is
only 213 feet.

Queuing Discussion
While most of the individual movements seem to operate at reasonable levels of service
from an individual intersection capacity perspective, in the no build 2024 condition the
SimTraffic model indicates that the existing queuing issues related to the Expressway
interchange will be exacerbated by the background growth in the corridor. The result is
significant queuing on the off ramps, on Graves Mill Road between the ramp signals, and
eastbound along Graves Mill Road approaching the Expressway (queuing and slow
traffic beyond Old Graves Mill Road).


5. Site trip generation

The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, was
utilized to project the new trips associated with the proposed development. In addition to
the projected trip generation, per VDOT's Traffic Impact Analysis Regulations
Administrative Guidelines, reductions are allowed for internal capture and pass-by. The
allowable internal capture rates for this development are 15% of residential trips, and the
pass-by rates are 25% of retail trips and 40% of convenience store and food service trips.

Table 2 provides a summary of the projected development trip generation.

6. Site trip distribution and assignment

The site trip distributions used in this study were generated based on the layout of the
development plan and evaluation of the existing traffic patterns in the Graves Mill Road
corridor.

Given the three entrances (eastern entrance right-in only, center entrance full access,
and western entrance right-out only) trips were assigned to entrances based on the site
plan. The proposed restaurant uses are near the eastern entrance and the proposed
gas station use is near the western entrance so those respective trips are more heavily
biased towards those entrances (80 percent of the appropriate trip by direction). All
other trips are assigned to the full entrance with a distribution similar to the current
distribution in the vicinity.

See Figures 6-1 through 6-3 for an illustration of the assumed trip distribution
percentages and Figure 7 for an illustration of the projected site related volumes.


7. Build conditions

The trips generated from the development, calculated and assigned to the study
intersections as documented in the previous sections, were added to the background no
build 2024 traffic volumes.

See Figure 8 for the illustration of the build traffic volumes in 2024.

Traffic Analysis
The Synchro and SimTraffic models were updated to reflect the build 2024 traffic
volumes. The delay, level of service (LOS) and queuing (from both Synchro and
SimTraffic) are summarized in a series of tables in Appendix B. The Synchro and
SimTraffic reports are provided in Appendix E.

Except for the site entrance, the build scenario is very similar to the no build scenario.
Examination of Figure 7 indicates that the traffic volumes for the no build and build
scenarios are similar near the Graves Mill Road interchange. As would be expected, the
projected operations issues are the same as in the no build scenario, related to
excessive interchange operations queuing.


Graves Mill Road and Expressway Ramps ­ Northbound Ramps on East Side of
Interchange
For both peak periods, the individual intersection capacity results are projected to be
basically the same as the no build scenario with all individual movements operating at
LOS D or better. However, also similar to the no build scenario, the SimTraffic model
projects significant queuing at this ramp junction, with the same impacts to the
northbound off ramp and the westbound through movement.

Graves Mill Road and Expressway Ramps ­ Southbound Ramps on West Side of
Interchange
For both peak periods, the individual intersection capacity results are projected to be
basically the same as the no build scenario with the same failing movements. Also
similar to the no build scenario, the SimTraffic model projects significant queuing for the
same movements ­ eastbound right turn onto the Expressway on ramp and westbound
through between the ramp intersections. The projected queues are basically the same
as in the no build condition.

Graves Mill Road and Creekside Drive (Home Depot)
For both peak periods, the individual intersection capacity results are projected to be
basically the same as the no build scenario with the same failing movements with one
exception ­ the westbound left turn movement is also projected to operate at LOS E
(was LOS D in the no build scenario). Again, the SimTraffic model projects significant
queuing in the eastbound direction (only slightly different than the no build scenario with
one additional vehicle in the AM peak hour and four additional vehicles in the PM peak
hour).

Graves Mill Road and Old Graves Mill Road
For both peak periods, the individual intersection capacity results are projected to be
basically the same as the no build scenario. The SimTraffic model does project
significant queuing in the eastbound direction, including an increase over the no build
condition (approximately 800 additional feet). As with the no build scenario, the
additional queuing is related to the heavy movement towards the Expressway plus the
right lane bias causing traffic to slow down and queue through the Creekside Drive
signal and through the Old Graves Mill Road signal.

Graves Mill Road and Full Site Entrance
Note that the build scenario included signalizing this entrance as the high traffic volumes
obviously require signalization. A peak hour signal warrant is provided later in this
section. For the build condition, all turn movements were assumed to have a single
exclusive turn lane.

During the AM peak hour all movements are expected to operate at LOS C or better.
During the PM peak hour, two of the individual movements are expected to operate at
LOS E ­ the eastbound left turn movement (into the site) and the southbound left turn
movement (exiting the site).

Graves Mill Road and Right-in Only Entrance
Exclusive right turn lane was not warranted through VDOT Turn Lane Warrant for the
Right-in Only Entrance. The turn lane warrant sheets were provided in Appendix F.


Queuing Discussion
The SimTraffic model indicates that the queuing issues related to the Expressway
interchange will have significant impacts to the Graves Mill Road corridor. Similar to the
no build scenario, the result is significant queuing on the off ramps, on Graves Mill Road
between the ramp signals, and eastbound along Graves Mill Road approaching the
Expressway (queuing and slow traffic beyond Old Graves Mill Road).


Site Entrance MUTCD Peak Hour Signal Warrant
The site entrance was evaluated per the MUTCD peak hour signal warrant. The graph is
provided in Appendix G. Both the AM and PM peak hour volumes substantially meet
the MUTCD peak hour warrant. Note that the southbound right turn volume (exiting the
site) was not included in the volume. It is typical practice to not include right turn volume
in this analysis if it can be assumed that the right turn traffic would be able to turn right
on red.


8. Mitigation

This section identifies mitigation measures to alleviate the traffic operations identified in
the various analyses. The issues can be categorized into two main categories ­ the
Expressway interchange (which includes the queuing throughout the corridor) and the
site entrance.


Traffic Analysis
The delay, level of service (LOS) and queuing (from both Synchro and SimTraffic) are
summarized in a series of tables in Appendix B. The Synchro and SimTraffic reports
are provided in Appendix H.

Expressway Interchange and Related Corridor Queuing Issues
Even in the existing conditions, there are several operational issues at the Expressway
interchange that result in queuing throughout the Graves Mill Road corridor. These
issues are exacerbated in the no build 2024 scenario, and further reflected in the build
scenario. The following improvements can help mitigate the negative impacts
documented in the analyses.

Note that overall, it appears that the conventional diamond style interchange, which is
adjacent to congested signalized intersections, may need to be substantially modified in
the future to keep pace, in terms of providing sufficient traffic capacity, with traffic growth
in the area. Specific improvement opportunities identified in this study, for the
interchange, include the following:

1. Eastbound to Southbound Expressway Ramp
The very high right turn volumes onto the southbound ramp will necessitate a free flow
turn, thus requiring ramp widening and possible extension. We still see extensive
queuing in the model, and in fact a dual free flow right turn onto the ramp begins to
relieve the queuing. However, feasibility of a dual right turn lane ramp is questionable.
This should be more closely examined in a future study of the entire interchange.

2. Northbound Off Ramp
The northbound ramp should be widened to provide for an additional approach lane to
the intersection consisting of an exclusive right turn lane, which will then provide an
opportunity to implement dual left turns.

3. Southbound Off ramp
The queuing and delay issues could be improved by widening the ramp to allow for a
free flow right turn lane onto Graves Mill Road, which then has implications for a
downstream receiving lane.

4. Westbound Queuing Between the Ramp Intersections
The two ramp signals should be signalized, with improved adaptive traffic coordination
equipment in the future. Modifications to phasing should allow for continuous movements
from the heavy ramp movements through the downstream signals.

5. Continued Signal Retiming and Optimization
Into the future, the signal timings should be revisited periodically, and as noted above,
traffic adaptive signal coordination should be considered to help maximize travel
capacity.

6. Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
Given the high concentration of employment centers near the corridor, it is possible that
a specific TDM program could make a significant improvement to peak hour operations
in the corridor. Examples include small shifts in arrival and exit times (to spread out the
peak hour) and ride sharing.

Note that a more detailed interchange study would be helpful to identify a full range of
improvements that might be needed in the future as a more regional improvement.


Site Entrance

1. Signalization
The analyses assumed that the entrance would be signalized. See Appendix G for the
peak hour warrant for the full build condition, and also the peak hour warrant for the
threshold of when a signal would meet the peak hour requirements. Given the very large
volumes on Graves Mill Road, the peak hour warrant is met with just 100 egress left turn
lanes out of the site. This equates to a total of approximately 23% of the build program
as shown in the trip generation Table 2 (i.e. 100 egress lefts / 423 peak PM egress lefts
per Figure 7 box 6 = 23%). This would equate to a grocery store, or some combination
of the rest of the development that would result in approximately 160-170 total trip in the
PM peak hour. Given the uncertainty of when the various elements, as shown in the
concept plan, would be constructed, development will need to be monitored and a
commitment made to perform a warrant analysis once construction begins on the
sections of the development.

Due to the long lead time required for obtaining poles and signal control equipment, the
traffic signal should be designed as part of the site plan process, and the infrastructure
should be put in place with the entrance intersection improvements. The signal could
then be activated once the traffic volumes to the newly opened uses materialize.

2. Dual Left Turn Lanes (Ingress and Egress)
Analyses indicate that dual left turn lanes are needed for ingress (eastbound left turn)
and egress (southbound left turn). However, due to environmental constraints,
construction of the dual left turn lane for ingress is not feasible. Since this is a "T"
intersection, the ingress left turn lane could be configured as a single left turn with 350
feet of storage, and the intersection will operate at a satisfactory level of service, with the
left turn operating right at LOS E. If the ingress left turn volume were reduced by just
5%, then the movement would achieve LOS D. Given that internal capture rates are
arguably conservatively low using the VDOT standard rates, and considering the gross
nature of site trip distribution assumptions, it is likely that the volumes shown for the left
turn ingress movements are higher than what might actually occur. Given the
constraints and the nature of the volume assumptions, engineering judgment suggests
that the long single left turn lane into the site would suffice with all vehicles clearing the
queue each cycle. Notice also that the single left turn lane provides an opportunity to
utilize permitted/protected phasing, versus the protected only phasing that is required for
dual lefts. The permitted/protected phasing will serve traffic more efficiently in the off-
peak periods of the day. This mitigation results in satisfactory operations with nearly all
movements operating at LOS C or better.

3. For the right-in entrance, exclusive right turn lane was not warranted.

9. Summary of conclusions and recommendations

The analyses conducted for this effort lead to the following principal conclusions:

   1. The study area is already experiencing congestion in peak hours.

   2. In existing conditions, the eastbound volumes desiring to go southbound at the
      interchange cause a bias towards heavy traffic in the right lane. This lane bias
      results in congestion and queuing in the peak hours.

   3. In the no-build condition we expect to see the need for substantial improvements
      at the interchange, in order to manage congestion and mitigate potential gridlock,
      or queues extending back to the deceleration portion of the off-ramps.

   4. For the build condition, the no-build conditions are exacerbated, though
      mitigation strategies and improvements that are needed for the no-build condition
      would also relieve the build conditions.


   5. The site entrance should be signalized at such time that occupancy of the site
      generates enough traffic to require activating the signal. The developer should
      be responsible for conducting a full signal warrant study once the site has been
      increasing in occupancy and at the request of the City.

   6. The site entrance will require a long single left for ingress and dual lefts for
      egress. The entrance road will need to be designed to consider these laneage
      needs, and the resulting queuing within the site. Thus, the functional distance for
      the southbound approach to Graves Mill Road is projected to be 250' (i.e.
      distance occupied by queuing).
   7. The signal design for the site entrance needs to include the required traffic
      coordination equipment per direction from the City.

   8. Exclusive right turn lane is not needed at the development's right-in only entrance.

Recommendations for this Development (i.e. developer driven improvements):

   1. Site Entrance ­ construct with a long single left turn for ingress and dual left turns
      egress. In the short term, hatch out the 2nd left turn lane on the egress approach.
      Provide a signal warrant analysis when directed by the City.

   2. Construct the intersection to be ready for signalization once warranted (i.e. install
      conduits, foundations, etc.. with initial intersection construction).

   3. Provide an exclusive right turn lane into the site along Graves Mill Road.

   4. Look for opportunities to expand the road network for connections to the north
      and east. This will help to disperse traffic away from Graves Mill Road.

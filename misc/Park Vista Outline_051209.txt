Subject:                          Park Vista Square Development, Preliminary Traffic Analysis

Introduction

This report documents a preliminary traffic study performed to review the
impacts of the removal of the left-turn restriction along Park Street at Buena
Vista Avenue in Alameda, CA upon completion of the proposed Park Vista
Square development at the southeast corner of Park Street and Buena Vista
Avenue. The City of Alameda currently restricts left-turn movements from Park
Street to Buena Vista Avenue Monday through Friday between 3:30 PM and 6:00
PM.

Purpose and Objectives

Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc., has been retained by Mr. Ken Phares (on
behalf of Mr. Bill Phua), to perform the traffic analysis to review the impact of
removing the left-turn restriction on Park Street at Buena Vista Avenue upon
completion of the Park Vista Square development.

The purpose of this study is to document PM intersection operations during the
left-turn restriction period (3:30 PM ­ 6:00 PM) on a typical weekday. The
specific objectives of this study are:

              To conduct existing PM peak hour traffic counts and document existing
              traffic operations during that time;
              To determine the level of service (LOS) at which the study area
              intersection currently operates during the PM peak period;
              To calculate the LOS at which the study area intersection may operate
              during the PM peak period upon completion of the Park Vista Square
              development and removal of the left-turn restriction on Park Street at
              Buena Vista Avenue; and

              To evaluate the overall impact to intersection LOS assuming the
              development is built and the left-turn restriction is removed.

Study Area (bullet form for outline)

       Discuss existing land use of current study area parcel(s) and adjacent parcels.
       Discuss proposed land use for study area parcel(s).

Existing Conditions (bullet form for outline)

       Discuss apparent PM peak period intersection operations.
       Discuss recorded PM peak period traffic volumes and apparent traffic
       patterns.

Analysis (bullet form for outline)

       Discuss trip generation process and results.
       Discuss key assumptions:
               Trip distribution

               Roadway geometry
       Discuss Synchro/LOS analysis.
               Existing PM peak period conditions (with EB Park St left-turn

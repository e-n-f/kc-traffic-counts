                         TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

I.   INTRODUCTION

This report summarizes traffic impacts related to the Washington Elementary Remodel
project. The general goals of this impact study concentrate on 1) the assessment of
existing roadway conditions and intersection congestion, 2) forecasts of newly generated
project traffic, 3) estimations of future delay, and 4) recommendations for mitigation.
Preliminary tasks include the detailed collection of roadway information, road
improvement information, and peak hour traffic counts. A level of service analysis for
existing traffic conditions is then made to determine the present degree of intersection
congestion. Based on this analysis, forecasts of future traffic levels on the surrounding
street system are found. Following this forecast, the future service levels for the key
intersections are investigated. As a final step, applicable conclusions and possible on-site
or off-site mitigation measures are defined. The findings of this study are intended to
ensure safe and efficient progression of vehicular/non-motorist traffic near the site.


II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed project is to remodel the existing Washington Elementary School. The
remodel will improve the aging facility and better facilitate on-street student drop-
off/pick-up. The site is located in the Proctor Business District in North Tacoma and is
bordered by N 26th Street, N Adams Street, N Washington Street and N 27th Street.
N 26th Street will be used primarily for student drop-off and pick-up. The frontages of N
27th Street, N Adams Street and N Washington Street will provide parking spaces for
faculty. The area is primarily residential and commercial with the elementary serving
the immediate surrounding area. A copy of the district's school boundaries has been
included in the appendix. Figure 1 on the following page shows the general site location
along with the local street network. The site plan is given in Figure 2.


III. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Surrounding Roadway System

Roadways serving the proposed site consist of multi-lane arterials and two-lane collector
roads which vary in width, terrain, and posted speeds. As indicated by their specific
arterial designations, these roadways also vary in their overall function as part of the
general network. The key streets near the site are described below.

N 26th Street is an east-west, multi-lane roadway that borders the south side of the school
with a speed limit of 25 mph. Paving is asphalt concrete and lane widths are around 12
feet. Shoulders are curb, gutter, and sidewalk. A center two-way left turn lane is
available along a majority of the road's length. Grades are level near the site. On street
parking is available.


                                             3
N 27th Street is an east-west, two-lane road that borders the north side of the site. Lane
widths are around 11 feet with on-street parking available along the road. Paving is
asphalt and shoulders are curb, gutter, and sidewalks. Grades are level near the site.
There is Post Office parking provided on this roadway near the Adams Street
intersection.

N Adams Street is a north-south, two-lane roadway bordering the west side of the school.
Grades along this road range up to 5 percent. Paving is asphalt and lane widths are
around 11 feet. Shoulders are curb, gutter, and sidewalk. Parking is available along the
road. A gravel on-site parking lot is accessed from Adams Street. The existing gravel
parking lot accommodates approximately 20 stalls.

N Washington Street is a north-south, two-lane road that borders the east side of the
elementary. On-street parking is provided. Lanes are 11 feet wide. Paving is asphalt
concrete and shoulders are curb, gutter, and sidewalks. The roadway grade ranges from
0 to 5 percent.

B. Existing Peak Hour Volumes and Patterns

Field data for this study was collected in June of 2012 while school was still in session.
School hours for Washington Elementary are from 9AM to 3:30PM Traffic counts were
taken for the school's AM peak hour from 8:30 to 9:30 and again for the PM peak hour
of 3 PM to 4 PM. These specific peak periods were targeted for analysis purposes since
they generally represent the worst case scenario with respect to traffic conditions for
schools. The highest volumes of traffic associated with the school in the AM happen
within the hour that parents drop their kids off at school and again when they return to
pick them up in the PM peak hour. Existing peak hour volumes for the key intersections
studied for N 26th Street & N Adams Street and N 26th Street & N Washington Street are
shown in Figure 3. Given are both the AM and PM peak hours. Peak hour counts can be
found in the appendix.

C. Roadway Improvements

A review of a current City of Tacoma 6-Year Comprehensive Transportation Program
indicates that no projects are currently planned in the immediate vicinity of the site.

D. Existing Level of Service

Existing peak hour delays were determined through the use of the Highway Capacity
Manual. Capacity analysis is used to determine level of service (LOS) which is an
established measure of congestion for transportation facilities. LOS is defined for a
variety of facilities including intersections, freeways, arterials, etc. A complete definition
of level of service and related criteria can be found in the HCM.

The methodology for determining the LOS at signalized intersections strives to determine
the volume to capacity ( /c) ratios for the various intersection movements as well as the
average control delay for those movements. Delay is generally used to measure the


                                              6
degree of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost time. Control delay,
in particular, includes movements at slower speeds and stops on intersection approaches
as vehicles move up in queue position or slow down upstream of an intersection. Aside
from the overall quantity of traffic, three specific factors influence signalized intersection
LOS. These include the type of signal operation provided, the signal phasing pattern, and
the specific allocation of green time.

The methodology for determining the LOS at unsignalized intersections strives to
determine the potential capacities for the various vehicle movements and ultimately
determines the average total delay for each movement. Potential Capacity represents the
number of additional vehicles that could effectively utilize a particular movement, which
is essentially the equivalent of the difference between the movement capacity and the
existing movement volume. Total delay is described as the elapsed time from when a
vehicle stops at the end of a queue until the vehicle departs from the stop line. Average
total delay is simply the mean total delay over the entire stream. A number of factors
influence potential capacity and total delay including the availability/usefulness of gaps.

The range for intersection level of service is LOS A to LOS F with the former indicating
the best operating conditions with low control delays and the latter indicating the worst
conditions with heavy control delays. Existing LOS for the AM and PM peak hours are
shown in Table 1. This analysis involved the HCS-2000 intersection analysis program.

As shown in Table 1, existing delays are mild in the LOS A to LOS B range for future
conditions during the AM and PM peak hours of travel.


                                               8
E. Pedestrian and Bicycle Activity

Pedestrian and bicycle activity was observed on the nearby street segments studied for
this project. Observations were made during routine peak hour movement counts and
during other site visits. Moderate bicycle and pedestrian activity was noted during field
observations, especially upon arrival and dismissal times of the school, given the urban
nature of the area. The area has well developed pedestrian facilities generally in the form
of sidewalks and crosswalks to help alleviate any conflict between motorist and non-
motorist traffic. The school provides a crossing guard at the N 26th/N Washington
intersection. No safety issues currently exist due to lack of pedestrian facilities and none
are expected in the future.

F. Public Transit

A review of the Pierce Transit regional bus schedule shows public transit service is
provided in the area. Routes 11, 16, and 51 serve across the project frontage on 26th
Street. Some students may use public transportation but the majority will use school
buses provided by the district. Bus routes are well established and not expected to
change. Existing traffic counts capture bus traffic.


IV. FUTURE TRAFFIC DEMAND

A. School Traffic Generation & Flow

A school remodel will generally not generate any new trips. In a well developed urban
area, such as Tacoma, elementary school districts are well defined and serve a given
population of students. The school is in an all walk area though some school district
transportation and parent transportation occurs.

As the existing peak hour counts show, traffic in the area is mild, with most of the trips
associated with school related traffic. These trips are primarily parents who are used to
the area and familiar with the on-site flow around the school as they drop-off and pick-up
their children.

B. Future Traffic Volumes With and Without the Project

A horizon year of 2017 was chosen for the future study period to determine any impact
the school might have during peak hours of travel. The future 2017 traffic volumes
without the project were derived by applying a 2 percent annual growth rate through the
year 2017 to the existing traffic volumes shown in Figure 3. The 2 percent growth rate is
used for a more conservative LOS analysis even though this mature area of Tacoma
would most likely not experience any growth in traffic volumes on area streets. Future
peak hour volumes are shown in Figure 4 on the following page.




                                             9
C. Future Level of Service

Level of service analyses were made of the future AM and PM peak hour volumes at the
key roadways and intersections using the HCS-2000 analysis program. Delays for the
key intersections under future conditions are shown below in Table 2.

                                                    Southbound        B        10.7
       26th St/Washington St       Stop             Eastbound         A         8.2

The results of Table 2 indicate delays will remain mild in the LOS A to LOS B range
during the school's peak hour of travel. Overall, the roadways serving the school are
shown to have no capacity issues.

D. On-Street Parking

The project proposes to provide substantial improvements to the adjacent streets in order
to provide perpendicular parking. This method has been used in a number of other
locations throughout Tacoma in order to provide better utilization of the urban
streetscape. Public meetings have revealed that perpendicular on-street parking would be
an asset to Proctor businesses. The street volumes along the project frontages proposed
for perpendicular parking, Adams Street, Washington Street and North 27th Street are
very low with school peak hour volumes indicating approximately 200 trips or less with
most of the traffic associated with the school during the school peak hours.

As was mentioned previously the school traffic will be repetitive and familiar with local
operations so safety concerns will be minimized and the school is providing curbside
drop off areas along both North 26th and Adams Street. The benefit of the new on-street
parking will be an increase in the parking capacity for the entire area as it can be utilized


                                               11
by neighboring businesses and residents when school isn't in session. The activities
involving the Proctor area will be benefited by the additional parking with little conflict
between the school's needs and the neighborhood needs outside the school operating
hours.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND MITIGATION

The project will remodel the existing Washington Elementary School that is located in
the City of Tacoma. The remodel with improve the aging school and provide better
frontage improvements for student drop-off and pick-up. Existing delays at the studied
intersections are mild for both the AM and PM peak hours of travel. Future 2017 delays
will remain mild in the LOS A to LOS B range.

Overall, the school will serve the same students it currently does. The area is well
developed and the Tacoma School District has well established districts that serve the
area. No significant impact on the local roadway system is expected due to traffic
associated with the Washington Elementary Remodel.

           APPENDIX




              13
                                  LEVEL OF SERVICE


The following are excerpts from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation
Research Board Special Report 209.

Quality of service requires quantitative measures to characterize operational conditions
within a traffic stream. Level of service (LOS) is a quality measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service
measures as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and
comfort and convenience.

Six LOS are defined for each type of facility that has analysis procedures available.
Letters designate each level, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating
conditions and LOS F the worst. Each level of service represents a range of operating
conditions and the driver's perception of those conditions.

Level-of-Service definitions

The following definitions generally define the various levels of service for arterials.

Level of service A represents primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 90 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles
are seldom impeded in their ability to maneuver in the traffic stream. Delay at signalized
intersections is minimal.

Level of service B represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds,
usually about 70 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. The ability
to maneuver in the traffic stream is only slightly restricted and delays are not bothersome.

Level of service C represents stable operations; however, ability to maneuver and change
lanes in midblock locations may be more restricted than in LOS B, and longer queues,
adverse signal coordination, or both may contribute to lower average travel speeds of
about 50 percent of the average free-flow speed for the arterial classification.

Level of service D borders on a range in which small increases in flow may cause
substantial increases in approach delay and hence decreases in arterial speed. LOS D
may be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or
some combination of these. Average travel speeds are about 40 percent of free-flow
speed.

Level of service E is characterized by significant delays and average travel speeds of one-
third the free-flow speed or less. Such operations are caused by some combination of
adverse progression, high signal density, high volumes, extensive delays at critical
intersections, and inappropriate signal timing.




                                             14
Level of service F characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds, from less than one-
third to one-quarter of the free-flow speed. Intersection congestion is likely at critical
signalized locations, with long delays and extensive queuing.

These definitions are general and conceptual in nature, and they apply primarily to
uninterrupted flow. Levels of service for interrupted flow facilities vary widely in terms
of both the user's perception of service quality and the operational variables used to
describe them.

For each type of facility, levels of service are defined based on one or more operational
parameters that best describe operating quality for the subject facility type. While the
concept of level of service attempts to address a wide range of operating conditions,
limitations on data collection and availability make it impractical to treat the full range of
operational parameters for every type of facility. The parameters selected to define levels
of service for each facility type are called "measures of effectiveness" or "MOE's", and
represent available measures that best describe the quality of operation on the subject
facility type.

Each level of service represents a range of conditions, as defined by a range in the
parameters given. Thus, a level of service is not a discrete condition, but rather a range
of conditions for which boundaries are established.

The following tables describe levels of service for signalized and unsignalized
intersections. Level of service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of average
control delay. Delay is a measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption and
lost travel time, as well as time from movements at slower speeds and stops on
intersection approaches as vehicles move up in queue position or slow down upstream of
an intersection. Level of service for unsignalized intersections is determined by the
computed or measured control delay and is determined for each minor movement.

As described in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, level of service breakpoints for all-
way stop controlled (AWSC) intersections are somewhat different than the criteria used
for signalized intersections. The primary reason for this difference is that drivers expect
different levels of performance from distinct kinds of transportation facilities. The
expectation is that a signalized intersection is designed to carry higher traffic volumes
than an AWSC intersection. Thus a higher level of control delay is acceptable at a
signalized intersection for the same level of service.

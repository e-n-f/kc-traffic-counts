    INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND NEED
The purpose of this safety study is to evaluate existing safety performance and identify potential
countermeasures to reduce congestion and traffic crashes at the intersection of State Route 43 (Sunset
Boulevard) and Lovers Lane in Steubenville, Ohio.

A review of crash data provided by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) yielded a total of 114
reported crashes within the intersection influence area (500 feet on each approach) during a 3-year period
between 2009 and 2011. Of the total reported crashes, 14.0 percent resulted in injury, which is lower than
the statewide average of 25.7 percent for injury crashes on a state route, non-freeway location. No
fatalities occurred during the study period.

The following crash types and conditions are over represented at the Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane
intersection compared to statewide averages (shown in parenthesis). Note the statewide crash averages are
based on 2007-2011 data whereas the project data encompasses years 2009 to 2011.
        >   Rear End: 55 crashes or 48.2 percent                                 (30.9 percent)
        >   Angle: 23 crashes or 20.2 percent                                    (16.2 percent)
        >   Sideswipe passing: 15 crashes or 13.2 percent                        (8.7 percent)
        >   Left Turn: 14 crashes or 12.3 percent                                (5.3 percent)
        >   Road condition - Wet: 26 crashes or 22.8 percent                     (21.5 percent)

BACKGROUND
State Route 43, herein referred to as Sunset Boulevard, is a roadway oriented in the east-west direction
and is one of the region's highest traffic volume arterials. Sunset Boulevard is the primary east-west
arterial through the city of Steubenville. The land uses are primarily commercial along Sunset Boulevard
in the project vicinity. Lovers Lane is a north-south roadway with residential land uses and a regional
shopping mall located south of the study intersection. The north leg of the intersection is referenced as
the Lovers Lane Connector which is a limited access high speed facility that connects US Route 22 to
Sunset Boulevard (State Route 43). A project location map is shown in Figure 1.

A safety study was conducted for Sunset Boulevard by the Brooke-Hancock-Jefferson Metropolitan
Planning Commission (BHJ) in July 2007 which included the study intersection at Lovers Lane. The
previous study documented a total of 55 crashes between 2003 and 2005 within 500 feet of the signalized
intersection of Lovers Lane and Sunset Boulevard.
The previous safety study proposed the following countermeasures at the study intersection. Status of the
identified improvements is noted in italic.
    >   Provide increased speed limit enforcement using Steubenville Police Department personnel.
        ongoing
    >   Provide increased red light enforcement using Steubenville Police Department personnel.
        ongoing
    >   Review traffic signal timing at all signalized intersections for current traffic demand, clearance
        intervals and coordination. High number of rear end collisions (50 percent overall) both at mid-
        block locations and at the intersection. Signal timing and sign upgrade project completed by TEC
        under an ODOT contract in 2011.
    >   Re-evaluate and replace all traffic control signs. Signal timing and sign upgrade project
        completed by TEC under an ODOT contract and installed 2011/2012.
    >   Resurface pavement and install thermoplastic pavement markings for improved motorist
        guidance. Resurfacing Sept 2010 and Nov 2010 on Sunset Boulevard.
    >   Widen the eastbound approach to Lovers Lane to provide longer left turn lane. Eastbound SR43
        approach at Lovers Lane has a short (50 feet) left turn lane which overloads on a regular basis
        creating a blockage in the eastbound through lanes. Several rear-end and side swipe crashes may
        be attributable to this problem. Not implemented
    >    Provide wider receiving lanes for the northbound dual left turn. Several sideswipe crashes at
        Lovers Lane occurred while motorists were making the double left turn (northbound to
        westbound). The receiving lanes are narrow and could be the contributing factor. Not
        implemented
    >   Widen the southbound approach to provide a right turn lane and install video detection. Several
        rear-end collisions noted on the southbound Lovers Lane approach and may be attributed to
        traffic volume-capacity issue. Video detection completed Aug 2010.

The Brooke-Hancock-Jefferson (BHJ) Metropolitan Planning Commission developed a concept plan for
improvements at the SR 43/Lovers Lane intersection based on analysis contained in the 2007 safety study
which features the following countermeasures, as shown in Figure 2.
    >   Extend length of the eastbound left turn lane
    >   Add southbound right turn lane
    >   Add northbound through lane and convert lane configuration (L-L-TR) to a three lane approach

     EXISTING CONDITIONS
 ROADWAY AND INTERSECTION CONDITIONS
 Sunset Boulevard (State Route 43) is a four-lane roadway (48 foot pavement width) providing two
 through travel lanes in each direction with exclusive left turn lanes at major intersections (55 foot
 pavement width). Sunset Boulevard intersects Lovers Lane at a signalized intersection with a 75 degree
 skew. The east and west approaches to Lovers Lane consist of two through lanes and one left-turn lane.
 The posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour (mph) on Sunset Boulevard.

 The northbound approach of Lovers Lane has a lane configuration of an exclusive left turn lane and a
 shared left-through-right lane (L-LTR). Pavement widths vary between 22 feet and 36 feet on the
 northbound approach of Lovers Lane ­ lane widths are wider at the intersection. The posted speed limit
 is 25 miles per hour.

 The southbound approach of the Lovers Lane Connector has a lane configuration consisting of an
 exclusive left turn lane and a shared through-right lane (L-TR). The pavement width is 48 feet wide with
 10 foot paved shoulders. The posted speed limit is 50 mph on the Lovers Lane connector.

 Existing roadway conditions are summarized in Table 1.

 TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONDITIONS
 The Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane intersection is controlled by a traffic signal operating a six (6)-phase
 signal sequence.      The Lovers Lane approaches are serviced with split phasing (southbound
 lead/northbound lag). Eastbound and westbound left turn movements have a lead/lead protected phase
 followed by a permissive phase during the through phases. The traffic signal is a mast arm design with
 signal supports located in all four quadrants of the intersection. Left turn phases are actuated with video
 detection.

 Crosswalks exist on all four legs of the intersection. Sidewalks exist along both sides of Sunset Boulevard
 and the south leg of Lovers Lane; sidewalks do not exist on the north leg. The existing signal timing is
 summarized in Table 2.

Other conditions were documented during field observations:
   1. Pedestrian pushbuttons exist to cross Sunset Boulevard but no pedestrian signal heads exist at the
      signal installation. At intersections with split phasing, a pedestrian standing on the SW quadrant
      of the Lovers Lane intersection does not have a signal or pedestrian head indication directing
      them when to cross the west leg during the southbound phase.
   2. A high volume of southbound right turns on red were observed. A previous No Turn on Red
      (NTOR) sign was removed from the southbound approach in 2009.
   3. A signal head is mounted on a near side signal support for the westbound approach due to the
      horizontal curve of the approach (409 foot radius).
   4. The eastbound approach shifts through lanes to the right to accommodate a short left turn lane.
      The lane transition to the right requires drivers to steer vehicles to the left immediately after
      crossing the Lovers Lane intersection. The profile of Sunset Boulevard reduces the visibility of
      pavement markings and the horizontal curve as motorists approach the intersection. See Photo 1.
       PHOTO 1: EASTBOUND LANE TRANSITION




   5. Photo 1 also shows vehicles extending from the left turn lane. Vehicles following left turning
      vehicles that extend into the through lane often stop abruptly thus contributing to rear end
      crashes.

DATA COLLECTION
Manual turning movement counts were conducted at the Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane Road intersection
on December 13, 2012 during the morning (6 ­ 10 AM) and afternoon peak periods (2 ­ 6 PM). Hourly
traffic volumes are summarized in Graph 1. Manual count data was submitted to the ODOT Office of
Technical Services for certification of design year forecasts. Count data and certified future traffic
volumes for the design year are provided in Appendix D.

AM and PM peak design hour volumes provided by ODOT were used in preparing detailed analysis for
this study. The PM peak period is significantly higher than the AM peak period. Peak traffic volumes
occur from 7:15 to 8:15 during AM peak period and 5:00 to 6:00 during PM peak period.




LAND USE AND PROPERTY ACCESS
The areas immediately surrounding the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Lovers Lane are
characterized by commercial land uses fronting the street and residential land uses behind. The Fort
Steuben Shopping Mall is located 0.50 mile south of the study corridor along Lovers Lane with access
through Mall Drive.

Driveways to access private property are located on all approaches to the intersection except for the
southbound approach (Lovers Lane connector). Driver attention required to process potential conflicts
with vehicles entering or leaving these access points is diverted from the navigation task at the signalized
intersection.

    CRASH ANALYSIS
CRASH DATA
Crash data was furnished by the Ohio Department of Transportation for the Sunset Boulevard at Lovers
Lane intersection, encompassing a three-year study period between January 1, 2009 and December 31,
2011. The OH-1 report for each documented crash was reviewed to confirm accuracy and to locate
crashes properly within the study limits. The crash diagrams for the intersection are included in
Appendix E. Noteworthy crash statistics for the three-year period between 2009 and 2011 are
summarized below and in Graphs 2 through 4. Statewide averages for crashes on state system, non-
freeway locations are shown in parentheses based on data for years 2007 through 2011.

    >   Total crashes: 114 total crashes
    >   Rear End: 55 crashes or 48.2 percent                                       (30.9 percent)
    >   Angle: 23 crashes or 20.2 percent                                          (16.2 percent)
    >   Sideswipe passing: 15 crashes or 13.2 percent                              (8.7 percent)
    >   Left Turn: 14 crashes or 12.3 percent                                      (5.3 percent)

Of the total reported crashes, 14.0 percent resulted in injury, which is lower than the statewide average of
25.7 percent for injury crashes on a state route, non-freeway location.

CRASH ANALYSIS - GENERAL
Safety and operational issues observed and documented at the Sunset Boulevard and Lovers Lane
intersection are consistent with urban/ suburban commercial corridors with high traffic volumes.
Congestion is a contributing factor to the majority of crashes at the subject intersection for the following
reasons:

    >   The majority of crashes (77 crashes or 68 percent) occurred between the hours of 11AM and
        6PM. The 11AM to 2PM period was the highest time period
    >   The majority of crashes (55 crashes or 48 percent) involved a vehicle that was slowing or stopped
        in traffic ­ see Graph 3: Frequency of Crashes by Action 2 (non-fault driver). The percentage
        of injuries (14 percent) is below the statewide average (25 percent) which indicates lower
        operating speeds associated with congestion.
    >   The majority of crashes (55 crashes or 48 percent) are rear end crashes with angle crashes
        representing the second most prevalent crash type (23 crashes or 20 percent). The other top crash
        types (i.e., angle, sideswipe passing, and left turn) are higher than the statewide average for this
        crash type. Graph 4 shows the frequency of crashes by crash type.

    >   Crash data shows a total of 8 crashes attributed to red light running (RLR). The at-fault driver in
        each RLR crash was evenly distributed between the eastbound, westbound, and southbound
        approaches of the intersection.

CRASH ANALYSIS ­ INTERSECTIONS
The most prevalent crash types reported at the study intersection were rear end, angle (right angle and left
turn crashes), and sideswipe passing crashes, accounting for 94 percent of the total intersection crashes.
These crash types were distributed on the intersection approaches as summarized in Table 3.

A prevalent feature of the Sunset Boulevard and Lovers Lane intersection is the size of the functional area
of the intersection which is greater than a typical intersection due to the length of queues in the through
lanes on each approach. The functional area of an intersection is defined as the area beyond the physical
intersection of two roadways. The functional area for a leg of an intersection includes two components:
one upstream of the physical area of the intersection and one downstream as shown in Figure 3. The
upstream (or intersection approach) includes additional length for decision-making, maneuvering, and
required vehicle storage. The downstream area consists of a conflict overlap distance that allows a
through vehicle to clear the intersection in addition to downstream conflict points. The downstream
distance is calculated to be 250 feet based on a design speed of 35 MPH.

Noteworthy crash patterns within the intersection influence area are summarized below:

   1. Eastbound Sunset Boulevard approach. Crashes involving eastbound left turning vehicles are
      the most significant crash pattern. The at-fault driver for the majority of these crashes was
      assigned to the left turning motorist. The short left turn lane does not enable left turning motorists
      to access the left turn lane thus causing motorists arriving late in the phase to turn without
      selecting adequate gaps in opposing traffic.
       The horizontal alignment of the westbound approach also complicates the driving task of the
       eastbound left turning motorist. Research suggests that two points on a vehicle are needed to
       judge approach speeds (Gould, et al, 2011). Eastbound motorists are not able to see the side of
       opposing vehicles due to the curvature of the roadway thus reducing their ability to accurately
       judge approach speeds in the opposing through lanes.
       The height and
       lateral position of
       the    signal    head
       controlling        the
       eastbound left turn

       Factors contributing to rear end crashes on the eastbound approach include queues extending
       from the left turn lane into the adjacent through lane, access points within the functional area of
       the intersection, and lane transitions that meet only the minimal design criteria (WS2/60 for 35
       MPH). Although the lane transitions meet minimum design criteria, all of these conditions occur

       within 250 feet of a signalized intersection which complicates the driving task contributing to
       driver error.

   2. Northbound Lovers Lane approach. Three primary crash patterns on the northbound approach
      are angle, sideswipe passing, and rear end crashes.

           >   NB sideswipe passing crashes. Five (5) side-swipe crashes were documented on the
               northbound approach. Two of the 5 sideswipe crashes were caused by vehicles in the left
               turn only lane trying to travel through and colliding with vehicles turning left from the
               shared lane. The other 3 sideswipe crashes were also related to the left turn movements.
               Additional sideswipe passing crashes for the northbound left turn were recorded for the
               receiving lane along Sunset Boulevard. Queues extend from the downstream intersection
               across Sunset Boulevard.
           >   Driveway/Princeton Avenue crashes. Current crash patterns using 2009-2011 crash
               data indicate at least 5 crashes are attributed to the Rite Aid and Gas station/convenience
               store driveway, and 3 crashes are attributed to the Princeton Avenue intersection. The
               crash types were various angle crashes (right, left turning, and right turn crashes). No
               injuries were reported for these crashes.
           >   Rear end crashes. Rear end crashes on this approach are attributed to driveway access
               and congestion. Nearly all crashes occurred after 12:00 (noon) ­ existing delays on this
               approach during the PM peak period are LOS E and operates near capacity (v/c 0.93).

   3. Southbound Lovers Lane approach. The rear end and angle crashes on the SB approach are
      attributed to congestion. The levels of service experienced by motorists in the shared through-
      right lane during the AM and PM peak periods are LOS E and F, respectively. Two of the right
      angle crashes were at-fault drivers running the red light.

   4. Westbound Sunset Boulevard. Rear end crashes on the westbound approach (9 crashes)
      contribute to the elevated frequency of this crash type (55 total crashes). The proximity of the
      horizontal curve to the signalized intersection contributes to the crash frequency. The driving task
      is complicated by having to navigate the horizontal curve in addition to watching for stopped
      traffic or signal indications.

       Two primary crash types that occurred on Sunset Boulevard west of the Lovers Lane intersection
       include rear end and sideswipe crashes. Queues extend from the downstream signalized
       intersection and vehicles abruptly change lanes from the inside lane to the curb lane to avoid
       stopped traffic leading to sideswipe crashes.

       Westbound through receiving lanes are 11 feet wide. Vehicles turning left from the northbound
       Lovers Lane are documented to sideswipe each other. This pattern was more predominate in the
       previous safety study conducted by BHJ.

   COUNTERMEASURES
The following section addresses contributing factors associated with the prevalent crash types at the
Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane intersection and possible countermeasures to mitigate those crashes.
Additional countermeasures are recommended to minimize potential safety issues that may not be directly
attributable to historical crash trends. A conceptual plan (Figure 4) on page 16 shows the
countermeasures proposed below. The Technical Analysis section of the study (next section) provides
supporting documentation for the proposed countermeasures.

The following countermeasures are recommended as potential mitigation of all crash types unless
otherwise specified. Countermeasures that are intended to address specific crash types are noted below.

   1. Upgrade traffic signal installation at Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane intersection.
      Reconstruction of the traffic signal is proposed to improve signal visibility. This recommendation
      includes the following components:
       >   Reconstruct traffic signal supports and associated signal equipment. Locating signal heads
           over each approach lane on the far side of the intersection will increase visibility thus
           increase safety performance. The signal head position for the eastbound approach is critical
           considering the motorists in the left turn lane are looking at approaching traffic on a
           horizontal curve.
       >   Reapply dotted lines for turning movements of dual left turn lanes through the intersection.
           Also paint channelizing lines on the westbound approach between adjacent through lanes.
           This countermeasure is targeted to mitigate sideswipe crashes for northbound left turn and
           westbound through traffic.
       >   Install supplemental 3-section signal heads on the near right side of the southbound approach.
           Two near left side supplemental signal heads on the westbound approach are recommended
           on the back side of the signal support arm to provide advance warning to traffic approaching
           the horizontal curve. This countermeasure is targeted to mitigate rear end crashes attributed
           to higher approach speeds (SB approach) or horizontal curvature (WB approach).
       >   Add far side mast-arm mounted 5-section signal heads
           for the east, west, and northbound approaches. FHWA
           publication HRT-04-091 dated August 2004 shows an
           alternate location to improve visibility of the signal head
           ­ Figure 5 (right) shows the driver field of vision to see a
           right turn overlap phase. This countermeasure is targeted
           to increase intersection capacity thus improve safety on
           all approaches.
       >   Install reflective back plates on all signal heads.
       >   Add Left Turn Signal sign adjacent to signal heads for
           protected only left turn phasing (Lovers Lane approaches
           only). Add overhead lane use sign for left turn lanes on
           the near side of a signal support.

  2. Upgrade clearance intervals. Modify the yellow clearance and all red clearance times per
     ODOT Traffic Engineering Manual and ITE guidelines, as summarized in Table 4 and Appendix
     F. Recommended clearance intervals are based on posted or operating speeds (25 and 35 MPH
     for Lovers Lane and 35 MPH for Sunset Boulevard) and actual crossing distances.
     The NCHRP Report 731 recommends using a design speed of 20 MPH for left turning vehicles.
     This finding is consistent with research conducted by the North Carolina Department of
     Transportation published by the ITE Journal determined that the average operating speed for left
     turning traffic is 17 miles per hour. Clearance intervals for the protected left turn phase referenced
     in this report are based on a design speed of 25 miles per hour unless a lagging or left turn phase
     or split phasing by approach. This methodology helps provide adequate all-red clearance times
     based on operating speeds (yellow + AR).

  3. Increase intersection capacity: Capacity constraints at the Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane
     intersection contributes to congestion and an overall decrease in safety. Intersection
     improvements to reduce congestion includes the following:
         >   Lane widths. Increase lane width to 12 feet on one through lane on both Sunset
             Boulevard approaches. Sunset Boulevard is designated on the revised NHS system thus
             requiring wider lane widths for truck traffic.
         >   Eastbound approach. Add an eastbound right turn lane (190 feet) and extend storage
             length of left turn lane to 350 feet. The proposed length of the eastbound left turn lane
             exceeds calculated values based on ODOT L&D methodology due to the transitions on
             Sunset Boulevard. The city may consider the installation of a raised median in the area of
             the diverging taper to manage access along Sunset Boulevard (median widths  6 feet).
             The EB right turn lane enables a right turn overlap with the northbound split phase.
         >   Westbound right turn lane. A westbound right turn lane (150 feet) is proposed to utilize
             available right-of-way and reduce the amount of green time required to deliver
             westbound traffic. The WB right turn lane enables a right turn overlap with the
             southbound split phase.
         >   Southbound right turn lane. The proposed length of the right turn lane (225 feet) is
             adequate to avoid the queue in the adjacent through lane. Synchro analysis indicates that
             the right turn overlap phase will result in sufficient vehicle storage length. Deceleration
             will occur in the existing through lane if demand volumes exceed the future traffic
             volumes. The southbound right turn lane enables a right turn overlap with the eastbound
             left turn phase.

             The construction of the southbound right turn includes a raised concrete island. The
             raised island is designed to maintain an acceptable intersection angle of Lovers Lane
             traffic with respect to Sunset Boulevard. The raised island serves the purpose of
             minimizing vehicle and pedestrian clearance intervals at the intersection.

       Other improvements are proposed to be implemented as part of the capacity improvements which
       may address potential safety issues.
           >   Pavement widening of the north curb line on Sunset Boulevard west of Lovers Lane to
               accommodate dual left turning vehicles.
           >   Shifting of the PC of the horizontal curve east of Lovers Lane to improve alignment of
               westbound traffic across the intersection and improve sight distance of eastbound left
               turning vehicles. Proposed radius of 382 feet (e=0.031).
           >   Remove Sunset Boulevard access to the gas station parcel closest to the Lovers Lane
               intersection.
           >   Add overhead lane use signs on the northbound approach of Lovers Lane. This is to
               address confusion of motorists regarding lane selection on the northbound approach.
               Limited right-of-way may be required to locate sign support foundation. Proposed
               location to accommodate future widening of Lovers Lane which is programmed for 2017.

           >   Add pedestrian signal heads to assist pedestrians crossing Sunset Boulevard. The split
               phasing of the Lovers Lane approaches does not provide adequate direction without
               additional pedestrian facilities.

No improvements are proposed at the Lovers Lane/Princeton Avenue intersection at this time. A project
is planned by the BHJ Metropolitan Planning Commission to widen Lovers Lane to a 3-lane section. The
extension of storage lane lengths from the Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane intersection can be done as part
of the future project.

        TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
CLEARANCE INTERVALS
Vehicular clearance times were calculated for the Sunset Boulevard and Lovers Lane intersection based
on guidelines published in the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and ITE Proposed
Recommended Practice. The following posted speeds were used to calculate clearance intervals for
through phases:
               ·    Sunset Boulevard: 35 MPH
               ·    Lovers Lane: 25 MPH
               ·    Lovers Lane Connector: 35 MPH. The operating speed at the intersection and existing
                    signal timing is consistent with a 35 MPH design speed although the posted speed on this
                    approach is 50 MPH.
A 25 MPH speed was used to calculate clearance intervals for all leading left turn phases. The clearance
intervals for lagging left turn phases are proposed to match the through phase to ensure the onset of the
yellow and all red intervals occur concurrently for both phases. Calculated clearance intervals were
included in the Synchro models for the proposed condition, as described in the following section. Existing
and proposed clearance intervals are summarized in Table 4. Clearance interval calculations are included
in Appendix F.

CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Intersections are graded using a level of service (LOS) designation expressed in terms of letter grades.
Level of service is a quality measure describing operational conditions with a traffic stream with LOS A
representing the highest quality traffic flow and minimal delay, and LOS F representing poor traffic
operations, significant delay, and substantial queuing. Level of service is defined in terms of vehicle
delay, as published in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2010). Levels of
service thresholds for signalized intersections have been summarized in Table 5.

Traffic signal operation was evaluated at the Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane intersection to assess existing
conditions and to determine the extent of capacity improvements to reduce congestion. Intersection
capacity was evaluated using Synchro traffic signal simulation software (Version 8). The following
conditions were evaluated using existing and design year (2033) volumes. Results for the critical peak
hours (AM and PM peak) are summarized in Table 6. Detailed reports are included in Appendix G.
Three scenarios representing existing and proposed conditions were evaluated: Existing conditions
(2103), the BHJ concept plan from 2007, and the proposed condition. The BHJ concept plan referenced
in the 2007 safety study was not implemented. The purpose of comparing the BHJ plan to the concept
plan shown in Figure 4 is to compare the operational benefits with the most recent traffic volumes.

Capacity analysis results for the existing condition suggest the Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane intersection
operates near capacity (v/c ratios 0.90). The capacity analysis reflects the traffic operations observed in
the field. Eastbound left turn queues spillback into the through lanes and northbound queues extend past
Princeton Avenue.

Vehicular levels of service show the left turn movements operating at critical levels (LOS E or worse)
during the PM peak hour. These findings are not consistent with results from the 2007 safety study which
is based on traffic data collected in April 2007. However, the December 2012 traffic volumes used to
calculate intersection capacity are consistent with AADT volumes on the Sunset Boulevard and Lovers
Lane corridors and with field observations conducted January 8, 2013.

The two conceptual plans are comparable resulting in acceptable levels of service for all movements
(LOS D or better).

STORAGE LANE LENGTHS
Turn lane lengths were calculated for turn lanes at the subject intersections. Lane lengths were first
calculated using guidelines specified in the Location and Design Manual Section 401 (Ohio Department
of Transportation). Lane lengths based on ODOT standard criteria assume posted speed limits and include
vehicle storage and a 50 foot diverging taper. The calculated lengths were compared to the 95th percentile
queue lengths generated by SimTraffic modeling software. A recommended length is provided based on
this comparison and available space between adjacent intersections. A summary of the lane sizing
comparison is shown in Table 7 with lane sizing calculations in Appendix H.

Turn lane lengths were calculated using the following parameters:
                  >     2033 PM peak traffic volumes
                  >     35 MPH design speed for Sunset Boulevard
                  >     25/50 MPH design speed for Lovers Lane south/north approaches, respectively
                  >     110 second cycle length
                  >     Lengths rounded up in 5-foot increments

The Lane Drop reference in Table 7 indicates that an approach lane is painted as an exclusive turn lane at
an intersection ­ a diverging taper does not demark the beginning of the left turn lane. The Lovers Lane
connection is a four lane roadway having two southbound lanes. At the Sunset Boulevard intersection,
the inside lane forms a southbound left turn lane whereas the outside lane adjacent to the shoulder forms a
shared through-right turn lane. Therefore the length of the southbound left turn lane does not show a
recommended length.

   SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The following section summarizes the recommended countermeasures to improve the safety performance
of the Sunset Boulevard and Lovers Lane intersection. Details of each countermeasure are summarized in
the Countermeasures section with supporting data and analysis included in the Crash Analysis and
Technical Analysis sections.

   1. Reconstruct the traffic signal to accommodate capacity improvements and to improve visibility of
      signal heads on the eastbound and westbound approaches. Add pedestrian signal heads for
      crossing Sunset Boulevard.
   2. Modify the yellow clearance and all red clearance times. See ODOT Traffic Engineering Manual
      and ITE guidelines, as calculated in Appendix F.
   3. Construct southbound right turn lane on the Lovers Lane connector, including a raised island and
      new signal support for signal head to indicate overlapping right turn phase.
   4. Add eastbound and westbound right turn lanes.
   5. Extend the eastbound left turn lane for a total length of 350 feet
   6. Realign the Sunset Boulevard approaches to accommodate recommended capacity improvements.
   7. Construct overhead lane use sign on the northbound Lovers Lane approach. Limited right-of-way
      may be required to locate the sign support foundation. The proposed location should
      accommodate future widening of Lovers Lane which is programmed for 2017.

The construction of a raised median along Sunset Boulevard to restrict access may be considered as a
long term countermeasure. The conceptual plan does not show locations for raised medians except for the
northwest quadrant of the intersection.

No improvements are proposed at the Lovers Lane/Princeton Avenue intersection at this time. A project
is planned by the BHJ Metropolitan Planning Commission to widen Lovers Lane to a 3-lane section. The
extension of storage lane lengths from the Sunset Boulevard/Lovers Lane intersection can be done as part
of the future project.

    RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS
Rate of return (ROR) is an economic analysis tool to determine the financial benefits of a project based on
net present value (NPV) of an improvement. ROR values greater than zero indicate a positive return on
the original investment. Preferred countermeasures are those having the highest net present value (NPV).
Project costs were estimated based on the concept plan shown in Figure 4 with the following
assumptions:

    >   35.0 percent design risk and 23.5 percent inflation rate for an estimated 2017 construction year.
    >   The proposed improvements will require additional right-of-way from parcels fronting Sunset
        Boulevard. However, the proposed improvements do avoid impacts to the existing service station
        on the southeast quadrant of the intersection. Estimated right of way impact costs has been
        provided in Appendix I.
    >   Estimate does not include utility relocation. The proposed sidewalk location on the south side of
        Sunset Boulevard avoids utility pole relocation.

Table 8 lists the crash reduction factors, total estimated project cost and resulting rate of return for the
recommended countermeasures. Detailed cost estimates and rate of return calculations are included in
Appendix I. Crash reduction factors (CRF) included in the rate of return for countermeasures were
limited to the following:

    1. Horizontal Realignment: The CRF for the intersection realignment was obtained from research
       by the Florida Department of Transportation: Update of Florida Crash Reduction Factors and
       Countermeasures to Improve the Development of District Safety Improvement Projects (2005):
       Table 3.7 in the Florida documentation shows an average crash reduction factor of 45 for all crash
       types with changes to the horizontal alignment of an intersection. A CRF of 45 is considered
       appropriate for the rate of return analysis for the following reasons:
            >   Lower than other horizontal alignment improvements published by FDOT
            >   Countermeasure includes traffic signal improvements which has a CRF of 7 as a
                standalone improvement (CMF Clearinghouse).
            >   The capacity benefits of the proposed realignment at the Sunset Boulevard and Lovers
                Lane intersection are considered to be representative of the safety benefits for all crash
                types ­ general capacity improvements are expected with this countermeasure.
        However, this applicable countermeasure is limited to the eastbound and westbound approaches
        at the Sunset Blvd/Lovers Lane intersection. The total number of crashes on these two approaches
        represents 51 percent of the total crashes. The CRFs therefore were factored by 51 percent to
        represent the benefits attributed to the crashes of these two approaches. The factored CMF
        therefore is equal to 23 percent.

    2. Retiming signal change intervals to ITE standards.

    3. Installation of right turn lanes on both major road approaches ­ signalized.

All improvements including signal timing revisions, pavement marking upgrades, pavement resurfacing,
the addition of exclusive right turn lanes, traffic signal reconstruction, and overhead signs are estimated as
part of the total construction cost. The CRFs associated with secondary improvements were not used to
calculate the potential rate of return.

The project costs for the BHJ plan (Figure 2) were estimated for an October 2010 funding application.
The construction, right of way, and design costs were estimated to be $2.37 million. The higher project
costs for the BHJ plan would result in a rate of return of 5.4 percent. Either of the alternative concepts or
refinement of both concepts that achieves comparable operational and safety benefits are considered
viable alternatives to mitigate crashes at the Sunset Boulevard and Lovers Lane intersection.

                                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Purpose:

The study section of State Route 43 appears on ODOT's 2005 listing of high crash locations as follows:

        HSP Non-Freeway listing
             Section 0.98 to 3.55 - ranked 31
             Section 3.77 to 4.49 ­ ranked 84

        HSP Non-Freeway Intersection listing
             CR 77 (John Scott Hwy) and SR43 ­ ranked 124

        Hot Spot Location listing
              Section 0.96 to 2.96 ­ ranked 83
              Section 2.96 to 4.96 ­ ranked 121

The purpose of this report is to study these locations and analyze the crashes to determine what, if any,
actions can be taken to reduce these crashes. The identified intersection and sections have been
combined in this study and analyzed as a whole.

Background:

State Route 43 (Sunset Blvd.) from SLM 0.96-4.96 is a principle arterial roadway located in the city of
Steubenville and the eastern part of the village of Wintersville. The dividing corporation line is located at
SLM 4.488, making 3.528 miles of the study section in the city of Steubenville and 0.472 miles within the
village of Wintersville. The roadway is four lanes without a center turn lane with the exception of SLM
1.40-1.95 and SLM 4.51-4.96 which has a fifth lane accommodating two way left turn lanes and exclusive
left turn lanes. Also, exclusive left turn lanes are provided on the approaches to the intersections of SR
43 and Johnson Road (SLM 2.89), SR 43 and John Scott Highway (SML 3.45) and SR 43 and Lovers
Lane (SLM 4.21).

SR 43 traverses the city of Steubenville and village of Wintersville in an east-west direction. However,
the routing of SR 43 is identified as north and south.

As noted earlier, the study section appears on several lists in ODOT's High Crash Location Identification
System (HCLIS). SR43 through the city of Steubenville and the village of Wintersville is one of the
region's highest traffic volume non-freeway roadways. The roadway traverses through commercial as
well as residential development. As might be expected, the majority of crashes are at intersections and
at mid-block locations in the commercial development areas where turning traffic volumes are high.

Possible Causes:

A number of safety problems were identified in the study.

    ·   The speed limit through the city of Steubenville is posted at 35 mile per hour. The 85th percentile
        speeds were observed to be between 40 and 45 miles per hour at two study locations (SLM 2.54
Brooke-Hancock-Jefferson                                                            HSP Safety Study
Metropolitan Planning Commission                 i                                 JEF-43-(0.96-4.96)
        and SLM 3.81). Although these speeds are not alarming, a closer look at the speed data
        revealed a high percentage of vehicles exceeding 54 miles per hour especially in the study at
        SLM 2.54.
    ·   High number of westbound SR43 left turn crashes at John Scott Hwy (SLM 3.45) possibly caused
        by a high left turn traffic volume (motorists heading to the regional mall). See Appendix H for
        volume and capacity data.
    ·   High number of rear end collisions (50 percent overall) both at mid-block locations and at
        intersections, possibly caused by
            o lack of separate left turn lanes
            o narrow driveway openings creating slow entry to driveways
            o insufficient guide signs creating driver confusion
            o possible traffic signal coordination problems creating unexpected stopping
            o high speeds causing drivers to be unable to avoid conflicts
            o driver in-attention
    ·   High number of angle, left turn and sideswipe crashes associated with traffic turning at
        intersections and driveways. Driver in-attention may also be attributable.
    ·   Existing thermoplastic pavement markings are in need of replacement in many areas creating
        driver guidance issues
    ·   Several sideswipe crashes at Lovers Lane (SLM 4.21) occurred while motorist were making the
        double left turn (northbound to westbound). The receiving lanes are narrow and could be the
        contributing factor.
    ·   Several rear-end collisions noted on the southbound Lovers Lane approach at SR43 (SLM 4.21)
        may be attributed to traffic volume-capacity issue.
    ·   Eastbound SR43 approach at Lovers Lane (SLM 4.21) has a short (50 feet) left turn lane which
        overloads on a regular basis creating a blockage in the eastbound left through lane. Several
        rear-end and side swipe crashes may be attributable to this problem. See Appendix I for volume
        and capacity data.

Recommended Countermeasures and Costs:

    1. Provide increased speed limit enforcement in the following sections using Steubenville Police
       Department personnel:
          a. West of McDowell Ave (SLM 1.20 to 1.40)
          b. West of Hollywood Blvd (SLM 1.75 to 1.90)
          c. Wilshire Boulevard area (SLM 2.30 to 2.50)
          d. Wlilma Ave/Opal Blvd area (SLM 2.55 to 2.80)
          e. Negley Avenue area (SLM 3.10 to 3.25)
          f. West of Cunningham Dr (SLM 3.80 to 3.95)
          g. West of Cunningham Ln (SLM 4.00 to 4.15)
          h. West of Lovers Ln (SLM 4.25 to 4.40)

       Before enforcement begins, it is recommended that an enforcement plan be prepared along with
    a media outreach plan to make citizens aware of the crash problems and reasons for the plan.

    2. Provide increased red-light enforcement at the following locations using Steubenville Police
       Department personnel:
          a. Westbound SR43 at Brady Circle West (SLM 1.45)
Brooke-Hancock-Jefferson                                                       HSP Safety Study
Metropolitan Planning Commission               ii                             JEF-43-(0.96-4.96)
            b.   Eastbound / Westbound SR43 at Hollywood Blvd (SLM 1.75)
            c.   Eastbound SR43 at Johnson Rd (SLM 2.89)
            d.   Eastbound SR43 at Rosemont Ave (SLM 3.04)
            e.   Southbound / Westbound SR43 at John Scott Hwy (SLM 3.45)
            f.   Eastbound / Westbound SR43 at Lovers Ln (SLM 4.21)

       As indicated on the prior section, before enforcement begins, it is recommended that an
    enforcement plan be prepared along with a media outreach plan to make citizens aware of the crash
    problems and reasons for the plan.

    3. Re-evaluate and replace all traffic control signs. Also install advance intersection warning signs
       with street name at all intersections for motorist guidance and install larger sized street name sign
       at the intersections for better legibility and motorist guidance. The proposed plan addresses the
       placement of speed limit signs within the city of Steubenville so that speed limit signs are posted
       past major intersection roadways and the spacing so that speed limit signs are posted every
       quarter to third mile. Intersecting stop signs are shown to be replaced due to the changes
       recommended for larger street name signs which are mounted on the same support as the stop
       sign. All signs are proposed to use high intensity reflective sheeting to increase night visibility to
       help with motorist guidance issues. The estimated cost for this countermeasure is $120,000.

    4. Review traffic signal timing at all traffic signals (total of 14) for current traffic needs, clearance
       intervals and coordination. The estimated cost for this countermeasure is $40,000.

    5. Resurface the following sections ­ from SLM 1.99 to 2.83 and from SLM 2.94 to 4.88. The
       estimated cost for this countermeasure is $1,339,000.

    6. Refresh and install where resurfaced all pavement marking using thermoplastic material to
       provide increased motorist guidance. The estimated cost for this countermeasure is $113,500.

    7. SR 43 & Hollywood Blvd (SLM 1.75) ­ move the eastbound supplemental signal head from the
       far right pole to the near right pole and add backing plate for improved visibility. The estimated
       cost for this countermeasure is $3,000.

    8. SR 43 & John Scott Hwy (SLM 3.45) - Modify the traffic signal to provide a protected only left turn
       phase for westbound left turn movement to address high number of left turn crashes. Install a
       near side mast arm pole with two supplemental signal heads for the southbound approach and
       install video detection to address southbound red light running. The estimated cost for these
       countermeasures is $88,000.

    9. SR 43 & Lovers Ln (SLM 4.21) - Widen the eastbound approach to Lovers Lane to provide longer
       left turn lane and to provide wider receiving lanes for the northbound dual left turn, widen the
       southbound approach to provide a right turn lane and install video detection. The estimated cost
       for this countermeasure is $675,000.

    10. SR43 at Taco Bell Driveway (SLM 1.66) ­ Install exiting left turn restriction during the hours of
        11:00am to 6:00pm in conjunction with signing to direct Taco Bell patrons to the traffic signal at
        Stanton. The estimated cost for this countermeasure is $1000.

Discussion of Future Long Term Solution
using Roundabouts with Mid-block Raised Medians

A new type of intersection design, called a roundabout, is emerging in the United States and recently has
been embraced by the Ohio Department of Transportation. Roundabouts have been in use for years in
Europe and their introduction in the United States date back over fifteen years. Historical crash reduction
data on roundabouts are compelling. Crash reduction rates following the change from signalized control
to roundabout operation are dramatic. Very few other engineering crash countermeasures experience
the same or better crash reductions in both total crashes and crash severity. See Appendix N for a
discussion of roundabouts and how to drive them. Several diagrams and photos are also included.

An example of a successful roundabout project involved an arterial street in Golden, Colorado very
similar to this study's section. The project was constructed in 1999 and involved construction of four
roundabouts and installing raised median between the roundabouts. The project length was
approximately three quarters of a mile. Driveway access through the project was converted to right in /
right out movements. The left in / left out movements are accommodated through the roundabouts. A
motorist wanting to turn left out of a driveway would turn right and proceed to the roundabout where they
effectively make a "U" turn and proceed to their destination.

In reviewing this report's study section, several segments were selected which are experiencing high
concentrations of mid-block and intersection crashes. These segments, shown below, are possible
candidates for the Golden, Colorado treatment. Cost estimates were prepared and crash reduction
factors experienced in Golden, Colorado were applied resulting in rates of return on investment versus
crash reduction benefits from 14 to 31 percent.

The greatest obstacle to moving forward with roundabout projects will be acceptance by the general
public and affected businesses. It has been the experience in other parts of the United States that as
time goes on and roundabouts become more common in the area, public acceptance increases
dramatically. In the Golden, Colorado project, one business had concerns about decreased business
revenue as a result of a roundabout project. The City administration promised the business owner they
would remove the roundabout if their business revenue declined. Following the project completion, the
business' revenue actually increased and the business was pleased with the design.

The following are several sections on SR43 where roundabout treatments may be feasible.

     ·   Pico (SLM 2.28) to Wilma (SLM 2.63) - Widen SR 43 by 2.5 feet on each side within existing
         right-of-way to allow the installation of a 3 foot wide continuous raised median (5 foot wide with
         painted edge lines). Construct roundabout type intersections at SR43 & Pico/Richland (SLM
         2.28) and also at SR43 & Wilma (SML 2.63). The raised median will eliminate all left turn
         ingress and left turn egress between the two roundabouts. The roundabouts will provide a
         means for `U' turns to accommodate the desired left turn movements. The estimated cost for
         this countermeasure is $1,520,000. The estimated rate of return is approximately 31%.

     ·   SR 43 & John Scott (SLM 3.45) to Jefferson Community College (SLM 3.67) ­ Widen SR 43 by
         2.5 feet on each side within existing right-of-way to allow the installation of a 3 foot wide
         continuous raised median (5 foot wide with median pavement marking edge lines). Construct
         roundabout type intersections at SR 43 & John Scott (SLM 3.45) and at SR43 & Jefferson
Brooke-Hancock-Jefferson                                                          HSP Safety Study
Metropolitan Planning Commission                iv                               JEF-43-(0.96-4.96)
         Community College (SLM 3.67). This will eliminate all left turn ingress and left turn egress
         between the two roundabouts. The roundabouts will provide a means for `U' turns to
         accommodate the desired left turn movements. The estimated cost for this countermeasure is
         $1,688,000. The estimated rate of return is approximately 31%.

     ·   Jefferson Community College (SLM 3.67) to Lovers Ln (SLM 4.21) - Widen SR 43 by 2.5 feet on
         each side within existing right-of-way to allow the installation of a 3 foot wide continuous raised
         median (5 foot wide with pavement marking edge lines). Construct roundabout type
         intersections at SR 43 & Cunningham Ln (SLM 3.97) and also at SR43 & Lovers Ln (SLM 4.21).
         This will eliminate all left turn ingress and left turn egress between the two roundabouts. The
         roundabouts will provide a means for `U' turns to accommodate the desired left turn movements.
         The estimated cost for this countermeasure is $2,100,000. The estimated rate of return is
         approximately 22%.

     ·   Lovers Ln (SLM 4.21) to Riesbeck Shopping Center Entrance in Village of Wintersville (SLM
         4.56) - Widen SR 43 by 2.5 feet on each side within existing right-of-way to allow the installation
         of a 3 foot wide continuous raised median (5 foot wide with pavement marking edge lines).
         Construct additional roundabout type intersection at SR43 & Shopping Center Entrance (SLM
         4.56). This will eliminate all left turn ingress and left turn egress between the two roundabouts.
         The roundabouts will provide a means for `U' turns to accommodate the desired left turn
         movements. The estimated cost for this countermeasure is $1,310,000. The estimated rate of
         return is approximately 14%.

                                         INTRODUCTION

The Swampscott School District is proposing to develop a portion of the Middle School site by
adding an Elementary School which will encompass 635 students. The site is located at 207 Forest
Avenue, Swampscott MA. The Middle School presently has 602 students and will continue to
maintain this number after the Elementary School is constructed. The Middle School starts at 8:00am
and the last regular class gets out at 2:20pm. The purpose of this Traffic Impact Study (TIS) Report
is to assess the existing traffic conditions and the impacts of the Elementary School on the area street
network. The site is located on the north side of Forest Avenue and is bounded by Forest Ave., Laurel
Rd. to the east, playfields to the north, and Burke Dr. to the west. The proposed Elementary School
is expected to be constructed to the northeast, or behind the Middle School on existing playfields with
a direct connection to Nason Rd and a driveways to Forest Ave.

A locus map, Figure 1, Location Plan is provided with the site centrally located on a USGS map. A
Site Plan, Figure 2, indicating the proposed Elementary School footprint relative to existing site
conditions, including the Middle School and local street network is provided by the project architect,
Mount Vernon Group (MVG).

GEOD Consulting Inc. has evaluated the existing traffic condition and the impacts of the new
Elementary School. The results are presented in this Study Report. The Report includes an analysis
of the existing study area intersections and roadways, and the future condition with the inclusion of
the Elementary School.

 PROPOSED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

The proposed Elementary School (ES) will include 635 students, teachers and administration staff
necessary to operate the school. The students are presently located at three schools in Town, Hadley
ES on Redington St, Clarke ES on Middlesex Ave. and Stanley ES on Whitman Rd. The elementary
students at these three schools will be relocated to the new school location. The Hadley, Clarke and
Stanley ES's are located southwest, northwest and east of the new ES, respectively. The ES hours
are from 8:20am to 2:15pm.

The proposed ES will be accessed by three avenues, a continuation of Nason Rd, the existing eastern
driveway and the main MS driveway both intersecting with Forest Avenue.

                                     PROJECT STUDY AREA

GEOD Consulting has met with the school building committee, the project team and town personnel
on several occasions. We have visited the site during the peak AM and PM periods and assessed the
existing conditions. The project study area, affected by the existing MS and the future ES, will be
Forest Avenue, Laurel Road, Sargent Road and Nason Road. Each of these either presently or in the
future will be the primary access routes to and from the schools. The schools will be directly
accessible by Forest Ave. and Nason Rd. All of the roadways are owned and maintained by the Town
of Swampscott.

All of the study driveways and intersection are unsignalized. The following intersection/driveways
comprise the study area:

                                    EXISTING CONDITIONS

Field investigations were conducted at the study area roadways and intersection/driveways to obtain
an inventory of existing conditions, posted traffic controls, adjacent land uses, lane configurations,
pavement widths, and existing vehicular traffic patterns.

ROADWAYS

 FOREST AVENUE
Forest Ave. is a two-lane east-west local roadway under the Town's jurisdiction, which ultimately
connects Humphrey St. (Rte 129) to Paradise Rd. (Rte 1A). The roadway is relatively flat in the
study area with a posted speed limit of 20 mph. The area is exclusively residential. The pavement
condition on Forest Ave. is fair with minor repairs and cracks and the roadway width is
approximately 33 feet. The length of Forest Ave. in front of the MS has a sidewalk on the northerly
side adjacent to the school, but not on the southerly side. Crosswalks are provided at the main
driveway entrance and at the intersection with Sargent Rd. The north side of the roadway, adjacent to
the MS, is signed for "1 Hr Parking, 8am ­ 3pm", and the south side of the road is signed for "No
Parking, 8am ­ 3pm".

 SARGENT ROAD
Sargent Rd. is a two-lane north-south local roadway under the Town's jurisdiction. The roadway
connects Forest Avenue to Pleasant Street, and then to Humphrey St. (Rte 129). The roadway has
significant grades, however it's relatively flat before it intersects with Forest Ave. The roadway does
not have a posted speed limit, however we assume it to be 20 mph. The area is exclusively
residential. The pavement condition on Sargent Road Ave. is fair to poor with numerous pavement
deficiencies. The roadway width is approximately 34 feet between Forest Ave. and Pleasant Street,
and beyond Pleasant St. the width decreases to varying widths.

 NASON ROAD
Nason Rd. is a two-lane east-west local roadway under the Town's jurisdiction, which connects
Humphrey St. (Rte 129) to Laurel Rd. and then onto Forest Ave. The roadway has moderate grades
in the study area with a posted speed limit of 20 mph. The area is exclusively residential. The
pavement condition on Nason Rd. is fair with minor repairs and cracks, and the roadway width is
approximately 32 feet. Nason Rd. has sidewalks on both sides of the road and is signed for no
parking.

 LAUREL ROAD
Laurel Rd. is a two-lane north-south local roadway under the Town's jurisdiction, which connects
Nason Rd to Forest Ave. The roadway has minimal grades in the study area. The roadway does not
have a posted speed limit, however we assume it to be 20 mph. The area is exclusively residential.

Project No. 13630MB                                                                       April 29, 2014

The pavement condition on Laurel Rd. is fair with minor repairs and cracks and the roadway width is
approximately 23 feet. Laurel Rd. has sidewalks on both sides of the road and is signed for no
parking.

TRAFFIC COUNT VOLUMES

Existing traffic counts were obtained from Transportation Data Corporation (TDC) for the study area
intersection and driveways. The actual count data obtained by TDC is shown in Appendix A.
Turning movement counts were collected on Tuesday, April 1, 2014 from 7:00 am to 9:00 am and
from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Additional counts were performed by Marshall-Gary Landscape Architects
a couple of months previous to the TDC counts.

The existing turning movement counts for the AM and PM peak hours are shown in Figure 3.

SAFETY ANALYSIS

The Swampscott Police Department has been contacted to request accident traffic history for the
project study area over the last three years. We have not received a report, however we were told
verbally that there is not a history of accidents in the study area.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS

The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology uses LOS as an index to the operational
qualities of an intersection. Level of service measures the operating conditions of signalized and
unsignalized intersections for a specific period of time, which is usually the peak hour. The
methodology evaluates operating conditions and assigns a level of service rating from LOS "A" to
"F" with LOS A being the most desirable. The LOS is a function of the average vehicle delay at the
intersection. Table 1 illustrates the LOS thresholds for unsignalized and signalized intersections.

The existing Middle School traffic operations were analyzed at the study area intersection and
driveways, and are presented in Table 2. The LOS, volume to capacity ratios (v/c), and delay for the
intersections existing condition have been calculated. The intersections operational/capacity analysis

calculations are shown in Appendix B. Typically the model calculations gives us an understanding of
the operational capacity of the school site drives and the Forest Ave. / Sargent Road intersection.
However, due to the excessive student drop offs on Forest Ave., and the crossing guards preference to
student walkers at the expense of the vehicles in queue, the human element is driving the modeling
software to determinations which do not match field observations. Consequently, our analysis is
derived by a combination of modeling analysis and field observations.

                            TRAFFIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

The methodology used for the analysis and development of the TIS was a means to assess the
existing operational condition of the study area roadways and intersections, add the ES generated
traffic and additional access and egress points, ie. the Nason Rd and eastern driveway connections,
and re-assess the proposed operational conditions. To do this TMC's were obtained as previously
described, the existing conditions of the intersection/driveways were modeled and assessed, the
proposed ES traffic and network then added to the model, and the study area reassessed. The
intersection/driveways were analyzed and the operational conditions (level of service, intersection
delay, approach delays, v/c capacity, queue lengths, etc.) calculated. The existing condition, MS and
the future condition, with the ES, are then evaluated.

The existing, and proposed condition operational analyses were performed using SYNCRO 8.05;
Traffic Control Coordination Software for the studied intersections. The software utilizes the
methods for intersection analyses contained in the latest version of the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM), Special Report 209; Transportation Research Board.

This project is classified as educational with peaks in the AM (7 ­ 9am) and PM (2 ­ 4pm) time
periods. Consequently, all conditions were analyzed for these two peak hours. The AM peak period
will have significantly greater volume of traffic in a more condense time than the PM period because
after school programs, for both the MS and ES will span out the PM peak period, thereby reducing
the net effect to the study area network.

 TRIP GENERATION

In order to assess the volume of traffic generated by the three ES's (Stanley, Hadley and Clarke),
traffic counts were taken at each of the schools. Each school has kindergarten students which will not
be coming to the MS site. Consequently we reduced the trip counts by the percentage of kindergarten
students in the schools.

Another consideration for the trip generation, and the volume of existing trips visiting the site is the
number of families that have students in both the MS and ES. Presently, of the 602 students in the
MS, 202 of them have siblings in the ES. Therefore 33% of the generated trips are already coming to
the site. To be conservative we have reduced the trip generation by 20%, simply because we don't
know if the 33% overlap is consistent year in and year out.

The following illustrates the ES volume of trips expected to come to the MS site:

 TRIP DISTRIBUTION

The trip distribution is illustrated in Figure 4, Trip Distribution ­ AM and PM Peak Hour Volumes.
Three routes provide access and egress to/from the site, Forest Ave. from the west, Sargent Rd. from
the south and Nason Rd/Laurel Rd/Forest Ave from the east. The distribution from each route was
developed utilizing a combination of methods. First we calculated the existing distribution based on
the existing MS traffic pattern, and then we considered the location of the three existing ES's relative
to the MS site. The existing traffic pattern illustrated that approximately 50% of the traffic comes to
the MS from the west on Forest Ave, 20% from the south on Sargent Rd and 30% from the east on
Nason Rd. The Clarke, Hadlley and Stanley schools are west, southwest and east of the MS,
respectively. The three schools are similarly populated, and based on their locale to the MS, we
believe the distribution will continue with the existing condition.

The trips generated by the ES are then distributed throughout the study area network utilizing the trip
distribution. This is shown in Figure 5.

OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS ­ PROPOSED CONDITION

At this point we have analyzed the existing roadway network condition as it operates with the Middle
School. We then calculate the expected trips generated by the Elementary School, distribute the trips
throughout the network, add those trips to the existing peak hour volumes as shown in Figure 3, and
run a new model which will represent the Proposed Condition. The resulting proposed total volume
coming to the site is shown in Figure 6. Lastly, we analyze the proposed network and if the network
level of service (LOS) degenerates at any of the site drives to an unacceptable LOS we mitigate the
condition.

Table 2 illustrates the operational capacity, delay and LOS, of the existing and proposed conditions
at the site drives and Forest Ave/Sargent Rd intersection.

The western driveway operates in a satisfactory condition in the existing and proposed conditions.
The middle driveway analysis shows the existing Forest Ave movements and the northbound
driveway (entrance into the MS) with LOS E and D. The proposed condition with the Elementary
School shows Forest Ave. east and westbound free flowing with no delays, however the northbound
movement operates at a LOS F. This is because the delayed vehicles on Forest Ave. are now on site
in the expanded MS drop off/pick up location.

The same condition exists for Sargent Road. Opening up the eastern driveway and prohibiting drop
offs on Sargent St will move the vehicles from Sargent Rd onto the school site, via the eastern
driveway.


                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The study area roadways, school driveways and Forest Ave / Sargent Road intersection operate at a
LOS A, except during the 15 ­ 20 minute period before school begins and ends. During this peak 15
­ 20 minutes approximately 300 vehicles and 175 pedestrians operate in the study area to populate
the MS. Additionally, another approximately 300 vehicles, having no business with the MS pass
through the study area. We believe the additional traffic is predominately using the study area to by
pass the congestion on Humphrey Street (Rte 129). The combination of this traffic, school and non
school related, is causing the delays and queueing on Forest Ave. and Sargent Road.

The ES will attract approximately 220 and 133 vehicles in the AM and PM peak periods,
respectively. However an additional access/egress point will be added by connecting Nason Rd to
the ES, and the eastern driveway will be opened to provide greater access and egress. Additionally
the main access driveway to the MS will be expanded providing greater drop off and queuing
availability.

The ES will start classes a minimum of 20 minutes after the MS. Based on our numerous
observations the MS traffic will be dispersed at or close to 8am. The ES traffic will then begin
to arrive and the drop off process will again run it's course from 8:00am ­ 8:20am. The
analysis prepared for this TIS assumes a worse case scenario, that being both schools start at
the same time. Our approach in this report is that if we can manage all of the drop offs,
happening at the same time, on site we will have alleviated the congestion on the local street
network. We have done this by designing three entrance/exit driveways with extensive drop
off/pick up locations.

The following is a discussion regarding the analytical data, and considering observed operating
conditions in the study area.

Forest Ave. ­ Western (Exit) Driveway
       The western driveway experiences queuing in the AM primarily because exiting vehicles are
       attempting to head eastbound on Forest Ave. to bring students to the Stanley ES. The queuing
       on Forest Ave eastbound resulting from the Middle driveway inhibits the left turn out of the
       western driveway. Adding the ES to the site should significantly reduce the need for this
       movement, and requiring parents to drop off on site should reduce the queue on Forest Ave.
       eastbound.

Project No. 13630MB                                                                         April 29, 2014



Forest Ave. ­ Middle (Entrance) Driveway
       The middle driveway provides access to the MS and curbside drop off on site. The existing
       combination of limited curbside length for drop off, drop offs occurring on both sides of
       Forest Ave from both eastbound and westbound traffic, and the length of time the crossing
       guard is taking to process students, all of this is contributing to the queues on Forest Ave from
       both directions. The proposed design significantly increases the curb side drop off, the
       enforcement of prohibiting drop offs on Forest Ave, and the re-training of the crossing guard
       to consider processing vehicles as well as pedestrians should significantly reduce the
       congestion and queues on Forest Ave.

Forest Ave. ­ Eastern (Exit / Entrance) Driveway
       The eastern driveway is presently underutilized and experiences no delays because it does not
       provide a drop off condition that the parents find useful. The proposed condition expands the
       eastern driveway to provide access to the ES, the MS and egress to Nason Rd and Forest Ave.
       at the western driveway. We expect expansion of the eastern driveway's capabilities should
       significantly mitigate additional traffic generated by the ES.

Forest Ave. / Sargent Road
       Forest Ave, eastbound and westbound queue to approximately 4 ­ 5 vehicles and Sargent
       Road queues to approximately 5 ­ 6 vehicles based on field observations. The delay, or time it
       takes for a vehicle to get through the intersection, is approximately 30 seconds. The queuing
       and delay are largely a result of student drop offs on Sargent Rd and the crossing guard
       processing the students across both Sargent Rd and Forest Ave. Due to the expanded use of
       the eastern driveway parents will be able to drop off their students more conveniently and
       safely on site, resulting in less congestion at the intersection. Enforcement and signing will be
       helpful to encourage the use of the eastern driveway.

Nason Road
      Nason Road presently processes approximately 4 drop offs in the AM peak hour and 25 pick
      ups in the PM peak hour. The parents pull of the road near the fenced area at the end of
      Nason Road which abuts the school site. In the future Nason Road will be extended into a
      new school driveway leading to curb side drop off/pick up in front of the new ES. This new
      point of access/egress to the site will provide extensive curbside drop-offs and queuing length
      on school property. Additionally the parents will be able to exit via Nason Rd and Forest Ave
      on the other side of the school property at the western, exit driveway. By creating the egress
      movement to the western driveway vehicles have been taken off the roadway from Nason Rd
      all the way to Forest Ave, beyond the school. This means the vehicle will not process through
      the Sargent Rd/Forest Ave intersection, or the eastern and western driveways.

Several issues contribute to the existing congestion. Those issues, and the issues which arise from the
additional ES trips can be mitigated through design, enforcement and education. The following is an
itemization of remedies which contribute to alleviating the congestion and queueing on the study area
roadways:

    1. The design of the new ES includes providing a drop off location with significant queue
       length on school property from Nason Rd.

Project No. 13630MB                                                                      April 29, 2014



    2. The front entrance to the MS will be widened and lengthened to provide a longer drop off
       and queue length on school property.

    3. The eastern driveway will be widened and extended to provide drop off locations for both the
       ES and MS. After the drop offs/pick ups occur the driver will be given the option to exit the
       school site via Nason Rd to the east, back out to Forest Ave in the same location they came
       in, or circle around the schools and exit out to Forest Ave from the western driveway.

    4. The analysis assumed the MS and ES would be operating in the same peak period, however
       the schools presently open twenty minutes apart, the MS starts at 8:00am and the ES at
       8:20am. The congestion and queues generally take place 15 ­ 20 minutes before school
       starts. If the schools start/end 20 ­ 30 minutes apart from each other the congestion and
       queues will not overlap, and consequently be more manageable.

    5. Presently the crossing guards are providing a valuable service by shepherding students across
       the cross walks at the main access driveway and across Sargent Road/Forest Ave. The guards
       could be trained to facilitate the traffic in combination with safeguarding the student
       movements.

    6. Signs and enforcement should be provided on Forest Ave, Laurel Rd, Nason Rd and Sargent
       Rd which restricts the parents from dropping off the students on the study area roadways.
       Students must be brought into the school site, and then dropped off / picked up. This will
       take the drop off movement from the study area roadways and allow traffic to move more
       freely.

    7. As described above Forest Ave is used as a cut through to bypass the heavily congested
       Humphrey St. This situation accounts for approximately 50% of the traffic on Forest Ave in
       both peak hours, and more significantly in the AM. The cut through could be redirected, and
       this would significantly reduce the number of vehicles in the study area during the peak
       periods.

    8. The school district is contemplating an increase use of buses. A single bus will take
       approximately 65 students, which will result in approximately 30 less vehicles coming to the
       school. Industry traffic analysis software cannot accurately measure the reduction in delay
       and queuing which results from 30 less vehicles, however we expect approximately 520
       vehicles to come to the site (albeit over two peak periods, 7:40 ­ 8am and 8 ­ 8:20am) so we
       can assume four buses will result in a little less than 25% reduction in delay and queue.

It is GEOD's professional opinion that the study area roadway network should be able to process the
existing Middle School and proposed Elementary School due to the design features, enforcement,
education and staggered start times of the two schools. Redistributing the student drop-off location
from Forest Ave. to on-site locations has the potential of reducing congestion within the study area
network The list of remedies above should provide adequate mitigation to process the existing and
proposed traffic.

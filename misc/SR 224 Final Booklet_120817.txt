  RECOMMENDATIONS


    Assumptions (All Phases)

    Phase 1 improvements consist of projects that could be completed in
    the immediate future. Phase 2 improvements consist of projects that
    will require additional analysis and refinement prior to implementation.
    The Phase 2 projects will have higher costs and some ROW impacts.
    Also, concept development was completed for far-distant options along
    the corridor. These future development concepts will require even
    further revision and scrutiny prior to implementation.

    Traffic
    The same methodologies and approaches used to develop the existing
    conditions analysis were employed to analyze the recommended
    phases. The Synchro analysis performed for this study served as a
    screening methodology to develop alternatives. The Synchro results
    are not presented in this analysis as more detailed micro-simulation
    was completed. The VISSIM analysis served to improve confidence
    in the recommendations and to quantify the operational benefits that
    could be expected from these investments.

    Land Use
    For the traf fic analysis, it was assumed that the land use in the study
    area would remain generally unchanged for the existing and near-term
    scenarios. Since the ultimate land use and traf fic generation from the
    Bonanza Park redevelopment are still in development, the impacts of
    this planned development were not included in this analysis. A 5%
    growth was applied to the December 2010 traf fic counts to develop the
    near-term volumes. Longer range forecasts were not part of the project
    scope and were not analyzed in detail.

 under existing traf fic conditions. Additionally,
 reducing the congestion at Park Ave / Deer Valley
 Drive will result in substantial improvements at the
 other study intersections. These improvements
 are a direct result of queue reduction and improved
 progression. The Phase I improvements will
 also provide acceptable delay for the near term
 conditions, with all study intersections operating at
 LOS D or better. This suggests that Phase II may
 not be necessary in the near-term (5% growth).

 Improved pedestrian and vehicular safety
 Pedestrian and vehicular safety will be improved by
 re-aligning Lame Dog Dr., reducing curb-cut conflict
 points, reducing left turn access with landscape
 medians, improving pedestrian and bicycle trails
 and by installing a pedestrian tunnel at SR-224/
 Deer Valley Drive.

 Improved Aesthetics
 By detaching pedestrian trails, installing berms and
 more landscaping, reducing curb-cuts and installing
 landscaped medians, the corridor aesthetic will be
 improved. An enhanced gateway experience will be
 created and the proposed improvements will unify
 the look of the corridor by creating a setting that is
 more reflective of conditions that exist along SR-
 224 west of the study area.                              Figure 21. Proposed Phase I Street Section

Phase II Action Plan ­ SR-224/SR-248
Roundabout
Unlike Phase I projects, the Phase II projects
need to be integrated with the land use planning to
account for the subsequent new trips and/or new
circulation patterns that may result from the BOPA
redevelopment planning effort.

   · Assign new trips and traf fic patterns resulting
   from BOPA to the traf fic model;

   · Continue to work with UDOT Region Two traf fic
   staff to ensure project buy-in;

   · Conduct detailed engineering including traf fic,
   utilities, access, roadway layout.

   · Implement the plan

One of the most important recommended actions
is on-going coordination and communication with
UDOT staff. UDOT's involvement varies by specific
recommendation, but they will likely be involved
with all. Staff should continue to engage UDOT at
every opportunity. One strategy that has proven
successful in other areas is to schedule a working
group meeting quarterly with staff and UDOT and
keep a "to do" list, with assignments, current.

SR-224 CORRIDOR STUDY

Park City Transportation Master Plan
       GOALS:
           Park City will have a multimodal transportation system with complete streets and balanced
           availability of pedestrian, bicycle, transit and auto travel.
           Park City will have a complete and well-connected network of trails, bicycle lanes and side-
           walks.

       STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (designed to address the above goals by 2040):
           Changes to individual street cross sections will be addressed on a case by case basis but will
           put city-wide emphasis on providing "complete street" infastructure that supports walking,
           biking, transit, and carpools over single occupant vehicles.
           All of the primary bicycle corridors identified in the Park City Transportation Master Plan will
           completed and open to use.
           At least 75% of the linear mileage of secondary bicycle corridords identified in the Park City
           Master Plan will be completed and open to use.

           Park City will establish roadway automobile capacity trigger points on major roadways
           (commercial collectors and arterials) that will require a proactive review of the roadway cross
           section with emphasis on providing "complete streets" which improve serving balanced modes
           of users either directly on the corridor or on parallel corridors.

Walkability / Bikeable Neighborhood Study
  OBJECTIVE:
      Purpose of the study to "provide planning and design suggestions which will improve walking
      and biking in urban Park City. The intent is to establish a clear and detailed list of projects that
      will improve pedestrian and cyclist safety, connectivity and efficiency."


  5 OVERARCHING GOALS:
      Safety: increased biking and pedestrian safety
      Efficiency: reducing vehicle trips and/or mitigating traffic

      Enhance Regional Connections: improving regional mobility along SR-224 & 248, Bonanza
      Drive, rail trail and other significant regional links

       We have evaluated the crash history for the subject section of SR-224 for the three-year period
of 2007 through 2009, with the following results:

        Crash data indicates that the crash rate of this section of SR-224 is higher than the expected and
the severity is lower than the expected. The predominant crash types are listed in table I above. The
total number of crashes had decreases of 9.5% and 42.1% for the years 2008 and 2009, respectively;
the crash rate also had decreases of 6.5 % and 26.1% for same years; the severity index showed a
similar trend with decreases of 7.6 % and 11.9% for 2008 and 2009, respectively.

       The time periods from 12:00 noon to 3:00 pm and from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm were the ones
where most crashes occurred with 24.5% and 29.4%, respectively; for the day of the week, Wednesdays
and Thursdays had the highest percentage of crash occurrence with 18.6% and 19.6%, respectively;
with regards to weather conditions, 63.7% of crashes took place in dry conditions, 14.7% in cloudy
conditions and 15.7% in snowy conditions; for roadway surface conditions, 65.7% occurred in dry
pavement conditions, 11.8% in rainy conditions, 18.8% in snowy/icy conditions. Percentages that are
missing for the last two parameters were coded as unknown or invalid.

       Most of the rear end crashes were concentrated at various intersections and their main
contributing factor was "following too closely"; approximately 55.2% of these crashes occurred in dry
weather conditions, 31.0% in snowy conditions and 13.8% in rainy conditions.

       Right angle crashes were also concentrated mostly at intersections and a few others at business
accesses. The main contributing factors for these crashes were `failure to yield the right-of-way' at non-


                                                                                                     Appendix | 111
  signalized intersections or business accesses and `disregard the traffic signal' at signalized
  intersections.

          Left turn crashes were also concentrated at intersections and their main contributing factor was
  `failure to yield the right-of-way'; the greatest percentage of these crashes occurred at the intersection
  of SR-224 and Bonanza Dr., with 40% total.

         Sideswipe same direction crashes were scattered through the boundaries of this corridor and
  were all caused by an improper lane change maneuver on the part of the offending driver.

          The occurrence of single vehicle crashes is depicted in Table II below, broken down by crash
  type, number of crashes, and percent of single vehicle crashes:

  Table II; SINGLE VEHICLE CRASHES
                 CRASH TYPE                        No.           % OF SINGLE VEH. CRASHES
  Run Off The Road to the Right                     7                          43.8
  Pedestrian Related                                4                          25.0
  Bicycle Related                                   3                          18.8
  Wildlife Related                                  2                          12.4
  TOTAL                                            16                         100.0%

          All of the crashes where vehicles ran off the road were caused by excessive speed. The fixed
  objects most commonly struck were signal poles and mailboxes or fire hydrants.

          The majority of the pedestrian and bicycle crashes (5 or 71.4%) occurred within a 400 feet
  stretch of road from MP 5.83 to MP 5.91 or mostly in the area between Iron Horse Drive and Home
  Steak Road; the 2 highest severities were a 4 and the 2 lowest were a 1, with the average being 2.71
  (there were 3 crashes with severity 3).

           We recommend that a comprehensive study be undertaken to develop various alternatives for
  improvements that can be implemented in this urban area, which is fully developed. Areas of concern
  should include any type of improvements that can be made to the existing signal systems, signal
  coordination, and pedestrian improvements; additionally, the study should consider alternatives to
  develop an Access Management Plan that would consider the combining of various business accesses,
  as this type of existing scenario (based on the analysis of crash data) contributes to a large number of
  crashes, both vehicular and pedestrian related.

          Source documents are available at the Division of Traffic and Safety for additional analysis. If
  questions arise, please call me at 801-965-4045.

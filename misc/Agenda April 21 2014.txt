30   his annual water bill will be over $1,500 dollars, residents are having a difficult time managing their
31   income now, although State law allows the tax, the Enterprise community cannot vote for City
32   Commissioners which seems like taxation without representation, and he is against the 25% surcharge.

20   a change to a zoning application, and Mrs. Vose replied that a Quasi-judicial hearing is equivalent to a court

23   property from information presented during the meeting.

32   access from Saxon Boulevard having to meet Volusia County requirements, mast arm installation becoming a

     Regular City Commission Meeting
     April 7, 2014
     Page 5 of 8


 1   The Commission and staff discussed Lot No. 1 currently being zoned C-1 commercial use under the
 2   MPUD and Florida Hospital being able to build on Lot No.1, the curve in Saxon Boulevard prior to
 3   Lot No. 2 not being the best location for non-residential to build, local roads feeding to I4, travel
 4   speed and traffic mobility design in the area, placing a traffic light in the area to help control traffic
 5   flow and speed, a traffic light at Saxon Boulevard and Sterling Park Boulevard being a must, types
 6   of non-residential uses of the lots under the current MPUD, no hourly operation restrictions under
 7   the current MPUD, current height restrictions being 36 feet or three (3) stories, responsibility for
 8   repair and maintenance of sidewalks being transferred to property owners when property is sold,
 9   buffer wall location for Lot No. 1, access to Lot No. 2 and 4 would be off Alabaster Way and Saxon
10   Boulevard, the City not being able to deny a retail grocery store to be built on Lot No. 1 as long as it
11   fits into the MPUD zoning requirements and the ramifications if the Commission turns down such a
12   request, the Commission addressing the issue of rezoning only and not whether a Wal-Mart is being
13   built or not, joint access being on Saxon Boulevard, the City would work with Volusia County's
14   traffic engineers on the timing of when a traffic light would be installed, requiring a construction
15   access point, the City's prerogative to place a requirement in a development agreement to requir e a
16   traffic light be installed before construction begins, whether or not to put amendments in the motion,
17   a PUD being a negotiated developers agreement, Florida Fish Memorial Hospital being committed to
18   coming to Deltona, having an executed contract with the developer for Lot No. 1, but can build on
19   either lot location, Florida Hospital's current contract being tied to and dependent on the requested
20   BPUD, reasons for the requirement of eight (8) foot wide sidewalks as compared to five (5) foot
21   sidewalks, the traffic study being 4,700 not 47,000 cars a day, having a median on Saxon Boulevard
22   to allow cross access which saves having to put in one (1) entrance in the area, and emergency
23   vehicle access not being affected by the proposed BPUD.
24
25   Mrs. Vose stated that because the Commission members are participating in a Quasi-judicial hearing
26   any ex parte communication received by the Commission needed to be disclosed. The Commission
27   discussed types of communications received and that the Commission providing no responses to
28   those communications, and any meetings attended that may have been germane to the rezoning.
29   Also discussed was the Commission only basing their decision on what was discussed at the public
30   hearing and what procedure to use for approving or disapproving the motion, making a motion for
31   Option No.2 to include modified amendments discussed at the public hearing, and discussing the
32   details of a development agreement at a workshop.
33
34   The Commission discussed when to have a traffic light installed and working out the installation
35   with Volusia County, installation of a mast arm traffic light being preferred and fitting better into the
36   ascetics of the community, addressing certain issues during a final site plan application, eight (8)
37   foot sidewalks being a must, the pros and cons of businesses being allowed to operate for 24 hours,
38   Wal-Mart acting irresponsible and inappropriately by putting a sign up and posting to their webpage
39   that a Wal-Mart store was coming to Saxon Boulevard, which gave residents a false impression that
40   a deal had already been made, and concerns about addressing area resident's issues.
41
42   Motion by Commissioner Nabicht, seconded by Vice Mayor Herzberg to approve Ordinance
43   No. 02-2014, a rezoning of the Saxon-Sterling Silver lots 1, 2, and 4 from MPUD to BPUD, to
44   include the following modified amendments to the Development Agreement: mast arm traffic
45   signal, eight (8) foot wide sidewalk(s) along Saxon Boulevard, address hours of operation at the
46   time of the Final Site Plan, and only Option 2 of the Master Development Plan, at first reading.

                              AGENDA MEMO


TO:       Mayor & City Commission               AGENDA DATE: 4/21/2014

FROM:     William D. Denny, City Manager        AGENDA ITEM: 8 - A

SUBJECT: Public Hearing - Ordinance No. 04-2014, Zoning Map Amendment (RZ13-009)
         for eleven (11) parcels located at the northeast corner of the Saxon
         Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection, at second and final reading.


LOCATION:               Located at the northeast corner of Saxon Boulevard
                        and Finland Drive.

BACKGROUND:             The subject site includes an assemblage of eleven (11)
                        parcels with Office Residential (OR) or Public (P) zoning
                        designations. The applicant proposes a rezoning of those
                        tracts from OR and P to C-2 (General Commercial), which
                        could accommodate a range of commercial land uses. The
                        applicant desires to perform the rezoning action to
                        accommodate a gas station with a convenience store, as
                        proposed.

                        The proposed rezoning is consistent with the Comprehensive
                        Plan for the general health, safety, welfare of the City and
                        furthers Deltona's economic development and employment
                        goals. The proposed rezoning to C-2 is located along a City
                        thoroughfare, as defined in the Comprehensive Plan, is near
                        a major interstate interchange, is similar to existing C-2
                        zoning designations to the east and west of the site, and
                        promotes a non-residential tax base that is predominantly
                        reliant upon residential land uses.

                        Because the rezoning request is for conventional zoning (C-
                        2), the zoning action is for the application of the C-
                        2 regulations to the subject site. While a gas station with
                        convenience store is the desired use for this rezoning
                        application, any permitted or conditional C-2 land use could
                        be development on-site with the established Citywide
                        standards for that zoning district. The Planning and Zoning
                        Board and local residents had concerns with access
                        management, site grading, area-wide drainage patterns, and
                        neighborhood compatibility, which will be addressed at the
                        site plan level. Finally, the City Commission unanimously
                        voted to approve Ordinance No. 04-2014, at first reading, on

                                           34                                   Item 8A

   the development of intensive commercial areas that provide a wide range of non-
   residential goods and services, located and adjoining at least one major collector or
   arterial road. The C-2 classification is intended to be applied to strip-retail areas,
   Interstate Highway interchange areas, and other intersections that are characterized by
   high traffic volumes appropriate for highway-oriented commercial development and
   shopping centers. This district is not intended to be applied within established residential
   areas or areas of lesser intensity; except when those areas are either in transition, blighted,
   or designated in the Commercial future land use category on the adopted Future Land Use
   Map, as it may be amended from time to time.

D. Back Ground:
   The subject property is proposed to be rezoned based on an application to accommodate
   an automobile service station, type C (fueling station with convenience store). However,
   the proposed zoning amendment is for conventional zoning to C-2 and any of the land
   uses listed within that district (see Section 110-316 of the Code of Ordinances) would
   have the potential to be development on the subject site whether a permitted or
   conditional uses. Conditional uses on-site can only be approved through additional City
   Commission action. Thus, this zoning application is requesting the ability to allow for a
   range of land uses and development rights on the assembled parcels that despite the use
   included with the zoning application could be changed by the applicant.

   Since the area-wide rezoning event in this corridor several years ago, this is one of the
   first redevelopment activities located along Saxon Boulevard between I-4 and Normandy
   Boulevard in nearly a decade. The prospect of this development has created interest by
   others in redeveloping the Saxon Boulevard corridor, as evidenced through increased due
   diligence activity. The proposed rezoning at this location has also supported a study to
   extend/upgrade sewer service from the Saxon Boulevard interchange to the Fisher Water
   Reclamation Facility. The sanitary sewer installation would facilitate more commercial
   development opportunities in the area.

F. Matters for Consideration:
   Section 110-1101, Code of City Ordinances, states that the City shall consider the following
   matters when reviewing applications for amendments to the Official Zoning Map:

   1. Whether it is consistent with all adopted elements of the Comprehensive Plan.
      The amendment to the Official Zoning Map will not diminish the vision of the goals
      or the policies of the Comprehensive Plan. The current future land use designation for
      the site is Commercial. The C-2 zoning is consistent with the Commercial future land
      use designation.

   2. Its impact upon the environment or natural resources.
      The subject property along the roads is developed with single family residences and
      the interior portion is undeveloped with a mixture of palms and scrub oaks. There is a
      depressional area in this portion of the property featuring steep slopes that appears to
      be a sinkhole. Water is ponded at the bottom of this area and exhibits wetland
      characteristics. The wetland is likely less than one-third of an acre and development
      within the wetland may be considered exempt under Chapter 98 of the City Land
      Development Code. The soils on-site are well-drained and classified as Paola Fine
      Sand. According to the February 19, 2014, a FEMA flood zone map, the subject
      property is not located within the 100 year floodplain.

       The site is home to a variety of small animals, such as rabbits, armadillos, squirrels,
       etc. that are tolerant of developed areas. Burrows were observed on the site; however,
       it was unclear if they were created by gopher tortoises. Before property development,
       the applicant will to need to survey the site for gopher tortoises and permit and
       relocate them to a suitable mitigation bank site, if any are present on-site. There are
       no other known listed species that utilize the property.

   3. Its impact upon the economy of any affected area.
      The proposed impact upon the local economy would be the creation of retail
      commercial jobs and an increase in the non-residential tax base for the City. The
      proposed rezoning may facilitate retail commercial development on nearby sites,
      given its visible location. The area utilized for existing residential uses is impacted by
      the close proximity to the interchange and the high volumes of traffic along Saxon
      Boulevard and Finland Drive.

       Further, that portion of the property zoned (P) Public, formerly owned by the City and
       sold to the applicant, has not generated commercial property taxes while in City
       control. Therefore, the rezoning to the requested C-2 would result in the property
       being zoned consistent with C-2 zoning to the east and west of the site, existing
       commercial uses in the area, and taxed at a commercial rate. Commercial uses will
       generate employment, lower the City's unemployment rate, and utilize the visible
       corner to match the adjacent roadway network.




                                                                                    Page 9 of 14

                                                                                   Attachment number 2 \nPage 10




4. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article XIV of the Land Development Code,
   Ordinance No. 92-25 [Chapter 86, Code of Ordinances] as it may be amended
   from time to time, its impact upon necessary governmental services, such as
   schools, sewage disposal, potable water, drainage, fire and police protection,
   solid waste or transportation systems.

   a. Schools: The Volusia County School Board staff has indicated that this rezoning
      will not affect local schools.

   b. Sewage Disposal: City sewer capacity is available at the central sewer plant.
      However, suitable transmission lines are more the quarter mile away that are
      required for development. Therefore, the site will be served by an on-site septic
      system in the interim, until central sewer service is available. The City is currently
      undertaking a feasibility study to provide sewer to this area. The sewer system
      will be required to be installed as `dry', until central sewer service becomes
      available.

   c. Potable Water: Deltona Water will serve the site and sufficient potable water
      capacity is available.

   d. Drainage: All site related stormwater will be managed on-site and will be
      constructed in accordance with the necessary requirements of the City's Land
      Development Code and other permitting agencies. Off-site drainage impacts will
      also be designed and engineered for site permitting.

   e. Transportation Systems: The subject property is located near the intersection of
      Interstate 4 and Saxon Boulevard; a congested area. The segment of Saxon
      Boulevard (I-4 to Normandy Boulevard) adjacent to the subject site is operating at
      a Level of Service "F". A Level of Service (LOS) "F" indicates that vehicle flow
      is sometimes halted by heavy traffic volumes typically at peak hours (morning and
      evening rush hours). The current traffic condition of the Saxon Boulevard
      segment from I-4 to Normandy Boulevard, at peak hours, has very slow speeds,
      limited maunverabilty, turn-lane storage issues, and occasionally grid-lock at AM
      and PM peak hours.

      The Comprehensive Plan has established a policy that the LOS on City
      thoroughfares generally should not be allowed to operate below a LOS of
      E. A level of service (LOS) E represents the maximization of the important and
      expensive public resource of roads. From a user standpoint, a roadway facility
      operates at a LOS E represents flowing traffic, at times below the speed limit and
      limited maneuvering opportunity. The purpose of implementing LOS standards is
      to maintain a level of mobility within the City. Mobility is critical to ensuring
      convenient travel throughout the City. However, LOS standards, while being a




                                                                               Page 10 of 14

                                         49                                        Item 8A
                                                                          Attachment number 2 \nPage 11




good way to quantifiably maintain and protect roadway capacity, can result in the
limitation of land use opportunity offered by major thoroughfares.

At the same time, traffic volume is used an indicator by potential businesses for
site selection. This dichotomy of commercial uses looking for heavy traffic
volumes to support viable business and a local government establishing a policy
to protect roadway capacity counters each other. The City has a policy provision
accommodate redevelopment of areas before public roadway improvements are
made and contemplates traffic volumes above the LOS E threshold, as follows:

Policy CIE1-1.4
The determination of concurrency for backlogged facilities, included in the
Thoroughfare System segments shall be consistent with the revised Land
Development Regulations and established in the following manner:
9J-5.016(3)(c)(1,3,4&6):
a. Establish Benchmark Traffic Counts
The most recent twenty-four hour traffic counts taken prior to the adoption of this
Comprehensive Plan shall be used as the benchmark counts for each backlogged
road identified in the Transportation Element.

b. Set Percent Thresholds of Benchmark Traffic Counts
Each of these backlogged thoroughfare roads shall not be allowed to degrade its
operational service standards on a peak hour basis (using the most recent
sanction FDOT Highway Capacity Tables) by allowing no more than twenty (20)
percent of the peak hour bench mark counts for such facilities in The City. Some
backlogged thoroughfare roads will only be allowed to be degraded ten (10) or
fifteen (15) percent from the adopted Level of Service.

c. Track Development - Trip Generation/Distribution
The City shall track all proposed new developments and based on generally
accepted traffic modeling procedures identify the likely number of trips generated
by such developments and their distribution specifically for this objective to the
previously identified backlogged thoroughfare roads. Tracking shall start upon
the Comprehensive Plan's effective date of the revised Land Development
Regulations.

d. Tracking on a Cumulative Basis
This tracking of the additional trips to the twenty percent threshold of the
benchmark counts and trips originating within the boundaries of the Future
Transportation Map shall be done on a cumulative basis following the adoption
of this plan.




                                                                      Page 11 of 14

                                 50                                       Item 8A
                                                                           Attachment number 2 \nPage 12




e. Cumulative Thresholds Twenty, Fifteen and Ten Percent
The City shall not approve any additional final development orders, (excluding
vested properties) including building permits, once the percent threshold for
projects that would generate trips in excess of ten/fifteen/twenty percent on a peak
hour basis; unless a final development order is subject to the adoption and
implementation of an Area-wide Traffic Action Mitigation Plan. An Area-wide
Traffic Action Mitigation Plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following
activities: additional or modified turn lanes; additional or modified signalization;
incentives for mass transit use where available; incentives for van/carpooling
programs; promote staggered work hours; or operating lanes.

f. It shall be the goal of each Area-wide Traffic Action Mitigation Plan to achieve
100 percent mitigation of the impacts of a proposed development.
Such plans shall include, when applicable, participants in addition to the property
owner or applicant in question such as but not limited to adjacent property owners
and business establishments.

While this policy indicates capacity on a City thoroughfare roadway may be
allowed to exceed a LOS E by up to 20%, there is a requirement for traffic
mitigation. According to policy CIE1-1.4, mitigation options include, but are not
limited to, access management in the form of modified turn lanes. The access
management element of this policy will be implemented during the City land
development review phase. According to the applicant's traffic impact analysis
submitted as part of this rezoning request, a Saxon Boulevard right-in and right-
out access to the site is proposed for Saxon Boulevard. This right-in right-out on
Saxon Boulevard does not comport with the City Land Development Code
driveway spacing requirements. The right-in, right-out will also result in more
turning maneuvers on Saxon Boulevard More turning on the Saxon Boulevard
thoroughfare further constraining traffic flow and creating safety problems. The
safety problems with the right-in, right-out are more acute when traffic speeds,
road curvature and limited sight distances associated with the subject segment of
Saxon Boulevard are factored.

A significant component regarding access to the site will be a driveway cut-off of
Finland Drive. According to the City Land Development Code, the entrance
should be no closer than 250 feet to the intersection of Saxon Boulevard and
Finland Drive. The intent of the 250 foot separation is to protect the flow and
function of major intersections. This distance will be needed along Finland Drive.

Lot 33 along Finland Drive and adjacent to the subject site is owned by the seller
of this land assemblage, but has elected to exclude this parcel from sale and, thus
the rezoning application. This exclusion will affect access management and
design of the subject site for any future development. For this rezoning
application, the applicant cannot elect to include Lot 33 without reapplying and



                                                                       Page 12 of 14

                                  51                                       Item 8A
                                                                              Attachment number 2 \nPage 13




going back through the Planning and Zoning Board, because the legal description
associated with due public notice does not include Lot 33.

The applicant prepared a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) with this application that
included a proposed fueling facility with convenience store use. As proposed, this
use will generate 3,256 trips per day, which is a significant amount of new trip-
ends on a failing segment of Saxon Boulevard. However, with the City's ability to
accommodate LOS thresholds to facilitate redevelopment (per policy CIE 1-1.4),
the Saxon Boulevard LOS could be exceeded by up to 20%. The proposed project,
along with background traffic, would create a condition where Saxon Boulevard
operates at an LOS E + 6.9%. To assist in relief of over-capacity of roadways,
Votran transit transportation is also available via bus routes 23. In summary, the
applicant will be required to design the subject site to be safe, functional, and
compatible to off-set transportation impacts in the area.

5. Any changes in circumstances or conditions affecting the area.
In Deltona, the Saxon Boulevard corridor has remained unchanged for some time
now. Volusia County is preforming major renovations to the Orange City side of
Saxon Boulevard on the other side of I-4. As stated, the City has hired a
consultant to study the feasibility of installing a sewer transmission line to the area
to serve commercial development along Saxon Boulevard from Normandy
Boulevard to the I-4 interchange.

6. Any mistakes in the original classification.
No known mistakes.

7. Its effect upon the public health, welfare, safety or morals.
Early in its history, the City changed the City Future Land Use Map for residential
properties along Saxon Boulevard between I-4 and Normandy Boulevard from a
residential land use category to Commercial to stimulate economic and non-
residential development within this urban corridor. Aside of the current platting
and existing residential development pattern, the change to Commercial on the
Future Land Use Map represents a City policy that is desirous of adjacent land
uses to be placed in strategic locations along accommodating roadways and near
interchanges. The City followed the policy action by administratively rezoning the
area to both C-2 and OR to transition the neighborhood from predominantly
residential to commercial and office uses.

While residential uses currently dominate the existing land use pattern, the
roadways, zoning designations, and future utility potential indicates that the area
is designed to accommodate commercial and office uses. Walgreens at the
northwest corner of Saxon Boulevard and Normandy Boulevard is one of the first
redevelopment conversions in the area, as an example. This incremental
conversion has impacts on the existing residential areas, in the form of traffic,



                                                                          Page 13 of 14

                                   52                                         Item 8A
                                                                                        Attachment number 2 \nPage 14




        signage, light and noise pollution. The effort is to accommodate and mitigate
        those impacts to the greatest extent possible, while providing for business and
        economic opportunity appropriate and strategic areas of the City.

        The OR zoning category is consistent with the underlying Commercial future land
        use designation, but predominantly commercial uses are not allowed in the OR
        zoning district. The subject property is under unified control, making development
        activity viable on the site. Therefore, the proposed C-2 designation would be
        appropriate to facilitate redevelopment for commercial uses on-site and is
        consistent and compatible with C-2 both east and west of the assembled tract.
        Rezoning the property to C-2 would represent a logical extension of the C-2
        zoning.

CONCLUSION/STAFF RECOMMENDATION:
The proposed rezoning is consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan goals for
economic development, employment, and general public health, welfare, and safety. The
requested C-2 zoning will support commercial development at this location, in proximity to
the Interstate 4 interchange and along the existing Saxon Boulevard urban corridor. The
proposed rezoning represents an incremental improvement of the City tax base, which is
predominantly reliant on low density residential land uses. The potential for commercial
development at this location is anticipated to facilitate more options to serve Deltona residents.
Therefore, staff recommends approval of the rezoning application from OR and P to C-2.

INTRODUCTION
Traffic Engineering Data Solutions, Inc. (TEDS) has been retained to conduct a traffic
impact analysis for the proposed RaceTrac gas station in the northeast quadrant of the
Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection in the City of Deltona, Florida (see Figure
1). The proposed gas station will include 20 vehicle fueling positions along with a 5,928
square-foot convenience store. A preliminary site plan of the proposed development is
included in the Appendix.

This study, which evaluates the overall impact of the development on the adjacent
roadway network, was prepared to meet the City of Deltona's transportation
concurrency requirements. This study was conducted in accordance with the approved
methodology as provided in the Appendix.



PROJECT ACCESS
Access to the proposed development is proposed via three driveways. Driveway #1, a
full access driveway, will be located on Finland Drive Williamson Boulevard
approximately 130 feet north of Saxon Boulevard. Driveway #2 is a proposed right-
in/right-out driveway on Saxon Boulevard approximately 230 feet east of Finland Drive.
It is proposed to have a westbound right-turn lane on Saxon Boulevard at Driveway #2.
Another full-access driveway, Driveway #3, is also proposed on Apache Circle
approximately 130 feet north of Saxon Boulevard.


STUDY AREA
Because the proposed development is projected to generate between 100 and 300 PM
peak-hour trips, the study area was determined based upon a three-percent level of
significance as consistent with the Volusia TPO Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA)
Guidelines. However, as summarized in the methodology, the development impact will
not exceed three percent on any of the adjacent roadways. Regardless, the following
roadways were analyzed.

      Saxon Boulevard from Interstate 4 to Finland Drive
      Saxon Boulevard from Finland Drive to Normandy Boulevard
      Finland Drive south of Saxon Boulevard
      Finland Drive north of Saxon Boulevard
      Apache Circle

The study intersections include the following:

      Saxon Boulevard at Finland Drive
      Saxon Boulevard at Apache Circle
      All access point intersections with public streets

EXISTING CONDITIONS
For purposes of this study, a PM peak-period turning movement count, from 4:00 PM to
6:00 PM, was conducted at the Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection as well as at
Apache Circle. Figure 2 summarizes the existing PM peak-hour turning movement
volumes at the study intersections. Printout of the traffic counts are provided in the
Appendix.

The PM peak-hour two-way volumes on the roadway segments were calculated from
the PM peak-hour turning movement volumes shown in Figure 2. These volumes were
then compared against the generalized service volume for each study roadway
segment. The generalized peak-hour two-way service volume for each roadway
segment was obtained from FDOT's 2012 Generalized Service Volume tables based on
the adopted level of service standards from the City of Deltona's Comprehensive Plan.
Table 1 below shows the adopted level of service and generalized service volume
under the adopted level of service for each study roadway segment. As shown in Table
1, the existing PM peak-hour two-way volumes for all study roadway segments are
below the generalized service volume, thereby indicating that all roadway segments
currently have acceptable operating conditions.

The PM peak-hour existing operating conditions for the Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive
intersection were evaluated using the Highway Capacity Software (HCS) 2010 which
utilizes analysis methodologies contained in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual. The
existing PM peak-hour turning movement volumes, existing roadway geometry, and
existing signal timings were utilized in the analyses. Based on the HCS analyses, the
Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection currently operates acceptably with an
overall intersection level of service of C (average delay of 33.5 seconds/vehicle). The
unsignalized intersection of Saxon Boulevard/Apache Circle was also analyzed using
HCS 2010. Based on the analysis the southbound approach and eastbound left-turn
movement both currently operate acceptably at level of service B. HCS printouts are
provided in the Appendix.

    FUTURE BACKGROUND TRAFFIC
    Future background traffic is the non-project-related traffic projected to utilize the study
    roadways and intersections. For the purposes of this analysis, trips from the proposed
    Saxon Sterling Silver retail development and the proposed Halifax Medical walk-in clinic
    (5,037 square feet) were added to the existing traffic volumes to obtain the future
    background traffic volumes on the study roadways and intersections. The trips from the
    Saxon Sterling Silver development were obtained from Transportation Impact Analysis
    dated November 2013 as prepared by CPH. The trips for the Halifax Medical clinic
    were calculated using ITE and assigning the trips to the study roadways. The resulting
    future background turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 3. Supporting
    documentation regarding vested trip information is provided in the Appendix.

    The future background PM peak-hour bi-directional volumes on the study roadway
    segments were calculated based on the volumes in Figure 3 and are summarized in
    Table 2. The resulting annual growth rates from the vested trips were then calculated.
    Based on the vested trips, the resulting annual growth rate on Saxon Boulevard ranges
    between 7% and 8%. In reviewing the County's historical traffic data on Saxon
    Boulevard as maintained on the County website, this level of growth is conservatively
    high as traffic volumes over the last 5 years have been stagnant and/or decreased.
    Relative to the resulting growth on Finland Drive, current historical data is not available.
    However, recognizing that these roadways essentially serve areas that are built out, the
    resulting annual growth rate of 2% south of Finland Drive and 13% north of Finland
    Drive are conservatively high. As for Apache Circle, no traffic growth is expected.
    Table 2 shows the future background PM peak-hour two-way volumes on the study
    roadway segments.

    TRIP GENERATION
    The number of vehicle trips that will originate from, or are destined to, a development is
    dependent upon the type and amount of land uses contained within that development.
    The total daily and PM peak-hour trip generation potential for the development was
    determined based on trip generation equations and rates provided in the Institute of
    Transportation Engineer's (ITE) Informational Report, Trip Generation, 9th Edition. For
    the proposed development, ITE Land Use Code 945 (Gas Station with Convenience
    Store) was used. As summarized in Table 3, the proposed development is projected to
    generate 3,256 total daily trips and 270 total PM peak-hour trips (135 in, 135 out).

    In order to determine the net effect of the proposed development on the future road
    system, the trip generation volumes need to be adjusted to consider the effects of pass-
    by trips. Pass-by trips are those trips that will stop at the site while traveling by the site
    on the adjacent roadways. Because pass-by trips are effectively vehicles that are
    already on the roadway, pass-by trips do not create any new impacts on the adjacent
    roadway segments. Pass-by trips for the gas station were calculated based on the
    pass-by rate of 56% for ITE Land Use Code 945 (Gas Station with Convenience Store)
    as provided in ITE's Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition. Of the total trip generation
    potential of the site, 151 PM peak-hour trips (76 in, 75 out) are expected to be pass-by
    trips. The Volusia TPO's TIA Guidelines limit pass-by trips to 14% of the background
    traffic on the adjacent streets. Based on Figure 3, the future background traffic on
    Saxon Boulevard adjacent to the site is 3,272 PM trips, of which 14% equates to 458
    trips. Therefore, the 151 pass-by trips as shown in Table 3 are acceptable. As
    summarized in Table 3, the proposed development is projected to generate 119 new
    external PM peak-hour trips (59 in, 60 out).

  TRIP DISTRIBUTION
  The trip distribution pattern defines the primary corridors that will be traveled by the
  traffic generated by the project. By reviewing the land use types in the vicinity of the
  site, proximity to competing sites such as the existing RaceTrac service station on the
  west side of Interstate 4, and applying engineering judgment with regard to the
  interaction with the project, a trip distribution pattern for the net new external trips was
  estimated. The trip distribution is shown in Figure 4.


  TRIP ASSIGNMENT
  The new external PM peak-hour project trips were assigned to the study roadways and
  intersections based on the trip distribution. Recognizing that the site will directly access
  on to Apache Circle, 25% of those trips traveling to the site from Normandy Boulevard
  north of Saxon Boulevard were assigned to Apache Circle. As for the 70% exiting the
  site to travel east, it is estimated that approximately 25% of these trips will instead use
  Apache Circle.

  Pass-by trips were also assigned to the project driveways and study intersections.
  However, the assignment of pass-by trips considered the volume of traffic on the
  roadways adjacent to the site, ease of access to the site for each direction of travel, as
  well as the consideration of other service stations in close proximity to the proposed
  development. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the PM peak-hour new external trips and
  pass-by trips, respectively, assigned to the study intersections.

  The project trips were then added to the future background traffic volumes to arrive at
  the total future PM peak-hour volumes for both the roadway segments and
  intersections. Figure 7 shows the total (year 2014) PM peak-hour turning movement

FUTURE CONDITIONS ANALYSIS
The PM peak-hour operating conditions of the roadway segments were analyzed by
comparing total projected PM peak-hour two-way segment volumes to each roadway's
generalized service volume. As summarized in Table 4, the projected volumes on all
study roadway segments are below the generalized service volumes, with the exception
of Saxon Boulevard between Interstate 4 and Finland Drive and between Finland Drive
and Normandy Boulevard. However, it should be noted that future background volumes
on these two same roadway segments also exceed the generalized service volume
thereby indicating that the deficiency is trigger by background traffic. Because a
development is not required to mitigate deficiencies triggered by background traffic, the
proposed development is not required to mitigate these deficiencies on Saxon
Boulevard. All other study roadway segments are projected to have acceptable
operating conditions in year 2014 at build out of the proposed RaceTrac gas station.

The PM peak-hour operating conditions of the Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive
intersection were analyzed at build out of the proposed development in year 2014 using
HCS 2010 and the projected turning movements. Based on the HCS analysis, this
intersection is projected to operate acceptably at overall level of service D (average
delay of 40.0 seconds/vehicle) at build out of the proposed RaceTrac gas station. The
HCS printout is provided in the Appendix. Despite the intersection being shown to
operate at an acceptable level of service, the developer is proposing to construct a
southbound right-turn lane at the Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection to
enhance operating conditions at the intersection. Based on the evaluation provided in
the Appendix, the project trips will increase the critical movement volume at the
intersection by 8 PM peak-hour trips. However, the addition of a southbound right-turn
lane increases the capacity of the critical movement sum by 92 PM peak-hour trips,
thereby substantially offsetting the project's impact. Recognizing that the proposed
improvement provides a capacity enhancement to City/County facilities, the engineering
and construction costs for such improvement should be creditable against the project's
transportation impact fees.

The unsignalized study intersections were also analyzed using HCS 2010 and the future
turning movement volumes. As summarized in Table 5, all movements at the
unsignalized intersections are projected to operate with acceptable levels of service.
HCS printouts are provided in the Appendix.

CRITICAL/NEAR-CRITICAL ROADWAY SEGMENTS
A critical, near critical and hurricane critical roadway segment is one where the existing
daily volume is 90 percent or more of a roadway's service volume at the adopted LOS
standard. The Volusia TPO Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines specifies that
convenience store developments are to analyze such roadways that are located within a
one-mile radius. As conveyed in the approved methodology, due to the fact that
another RaceTrac gas station is located on the west of the Saxon Boulevard/Interstate 4
interchange, no roadways will be evaluated west of I-95 as motorists would be expected
to use that RaceTrac service station. The only other critical/near-critical roadway
located within a one-mile radius is Saxon Boulevard between Interstate 4 and
Normandy Boulevard. However, these roadway segments were already evaluated in a
prior section of this study. Therefore, no other roadways are analyzed as part of this
section.

CONCLUSIONS
Traffic Engineering Data Solutions, Inc. (TEDS) was retained to analyze the projected
traffic impact for a proposed RaceTrac gas station proposed in the northeast quadrant
of the Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection in Deltona, Florida.

Based on the analyses, the existing PM peak-hour two-way volumes for all study
roadway segments are below the generalized service volume, thereby indicating that all
roadway segments currently have acceptable operating conditions. Additionally, the
Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection currently operates acceptably with an
overall intersection level of service (LOS) of D during the PM peak hour. Also, the
southbound approach and eastbound left-turn movement at the Saxon
Boulevard/Apache Circle intersection both currently operate acceptably at level of
service B.

At build out of the proposed RaceTrac in 2014, the projected volumes on all study
roadway segments are below the generalized service volumes, with the exception of
Saxon Boulevard between Interstate 4 and Finland Drive and between Finland Drive
and Normandy Boulevard. However, it should be noted that future background volumes
on these two same roadway segments also exceed the generalized service volume
thereby indicating that the deficiency is trigger by background traffic. Because a
development is not required to mitigate deficiencies triggered by background traffic, the
proposed development is not required to mitigate these deficiencies on Saxon
Boulevard. All other study roadway segments are projected to have acceptable
operating conditions in year 2014 at build out of the proposed RaceTrac gas station.

The Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive intersection is projected to operate acceptably at
LOS D at build out of the proposed development in 2014. Despite the intersection being
shown to operate at an acceptable level of service, the developer is proposing to
construct a southbound right-turn lane at the Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive
intersection to enhance operating conditions at the intersection. The addition of a
southbound right-turn lane substantially offsets the project's impact. Recognizing that
the proposed improvement provides a capacity enhancement to City/County facilities,
the engineering and construction costs for such improvement should be creditable
against the project's transportation impact fees.

With regard to the unsignalized intersections, all movements at the project driveways
and the Saxon Boulevard/Apache Circle intersection are projected to operate
acceptably at build out of the proposed RaceTrac service station in 2014.

Introduction

Traffic Engineering Data Solutions, Inc. (TEDS) has been retained to conduct a traffic impact analysis
for the proposed RaceTrac gas station in the northeast quadrant of the Saxon Boulevard/Finland Drive
intersection in the City of Deltona, Florida (see Figure 1). The proposed gas station will include 24
vehicle fueling positions along with a 5,928 square-foot convenience store. A preliminary site plan of
the proposed development is attached. This letter summarizes the methodology for the City of Deltona
concurrency study and for the Volusia County Use Permit Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA).

Project Access

Access to the proposed development is proposed via three driveways. One full access driveway is
proposed on Finland Drive approximately 120 feet north of Saxon Boulevard. A right-in/right-out
driveway is proposed on Saxon Boulevard approximately 185 feet east of Finland Drive. A full ingress
and right-out egress access driveway is proposed on Apache Road, approximately 110 feet north of
Saxon Boulevard.

Trip Generation

The total daily and PM peak-hour trip generation potential for the development was determined based
on trip generation equations and rates provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineer's (ITE)
Information Report, Trip Generation, 9th Edition. For the gas station with convenience market, Land
Use Code 945 (Gas Station with Convenience Store) was used. As summarized in Table 1, the
proposed development is projected to generate 3,908 total daily trips and 324 total PM peak-hour trips
(162 in, 162 out).

Pass-by trips for the gas station were calculated based on the pass-by rate of 56% for Land Use Code
945 (Gas Station with Convenience Store) as provided in ITE's Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition.
Of the total trip generation potential of the site, 181 PM peak-hour trips (91 in, 90 out) are expected to
be pass-by trips. As summarized in Table 1, the proposed development is projected to generate 143
new external PM peak-hour trips (71 in, 72 out).

In addition to the trip generation calculations above, a trip generation comparison will also be provided
for the maximum development intensity allowed under both the approved and existing zoning for the
parcels of the site.

Trip Distribution & Assignment

Project trips will be assigned to the study area roadways based on applying engineering judgment. The
proposed trip distribution is provided in Figure 2.

Study Area

Because the proposed development is projected to generate more than 100 PM peak-hour trips, the
study area was determined based upon a three-percent level of significance as consistent with the
Volusia TPO Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) Guidelines. A summary of the determination of the
three-percent significance area can be found in Table 2. The adopted levels of service (LOS) included
in Table 2 were obtained from the City of Deltona's comprehensive plan and the generalized service
volumes based on FDOT's 2012 Generalized Service Volume Tables.

Based on Table 2, none of the adjacent roadway segments meet or exceed three percent. However,
the following roadway segments will be analyzed:

         Saxon Boulevard from Interstate 4 to Finland Drive
         Saxon Boulevard from Finland Drive to Normandy Boulevard
         Finland Drive south of Saxon Boulevard
         Finland Drive north of Saxon Boulevard
         Apache Circle

The study intersections will include the following:

         Saxon Boulevard at Finland Drive
         Saxon Boulevard at Apache Circle
         All access point intersections with public streets

The PM peak-hour background traffic volumes for the roadway segments will be projected based on
vested trips from the City of Deltona and/or historical growth rates. Project trips will then be added to
the future background volumes to project the build out conditions for each roadway segment and
intersection.

The existing and future roadway segment and intersection operating conditions will be analyzed for the
PM peak hour. The roadway segments will be analyzed by comparing the two-way link volumes to the
generalized service volumes. Should the projected volume be less than the generalized service
volume then it shall be concluded that the roadway will operate at an acceptable LOS standard at build
out of the project. In the event the future volume of a roadway exceeds the generalized service
volume, TEDS may conduct a more detailed highway/arterial analysis to further refine the level of
service evaluation.

Existing and future PM peak-hour intersection operating conditions will be analyzed using the Highway
Capacity Software based upon the committed geometry. Existing signal timings and phasing will be
used for intersection analyses. A study intersection will be deemed to operate acceptably if the overall
intersection LOS meets the adopted LOS standard for the roadways. Per the Volusia TPO TIA
Guidelines, in the event the two intersecting roadways have different LOS standards, then the lower
standard shall prevail. For example, if one roadway has a LOS standard of D and the intersecting road
has a LOS standard of E, then the overall intersection LOS standard shall be E.

Critical and Near Critical Study Area

A critical, near critical and hurricane critical roadway segment is one where the existing daily volume is
90 percent or more of a roadway's service volume at the adopted LOS standard . All critical, near
critical, and hurricane critical roadway segments located within a five-mile travel distance of the
development will be analyzed if the project's impact is deemed to be non-deminimus. It should be
noted that due to the fact that another RaceTrac gas station is located on the west of the Saxon
Boulevard/Interstate 4 interchange, no roadways will be evaluated west of I-95 as motorists would be
expected to use that RaceTrac service station.

Conclusions, Recommendations and Mitigation

Based upon the results of the analysis, conclusions and recommendations will be prepared. If the TIA
identifies deficient roadways/intersections and the project's impacts are non-deminimus, then a plan to
mitigate the project's impacts will be provided.

Attachments:                       Saxon&Normandy-PM Counts.pdf


Good morning Ron, 
 
Upon receiving the Saxon Sterling TIA, I reviewed the TMC for Normandy/Saxon and think our assignment of traffic to 
Normandy (north/south of Saxon) and to Saxon (east of Normandy) as conveyed in item 4 in my responsetocomments 
email is not appropriate and should be adjusted.  As shown in the attached count sheet, of traffic on the west leg of the 
Normandy/Saxon intersection, approx. 20% is to/from the north on Normandy, 16% to/from the south on Normandy, 
and 64% to/from the east on Saxon.  Recognizing that our project assignment on Saxon (east of the project) is 70%, this 
means our new proposed assignment is as follows: 
 
To/from the north on Normandy = 70% x 20% = 14% 
To/from the south on Normandy = 70% x 16% = 11% 
To/from the east on Saxon (east of Normand) = 70% x 64% = 45% 
 
Thus, we would like to revise our response to comment #4 to as follows: 
 
    4) Trip Distribution ­ Suggest that a certain percentage of trips will use Apache Circle and Apache needs to be 
         modeled.  
    Response:  Projectrelated trips will be assigned to Apache.  However, access onto apache has not been finalized in 
    terms of full access or turn restrictions.  When considering the assignment of traffic it should be noted that of the 
    70% project trips to/from the east on Saxon, 11% will be to/from the south on Normandy (south of Saxon), 14% 
    to/from the north on Normandy (north of Saxon), and the remaining 45% to/from the east on Saxon (east of 
    Normandy). 
 
I know you are probably jazzed up by reading this technical stuff....but that's what we do.  Please call or email with any 
questions and also please let me know if you find this revised response acceptable.

Chris, thanks for the responses. Please be advised that both Apache and Finland are local roads have a LOS of "D" Comp 
Plan requirement.  
 
With regard to access, it is understood that TEDS will  model the traffic with the access off of Saxon. However, that 
access assumption will probably result in staff questions and will possibly create a condition for the City to engage in 
peer review ­ at the expense of the applicant. In addition, the process may be protracted.  
 
Finally, modeling the access off of Saxon does not obligate the City to approve or otherwise acknowledge the 
appropriateness of such access during the rezoning or subsequent land development reviews/processes.  
 
If there are any questions feel free to contact me at 8788610.  
 
Have a good day.

Mr. Walsh, Mr. Bowley and I went over the methodology provided to us by TEDS. Thanks.  
 
Below are some comments:

    1) Project Access ­ The proposed right in and right out on Saxon does not comply with section 9637(a)(10)(c)(5)(ii) 
        of the City Land Development Code. That Section calls for 250' of turn lane for right turns. In addition, Table 96
        6B of the City Code (Chapter 96) requires at least 335' of separation between access points. The site has about 
        420' of frontage. Also, City staff is concerned about the safety ramifications regarding a right in and right out on 
        Saxon. There is no problem with the suggested full access points on Finland and Apache Circle being modeled. 
        However, the exact distances from Saxon will be determined as project review matures.    
    Response:  The TIA will reflect the proposed access.  Should the proposed access be adjusted based on further 
discussion with the City/County, then the TIA will be adjusted accordingly. 
    2) Trip Generation  The 3,908 total daily trips seems reasonable.  
    Response:  No comment 
    3) Location Map ­ The site location maps do not depict the entire property. (Picky I know.)  
    Response:  The maps within the TIA will be modified accordingly. 
    4) Trip Distribution ­ Suggest that a certain percentage of trips will use Apache Circle and Apache needs to be 
        modeled.  
    Response:  Projectrelated trips will be assigned to Apache.  However, access onto apache has not been finalized in 
    terms of full access or turn restrictions.  When considering the assignment of traffic it should be noted that of the 
    70% project trips to/from the east on Saxon, 20% will be to/from the south on Normandy, south of Saxon, 30% 
    to/from the north on Normandy, north of Saxon, and the remaining 20% to/from the east on Saxon, east of 
    Normandy. 
    5) Trip Distribution Map ­ Please provide directional information for traffic splits.  
    Response:  The percentages shown in the distribution map reflect each direction.  So, as an example, the 15% on 
Saxon west of Finland indicates that 15% of the inbound traffic and 15% of the outbound traffic will be assigned to this 
roadway segment. 
    6) Table 2 ­ Apache Circle should be included in Table 2. In addition, Apache and Finland are considered local roads 
        and have a LOS threshold of "D" as articulated in Policy T14.3 of the City Comprehensive Plan.  
    Response:  Apache will be added to Table 2 
    7) PM Peak Hour Volumes ­ With regard to volume projections and City growth rates, please be advised that the 
        City utilizes a 2.5% annual growth rate as per the City CIE. In addition, there are several projects that will affect 
        traffic volumes on the Saxon corridor associated with the project. The projects include the Saxon/Sterling Silver 
        development (retail and office) and the Halifax medical clinic located near Publix.  
    Response:  The background trips will account for trips to/from both developments. 
 
Mr. Bowley and I will be calling you to discuss when you get back in the office.  
 
Thanks and have a great day.

RE:            RaceTrac Gas Station- Saxon Boulevard at Finland Drive
               Transportation Impact Analysis
               GMB Project No.: 14-010.01



 The purpose of this memorandum is to provide a review of the RaceTrac Gas
 Station at Saxon Boulevard and Finland Drive Transportation Impact Analysis
 (TIA) dated January 2014. Specific comments and findings are provided below.

  Comment 1 - (General Comment):
  The Methodology in the Appendix of the TIA indicates the proposed gas station
  will include 24 vehicle fueling positions. The Introduction of the TIA, and
  subsequent analyses, indicates the proposed gas station will include 20 vehicle
  fueling stations. Please revise, if necessary.

  Comment 2 - Page 3
  It appears that existing and background analysis revolves around existing
  turning movement counts (TMC), counts collected for Saxon Boulevard rather
  than utilizing the "2012 Volusia County Traffic Counts and LOS for Volusia
  County Roadways". Please determine if any findings using the Volusia County
  Counts are different from the study's final conclusions. The existing TMCs
  counts can be utilized for roadways not listed in the Volusia County or City of
  Deltona's Count programs. The K-factor of 0.09 should be used to determine the
  peak hour volumes. For example, if we use a K-factor of 0.09, and the correct
  total future PM peak hour 2-way volume on Saxon Boulevard, from Finland
  Drive to Normandy Boulevard, of 3,272, as discussed in Comment 4, the
  resulting AADT is 36,356, which does not correspond with the Volusia County
  2012 AADT & Historical Counts spreadsheet.

Review of RaceTrac Gas Station- Saxon Boulevard at Finland Drive
Transportation Impact Analysis
March 11, 2014
Page 2 of 2


    Comment 3 - (Table 1):
    The total existing PM peak hour 2-way volume on Finland Drive, south of
    Saxon Boulevard, is 408, not 390. Please revise, both existing and future
    volumes, accordingly.

    Comment 4 - (Table 2):
    The total future PM peak hour 2-way volume on Saxon Boulevard, from Finland
    Drive to Normandy Boulevard, is 3,272. This is further corroborated in the Trip
    Generation section, in which the amount of 3,272 PM trips is quoted. Please
    revise as necessary.

    Comment 5 - (Future Conditions (2014) Analyses):
    The Two-Way-Stop-Controlled Analysis for Apache Circle at Driveway #3,
    during the PM peak, for 2014, contains an input error. The southbound volumes
    should read: 0 left, 5 through, and 3 right. According to Figure 7, the latter two
    movements were erroneously swapped. Please revise accordingly.

    Comment 6 - Figure 5
    The sum of 57 vehicles entering the site does not correspond to the trip
    generation presented within the study. Please revise study as needed.


    Comment 7 - Figure 6
    The sum of 77 vehicles entering the site does not correspond to Pass-By
    presented in the trip generation calculation. Please revise study as needed.



Conclusion:
In summary, based on the peer review relating to the TIA supporting the RaceTrac Gas Station
at Saxon Boulevard and Finland Drive, GMB recommends that the City of Deltona transmits
these comments to the Applicant and that a revised TIA be provided addressing these
comments. Should you have any questions on the above, please feel free to call me at

                        more efficient movement of people, industry, and commerce
                        for economic development and community function (see
                        Exhibit A attached).

                        Historically, these funds are for large capital improvement
                        projects in urban areas, as has been implemented for the past
                        six years. Of the eligible categories listed above, the DOT
                        has opened the application process to planning projects for
                        the first time since 2010. Past TIGER grant awards within
                        Florida have been for construction projects, such as the
                        Dames Point Marine Terminal Intermodal Facility, the Port
                        of Miami Rail Access, the City of Orlando Parramore Bus
                        Rapid Transit Facility, the Tampa Downtown Multimodal
                        Improvements, the Ft. Lauderdale Wave Streetcar Project,
                        etc. TIGER planning grants were also awarded outside of
                        Florida for transportation, affordable housing, infrastructure,
                        and trail systems projects.

                        The 2014 TIGER grant funds Notice of Available Funding
                        (NOFA) was authorized by the President on January 17,
                        2014, under the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2014,
                        National Infrastructure Investments. The City has a project
                        worth consideration after meeting with the Florida
                        Department of Transportation (FDOT) and the Volusia
                        Transportation Planning Organization (TPO). The project is
                        warranted, due to the proposed expansion of Interstate 4 and

                                           132                                     Item 10A
                   the area's population. It would parallel I-4 as a north-south
                   reliever/connector that is regionally serving, protects the
                   capacity of the area roadway network, and allows for greater
                   mobility. The project limits would extend from Graves
                   Avenue to DeBary Avenue, utilizing and expanding the
                   existing roadway network that includes Normandy
                   Boulevard and Deltona Boulevard.

                   The application deadline to be considered for the planning
                   grant is April 28, 2014, and the DOT has allocated $600
                   million for nationwide grant funding. Staff is requesting a
                   lock-step approach that first requires the City
                   Commission's approval to apply for the grant by the April
                   28, 2014 deadline. If approved, staff would then bring the
                   cost estimate for the feasibility study and ultimate design to
                   the City Commission once determined from the study, to
                   receive permission to proceed prior to funding commitment.

                   To utilize TIGER funds, there would be an 80%
                   reimbursement from the grant and a 20% funding
                   commitment from the City, if the City elects to move
                   forward. Proposed funding for this grant would then be
                   considered for fiscal year 2014/15. Thus, this request is only
                   for the City Commission approval to apply for the grant by
                   the April 28, 2014 deadline.

The Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, or TIGER Discretionary Grant
program, provides a unique opportunity for the DOT to invest in road, rail, transit and port
projects that promise to achieve critical national objectives. Since 2009, Congress has dedicated
more than $4.1 billion for six rounds to fund projects that have a significant impact on the
Nation, a region or a metropolitan area. As can be seen below, a variety of project types have
been awarded:




The TIGER program enables DOT to examine a broad array of projects on their merits, to help
ensure that taxpayers are getting the highest value for every dollar invested. This focus is
especially important in the current era of fiscal constraint. In each round of TIGER, DOT
receives many applications to build and repair critical pieces of our freight and passenger
transportation networks. Applicants must detail the benefits their project would deliver for five
long-term outcomes: safety, economic competitiveness, state of good repair, livability and
environmental sustainability. DOT also evaluates projects on their expected contributions to
economic recovery, as well as their ability to facilitate innovation and new partnerships.

The competitive structure of the TIGER program and its broad eligibility allow project sponsors
at the State and local level to avoid narrow, formula-based categories, and fund multi-modal,
multi-jurisdictional projects not eligible for funding through traditional DOT programs. TIGER
can fund port and freight rail projects, for example, which play a critical role in our ability to
move freight, but which are not eligible for any other sources of Federal funds. Similarly, TIGER
can provide capital funding directly to any public entity, including municipalities, counties, port
authorities, tribal governments, MPOs, or others in contrast to traditional Federal programs
which provide funding to very specific groups of applicants (mostly State DOTs and transit
agencies). This flexibility allows TIGER and our traditional partners at the state and local level




                                                 135                                      Item 10A
                                                                                           Attachment number 1 \nPage 2




to work directly with a host of entities that own, operate and maintain much of our transportation
infrastructure, but otherwise cannot turn to the Federal government for support.

By running a competitive process, DOT is able to reward applicants that exceed eligibility
criteria and demonstrate a level of commitment that surpasses their peers. While TIGER can
fund projects that have a local match as low as twenty percent of the total project costs, TIGER
projects have historically achieved, on average, co-investment of two non-Federal dollars
(including State, local, private and philanthropic funds) for every TIGER dollar invested. The
high-level of co-investment achieved through TIGER, and the ability to foster creative and
innovative approaches to transportation investments, is demonstrated across all types of TIGER
projects.

Program Background
The Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, or TIGER Discretionary Grant
program, provides a unique opportunity for the U.S. Department of Transportation to invest in
road, rail, transit and port projects that promise to achieve critical national objectives. Congress
dedicated more than $4.1 billion to the program: $1.5 billion for TIGER I, $600 million for
TIGER II, $526.944 million for FY 2011, $500 million for FY 2012, $473.847 million for
FY2013, and $600 million for the FY 2014 round of TIGER Grants to fund projects that have a
significant impact on the Nation, a region or a metropolitan area.

TIGER's highly competitive process, galvanized by tremendous applicant interest, allowed DOT
to fund 51 innovative capital projects in TIGER I, and an additional 42 capital projects in TIGER
II. TIGER II also featured a new Planning Grant category and 33 planning projects were also
funded through TIGER II. In the FY 2011 round of TIGER Grants, DOT awarded 46 capital
projects in 33 states and Puerto Rico. DOT awarded 47 capital projects in 34 states and the
District of Columbia in the FY 2012 round. Last year the Department announced 52 capital
projects in 37 states.

Each project is multi-modal, multi-jurisdictional or otherwise challenging to fund through
existing programs. The TIGER program enables DOT to use a rigorous process to select projects
with exceptional benefits, explore ways to deliver projects faster and save on construction costs,
and make investments in our Nation's infrastructure that make communities more livable and
sustainable.

TO:        Mayor & City Commission                AGENDA DATE:         4/21/2014

FROM:      William D. Denny, City Manager         AGENDA ITEM: 10 - B

SUBJECT: Request for approval of Resolution No. 2014-07 declaring certain property of
         the City as surplus and authorizing the sale or disposal of such property.


LOCATION:                  N/A

BACKGROUND:                Over time certain items of the City become obsolete or lose
                           their usefulness and are either replaced, upgraded or are no
                           longer functional and need to be declared surplus or
                           disposed of by the most appropriate means available.

                           The attached resolution declares certain property as surplus
                           as it has long outlived its usefulness. The City has been
                           using GovDeals for disposal of assets. This has been more
                           profitable than the live auctions that were done in the past.
                           Most items will be auctioned this way. A lot of the radios
                           will be traded in for credit towards new radios.

                           The GovDeals auction is open to the public. The cost to sell
                           on GovDeals will be netted against the proceeds for the
                           items sold.

TO:         Mayor & City Commission                AGENDA DATE: 4/21/2014

FROM:       William D. Denny, City Manager         AGENDA ITEM: 10 - C

SUBJECT: Request for approval to sign engagement letter with Purvis Gray & Company.


LOCATION:                 N/A

BACKGROUND:               Purvis Gray & Company have worked with the City for a
                          number of years providing auditing services and they are
                          interested in continuing the relationship with the City of
                          Deltona through FYE 2016 with optional renewals for FYE
                          2017 and FYE 2018. They have reduced their annual fee by
                          $1,500 less than the most recently completed audit due to the
                          efficiencies they have gained from their experience in
                          working with the City.

                          The last time the City competitively solicited auditing
                          services in 2009, only two firms responded and Purvis Gray
                          & Company's current proposal is $8,000 less than what the
                          other firm bid back in 2009.

                          Staff cannot say with certainty that should we put this
                          engagement out to bid another firm would not bid lower than
                          this offered renewal fee but given prior history and the fact
                          that this proposed fee is $8,000 below what another firm bid
                          five years ago it would appear that significant savings are
                          unlikely. Furthermore we believe the additional cost and
                          effort required of staff to bring new auditors up to speed
                          should be factored into the decision.

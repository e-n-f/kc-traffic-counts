                       Subject:    Final Draft Report: Miller Creek Road Interchange Traffic Calming Study
                                   (Project No. 036-038)

                       Dear Mr. Haile:

                       The purpose of this letter report is to provide a summary of results for the subject study. For
                       several years, Marinwood residents have expressed concerns that southbound commuters on
                       nearby U.S. 101 are using the southbound off-ramp at Miller Creek Road to bypass the freeway
                       congestion during a.m. peak commute hours. Several attempts have already been made in the
                       past to either eliminate or reduce cut-through traffic at this location.

                       Under Marin County direction, TJKM has collected extensive travel time and volume data in the
                       field to estimate the extent of the cut-through issue. The focus of our study has been to develop
                       effective solutions to keep commute traffic on the U.S. 101 freeway and prevent the bypass of
                       freeway congestion via local county roads. TJKM has developed several preliminary
                       recommended alternatives with the goal of reducing or eliminating cut-through commute traffic.
                       The preliminary alternatives described in this letter report are meant to guide the ongoing public
                       input process and to help build consensus on a traffic calming solution for the Marinwood area
                       acceptable to residents, the County, and Caltrans.

Existing Traffic Volumes
TJKM additionally collected two types of existing traffic volumes in the study area, shown in
Figure 1 and discussed below. Attachment A includes all 48-hour count sheets for the study
segments. Attachment B includes all a.m. peak hour count sheets for the study intersections.
48-Hour Counts
TJKM collected continuous 48-hour two-way traffic counts in September 2007 along the following
three roadway segments:
        1. Miller Creek Road between Marinwood Avenue and Las Gallinas Avenue
        2. Las Gallinas Avenue between Roundtree Boulevard and Elvia Court
        3. Lucas Valley Road between Las Gallinas Avenue and Los Gamos Road

It is notable that on all three segments, the 24-hour volumes on the individual two days are
heavier in the direction of the potential cut-through Route 3 than in the other direction. That is,
westbound Miller Creek Road, southbound Las Gallinas Avenue, and eastbound Lucas Valley Road
have higher 24-hour volumes than in the corresponding opposite direction for each roadway.
Under typical conditions, a roadway often has heavier volumes in one direction during a typical
weekday a.m. peak period, and then heavier volumes in the opposite direction during a typical
weekday p.m. peak period. As a result, volumes in both directions of the roadway should be
approximately balanced. However, since the three study roadway segments do not have balanced
directional volumes over either 24-hour period, this suggests a commute pattern in which vehicles
are not returning in the opposite direction along the same path. This suggests that commuters
consider cut-through Route 3 a viable route during the a.m. peak period, but instead of using the
reverse route during the p.m. peak period, they would instead travel along U.S. 101 Northbound.
A.M. Peak Hour Intersection Counts
TJKM collected existing turning movement counts between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. within the above
mentioned same 48-hour observation period in September 2007 at the Miller Creek Road
intersections with the U.S. 101 Southbound Off-Ramp and Marinwood Drive. Additional a.m.
peak hour counts were conducted in January 2008 at the following intersections:
    ·   Miller Creek / Las Gallinas Avenue
    ·   Miller Creek Middle School Driveway / Las Gallinas Avenue
    ·   Lucas Valley Road / Las Gallinas Avenue
    ·   Lucas Valley Road / U.S. 101 Southbound On-Ramp
    ·   Lucas Valley Road / Miller Creek Road

The counts are shown in Figure 1. During the a.m. peak hour, 113 vehicles were observed
making the westbound U-turn at the Miller Creek Road / Marinwood Drive intersection. All of
these U-turning vehicles are presumed to have originated from the southbound right-turn, which
totals 868 vehicles during the a.m. peak hour.

Field Data Collection Methodology
TJKM conducted three sets of field observations during the typically congested a.m. peak period
between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. on a typical Tuesday and Wednesday in September 2007. The first
observation consisted of counting vehicles traveling directly onto the southbound Miller Creek
Road on-ramp (Route 1) or turning right from the off-ramp and making the U-turn at Marinwood
Avenue to return to the freeway (Route 2). The second observation involved floating vehicle
Mr Amanuel Haile

runs using global positioning system (GPS) devices, in which observers followed select vehicles
traveling Route 3 along Las Gallinas Avenue in the Marinwood area, in order to estimate average
travel time and determine the proportion of cut-through vehicles. The third observation was
following vehicles with GPS during congested periods along the U.S. 101 Southbound freeway
mainline between the Alameda Del Prado and Lucas Valley Road interchanges, in order to
estimate average travel time on the freeway. Congestion on the freeway was present during all
observations.

Floating Car Travel Time Survey Results
Table 1 shows the results of the field GPS travel time surveys for the freeway mainline and three
cut-through routes. A minimum of three floating runs was performed for each route. Route
distances are based on the same starting and ending reference points. The start point is the Nave
Drive Overcrossing upstream on the U.S. 101 Southbound freeway, which represents the
beginning of the auxiliary lane between the Alameda Del Prado and Miller Creek interchanges.
The ending point is the merge of the southbound Lucas Valley Road on-ramp downstream on the
freeway mainline.

Based on the above results, TJKM has made the following findings:
    ·   Even though all three cut-through routes are longer in distance than the freeway mainline,
        Routes 1 and 2 offer on average at least one minute fifty seconds of travel time savings.
    ·   Motorists on Routes 1 and 2 on average are traveling slightly faster than the freeway
        mainline, though by no more than 2.7 miles per hour (mph).
    ·   Although motorists on Route 3 are experiencing higher travel time than the freeway
        mainline segment on average (66 seconds), due to the longer route distance they are
        traveling a slightly higher average speeds (1.4 mph).
    ·   Although it appears that motorists on average are achieving marginal benefits by utilizing
        the three cut-through routes (and incurring marginal costs in time for Route 3), it is
        deduced that many motorists derive a psychological benefit from using these routes
        because they feel they are moving faster than on the freeway mainline. A closer look at
        the floating car data reveals that the perceived advantage is not just psychological. Most
        of the speed and travel time advantage is gained along the southbound freeway segment
        between the Nave Drive Overcrossing and the beginning of the Miller Creek Road off-
        ramp. On average, motorists using the approximately one-mile auxiliary lane in this
        segment are traveling at 27.7 mph, which is more than triple the speed of motorists
        traveling in the adjacent mixed-flow lanes (average of 9.0 mph). In terms of average travel
        time, the same comparison reveals an auxiliary lane advantage of four minutes and 23
        seconds (6:26 on the mixed flow lanes minus 2:03 on the auxiliary lane). However, once
        motorists leave the freeway, the speed and travel time advantages are partially diminished,
        due to surface street congestion and additional traffic controls such as stop signs and
        crosswalks.

Cut-Through Route Field Observations
Table 2 shows estimated proportions of the three cut-through routes based on field observations
and the existing intersection turning counts. As shown in Table 2, approximately 44 percent of
vehicles using the U.S. 101 Southbound off-ramp at Miller Creek Road and staying on the west
side of U.S. 101 eventually return to the freeway. Based on 1,181 total observed through and
right-turning volumes on the Southbound U.S. 101 Off-Ramp approach at Miller Creek Road
(=313 through + 868 right turns), 26.5 percent (313/1,181) followed Route 1 directly back on to
the freeway. All 113 U-turns observed at the Miller Creek Road / Marinwood Avenue
intersection are assumed to follow Route 2 and originate from the off-ramp. Therefore, the
Route 2 proportion is estimated to be 9.5 percent (113/1,181).

The eight percent proportion for Route 3 that is shown in Table 2 was derived from the number
of cars followed as part of the above mentioned floating car survey. As part of field observations
of 300 vehicles during the two a.m. peak hours, TJKM observed vehicles making the westbound
through movement on Miller Creek Road at Marinwood Drive. Vehicles making this movement
were followed since they would potentially follow Route 3 back to the freeway. Of the potential
vehicles, 20 percent actually followed the entire Route 3 from the Miller Creek Road off-ramp to
the Lucas Valley Road on-ramp to U.S. 101 Southbound. This 20 percent proportion was then
applied to the westbound through movement at Miller Creek Road / Marinwood Drive, since all
Route 3 vehicles by definition must make this movement. Of the 495 westbound through vehicles
counted during the a.m. peak hour, 99 (20 percent) would therefore be expected to follow
Route 3. In turn, these 99 vehicles represent eight percent (=99/1,181) of the total southbound
through and right turning volumes at the Miller Creek Road off-ramp.
Mr Amanuel Haile

TJKM evaluated the additional a.m. peak hour turning movements collected in January 2008 to
determine consistency with the estimated 99 vehicles following Route 3. The following key
turning movements along Route 3 were observed as follows:
    ·     Westbound Miller Creek Road left turn at Las Gallinas Avenue: 242 vehicles
    ·     Southbound Las Gallinas Avenue left turn at Lucas Valley Road: 172 vehicles
    ·     Eastbound Lucas Valley Road right turn onto U.S. 101 Southbound On-Ramp: 451 vehicles

The 99 vehicles expected to follow Route 3 are less than all of the above turning movements.
Therefore, the Route 3 vehicle estimate is reasonable since it is completely contained within these
key intersection turning movement counts.

It should be noted that the 44 percent of vehicles following Routes 1, 2, or 3 does not include a
secondary U-turn at Marinwood Avenue that was observed in the field. This U-turn movement
includes a westbound right turn onto Marinwood Avenue, a U-turn on Marinwood Avenue itself,
and then finally a left turn onto eastbound Miller Creek Road towards the southbound U.S. 101
on-ramp. Although this maneuver was observed, it was difficult to estimate precisely how many
motorists did this. The likely reason that motorists made this maneuver was that they were
looking for a U-turn alternative by utilizing the westbound free right turn lane at Marinwood
Avenue. This would have occurred when the short segment of westbound Miller Creek Road
between the two study intersections was filled with vehicles making the more conventional
U-turn to return to the freeway.

             Route                    Percentage
Route 1                                  26.5 %
Route 2                                  9.5 %
Route 3                                  8.0 %
Cut-Through Total                       44.0 %
Other                                   56.0 %
Total                                   100.0%



Potential Design Alternatives
In part based on previous observations in this study area, TJKM has developed a set of potential
design alternatives that generally are intended to discourage motorists from diverting onto local
streets in the Marinwood area to avoid southbound freeway congestion during the a.m. peak
period. These alternatives are illustrated in Figures 2 through 6 and are described further below.
It should be noted that the alternatives are presented only for discussion purposes. At this stage
in the evaluation process, neither TJKM nor the County is advocating any specific alternative.
Alternative 1
Shown in Figure 2, this alternative is a design treatment that would narrow westbound Miller
Creek Road between the U.S. 101 Southbound off-ramp and Marinwood Avenue to a single
14-foot lane. In addition, a Yield sign would be posted for off-ramp traffic. Currently, the
pavement width in the westbound direction is approximately 42 feet, leading into a three-lane
westbound approach at Marinwood Avenue. Additionally, the southbound off-ramp includes an
exclusive, unrestricted free right turn.
Mr Amanuel Haile

The potential safety benefits of this alternative are:
    ·   Narrower roadway width promotes slower speeds on Miller Creek Road and eliminates
        weaving of vehicles between the off-ramp and Marinwood Avenue
    ·   Yield sign forces previously free right turn from the off-ramp to yield to Miller Creek
        Road traffic, reducing the potential risk of angle collisions

The potential disadvantages to traffic operations are:
    ·   Narrower roadway width promotes slower speeds and thus increased delay on the Miller
        Creek Road approach to Marinwood Avenue. The time advantage of potential cut-
        through traffic is reduced
    ·   Yield sign forces previously free right turn from the off-ramp to yield to Miller Creek
        Road traffic, increasing delay on the off-ramp for all movements
    ·   Initially, the Yield sign may result in rear-end collisions as drivers adjust from the
        previously free right turn. Proper signage and advanced notices should be included during
        implementation.

Alternative 2
Shown in Figure 3, this alternative is a design treatment meant to specifically discourage the
Route 2 cut-through movement, the westbound U-turn at Miller Creek Road / Marinwood
Avenue. The treatment would shift the westbound left turn lane and adjacent median to the
south and include installation of a "No U Turn" sign. This lane shift would discourage U-turns
since vehicles would not be able to negotiate the turn due to a smaller available turning radius.

The potential safety benefits of this alternative are:
    ·   Eliminates westbound U-turns at Marinwood Avenue, reducing volume in the left turn
        lane
    ·   Reduces weaving conflicts caused by U-turning vehicles originating from the southbound
        off-ramp

The potential disadvantages to traffic operations are:
    ·   Restricts westbound U-turns and could possibly result in more cut-through vehicles using
        other routes, adding to travel time and delay for these vehicles.
    ·   May induce more Route 2 cut-through vehicles to use the secondary U-turn (right turn
        onto Marinwood, southbound left back towards freeway)
    ·   May temporarily add to queuing on southbound off-ramp as more cut-through vehicles
        divert back to Route 1 (directly back onto the freeway)

Alternative 3
Shown in Figure 4, this alternative is a design treatment that eliminates free right turns on the
eastbound and westbound Miller Creek Road approaches to Marinwood Avenue. Additionally, a
crosswalk and pedestrian refuge would be added to the westbound intersection approach. This
alternative could be combined with the westbound left turn lane shift of Alternative 2.

The potential safety benefits of this alternative are:
    ·   Discourages use of secondary Route 2 cut-through U-turn at Marinwood Avenue
        described above by eliminating westbound free right turn.
    ·   Increases pedestrian and bicycle safety and promotes pedestrian activity with the addition
        of the pedestrian design treatments and elimination of the free right turns.
    ·   Slightly narrowed pavement width promotes better channelization of westbound
        approach traffic

The potential disadvantages to traffic operations are:
    ·   Elimination of free right turns on Miller Creek Road adds to right turn delay and approach
        delay for eastbound and westbound intersection approaches

Alternative 4
Shown in Figure 5, this alternative is identical to Alternative 3, but with the additional realignment
of the southbound U.S. 101 off-ramp at Miller Creek Road. This design treatment would narrow
westbound Miller Creek Road immediately downstream of the off-ramp to one lane. Also, the
off-ramp free right turn would be forced to stop at Miller Creek Road in the same way as the
southbound left turns and through movements do currently. This alternative also could be
combined with the westbound left turn lane shift of Alternative 2.

The potential safety benefits of this alternative are similar to Alternative 3. In addition, the
conversion of the southbound off-ramp right turn from a free movement to stop-controlled
movement would reduce right turning speeds, thereby increasing intersection safety. Also, the
design would create a shorter pedestrian crossing distance across the off-ramp and promote
better pedestrian channelization along the north side of Miller Creek Road in the area, particularly
towards the Golden Gate Transit bus stop along U.S. 101 Southbound.

The potential disadvantages to traffic operations are also similar to Alternative 3. In addition,
southbound off-ramp approach delay and right turn delay would increase, which initially could lead
to additional queuing until cut-through traffic begins to stay on the freeway.

Alternative 5
Shown in Figure 6, this alternative is essentially a pedestrian design treatment that adds bulb-outs
to all intersection approaches at the Miller Creek Road / Marinwood Avenue intersection and
includes crosswalks across each approach. These bulb outs would eliminate the existing free right
turns of all four intersection approaches. This alternative could be combined with the westbound
left turn lane shift of Alternative 2, as well as the southbound off-ramp design treatment of
Alternative 4.

The potential safety benefits of this alternative are:
    ·   Adds pedestrian crossings across all four intersection approaches.
    ·   Shortens pedestrian crossing distances for all four intersection approaches with the
        elimination of all free right turns, thereby reducing pedestrian exposure to intersection
        vehicles.
    ·   Discourages use of secondary Route 2 cut-through U-turn at Marinwood Avenue
        described above by eliminating westbound free right turn.

The main potential disadvantage to traffic operations of Alternative 5 is that approach delay and
right turn delay would increase for all four approaches with the elimination of the free right turns.

    Add "bulb-outs" at all corners of Marinwood Avenue intersection (narrows pedestrian crossing distance)

In the Marinwood area, the design alternatives presented above may be most effective in
eliminating cut-through Routes 1 and 2. As for Route 3, speeding may be an issue since average
speed is greater than on the freeway, even though average travel time is also greater. Some of
the eight percent of motorists utilizing Route 3 may speed along some segments of the route to
make up for lost time along other segments where average speed is lower due to congestion and
traffic controls. Therefore, the potential education and enforcement measures mentioned above
are more likely to discourage this cut-through route than engineering measures.

It should be noted the five alternatives presented are not necessarily stand-alone design
treatments and can be combined with one another. For example, Alternative 4, which forces
southbound off-ramp right turns into stop control at Miller Creek Road and eliminates eastbound
and westbound free right turns at Miller Creek Road / Marinwood Avenue, could be combined
with Alternative 2. Alternative 2, which only shifts the westbound left turn median at Marinwood
Avenue, could be integrated with Alternative 4 since they are complementary design treatments.

TJKM appreciates the opportunity to present preliminary cut-through traffic evaluation results and
preliminary traffic calming design alternatives. If you have any questions, please call us at

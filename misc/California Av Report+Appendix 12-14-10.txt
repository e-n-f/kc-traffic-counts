Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis conducted for the
proposed California Avenue lane reduction in Palo Alto, California. The proposed project
would reduce the number of travel lanes on California Avenue between El Camino Real
and Park Boulevard from four travel lanes to two. An operations and queue analysis of key
intersections along California Avenue is also provided.
The additional pavement space provided from the lane reduction would be used for
streetscape improvements including decorative pavement bands, intersection bulb-outs,
and to provide additional on-street parking supply. Most of the parking spaces would be
60-degree angled parking spaces, although some parallel parking will also be provided. At
higher volume intersections such as El Camino Real & California Avenue and Birch Street
& California Avenue, additional approach lanes are proposed to provide additional
intersection capacity for traffic. All existing crosswalks for pedestrians would be maintained
with three additional crosswalks provided at the intersections of Park Boulevard &
California Avenue. Where bulb-out improvements are proposed, existing crosswalk
lengths would be reduced to improve pedestrian operations. The project would also
enhance the existing California Avenue Bike Route with the addition of Sharrows stenciled
onto the pavement.
The proposed lane reduction was reviewed in accordance with City of Palo Alto and Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) ­ Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines.
According to the City of Palo Alto, there are no pending projects or planned projects in the
foreseeable future. Therefore, traffic volumes on California Avenue between El Camino
Real and Park Boulevard will remain unchanged with the current land uses. An analysis of
intersection Level of Service (LOS), street segment LOS, and intersection queuing was
conducted to determine whether the project would result in any significant adverse impacts
under project conditions with the lane reduction.
The intersection LOS analyses show no significant impact from the proposed lane
reduction along California Avenue. The roadway segment LOS analyses also show no
significant impact from the proposed lane reduction along California Avenue. The queue
length and overall operations analysis though did yield several optional improvements to
the City's proposed conceptual plan line to help improve operations under the proposed
two-lane condition including:
    ·   At California Avenue the existing two-lane to three-lane westbound approach to the
        El Camino Real intersection may be maintained to help provide adequate storage


                                                                              ii | Page 
California Avenue Lane Reduction ­ Traffic Analysis Report                                        


        capacity for at least 200 feet from the intersection. This would result in the loss of
        the 5 new on-street parking spaces along the north side of California Avenue but
        still allows for the maintenance of the existing 12 on-street parking spaces in the
        segment providing for no overall parking loss.

    ·   The proposed crosswalk additions at the intersections of California Avenue & Park
        Boulevard should be reviewed to ensure that wheelchair ramps can be installed in
        accordance with American Disabilities Act requirements.

    ·   The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept proposes to maintain the
        existing two-lane westbound approach at Birch Street. Two lanes are also
        proposed for maintenance immediately west of Birch Street approaching the mid-
        block crosswalk west of the Birch Street intersection. To eliminate the need for lane
        merging along California Avenue, the westbound curb lane may be converted to a
        dedicated right turn only lane to northbound Birch Street.

    ·   The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept also proposed to maintain
        the existing two receiving lanes for eastbound California Avenue at El Camino
        Real. Only one receiving lane is required because at any given time only one lane
        from either the west side of El Camino Real, the southbound left turn approach of
        El Camino Real, or the northbound right turn approach of El Camino Real feed
        traffic onto California Avenue. The existing curb lane approaching the first mid-
        block crosswalk of the project area may be removed to eliminate the need for lane
        merging. The curb lane can be converted to a bus duckout for the existing Stanford
        Marguerite shuttle stop at the intersection. This design would eliminate a stopped
        bus from blocking through traffic and help to avoid operations impacts to the El
        Camino Real & California Avenue intersection.

    ·   Three proposed on-street parking segments on California Avenue do not meet the
        City's existing parking standards providing adjacent lane widths that are too narrow
        for vehicles to back out of angled parking spaces. To comply with the City's parking
        standards these segments could be reconfigured to 45-degree parking stalls. The
        three parking segments are as follows:

            o   The proposed four angled parking spaces in the same location of the
                proposed Optional Outside Seating/Community Stage area on the south
                side of California Avenue between Ash Street and the mid-block crosswalk
                immediately west of Ash Street. Changing these parking spaces from 60-
                degrees to 45-degrees does not result in a loss of proposed on-street
                parking spaces within this street segment.

            o   The proposed six angled parking spaces along the north side of California
                Avenue between Park Boulevard and the driveway entrance to the Molly
                Stone market. Changing these parking spaces from 60-degrees to 45-


                                                                               iii | Page 
California Avenue Lane Reduction ­ Traffic Analysis Report                                     


                degrees results in the loss of one new parking space providing five spaces
                instead. This is still one space more than the existing four parking spaces
                under existing conditions.

            o   The proposed eight angled parking spaces along the south side of
                California Avenue between Park Boulevard (East) and Park Boulevard
                (West). Changing these parking spaces from 60-degrees to 45-degrees
                results in the loss of two new parking spaces providing six spaces instead.
                This is still one space more than the existing five parking spaces under
                existing conditions.

Introduction
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis conducted for the
proposed California Avenue lane reduction in Palo Alto, California. The proposed project
would reduce the number of travel lanes on California Avenue between El Camino Real
and Park Boulevard from four travel lanes to two. An operations and queue analysis of key
intersections along California Avenue is also provided.
The additional pavement space provided from the lane reduction would be used for
streetscape improvements including decorative pavement bands, intersection bulb-outs,
and to provide additional on-street parking supply. Most of the parking spaces would be
60-degree angled parking spaces, although some parallel parking will also be provided. At
higher volume intersections such as El Camino Real & California Avenue and Birch Street
& California Avenue, additional approach lanes are proposed to provide additional
intersection capacity for traffic. All existing crosswalks for pedestrians would be maintained
with three additional crosswalks provided at the intersections of Park Boulevard &
California Avenue. Where bulb-out improvements are proposed, existing crosswalk
lengths would be reduced to improve pedestrian operations. The project would also
enhance the existing California Avenue Bike Route with the addition of Sharrows stenciled
onto the pavement. The project study area and study intersections are shown on Figures 1
& 2.

Scope of Study
The proposed lane reduction was reviewed in accordance with City of Palo Alto and Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) ­ Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines.
The study included an analysis of traffic conditions for one signalized intersection, six
unsignalized intersections, and the California Avenue corridor from El Camino Real to the
Caltrain Station past Park Boulevard. The study intersections are identified below.

            5. Park Boulevard (E) and California Avenue (3-way STOP)
            6. Birch Street and Cambridge Avenue (4-way STOP)
            7. Birch Street and Sherman Avenue (4-way STOP)

The segment lane capacity was reviewed for the following roadway segments within the
project area:
    ·   California Avenue between El Camino Real and Ash Street
    ·   California Avenue between Ash Street and Birch Street
    ·   California Avenue between Birch Street and Park Boulevard (W)
    ·   California Avenue between Park Boulevard (W) and Park Boulevard (E)

Traffic conditions were analyzed for three weekday time periods: AM peak-hour (one hour
between 7 AM ­ 9 AM), Mid-day peak-hour (one hour between 11:30 AM ­ 1:30 PM), and
PM peak hour (one hour between 4 PM ­ 6 PM). Traffic conditions were evaluated for the
following scenarios:
Scenario 1: Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from tube count
            and manual turning movement count data obtained in November 2010.

Scenario 2: Project Conditions. The intersections and street segments were evaluated
            with the proposed lane reductions. Project conditions were evaluated
            relative to existing conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each
scenario described above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis
methodologies, and the applicable level of service standards.
Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from the City of Palo Alto and field
observations. The following data were collected from these sources:
·   existing traffic volumes
·   lane configurations
·   signal timing and phasing (for signalized intersections)
·   existing and future bicycle facilities
·   existing transit service
·   travel time runs

Level of Service Standards and Analysis Methodologies
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS).
Level of Service is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or
free-flow conditions with little or no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive
delays. The various analysis methods are described below. The City of Palo Alto level of
service standard for intersections is LOS D or better.
Signalized Intersections
Level of service at signalized intersections in the City of Palo Alto is based on the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (2000 HCM) method. The software called TRAFFIX is used to
apply this 2000 HCM operations method for evaluation of conditions at signalized
intersections. The 2000 HCM method evaluates signalized intersection operations on the
basis of average control delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Control delay is the
amount of delay that is attributed to the particular traffic control device at the intersection,
and includes initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final
acceleration delay. The correlation between average delay and level of service is shown in
Table 1.

            Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive during the green
    A       phase and do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths may also contribute to the very        10.0 or less
            low vehicle delay.

            Operations characterized by good signal progression and/or short cycle lengths.
    B       More vehicles stop than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average vehicle             10.1 to 20.0
            delay.

            Higher delays may result from fair signal progression and/or longer cycle
            lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level. The number of
    C                                                                                                20.1 to 35.0
            vehicles stopping is significant, though may still pass through the intersection
            without stopping.

            The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result
            from some combination of unfavorable signal progression, long cycle lenghts, or
    D                                                                                                35.1 to 55.0
            high volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Many vehicles stop and individual cycle
            failures are noticeable.

            This is considered to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay values
    E       generally indicate poor signal progression, long cycle lengths, and high volume-         55.1 to 80.0
            to-capacity (V/C) ratios. Individual cycle failures occur frequently.

            This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This condition
            often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival flow rates exceed the
    F                                                                                             greater than 80.0
            capacity of the intersection. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also
            be major contributing causes of such delay levels.

Unsignalized Intersections
Level of service at unsignalized intersections also is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (2000 HCM) method. The TRAFFIX software is used to apply the 2000 HCM
operations method for evaluation of conditions at unsignalized intersections. The delay
and corresponding level of service at unsignalized, stop-controlled intersections is
presented in Table 2. The reported LOS represents the average delay of all intersection
movements.

Link Level of Service
Roadway links were analyzed using volume to capacity (V/C) ratios. The volume was
measured in the field using recent traffic counts. The volumes used for the analysis were
based on the day of the week with the highest daily traffic volume, which for all study
segments was Friday, November 5th 2010. Using the highest day's traffic data, the counts
were further disaggregated into AM, Midday, and PM peak hour volumes. The capacity of
each study segment was derived from the Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 published by
the Transportation Research Board. According to the Highway Capacity Manual, an urban
minor arterial (Class 4) has an approximate capacity of 800 vehicles per hour (Table 10-7).
However, because of the presence of on-street parking, an additional reduction in capacity
was applied per the publication, Parking, by Weant and Levinson (Table 11-1). Thus, for
this analysis, each two lane directional segment was assumed to have a capacity of
approximately 1,360 vehicles per hour and each one lane directional segment was
assumed to have a capacity of 560 vehicles per hour. For each link, the peak hourly
volume was divided by the capacity to calculate a V/C ratio. This was then correlated to a
level of service per Table 3.

Intersection Queuing
A queuing analysis was conducted for high-demand movements at intersections. Vehicle
queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the
probability of "n" vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:
Probability (X=n) =        n e ­ ()
                               n!

Where:
         Probability (X=n) = probability of "n" vehicles in queue per lane
         n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
          = Average number of vehicles in queue per lane (vehicles per hour per
            lane/signal cycles per hour)

The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to
estimate the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a
particular movement; (2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is
translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated
maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned available storage capacity
for the movement.

2.
Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in
the vicinity of the site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and
pedestrian facilities.

Existing Roadway Network
California Avenue runs at a diagonal to the ordinal directions, but will be considered to run
east-west in this study. The segment of California Avenue included in this study extends
four blocks from El Camino Real to the California Avenue train station. The cross-streets
along this segment are Ash Street, Birch Street, and Park Boulevard. There are STOP
signs for all movements at each of the cross-streets. California Avenue has four 9-foot
travel lanes, two in each direction, along this segment. There is on-street parking on both
sides ­ some diagonal and some parallel. California Avenue has sidewalks on both sides
of the street and serves mostly retail businesses. Parking for the businesses is provided
either on-street or in parking lots and garages behind the buildings.
El Camino Real will be considered to run north-south in this study. El Camino Real is a six-
lane arterial and designated State Highway 82. The intersection of El Camino Real with
California Avenue is controlled by an 8-phase signal, with left turn pockets on all
approaches. There are cross-walks with pedestrian heads on all legs of the intersection.
Ash Street will be considered to run north-south in this study. It has one travel lane in each
direction and on-street parking.
Birch Street will be considered to run north-south in this study. North of California Avenue
it has one travel lane in each direction and on-street parking. South of California Avenue it
has two travel lanes in each direction and no on-street parking.
Park Boulevard will be considered to run north-south in this study. It has one travel lane in
each direction, on-street parking, and bike lanes. The two pieces of Park Boulevard north
and south of California Avenue are off-set by about 200 feet, forming two separate
intersections.
Cambridge Avenue runs parallel to California Avenue on the north side. It has one travel
lane in each direction and on-street parking. Its intersection with El Camino Real is not


                                                                               13 | Page 
California Avenue Lane Reduction ­ Traffic Analysis Report                                       


signalized but allows all movements. Cambridge Avenue provides access to three parking
lots and two garages serving the surrounding commercial development.
Sherman Avenue runs parallel to California Avenue on the south side. It has one travel
lane in each direction and on-street parking. The intersection of Sherman Avenue and El
Camino Real is unsignalized and allows right turns only. Sherman Avenue provides
access to three parking lots serving the surrounding commercial development.

Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by
observations in the field and confirmed by City staff. The existing intersection lane
configurations are shown on Figure 3. For the most part, the intersections have two lanes
in each direction on California Avenue. The exceptions are the eastern Park Boulevard
intersection, which has only one westbound lane, and the El Camino Real intersection,
which has one left-turn lane, one through lane, and one right turn lane in the westbound
direction. Although present, the right turn lane is only 50 feet long.

Existing Traffic Volumes
Daily and peak hour traffic counts were collected in November 2010 at all the study
intersections and street segments (see Figures 4 and 5). Daily volume on California
Avenue ranges from 2,800 to 5,300 vehicles, with the higher volume nearer El Camino
Real. The parallel streets of Cambridge Avenue (2,100 ­ 3,000 vehicles per day) and
Sherman Avenue (1,800 ­ 2,600 vehicles per day) carry lower volume. These volumes are
typical of two to four-lane commercial streets.

Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Within the study area, California Avenue is a designated bike route. Just west of the study
area, on the other side of El Camino Real, California Avenue has striped bike lanes. Also
within the study area Park Boulevard has striped bike lanes. The project would enhance
the California Avenue bike route, with Sharrows painted on the pavement, to provide a
continuous bicycle connection to the Caltrain Station and to the Park Boulevard bike lanes.
The existing peak-hour bicycle volumes at the study intersections are shown on Figure 6.
Pedestrian facilities in the project area consist of sidewalks along all streets in the study
area and crosswalks at the intersections. The intersections at El Camino Real, Ash Street,
and Birch Street have crosswalks on all legs. The intersections at Park Boulevard have
some legs without crosswalks. In addition, there are four mid-block crosswalks across
California Avenue between the cross-streets. Thus, there are opportunities to cross
California Avenue every 275 feet or less. Based on field observations, there are many
pedestrians using the sidewalks and crosswalks during peak hours. The existing peak-
hour pedestrian volumes at the study intersection crosswalks are shown on Figure 7.




                                                                             14 | Page

Existing Transit Service

Existing transit service in the study area is provided by Caltrain, the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Agency (VTA), and the Stanford Marguerite shuttle. The California Avenue
Caltrain station is located at the terminus of California Avenue, which provides access to
the park-and-ride lot. There are two bus lines that operate on California Avenue: VTA
Route 89, which provides access from the Caltrain station to the Stanford industrial park,
and Marguerite Shuttle Route C, which provides access from Caltrain to the Stanford
University campus. In addition, there are seven VTA bus lines that operate on El Camino
Real and stop near California Avenue.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection level of service calculations show that the study intersections all operate at
LOS C or better during peak hours (see Table 4). These levels of service are indicative of
acceptable operations with little congestion. The STOP controlled intersections all operate
at LOS A or B. The signalized intersection of California Avenue and El Camino Real
operates at LOS C.

Existing Link Level of Service
Roadway links were analyzed using volume to capacity (V/C) ratios. The traffic volumes
were measured in the field using recent traffic counts. The results of this analysis are
summarized on Table 5. Under existing conditions, all of the study segments on California
Avenue operate at Level of Service A during the weekday AM, midday, and PM peak
hours.

Existing Queuing
Queue lengths were calculated for each of the study intersections to check whether any
excessive queues are occurring under existing conditions (see Table 6). At all of the STOP
controlled intersections the 95th percentile queue lengths are shown to be four cars at the
most (two cars per lane, 50 feet per lane). Queues are longest at the El Camino Real
intersection. The 95th percentile queues on westbound California Avenue are shown to be
up to 8 cars. The longest queues are for the through lane in the AM peak hour, the left turn
lane for the mid-day peak hour, and the right turn for the PM peak hour. The right turn lane
is of insufficient length to accommodate 8 cars. Therefore, some right turn cars queue in
the through lane.

California Avenue Lane Reduction ­ Traffic Analysis Report


Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational
deficiencies and to confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this
effort was (1) to identify any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to
intersection level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the level of service
calculation does not accurately reflect level of service in the field. Overall, the study
intersections operate well during the weekday AM, midday, and PM peak hours. Vehicles
were able to clear the signal on each cycle. Speeds on California Avenue are slow because of
cars hunting for parking spaces and because of numerous pedestrians crossing the street,
both in the crosswalks and between crosswalks. Also, there are many bicycles using
California Avenue to access the Caltrain station.




                                                                             23 | Page

Project Conditions
This chapter describes project traffic conditions, level of service results, and project
recommendations. Included are descriptions of the proposed project, identification of the
impacts, and descriptions of the mitigation measures.

Proposed Project Description
The proposed project would reduce the number of travel lanes on California Avenue between
El Camino Real and Park Boulevard from four travel lanes to two. The additional pavement
space provided from the lane reduction would be used for streetscape improvements including
decorative pavement bands, intersection bulb-outs, and to provide additional on-street parking
supply. Most of the parking spaces would be 60-degree angled parking spaces, although
some parallel parking will also be provided. At higher volume intersections such as El Camino
Real & California Avenue and Birch Street & California Avenue, additional approach lanes are
proposed to provide additional intersection capacity for traffic. All existing crosswalks for
pedestrians would be maintained with three additional crosswalks provided at the
intersections of Park Boulevard & California Avenue. Where bulb-out improvements are
proposed, existing crosswalk lengths would be reduced to improve pedestrian operations.
The project would also enhance the existing California Avenue Bike Route with the addition of
Sharrows stenciled onto the pavement. The proposed project plan is shown on Figures 8 & 9.

Traffic Volumes
For this analysis, the traffic volumes were assumed to be unchanged from those of existing
conditions. According to the City of Palo Alto, there are no pending projects or planned
projects in the foreseeable future. Therefore, traffic volumes on California Avenue between El
Camino Real and Park Boulevard will remain unchanged with the current land uses. The
reduction in capacity on California Avenue that would occur when narrowing from four lanes to
two lanes is not expected to displace any vehicles to parallel streets. As described below,
even with the narrowing, traffic delays and queues would be well within acceptable standards.




                                                                               24 | Page

Intersection Level of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under project conditions are
summarized in Table 7. The results indicate that, with the proposed reduction in travel lanes,
all of the study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable levels of service with
LOS C or better. The stop sign intersections would operate at LOS A or B. While some
intersection delays would increase slightly, each of the study intersections would continue to
operate well within capacity. Thus, the proposed project would not result in any adverse LOS
impacts to intersections on California Avenue. The level of service calculation sheets are
included in Appendix B.

Roadway Segment Level of Service
Roadway links were analyzed using volume to capacity (V/C) ratios. With the proposed lane
reduction, the volume of traffic on California Avenue would remain unchanged, but the
capacity of each direction would be reduced from 1,360 vehicles per hour to 560 vehicles per
hour. According to the publication Parking by Weant and Levinson, lane groups with 2 lanes
experience a 15% reduction in capacity when on-street parking is provided and parking
turnover is heavy (approximately 40 parking maneuvers per hour). For one lane streets, on-
street parking, and heavy parking turnover, a 30% decrease in capacity is expected. The
additional reduction in capacity occurs for one lane roadways because vehicles backing out of
spaces block the entire traveled way. With the two lane configuration, through traffic can
maneuver around vehicles backing out of spaces.



                                                                                         27 | Page 
California Avenue Lane Reduction ­ Traffic Analysis Report


The results of the volume to capacity analysis are summarized in Table 8. After conversion
from four lanes to two lanes, all of the study segments on California Avenue would operate at
Level of Service A or B during the weekday AM, midday, and PM peak hours, despite the
reduction in capacity. Thus, according to the City of Palo Alto level of service standards, the
proposed lane reduction would not result in any adverse LOS impacts to California Avenue.

Traffic Diversion
With any change to the roadway network there is the potential for traffic diversion. Traffic
diversion normally occurs when a proposed roadway network change would significantly alter
the vehicle delays in a corridor. As previously described, all of the intersections and roadway
segments on California Avenue, east of El Camino Road, would operate at LOS A or B with or
without the proposed lane reduction. Thus, there would remain plenty of capacity for vehicular
traffic on California Avenue even with the lane reduction. For this reason, no measurable
traffic diversion to other streets is anticipated.
It should be noted that the existing volumes on the adjacent streets parallel to California
Avenue, Cambridge Avenue and Sherman Avenue, are lower than California Avenue. Since
these volumes are low, even with the proposed lane reduction, the intersections of Birch
Street & Cambridge Avenue and Birch Street & Sherman Avenue would operate at LOS A for
all peak periods.




                                                                                                            28 | Page 
California Avenue Lane Reduction ­ Traffic Analysis Report


Intersection Queuing
A vehicle queuing analysis was conducted for the movements affected by the lane reduction
on California Avenue. Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution.
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to
estimate the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles for a particular movement;
(2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length,
assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to
the existing or planned available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus
provides a basis for estimating future storage requirements at intersections.
The vehicle queuing estimates and a tabulated summary of the findings are provided in
Tables 9, 10, and 11. The analysis indicates that, at all of the unsignalized study intersections
with the proposed lane reduction, the estimated 95th percentile vehicle queues for the
eastbound and westbound movements on California Avenue would be 2 or 3 vehicles or less.
These queues easily could be accommodated in the queuing space provided and would not
significantly interfere with parking maneuvers on California Avenue.
The proposed lane reduction would transition from one westbound lane to three lanes (one
left, one through, and one right) approximately 100 feet before intersection of El Camino Real
and California Avenue. Under existing conditions, this area transitions from two westbound
lanes to three lanes. According to the queuing analysis, with the proposed lane reduction, the
westbound 95th percentile queues would extend 200 feet from the subject intersection for the
following movements:
   ·   westbound through movement ­ AM peak hour
   ·   westbound left turn movement ­ Midday peak hour
   ·   westbound right turn movement ­ PM peak hour

During these periods, the 95th percentile queues for the other movements at the subject
approach would be 100 feet or more. Thus, under the proposed configuration, queues up to
200 feet could occur potentially blocking access to adjacent parking stalls and result in less
efficient use of green time at the El Camino Real/California Avenue intersection.
The project consultant explored the use of split phase at the intersection to reduce the
vehicles queues and determine whether better signal efficiency could be achieved using
shared lanes. Due to the heavy pedestrian crossing volume at the intersection, the level of
service calculations showed worse efficiency with split phase operation during all peak hours.
For this reason, it is recommended that the existing signal phasing and lane geometry be
maintained.
Recommendation: At California Avenue the existing two-lane to three-lane westbound
                approach to the El Camino Real intersection may be maintained to help
                provide adequate storage capacity for at least 200 feet from the
                intersection. This would result in the loss of the 5 new on-street parking
                spaces along the north side of California Avenue but still allows for the
                maintenance of the existing 12 on-street parking spaces in the segment
                providing for no overall parking loss. See Figure 10 for a diagram of the
                extended queues and modified parking spaces.

Alternate Extended Queue Storage Design at El Camino Real
California Avenue Lane Reduction ­ Traffic Analysis Report


Two Lane to One Lane Transitions
There are two locations where the proposed lane reduction would transition two lanes to
one lane. The 2010 California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices states that the
transition length for roads with a design speed of less than 45 mph is computed by the
following formula: L=WS2/60, where L is the transition length, S is the speed limit in MPH,
and W is the offset distance. Thus, to transition 12 feet with a speed limit of 25 mph would
require a taper of 125 feet.
The first transition location is located westbound on California Avenue just west of Birch
Street. This transition would move two lanes into one lane over approximately 125 feet. To
eliminate the need for lane merging along California Avenue, the westbound curb lane
may be converted to a dedicated right turn only lane to northbound Birch Street. This
configuration would add less than 1 second of average delay to the intersection during the
worst peak hour, and the intersection still would operate at LOS B. See Figure 11 for a
diagram of the alternate westbound geometry and transition to one lane.
The second merge location is on eastbound California Avenue just east of the El Camino
Real/California Avenue intersection. This segment transitions two lanes to one lane over
approximately 100 feet. Only one receiving lane is required because at any given time only
one lane from either the west side of El Camino Real, the southbound left turn approach of
El Camino Real, or the northbound right turn approach of El Camino Real feed traffic onto
California Avenue. The existing curb lane approaching the first mid-block crosswalk of the
project area may be removed to eliminate the need for lane merging. The curb lane can be
converted to a bus duckout for the existing Stanford Marguerite shuttle stop at the
intersection. This design would eliminate a stopped bus from blocking through traffic and
help to avoid operations impacts to the El Camino Real & California Avenue intersection.
See Figure 10 for an alternate design for the eastbound receiving lanes.

Impacts to Pedestrians, Bikes, & Transit
The project would maintain all existing crosswalks and sidewalks. In addition, three new
crosswalks would be provided at the intersections of Park Boulevard and California
Avenue (east and west). Overall, pedestrian mobility would be maintained or improved.
Prior to final design, the new crosswalk locations should be reviewed to ensure that
wheelchair ramps could be installed in accordance with Americans with Disabilities Act
requirements.
The project would make California Avenue east of El Camino Real into an enhanced bike
route, with Sharrows, to provide a continuous bicycle connection to the Caltrain Station
and to the Park Boulevard bike lanes. Generally, motor vehicle speeds would remain as is
or could be reduced slightly because fewer travel lanes would eliminate the ability of faster
drivers to pass slower drivers. Thus, conditions for bikes would be improved under the
proposed plan.

The project does not propose any changes to existing Caltrain or bus facilities. All existing
bus stops would be maintained. The proposed lane reduction would result in small
increases in travel time in the corridor due to the increased parking supply on California
Avenue and fewer travel lanes. However, the increased delays would be on the order of
two or three seconds and would not significantly adversely impact bus operations.

Geometric Considerations
As previously described, the project would add 60 degree angled parking along the study
segments of California Avenue. City of Palo Alto standards for angled parking require 16-
foot drive aisle widths adjacent to 9 foot wide parking stalls to allow vehicles to back out of
spaces without encroaching on the opposite direction travel lane. For most of the study
segment, the project would provide 18 to 19 foot street widths adjacent to 60 degree
angled parking, which would comply with City standards. However, three locations would
provide less back up space than recommended by City standards. On the south side
of California Avenue, just west of Ash Street, the back up distance shown on the current
plan would be 14.5 feet. On the north and south sides of California Avenue, between the
Park Boulevard intersections, the back up distance would be 13.5 feet.

While the City standard would not be met in these areas, the publication The Dimensions
of Parking, Fourth Edition by the Urban Land Institute (Table 8-4) shows that a
minimum street width of 14.5 feet is acceptable adjacent to 60 degree angled parking.
The City may wish to review the proposed plan to determine whether the existing street
width in these areas could be increased by slightly relocating double yellow lines or
changing the parking angle to 45-degrees. Potential alternate designs are discussed
below:

           o   For the proposed four angled parking spaces in the same location of the
               proposed Optional Outside Seating/Community Stage area on the south
               side of California Avenue between Ash Street and the mid-block crosswalk
               immediately west of Ash Street, changing these parking spaces from 60-
               degrees to 45-degrees does not result in a loss of proposed on-street
               parking spaces within this street segment.

           o   For the proposed six angled parking spaces along the north side of
               California Avenue between Park Boulevard and the driveway entrance to
               the Molly Stone market, changing these parking spaces from 60-degrees to
               45-degrees results in the loss of one new parking space providing five
               spaces instead. This is still one space more than the existing four parking
               spaces under existing conditions.

           o   For the proposed eight angled parking spaces along the south side of
               California Avenue between Park Boulevard (East) and Park Boulevard
               (West), changing these parking spaces from 60-degrees to 45-degrees
               results in the loss of two new parking spaces providing six spaces instead.
               This is still one space more than the existing five parking spaces under
               existing conditions.

See Figure 12 for a diagram of potential changes to the proposed parking between the
Park Boulevard intersections. Note that with the recommended angle changes to the
parking, the total number of proposed parking spaces on the study segment would be 124
spaces with 13 net new spaces.

Conclusion
The proposed lane reduction was reviewed in accordance with City of Palo Alto and Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) ­ Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines.
According to the City of Palo Alto, there are no pending projects or planned projects in the
foreseeable future. Therefore, traffic volumes on California Avenue between El Camino
Real and Park Boulevard will remain unchanged with the current land uses. An analysis of
intersection Level of Service (LOS), street segment LOS, and intersection queuing was
conducted to determine whether the project would result in any significant adverse impacts
under project conditions with the lane reduction. Based on this analysis, the proposed lane
reduction would not result in any adverse significant LOS impacts to intersections or
roadway segments, both of which would continue to operate well within capacity (LOS A or
B). Because sufficient capacity would be maintained on California Avenue, no traffic
diversion is expected to occur with the proposed lane reduction. The project would
enhance pedestrian circulation with added crosswalks and enhance bicycle safety with
Sharrows painted on the pavement. The project would not change existing bus stops, so
there would not be any impact to transit service.
The study recommends the following enhancements to the design:
           ·   At California Avenue the existing two-lane to three-lane westbound
               approach to the El Camino Real intersection may be maintained to help
               provide adequate storage capacity for at least 200 feet from the
               intersection. This would result in the loss of the 5 new on-street parking
               spaces along the north side of California Avenue but still allows for the
               maintenance of the existing 12 on-street parking spaces in the segment
               providing for no overall parking loss.
           ·   The proposed crosswalk additions at the intersections of California Avenue
               & Park Boulevard should be reviewed to ensure that wheelchair ramps can
               be installed in accordance with American Disabilities Act requirements.
           ·   The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept proposes to
               maintain the existing two-lane westbound approach at Birch Street. Two
               lanes are also proposed for maintenance immediately west of Birch Street
               approaching the mid-block crosswalk west of the Birch Street intersection.
               To eliminate the need for lane merging along California Avenue, the


                                                                             38 | Page

               westbound curb lane may be converted to a dedicated right turn only lane
               to northbound Birch Street.
           ·   The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept also proposed to
               maintain the existing two receiving lanes for eastbound California Avenue
               at El Camino Real. Only one receiving lane is required because at any
               given time only one lane from either the west side of El Camino Real, the
               southbound left turn approach of El Camino Real, or the northbound right
               turn approach of El Camino Real feed traffic onto California Avenue. The
               existing curb lane approaching the first mid-block crosswalk of the project
               area may be removed to eliminate the need for lane merging. The curb lane
               can be converted to a bus duckout for the existing Stanford Marguerite
               shuttle stop at the intersection. This design would eliminate a stopped bus
               from blocking through traffic and help to avoid operations impacts to the El
               Camino Real & California Avenue intersection.
            · Three proposed on-street parking segments on California Avenue do not
              meet the City's existing parking standards providing adjacent lane widths
              that are too narrow for vehicles to back out of angled parking spaces. To
              comply with the City's parking standards these segments could be
              reconfigured to 45-degree parking stalls. The three parking segments are
              as follows:

                    o   The proposed four angled parking spaces in the same location of
                        the proposed Optional Outside Seating/Community Stage area on
                        the south side of California Avenue between Ash Street and the
                        mid-block crosswalk immediately west of Ash Street. Changing
                        these parking spaces from 60-degrees to 45-degrees does not
                        result in a loss of proposed on-street parking spaces within this
                        street segment.

                    o   The proposed six angled parking spaces along the north side of
                        California Avenue between Park Boulevard and the driveway
                        entrance to the Molly Stone market. Changing these parking spaces
                        from 60-degrees to 45-degrees results in the loss of one new
                        parking space providing five spaces instead. This is still one space
                        more than the existing four parking spaces under existing
                        conditions.

                    o   The proposed eight angled parking spaces along the south side of
                        California Avenue between Park Boulevard (East) and Park
                        Boulevard (West). Changing these parking spaces from 60-degrees
                        to 45-degrees results in the loss of two new parking spaces
                        providing six spaces instead. This is still one space more than the
                        existing five parking spaces under existing conditions.

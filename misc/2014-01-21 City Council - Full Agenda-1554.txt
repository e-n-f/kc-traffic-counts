    Did you know that each year more than 350 million pairs
    of shoes are tossed in our landfills for a resting place?
    Also, did you know some, like high-tech shoes, take as
    much as 1,000 years to decompose. Leather shoes may




                                                                               Attachment: Shoe Recycling Drive 2014 Community and City Flyer FK (1839 : KEPB "Shoe Recycling Drive" Presentation)
    take 45 years and rubber-soled shoes may take 80
    years!

     Keep East Point Beautiful is thrilled to launch
          a community-wide Shoe Recycling Campaign.
Goals of the campaign are to divert 50,000 or more pairs of shoes
from the transfer station and landfill, reuse them by sending them
to developing countries and raise funds to support KEPB
programs and projects. This campaign not only confirms KEPB's
commitment to promoting environmental stewardship; it will also
allow KEPB to demonstrate good will towards others. "The shoes
will be refurbished and disinfected then sent to undeveloped
countries where the shoes will be welcomed," Frances Kennedy
said.
Shoes should be gently used or new. All types of shoes are
acceptable: baby, children, women and men. Work shoes and
sports shoes will do just find also. You are asked to collect them
in large black trash bags containing 25 pairs each. (25 pair of men,
women or children's shoes in each bag) KEPB's goal is to collect
2,000 bags of shoes.
Shoes that are collected will be placed in the storage collect trailer
between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on January 31, February 14 and 28, and
March 14 and 28. The trailer collection location will be designated
before the first collection date and time.

    The Star Community, Star Business, Star City
    Department, and Star Elected Official collecting
    the most bags of shoes, over 5 bags, will be
    rewarded and designated as "KEPB STARS."

         Councilmember Martin stated that there have been citizens asking about where the City Manager's Office
         is now located. Councilmember Martin mentioned that she had two concerns with the changes. The first

         employees into City Hall which was deemed as hazardous; and would like an assessment done which will
         include additional office spaces.

         employees to see his work ethic and it is his responsibility to make sure that a system is in place to have
         any concerns addressed immediately. As for the assessment, Mr. Mitchell stated that there was one done
         and he and staff are in the process of going through the Capital Improvement budget to complete what
         needs to be done.

         Councilmember Cook stated that if City Hall is hazardous to some staff members, then it should be
         hazardous to all staff members.

         Councilmember Holiday Ingraham motioned to have this agenda item sent to the January 13, 2014 Work
         Session, and to include data on how citizens are reaching out via telephone, emails or personal visits.

         without a lobbyist to help secure state and federal funds and we have not been at the table with our state
         elected officials to ensure that the needs of East Point are considered under the gold dome this legislative
         session. Asking the City Manager to reach out to our state elected officials, who are representatives
         Margaret Kaiser and LaDawn Blackett Jones, as well as Senator Vincent Fort and arrange a legislative
         roundtable between the representatives and this council. Their 40-day legislative session begins a week
         from today. East Point continues to make progress, with the Wal-Mart and Cleveland Crossing Shopping

City Council ACTION REQUEST ON:

PURPOSE:         Request that the East Point City Council approve the Preliminary Plat for the Villages @ Redwine -
Phase 1B, with conditions, located at Redwine Road & North Commerce Drive.



HISTORY:         The site located along Redwine Road @ North Commerce Drive is vacant land that was rezoned in
2008 for a mixed-use development. The total property consists of approximately eighty-one (81) acres and was
rezoned to C-1 (Neighborhood Commercial) with conditions and R-4 (Multifamily) with conditions. The zoning case
number was 2007Z-016-10 with a concurrent variance case number 2007V-019-10 (see attached ordinance). The
proposed project consisted of 42,000sf of retail/office space, 375-midrise apartment units, 460-garden apartment
units, 110-townhomes, 47-single family lots and 17.44-acres (21.8%) of open space (see attached site plan).

Since the 2008 approval of the rezoning with concurrent variances, ownership of the site has changed and the
economy has changed. Morningstar Investment Group, LLC has recently acquired approximately 71-acres of the
original development site and has proposed five (5) phases: 1A, 1B, 2, 3 and 4.



FACTS and ISSUES:             Morningstar Investment Group, LLC has submitted a preliminary plat for Phase 1B of the
Villages @ Redwine. This phase proposes construction of 258 multifamily residential units on 16.83 acres ( see
attached rendering and site plan with mark-up).

Staff recommends approval of the Preliminary Plat with the following conditions:

     1.     Must adhere to the amenities package requirement found in Section 10-2066 of the East Point Zoning
            Code & Regulations.

     2.     Applicant must construct stub-street which aligns to the intersection of North Commerce Drive at
            Redwine Road to the limits of the Phase 1B project.

     3.     Must construct all sidewalks in accordance with the East Point Code of Ordinances.

                                                                                                               Packet Pg. 35

Action Item (ID # 1754)                                                                Meeting of January 21, 2014




     4.     Architectural features shall be comparable to the architectural features of the adjacent multifamily
            complex located at Princeton Lakes.

     5.     Must adhere to the conditions of zoning and concurrent variances approved September 22, 2008 of case
            #2007Z-016-10 and 2007V-019-10.

     6.     Preliminary Plat must show all phases (current and future) associated with the overall site development
            plan.

     7.     Planted landscape strip shall be required along frontage of Redwine Road.

Public Notice signs were posted for the Community Zoning Information Meeting (CZIM) held on September 17, 2013.
The Planning & Zoning Commission Meeting was held October 17, 2013.

The Commission recommended APPROVAL of the Preliminary Plat-Phase 1B per staff's recommendation with one
exception: The Commission recommended that condition #2 be removed and the stub street/driveway be
constructed as shown on the preliminary plat submitted by the developer.

During the November 11, 2013 Work Session Council requested additional information regarding occupancy rates at
the existing complexes located on Redwine Road and options to alleviate congestion. See the attached documents
regarding this issue; E-mail dated November 13, 2013 and 1980 Redwine Road abandonment ordinance.



OPTIONS:             1. Council can approve the Preliminary Plat w/conditions for the Villages @ Redwine Phase -1B
                         per staff's recommendation

                      2. Council can approve the Preliminary Plat w/conditions for the Villages @ Redwine Phase- 1B
                          per the Planning & Zoning Commission's recommendation

                      3. Council can approve the Preliminary Plat with no conditions for the Villages @ Redwine
                         Phase -1B

                      4. Council can deny the Preliminary Plat w/conditions for Villages @ Redwine -Phase 1B



RECOMMENDED ACTION:

Council has the governing authority to choose one of the options listed above or make a different decision.

Hi Corliss and Brad,
 
This e-mail is in response to some of the congestion issues and occupancy rates
Council mentioned Monday regarding the above subject application.  The
information can be forwarded to them for their review.
 
Traffic Congestion
Attached is a copy of the easement Council granted to property owner Larry Dodson
(3541 Prince George Street) in 1980.  If I read it correctly, the easement was only
valid as long as Mr. Dodson and/or his heirs owned the property.  However, the
property is now owned by George & Kathleen Alford.
 
The re-opening of Redwine Road is an option for Council's consideration to alleviate
some of the vehicle "stacking" issues on North Desert Drive and Washington Road. 
If re-opened, the City could possibly install traffic-calming devices such as round-a-
bouts, speed bumps, planted median, etc.  Redwine Road provides connection
between Washington Road in East Point and Fairburn Road in Atlanta.  It also
would be an alternative to having all vehicles use Washington Road to access Camp
Creek Parkway.
 
Occupancy Rates
I also checked on the occupancy rates for The Landings @ Princeton Lakes and
Landmark @ Creekside Grand.  Both complexes are located on Redwine Road and
immediately adjacent to the proposed project site.  The Landings is in Atlanta, has
350-units, an occupancy rate of 92% and a preleased rate of 96%.    Landmark is in
East Point, has 492-units, an occupancy rate of 85% and a preleased rate of 88%. 
 
Let me know if you have additional questions.
 
Thanks for your attention.

Re:      Memorandum for the proposed The Village at Redwine
         Trip Generation Comparison and Turn Lane Determination
         City of East Point, Georgia


Dear Michael:

Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. is pleased to provide this memorandum
comparing the trip generation of the new proposed site plan for The Village at
Redwine. The approximate 16-acre development is located along the north side of
Redwine Road directly across from North Commerce Drive in the City of East
Point, Georgia. Proposed access to the development will occur by constructing the
4th leg (north leg) of the Redwine Road/North Commerce Drive intersection. This
site was reviewed by GRTA in 2008, named Village at Redwine DRI #1627
(approved in April 2008). The purpose of this memorandum is to demonstrate that
the current proposed site plan is projected to generate less traffic than the original
DRI density from 2008 and to determine whether or not additional left-turn or right-
turn lanes are warranted along Redwine Road at the proposed site driveway.


                   SITE OVERVIEW AND PROJECT TRAFFIC

A summary of the original DRI densities and the currently-proposed densities for
the overall project are provided in Table 1 below. Please note that the industry
standard for conducting trip generation analyses has been updated since the original
DRI approval in 2008 with the release of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th
Edition, 2012. For accurate comparison, the original DRI densities have been
reevaluated using equations from the new 9th Edition of the manual (previously
calculated using the 7th Edition), which includes revised equations based on more
recently-observed trip generation data. The land use for this development was
assumed to be ITE Code 220 ­ Apartments.

 Site Plan


   For the 9th edition comparison shown in Table 1, the proposed density changes
   (2014 site plan) will result in approximately 22% and 20% fewer vehicular trips
   expected during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively, when compared to the
   expected number of trips from the original DRI density in 2008, as well as
   approximately 21% fewer daily trips.

   Based upon traffic counts performed on January 8, 2014 at the proposed site
   driveway (Redwine Road @ North Commerce Drive) and at near-by intersections
   (Crestridge Drive @ Redwine Road and Creekside Grand @ Redwine Road), the
   distribution of traffic entering and exiting the proposed site was estimated. The PM
   peak hour was determined to be the most critical hour due to the fact that it has the
   highest entering volume for any one-hour interval into the proposed site. The
   distribution of traffic for the PM peak hour was estimated to be 30% entering the
   site from the east (right-turn into site), 20% entering the site from the west (left-turn
   into site), and 50% entering the site from the south (through movement into the
   site).

   Furthermore, intersection level-of-service analyses were performed at the
   intersection of Redwine Road and North Commerce Drive for the 2014 Existing
   AM peak hour and PM peak hour scenarios. The unsignalized T-intersection
   currently operates as an All-Way Stop controlled intersection. It was found that the
   intersection currently experiences an intersection delay of 9.4 s/veh (LOS A) during
   the AM peak hour and 22.6 s/veh (LOS C) during the PM peak hour. Both of

                          DRIVEWAY TURN-LANE REQUIREMENTS

   Fulton County's Driveway Manual was used to determine if turn lanes are needed
   for the proposed site driveway based on the traffic volumes expected to be generated
   by the proposed development as depicted in Table 1.

   In order to evaluate if turn lanes are recommended, the Average Daily Traffic
   (ADT) along Redwine Road is needed. AM and PM peak hour traffic data collected
   on January 8, 2014 was used to determine the ADT. The ADT along Redwine Road
   (including the expected traffic to be generated by the proposed development) in the
   vicinity of the proposed driveway is approximately 7,800 vehicles per day. As
   stated earlier, the site is anticipated to consist of 258 apartment units. This equates
   to 844 trips exiting the site and 844 trips entering the site throughout a 24-hour day.

   The speed along Redwine Road in the vicinity of the proposed driveway is 35 mph.

   Right-Turn Deceleration Lane Requirement
   Fulton County states that a right-turn deceleration lane must be constructed if the
   daily site generated right-turn volumes (RTV) meet or exceed the values shown in
   Table 2. Applying the assumption that 30 percent of users will access the proposed
   site from the east along Redwine Road to the gross trip generation listed in Table 1,
   approximately 253 vehicles are expected to turn right into the proposed driveway
   during a 24-hour day.

                                             Table 2
                             Minimum Volumes Requiring Right-Turn Lanes

                                                2 Lanes on Main Road                     > 2 Lanes on Main Road
Posted Speed Limit                            35-40 MPH             > 40 MPH             35-40 MPH    > 40 MPH
Main Roadway ADT                                 8,000                 4,000                12,000      10,000
Daily Right Turning Volume                        150                    75                  150         75

   The threshold is 150 daily RTVs for a 2-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of
   35 mph. Additionally, the threshold for 15 peak hour RTVs is met. Based on Table
   2, a westbound right-turn lane from Redwine Road into the proposed driveway is
   warranted.

   Left-Turn Lane Requirement
   Fulton County states that a left-turn lane must be constructed if the daily site
   generated left-turn volumes (LTV) meet or exceed the values shown in Table 3.
   Applying the assumption that 20 percent of users will access the proposed site from
   the west along Redwine Road to the gross trip generation listed in Table 1,
   approximately 169 vehicles are expected to turn left into the proposed driveway
   during a 24-hour day.

   The threshold is 300 daily LTVs for a 2-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of
   35 mph. Additionally, the threshold for 30 peak hour LTVs is not met. Based on
   Table 3, an eastbound left-turn lane from Redwine Road into the proposed driveway
   is not warranted.


                          CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

   It was found that the changes in land use densities for the currently-proposed site
   plan (258 apartments) will result in a reduction in projected trips generated by the
   project compared to the previously-approved DRI (2008). Per Fulton County
   Regulations, however, a westbound right-turn lane may be required along Redwine
   Road to serve the vehicles entering the proposed site. Also, the minimum right-turn
   deceleration lane lengths are 100 feet of full-width storage with a 50-foot taper, for
   a 35 mph roadway. With the installation of this right-turn lane at the proposed site
   driveway, it is recommended that adequate sight distance be provided. The level-of-
   service at this intersection currently operates at an acceptable level of LOS A and
   LOS C during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively.


   I hope this information is helpful. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Proposed Charter Amendment
City of East Point
2014 Legislative Session




                                                                                                                 Attachment: Resolution to Amend Tax Exemption for Elderly and Disabled Residents (1832 : Senior Property Tax Exemption)
Amend City Charter to Remove Millage Rate Cap and Amend Tax Exemption
Executive Summary

The Mayor and City Council are seeking an amendment to the City Charter to remove the
millage rate cap now contained in Section 5-202 and to amend the tax exemption in Section 5-
211 for the elderly and disabled. Neither the fifteen (15) millage rate cap nor the tax exemption
has been amended since adoption of the City's 2007 Charter, (Ga. L. 2007, p. 3878).

The City's millage rate for fiscal year 2014 is 15, which is at the maximum, and the inability to
raise the millage rate has caused the City to severely cut operating expenses due to the lack of
operating revenue generated from property taxes. The City of East Point, like so many other
surrounding municipalities, has experienced a continuous decline in the value of a mil because of
the downturn in the economy. Accordingly, the Mayor and City Council are seeking this Charter
amendment to fulfill the Charter's directive that "[t]he city council shall levy by ordinance such
taxes as are necessary to provide for the operation, maintenance, support, and expenses of the
city and its various functions and departments, including such taxes as are necessary for the
payment of the principal and interest of the bonded indebtedness and related sinking funds of the
city as the same shall become due and payable. The taxes and tax rates set by such ordinance
shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy shall at least be sufficient,
together with other anticipated revenues, fund balances, and applicable reserves, to equal the
total amount appropriated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget
and current year capital budget for defraying the expenses of the general government of this
city." Section 5-201. Hence, the removal of the millage cap is necessary for operating expenses
as well as to preserve and protect the City's ability to participate in future revenue bond projects,
essential to the City of East Point's continued growth, development and economic sustainability.

The City of East Point is obligated to guarantee the repayment of outstanding revenue bonds for
utility purposes and the purchase of the customer care, and the South Fulton County Municipal
Water and Sewer Authority. The City's participation in these projects is necessary for their long
term success and the City's viability. Moreover, the City is currently leasing space for its
government offices and would like to move the City to be in a position to finance a government
complex. Finally, the City is obligated to pay its $59 million owed in unfunded pension benefits.

Similarly, the City is requesting to amend the tax exemption for the elderly and disabled.

As a result of the City Charter's millage cap and the tax exemption, the City of East Point 's
General Fund has insufficient ability to generate sufficient revenue for future operating expenses
and to guarantee the repayment of additional revenue bond debt. This inability to guarantee such
debt in the future could significantly increase the interest rate applicable to such debt, thereby
significantly decreasing the financial viability of future projects that otherwise would provide
long term economic advantages for both the City of East Point and the surrounding area.
Accordingly, the Mayor and City Council are respectfully requesting that the City Charter be

Proposed Charter Amendment
City of East Point
2014 Legislative Session

Amend City Charter to Remove Millage Rate Cap and Amend Tax Exemption
Executive Summary




                                                                                                                 Attachment: Resolution to Remove Millage Rate Cap (1833 : Removal of the Cap on the Millage Rate)
The Mayor and City Council are seeking an amendment to the City Charter to remove the
millage rate cap now contained in Section 5-202 and to amend the tax exemption in Section 5-
211 for the elderly and disabled. Neither the fifteen (15) millage rate cap nor the tax exemption
has been amended since adoption of the City's 2007 Charter, (Ga. L. 2007, p. 3878).

The City's millage rate for fiscal year 2014 is 15, which is at the maximum, and the inability to
raise the millage rate has caused the City to severely cut operating expenses due to the lack of
operating revenue generated from property taxes. The City of East Point, like so many other
surrounding municipalities, has experienced a continuous decline in the value of a mil because of
the downturn in the economy. Accordingly, the Mayor and City Council are seeking this Charter
amendment to fulfill the Charter's directive that "[t]he city council shall levy by ordinance such
taxes as are necessary to provide for the operation, maintenance, support, and expenses of the
city and its various functions and departments, including such taxes as are necessary for the
payment of the principal and interest of the bonded indebtedness and related sinking funds of the
city as the same shall become due and payable. The taxes and tax rates set by such ordinance
shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy shall at least be sufficient,
together with other anticipated revenues, fund balances, and applicable reserves, to equal the
total amount appropriated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget
and current year capital budget for defraying the expenses of the general government of this
city." Section 5-201. Hence, the removal of the millage cap is necessary for operating expenses
as well as to preserve and protect the City's ability to participate in future revenue bond projects,
essential to the City of East Point's continued growth, development and economic sustainability.

The City of East Point is obligated to guarantee the repayment of outstanding revenue bonds for
utility purposes and the purchase of the customer care, and the South Fulton County Municipal
Water and Sewer Authority. The City's participation in these projects is necessary for their long
term success and the City's viability. Moreover, the City is currently leasing space for its
government offices and would like to move the City to be in a position to finance a government
complex. Finally, the City is obligated to pay its $59 million owed in unfunded pension benefits.

Similarly, the City is requesting to amend the tax exemption for the elderly and disabled.

As a result of the City Charter's millage cap and the tax exemption, the City of East Point 's
General Fund has insufficient ability to generate sufficient revenue for future operating expenses
and to guarantee the repayment of additional revenue bond debt. This inability to guarantee such
debt in the future could significantly increase the interest rate applicable to such debt, thereby
significantly decreasing the financial viability of future projects that otherwise would provide
long term economic advantages for both the City of East Point and the surrounding area.
Accordingly, the Mayor and City Council are respectfully requesting that the City Charter be

amended to remove the Charter's millage cap and to amend the tax exemption as set forth on the
following pages.

                INTRODUCTION

                SunGard Public Sector ("SunGard") will rent to you, and you will rent from SunGard, the personal property (the
                "Equipment") listed on the Rental Agreement.




                                                                                                                                                        Attachment: SunGard Rental Agreement East Point GA (1842 : Approval of Three (3) Year Rental Agreement with NaviLine/SunGard)
                DELIVERY; INSTALLATION

                SunGard will use reasonable efforts to deliver the Equipment to you on or before the estimated delivery date on the
                Rental Agreement. If no date is indicated, the Equipment will be delivered on such date as is consistent with Equipment
                availability and SunGard's normal business practices.

                You are responsible for providing a suitable installation location meeting all applicable manufacturer's environmental
                specifications and local fire and building codes. Upon delivery, you will be responsible for all unpacking, set-up and
                installation of the Equipment.

                TERM

                The rental term will commence upon the delivery of the Equipment to the Installation Site (the "Commencement
                Date"); upon request you will sign a certificate confirming such date. The rental term will continue for the rental term
                (the "Rental Term") specified on the Rental Agreement. The term may continue on an annual basis at the same rental
                rate, subject to your council approval and provided that you confirm such intent prior to commencement of such
                renewal term. Upon conclusion of the Rental Term or any renewal term, provided that you have not indicated your
                intent to renew, you must return the equipment to SunGard in the manner and condition specified in the Rental
                Agreement. You agree to pay for the transportation costs for return of the Equipment. In the event of termination by
                you prior to the end of the Rental Term, all remaining Yearly Rental payments, if any, shall become immediately due
                and payable.

                PAYMENT

                You will pay to SunGard the Yearly Rental for the Equipment, without deduction or offset, in advance of the
                Commencement Date anniversary date.

                You agree to pay all transportation and installation charges. In addition, you agree to pay all taxes, fees or other
                charges (plus any interest and penalties not arising solely from SunGard's negligence) imposed or assessed with
                respect to this Agreement and the charges paid hereunder, or the Equipment and its use.

                You agree to pay for Services and Project Management fees which are due on invoice, as incurred.

                Applicable taxes are not included, and, if applicable, will be added to the amount in the payment of invoice(s)
                being sent separately.

                Any applicable travel and living expenses relating to Services hereunder which are scheduled with you in
                advance are due as incurred monthly, are in addition to the prices quoted above and shall be governed by the
                SunGard Public Sector Corporate Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy.

                Payment will be made in U.S. Dollars to the address specified in SunGard's invoice. Any payment not made within ten
                (10) days after the due date will accrue interest, until paid, at the lover of 18% per annum or the maximum rate
                allowed by law.

                NON-APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS

                You believe that sufficient funds can be obtained to pay all amounts due SunGard throughout the term of this rental
                agreement and you hereby covenant and agree that you will make appropriate requests for budget appropriations for
                the fiscal years in amounts as specified herein. You further agree that said funds, once appropriated, will be
                maintained and expended for the expressed purpose of acquiring from SunGard the rental and services set forth
                herein.

                In the event sufficient funds are not appropriated, not budgeted or not otherwise legally available, you shall
                immediately notify SunGard of such occurrence and SunGard will respond with a proclamation that this rental
                agreement, or the appropriate executory portions thereof, is terminated. Should there be any premature termination
                of this rental agreement, you shall be responsible to pay a) for any services delivered by SunGard prior to the notice
                and b) for all rental fees which have been incurred.

                OWNERSHIP; USE

                This is a rental agreement, and SunGard shall retain all ownership rights in the Equipment. If the Equipment includes

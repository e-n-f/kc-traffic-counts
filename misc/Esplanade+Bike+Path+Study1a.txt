EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
OVERVIEW
The purpose of this report is to identify the potential traffic impacts associated with the
installation of a bike lane on Esplanade Avenue from Claiborne Avenue to City Park Avenue
in New Orleans, LA, by restriping the four-lane geometry on Esplanade Avenue into a two-
lane geometry.

The capacity of a highway system is predicated by two components: the capacity of the
included roadway sections and the capacity of the affected intersections along the route.
Intersecting roadways generally provide the initial constraint on a system's capacity.
Efficiency at the intersections becomes the critical constraint for capacity. Vehicle
interactions at these points must therefore be analyzed to assess the projected operation and
capacity levels.

Based on a comprehensive review of the vicinity roadway network, the intersection of
Esplanade Avenue and N Broad Street was determined to be the critical intersection for the
study corridor.

ITS Regional, LLC staff conducted manual traffic counts for the AM peak hours and PM
peak hours at the intersection of Esplanade Avenue and N Broad Street. Four scenarios
(existing volumes with existing intersection geometry (Year 2012), existing volumes with
proposed intersection geometry (Year 2012), twenty year future projections with existing
intersection geometry (Year 2032) and twenty year future projections with proposed
geometry (2032)) were analyzed as a part of this traffic impact study. A growth rate of
0.75% was used in the calculation of background growth. This growth rate was provided by
the Regional Planning Commission staff based on archived data and projection models.


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A comparison of the Synchro analysis output reports for the four study scenarios (existing
Year 2012 volumes with existing intersection geometry, existing Year 2012 volumes with
proposed intersection geometry, projected Year 2032 volumes with existing intersection
geometry and projected Year 2032 volumes with proposed intersection geometry)
demonstrates that the study intersections are expected to operate within acceptable LOS
thresholds and will not create significant impacts through the analysis period.

It is recommended that the proposed Esplanade Avenue bike lane be installed in the existing
travel way by restriping the existing Esplanade Avenue corridor to accommodate one
through lane, one bike lane and one right turn lane for the Esplanade Avenue approaches at
the intersection with N. Broad Street.

I. INTRODUCTION

Purpose

The study identifies the potential traffic impact associated with restriping of the Esplanade
Avenue corridor from Claiborne Avenue to City Park Avenue to accommodate a bike lane
for the river bound and lake bound approaches on Esplanade Avenue.

The objectives of this study are as follows:
    To adequately assess the traffic impacts associated with the restriping of Esplanade
       Avenue from Claiborne Avenue to City Park Avenue to accommodate the proposed
       bike lane on Esplanade Avenue for the river bound and lake bound approaches;
    To provide public agencies a comprehensive study which evaluates and documents
       the traffic impacts and recommendations associated with the restriping of Esplanade
       Avenue for the proposed bike lane installation;

This study includes the evaluation of the traffic operations at the study intersection for four
scenarios: existing volumes with existing intersection geometry (Year 2012), existing volumes
with proposed intersection geometry (Year 2012), twenty year projections with existing
intersection geometry (Year 2032) and twenty year projections with proposed geometry
(Year 2032).

II. STUDY AREA
Figure 1A contains the area map, which illustrates the location of the proposed bike lane
corridor and the following study intersection:

       Esplanade Avenue at N Broad Street


Esplanade Avenue at N Broad Street is a four-way intersection. Traffic is controlled at the
intersection by a traffic signal. In an effort to simplify the intersection analysis Esplanade
Avenue, a four lane divided roadway segment with on street parking, was assumed to
operate in the east-west direction while N Broad Street, a four lane boulevard with on street
parking, was assumed to operate in the north-south direction. Left turn movements at this
intersection are prohibited.

Esplanade Avenue in the vicinity of the study intersection extends from the City Park to the
east to the River front on the west. N Broad Street in the vicinity of the study intersection
extends from Canal Street on the south to I-610 on the north.

III. INTERSECTION ANALYSES
Analysis Methodology

The capacity of a highway system is predicated by two components: the capacity of the
included roadway sections and the capacity of the affected intersections along the route.
Intersecting roadways generally provide the initial constraint on a system's capacity.
Efficiency at the intersections becomes the critical constraint for capacity. Vehicle
interactions at these points must therefore be analyzed to assess the projected operation and
capacity levels.

The standard procedure for capacity analysis of signalized and unsignalized intersections is
outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research Board.
Synchro was used in analyzing operating conditions at study area intersections. The
procedure yields a Level of Service (LOS) as an indicator of how well intersections operate.

The concept of Level of Service is defined as a qualitative measurement describing operating
conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by motorists and/or passengers.
Level of Service is defined in terms of delay which is a measure of driver discomfort,
frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time.

Six Levels of Service, with corresponding levels of delay are defined for analysis. They are
assigned letter designations, from "A" to "F", with LOS "A" representing the best
conditions (little or no delay), LOS "C" average conditions and LOS "F" the worst
(excessive delay).

The projected traffic volumes, generated by the site are added to the background traffic
volumes and analyzed to assess the capacity potential of the study area intersections.
Suggested ranges of service capacity, related delay, and an explanation of Levels of Service
are included in the Appendix. Table I depicts LOS criteria for Signalized Intersections.

IV.    EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES WITH EXISTING
       INTERSECTION GEOMETRY

Weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic counts were obtained by ITS Regional, Inc. staff at
the study area intersections. Data collection occurred between 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and
3:00 PM to 6:00 PM on Tuesday, April 24, 2012. These time frames were selected because
they represent the greatest combination of weekday traffic on the adjacent roadways. The
turning movement count data is included in Appendix A.

The existing intersection geometry consists of two (2) through lane lanes for both
approaches on Esplanade Avenue and two (2) through lane lanes for both approaches on
Broad Street. A cycle length of 90 seconds was used for the analysis.

Figure 2 illustrates the existing weekday peak hour traffic volumes at the study intersection.

The peak hour operations at the study intersection were analyzed using Synchro with the
existing roadway geometry and existing Year 2012 traffic volumes. Capacity results of the
existing Year 2012 conditions are contained in Table II.

V.     EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES WITH MODIFIED
       INTERSECTION GEOMETRY

The existing Year 2012 weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic counts obtained by ITS
Regional, Inc. staff at the study area intersections were analyzed with the proposed modified
intersection geometry required to incorporate a bike lane on Esplanade Avenue for the river
bound and lake bound approaches.

The proposed modified intersection geometry consists of one (1) bike lane, one (1) through
lane and one (1) right turn lane on Esplanade Avenue for the river bound (eastbound) and
lake bound (westbound) approaches. No modifications are proposed for the N Broad Street
approaches. A cycle length of 90 seconds was used for the analysis.

A copy of the modified intersection geometry with the bike lanes is included in Appendix
C.


The peak hour operations at the study intersection were analyzed using Synchro with the
existing Year 2012 traffic volumes and modified roadway geometry. Capacity results of the
existing Year 2012 conditions are contained in Table III.

VI.    YEAR 2032 TRAFFIC VOLUME WITH EXISTING
       INTERSECTION GEOMETRY

The existing Year 2012 weekday peak hour volumes were grown by a 0.75% growth rate for
20 years to obtain the Year 2032 background peak hour volumes. The 0.75 % growth rate
was provided by the Regional Planning Commission staff based on archived data and
projection models.

Year 2032 Traffic = Year 2012 Traffic x 0.75 % Growth for 20 Years

Figure 3 illustrates the Year 2032 weekday peak hour traffic volumes at the study
intersection. The Year 2032 traffic volume calculations are included in Appendix E.

The peak hour operations at the study intersection were analyzed using Synchro Software
with the existing roadway geometry and projected Year 2032 traffic volumes. A cycle length
of 90 seconds was used for the analysis. Capacity results of the Year 2032 conditions are
shown in Table IV.

VII. YEAR 2032 TRAFFIC VOLUME WITH MODIFIED
     INTERSECTION GEOMETRY

The existing Year 2012 weekday peak hour volumes were grown by a 0.75% growth rate for
20 years to obtain the Year 2032 background peak hour volumes. The 0.75 % growth rate
was provided by the Regional Planning Commission staff based on archived data and
projection models.

Year 2032 Traffic = Year 2012 Traffic x 0.75 % Growth for 20 Years

The Year 2032 traffic volume calculations are included in Appendix E.

The Year 2032 projected traffic volumes at the study area intersections were analyzed with
the proposed modified intersection geometry required to incorporate a bike lane on
Esplanade Avenue for the river bound and lake bound approaches.

The proposed modified intersection geometry consists of one (1) bike lane, one (1) through
lane and one (1) right turn lane on Esplanade Avenue for the river bound (eastbound) and
lake bound (westbound) approaches. No modifications are proposed for the N Broad Street
approaches.

A copy of the modified intersection geometry with the bike lanes is included in Appendix
C.

The peak hour operations at the study intersection were analyzed using Synchro Software
with the modified geometry and projected Year 2032 traffic volumes. A cycle length of 90
seconds was used for the analysis. Capacity results of the Year 2032 conditions are shown in
Table V.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The preceding text analyzed the potential traffic impacts associated with the installation of a
bike lane on Esplanade Avenue from Claiborne Avenue to City Park Avenue in New
Orleans, LA, by restriping the four-lane geometry on Esplanade Avenue into a two-lane
geometry.

A comparison of the Synchro analysis output reports for the four study scenarios (existing
Year 2012 volumes with existing intersection geometry, existing Year 2012 volumes with
proposed intersection geometry, projected Year 2032 volumes with existing intersection
geometry and projected Year 2032 volumes with proposed intersection geometry)
demonstrates that the study intersections are expected to operate within acceptable LOS
thresholds and will not create significant impacts through the analysis period.

It is recommended that the proposed Esplanade Avenue bike lane be installed in the existing
travel way by restriping the existing Esplanade Avenue corridor to accommodate one
through lane, one bike lane and one right turn lane for the Esplanade Avenue approaches at
the intersection with N. Broad Street.

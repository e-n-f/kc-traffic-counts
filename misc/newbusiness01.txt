STAFF REPORT
Master Subdivision Plan-Lake Castleberry
February 18, 2014 Town Council


PROJECT DATA:
     Public Utilities:
     Connecting to Town water and sewer through the proposed White Oak Pump Station.

      Storm Drainage:
      Several BMPs located throughout the project.

      Grading:
      Meets all requirements of the Unified Development Ordinance. There is no mass grading.

      Architectural and Design Standards
      As agreed to in Rezoning cases #13CZ17 & #14CZ01.

PARKS AND RECREATION:
"The first preference of the Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Resources Advisory Commission is that the
developers of Castleberry Lake pursue a partnership with other developers in the area that will result in a
regional park facility consistent with the Town's Parks Recreation, Greenways, and Open Space Master Plan. In
the event that such a regional facility/partnership is not accomplished to the Town's satisfaction by the time
the first plat is submitted for Castleberry Lake, the developer shall be required to pay a fee in lieu for the
project with the caveat that the Town and developer could elect to continue seeking a regional park facility at
their discretion if sufficient progress is being made towards land acquisition".

APEX TRANSPORTATION PLAN:
The proposed Residential Master Subdivision Plan is consistent with the Apex Transportation Plan.

ACCESS AND CIRCULATION:
The Residential Master Subdivision Plan has connections to Castleberry Road, Wimberly Road and Green Level
West Road.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE:
The proposed Lake Castleberry Master Subdivision Plan is in compliance with the standards provided in the
UDO.

PLANNING BOARD RECOMMENDATION
Planning Board heard this at their February 10, 2014 meeting and recommended approval with conditions #1, 3
 and 4. Condition #2 was debated, but the decision for the condition was left to the Town Council and
 Condition #5 was recommended to be re-worded. Condition #6 was added after Planning Board.

STAFF RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends approval of the Lake Castleberry Master Subdivision Plan with the following conditions:
1.        Prior to signature of Construction Plans, the developer shall provide legal documentation acceptable
         to the Town showing: (1) the limits of dedicated street public right of way along Castleberry Road, (2)
         that Castleberry Road is paved on dedicated public street right of way along the project frontage
         serving both proposed points of access, and (3) that the developer is able to grant public the Town of
         Apex access and utility easements such as are needed for the Town of Apex to access and maintain all

                                                                           Prepared by: Lauren Simmons, Planner II

         proposed public utilities as required for the proposed subdivision within or outside dedicated public
         street right of way.
2.       Developer shall widen Castleberry Road along the project frontage based on a 26-foot edge-to-edge
         roadway (11-foot travel lanes and two-foot paved shoulders).
3.        Developer shall pay fee-in-lieu for paving half of a 26-foot edge-to-edge roadway on Castleberry Road
         along the unpaved project frontage, provided that the portion of the road is determined to be public.
4.        Developer shall pay fee-in-lieu for sidewalk along the entire project frontage on the public portions of
         Castleberry Road.

         within the 30' Type B buffer along the Castleberry Road streetscape; in order to meet Rezoning
         #13CZ17 condition #8 listed below, the full width of the 30' Type B buffer shall be landscaped to a
         Type B standard with shrubs and small understory trees within the 15' easement and the taller trees
         located outside the 15' easement but within the 30' buffer. The developer shall provide an updated

Subject:       Staff comments for Lake Castleberry Development TIA dated 1/10/14

Mr. Epley:

Please review the following comments and recommendations. You may schedule a
meeting with me and your client to discuss at your convenience.

Study Area
    The subdivision is located on the north side of Castleberry Road west of the
       intersection with Wimberly Road and extends northward to connect with Green
       Level West Road.
    The study includes the following intersections:
           o Wimberly Road at Green Level West Road
           o Green Level West Road at Green Level Church Road
           o Wimberly Road at Castleberry Road
           o Wimberly Road at Jenks Road
           o Site Access Driveways to Castleberry Road (2), Wimberly Road, and Green
              Level West Road

Trip Generation and Distribution
The TIA assumes 172 single family homes and is anticipated to generate 33 inbound
trips and 97 outbound trips in the a.m. peak hour, 108 inbound trips and 63 outbound
trips in the p.m. peak hour, and 1,730 trips on a typical weekday. The distribution is as
follows:

       40% east on Green Level West Road
       30% west on Green Level West Road
       10% east on US 64
       10% west on US 64
       5% north on Green Level Church Road
       5% south on Green Level Church Road
Site Access
     Two points of access are proposed along Castleberry Road west of Wimberly
        Road.
     One point of access is proposed along Wimberly Road north of Castleberry Road.
     One point of access is proposed along Green Level West Road west of Wimberly
        Road.
     All four points of access are proposed as full movement.

Traffic Capacity Analysis
       With the installation of a traffic signal and construction of a northbound left turn lane as
       planned by others, the intersection of Green Level West Road at Green Level Church
       Road is anticipated to operate at overall LOS D for build-out in 2018. The westbound
       approach of Green Level West Road is anticipated to operate at LOS E in the a.m. peak
       hour and LOS F in the p.m. peak hour for build-out in 2018.
       With the construction of left turn lanes on Jenks Road as planned by others, the
       southbound and proposed (Westford Driveway) northbound approach of Wimberly
       Road at Jenks Road are anticipated to operate with long delays for build-out in 2018.
       All proposed points of access for the site, Castleberry Road at Wimberly Road, and
       Wimberly Road at Green Level West Road are anticipated to operate with short delays.

Recommendations
   1. The TIA recommends a 100-foot westbound left turn lane on Green Level West
      Road at Wimberly Road. Apex staff concurs with the recommendation.
   2. The TIA recommends no additional improvements for Green Level West Road at
      Green Level Church Road. The H7 High School development plans include
      installation of a traffic signal and the Beckwith Property development plans
      include a 125-foot northbound left turn lane. Apex staff concurs with no
      additional recommendations.
   3. The TIA recommends no additional lanes for Wimberly Road at Castleberry Road.
      Apex staff concurs.
   4. The TIA recommends no additional improvements for Wimberly Road at Jenks
      Road. The Westford development plans include construction of 100-foot left
      turns lanes each direction on Jenks Road. Apex staff concurs with no additional
      recommendations.
   5. The TIA recommends a 100-foot westbound left turn lane on Green Level West
      Road at the proposed Site Access Driveway. Apex staff concurs with the
      recommendation.




                                                                                                 2
   6. The TIA recommends no exclusive turning lanes for either of the two proposed
      Site Access Driveways on Castleberry Road and no exclusive turning lanes for the
      Site Access Driveway on Wimberly Road. Apex staff concurs with the
      recommendations.

NCDOT maintains Green Level Church Road, Green Level West Road, Jenks Road,
Wimberly Road, and Castleberry Road. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any
recommendations pertaining to state-maintained roads and encourage discussions with
NCDOT as early as possible prior to review by Town Council.

Project Background
                 A residential development is being proposed west of Wimberly Road between Green
                 Level West Road and Castleberry Road in Apex, NC (Figure 1). The development is
                 expected to be complete by 2018 and consists of the following land use:
                       Single-Family Detached Housing ­ 172 units

                 Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four future unsignalized
                 driveways (Figure 2), as follows:
                       Site Access #1 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along
                         Castleberry Road approximately 2,400 feet west of Wimberly Road
                       Site Access #2 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along
                         Castleberry Road approximately 1,200 feet west of Site Access #1
                       Site Access #3 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along
                         Wimberly Road approximately 1,200 feet south of Green Level West Road
                       Site Access #4 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along Green
                         Level West Road approximately 1,200 feet west of Wimberly Road

                 The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study
                 area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
                       Wimberly Road and Green Level West Road (unsignalized)
                       Green Level West Road and Green Level Church Road (unsignalized)
                       Wimberly Road and Castleberry Road (unsignalized)
                       Wimberly Road and Jenks Road (unsignalized)
                       Castleberry Road and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)
                       Castleberry Road and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)
                       Wimberly Road and Site Access #3 (future unsignalized)
                       Green Level West Road and Site Access #4 (future unsignalized)

                 Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2013), Background (2018),
                 Build (2018) and Build (2018) with Improvements conditions. The Existing (2013)
                 scenario includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count
                 data collected in May, August, and November 2013. Background (2018) scenario
                 includes existing traffic with eighteen approved developments and projected annual
                 growth. The Build (2018) scenario includes Background (2018) volumes with the
                 addition of site trips generated by the proposed development. The Build (2018) with




                                              i
                   improvement scenario includes Build (2018) volumes with planned roadway
                   geometrics.



Existing (2013) Conditions
                   Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and
                   intersection turning movement counts.

                   As reported in the Summary Level of Service (LOS) table on page v, all of the study
                   intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM
                   peak hours.




Background (2018) Conditions
                   In the Background (2018) scenario, an annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
                   applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year
                   (2013) and the build year (2018). Furthermore, there are thirteen (13) Town of Cary
                   developments and five (5) Town of Apex developments in the vicinity projected to be
                   constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
                   development. Site traffic associated with these approved developments was
                   included in the Background (2018) analysis along with any recommended
                   mitigations.

                   As recommended in previous studies, the mitigations from the background
                   developments within the study area include a northbound left-turn lane with 125 feet
                   of storage along Green Level Church Road at Green Level West intersection and
                   signalization. At the Jenks Road at Wimberly Road intersection, a fourth leg to the
                   intersection is added with modifications including a westbound left-turn lane, an
                   eastbound left-turn lane, and a northbound driveway approach.

                   Based on the Background (2018) analysis, all study area intersections are projected to
                   continue operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours
                   with the exception of the stop-controlled southbound Wimberly Road approach at
                   Jenks Road that is projected to degrade from LOS A to LOS E in the PM peak hour.



Trip Generation and Assignment
                   The development is proposed to consist of the following land use:
                         Single-Family Detached Housing ­ 172 units




                                                 ii
                   Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
                   generation code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and the
                   suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

                   As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,730 daily site trips
                   with 130 trips (33 entering, 97 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 171 trips
                   (108 entering, 63 exiting) in the PM peak hour. Phase V is located in the southwest
                   quadrant of the Wimberly Road and Jenks Road Intersection. This phase is proposed
                   as twelve potential homes that may be developed sometime in the future. They are
                   included in this development's site trips due to the potential access within the
                   development. The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the
                   existing turning movement counts and land uses.



Build (2018) Conditions
                   The Build (2018) conditions account for both the Background (2018) traffic and the
                   site traffic generated by the proposed development.

                   As shown on the Summary LOS table on page v, the addition of site trips will lead to
                   minimal traffic delay increases at several study area intersections. All the study area
                   intersections are projected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service during
                   the AM and PM peak hours with the exception of the stop-controlled southbound
                   Wimberly Road approach at Jenks Road that is projected to operate at LOS E in the
                   AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. The intersection's degradation is
                   due to the background traffic at this intersection as can been seen in the 2018
                   Background traffic analysis. Therefore, any improvements to this intersection should
                   be required of background developments near this intersection.



Roadway Improvement Recommendations
                   As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is
                   projected to have minimal impact on the traffic operations of the surrounding
                   roadway network and intersections. The following roadway improvements are
                   recommended.

                   Phase I - Castleberry Road and Site Access #1 (unsignalized)
                   The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                   during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                   configuration is recommended at this location:
                         Construct Site Access #1 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.




                                                 iii
Phase II - Castleberry Road and Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
configuration is recommended at this location:
      Construct Site Access #2 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

Phase III - Wimberly Road and Site Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. The following intersection configuration is
recommended at this location to accommodate the proposed development's traffic
volumes and reduce delay on Wimberly Road:
      Construct Site Access #3 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

Phase IV - Green Level West Road and Site Access #4 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. The following intersection configuration is
recommended at this location to accommodate the proposed development's traffic
volumes and reduce delay along Green Level West Road:
      Construct a westbound left-turn lane along Green Level West Road that
          provides at least 100 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.
      Construct Site Access #4 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

Phase V - Green Level West Road and Wimberly Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. However, due to the anticipated westbound
left-turn volume on Green Level West Road once Phase IV is completed, the
following is recommended at this location:
       Construct a westbound left-turn lane along Green Level West Road that
          provides at least 100 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service under Build (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further improvements are
recommended.

                                                    Introduction


A residential development is being proposed west of Wimberly Road between Green
Level West Road and Castleberry Road in Apex, NC (Figure 1). The development is
expected to be complete by 2018 and consists of the following land use:
      Single-Family Detached Housing ­ 172 units

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four future unsignalized
driveways (Figure 2), as follows:
      Site Access #1 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along
        Castleberry Road approximately 2,400 feet west of Wimberly Road
      Site Access #2 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along
        Castleberry Road approximately 1,200 feet west of Site Access #1
      Site Access #3 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along
        Wimberly Road approximately 1,200 feet south of Green Level West Road
      Site Access #4 ­ future stop-controlled full-movement access along Green
        Level West Road approximately 1,200 feet west of Wimberly Road

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study
area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
      Wimberly Road and Green Level West Road (unsignalized)
      Green Level West Road and Green Level Church Road (unsignalized)
      Wimberly Road and Castleberry Road (unsignalized)
      Wimberly Road and Jenks Road (unsignalized)
      Castleberry Road and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)
      Castleberry Road and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)
      Wimberly Road and Site Access #3 (future unsignalized)
      Green Level West Road and Site Access #4 (future unsignalized)

VHB Engineering NC, PC was retained by Withers & Ravenel to analyze the
potential traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary
roadway improvements. This Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) summarizes trip
generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed
development.

Existing Turning Movement Data
                    VHB Engineering NC, P.C. collected the majority AM and PM peak hour intersection
                    turning movement counts for this TIA, but also utilized a count from the Beckwith
                    TIA by SEPI at the Green Level West Road and Green Level Church Road
                    intersection. Table 1 summarizes the schedule used to obtain the turning movement
                    data. A detailed summary of the traffic counts can be found in Appendix A.

Level of Service Criteria
                    Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection
                    geometrics and traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given
                    turning volumes. Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average
                    control delay experienced by vehicles traveling through the intersection during the
                    peak hour. Control delay represents the portion of total delay attributed to traffic
                    control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs). The engineering profession generally
                    accepts LOS D as an acceptable operating condition for signalized intersections in
                    urban areas LOS C for rural areas.

                    At unsignalized intersections, LOS E is generally considered acceptable only if the
                    side street encounters delay. Nevertheless, side streets sometimes function at LOS F
                    during peak traffic periods; however, the traffic volumes often do not warrant a
                    traffic signal to assist side street traffic. Table 2 provides a general description of
                    various levels of service categories and delay ranges.

Level of Service Analysis
                        Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                        and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. A summary of
                        the findings for the Existing (2013) scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and
                        the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

                        As reported in Table 3, all of the study intersections are operating at acceptable levels
                        of service during the AM and PM peak hours.

Background Growth and Development
                 A review of the historical Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data collected by
                 NCDOT in the area indicates that the area has seen minimal growth in the area
                 during the past decade. However, to be conservative a two-percent (2%) growth rate
                 was applied to the study area roadways intersections. Furthermore, there are
                 thirteen (13) Town of Cary developments and five (5) Town of Apex developments in
                 the vicinity projected to be constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out
                 of the proposed development.          Site traffic associated with these approved
                 developments was also included in the Background (2018) analysis along with any
                 approved recommended mitigations. The background projects include:
                        11-TAR-323 (Highcroft Village Phase 4 and 5)
                        11-TAR-331 (Fryar Tract Development)

                 The school PM peak hour traffic for the H7 High School was applied to the typical
                 PM peak hour to be conservative and consistent with other TIAs in the study area.
                 Background site traffic volumes for the Westford Development and Tunstal
                 Property/The Preserve at White Oak TIAs were provided by Kimley-Horn and

                   Associates. Background traffic for the Holt Property was provided by VHB. All
                   additional background site traffic volumes were provided in the Beckwith TIA by
                   SEPI Engineering.

                   Background development volumes are included in Appendix C. The mitigations
                   from the backgrounds developments within the study area are listed below:
                         Beckwith at Green Level Crossing: Northbound left-turn lane with 125 feet
                            of storage along Green Level Church Road and Green Level West
                            intersection.
                         H7 High School: Signalization of the Green Level Church Road and Green
                            Level West intersection.
                         Westford Development: Westbound left-turn lane and eastbound left-turn
                            lane along Jenks Road with 100 feet of storage each at the Wimberly Road
                            intersection.

                   The Background (2018) peak hour trips are shown in Figure 5.




Level of Service Analysis
                   Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                   and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway
                   Capacity Software (HCS 2010). The signal cycle length and splits at Green Level
                   Church Road and Green Level West Road were optimized within Synchro as part of
                   the future year analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2018)
                   scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be
                   found in Appendix B.

                   As reported in Table 4, all study area intersections are projected to continue
                   operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours with the
                   exception of the stop-controlled southbound Wimberly Road approach at Jenks Road
                   that is projected to degrade from LOS A to LOS E in the PM peak hour.

                  A residential development is being proposed west of Wimberly Road between Green
                  Level West Road and Castleberry Road in Apex, NC (Figure 1).



Trip Generation
                  The development is proposed to consist of the following land use:
                        Single-Family Detached Housing ­ 172 units

                  Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
                  generation code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and the
                  suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

                  As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,730 daily site trips
                  with 130 trips (33 entering, 97 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 171 trips
                  (108 entering, 63 exiting) in the PM peak hour. Phase V is located in the southwest
                  quadrant of the Wimberly Road and Jenks Road Intersection. This Phase is proposed
                  as twelve potential homes that may be developed sometime in the future. They are
                  included in this development's site trips due to the potential access within the
                  development. The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the
                  existing turning movement counts and land uses.

                  Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for
                  typical weekday AM and PM peak hours.

Level of Service Analysis
                   The Build (2018) analysis scenario includes the Background (2018) traffic, as well as
                   site generated trips from the proposed development as described previously. Figure
                   8 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2018) scenario analysis.

                   Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                   and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The signal cycle
                   length and splits at Green Level Church Road and Green Level West Road were
                   optimized within Synchro/SimTraffic as part of the build year analysis. Table 6
                   summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the full
                   Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

                   As reported in Table 6, the addition of site trips will lead to minimal traffic delay
                   increases at several study area intersections. All the study area intersections are
                   projected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM
                   peak hours with the exception of the stop-controlled southbound Wimberly Road
                   approach at Jenks Road that is projected to operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour
                   and LOS F in the PM peak hour. The intersection's degradation is due to the
                   background traffic at this intersection as can been seen in the 2018 Background traffic
                   analysis. Therefore, any improvements to this intersection should be required of
                   background developments near this intersection.

                     Findings and Conclusions


As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is
projected to have minimal impact on the traffic operations of the surrounding
roadway network and intersections. The following roadway improvements are
recommended.

Phase I - Castleberry Road and Site Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
configuration is recommended at this location:
      Construct Site Access #1 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

Phase II - Castleberry Road and Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
configuration is recommended at this location:
      Construct Site Access #2 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

Phase III - Wimberly Road and Site Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. The following intersection configuration is
recommended at this location to accommodate the proposed development's traffic
volumes and reduce delay on Wimberly Road:
      Construct Site Access #3 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

Phase IV - Green Level West Road and Site Access #4 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. The following intersection configuration is
recommended at this location to accommodate the proposed development's traffic
volumes and reduce delay along Green Level West Road:
      Construct a westbound left-turn lane along Green Level West Road that
          provides at least 100 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.
      Construct Site Access #4 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

Phase V - Green Level West Road and Wimberly Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. However, due to the anticipated westbound
left-turn volume on Green Level West Road once Phase IV is completed, the
following is recommended at this location:
       Construct a westbound left-turn lane along Green Level West Road that
          provides at least 100 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service under Build (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further improvements are
recommended.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting
future lane configurations and traffic control for 2018 are shown in Figure 9.

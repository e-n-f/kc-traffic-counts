Introduction
In February of 1999, the 25% Submission for the Reconstruction of
Beacon Street was submitted to the then Massachusetts Highway
Department. Included in this submission was the Functional Design
Report, Preliminary Cost Estimate and 25% Plans. This design was
carried through to the 75% Submission in March of 2004. The project
was put on hold for some time and reactivated in late 2011.
Due to the time that has passed since the original 25% Submission,
MassDOT has requested that the 25% Submission be resubmitted.
The City's vision for this corridor as well as the users of the roadway
have changed since the original 25% Submission. This 25%
resubmission incorporates the City's vision for Beacon Street and also
adjusts to the changed users of the roadway.
This new vision has ultimately mandated a re-evaluation of this
multimodal arterial. The response was clear, the community wanted a diverse arterial that
would improve the quality of life for all stakeholders; residents, business owners, bicyclists,
pedestrians, motorists and all others. The redesign must be a "complete street". Thus, the
goals for this project are to:
        Improve the overall functionality and flow within the arterial for all users (vehicular,
        bicycle, pedestrian, bus, etc.). This will be achieved by creating a clear definition and
        delineation of the sidewalks and roadways, with appropriate contrasting materials, use
        of curbing for vertical separation, plantings and placement of vertical elements, such as
        lighting.
        Provide new and/or upgraded traffic signal control at critical intersections to increase
        capacity, reduce delays and improve safety. New signal control will provide for bicycle
        detection, emergency vehicle pre-emption and meet the latest MUTCD and ADA
        standards.
        Redesign curb cuts to appropriately meet ADA requirements, fit the use and provide
        additional space for pedestrians where required.
        Identify other amenities for the desired activities such as planters, shrubs, benches and
        trash recepticals, bus shelters and trees. Diseased trees will be identified and existing
        trees will be preserved where feasible.
        Upgrade needed subsurface utilities to ensure that they are sufficient to meet the
        project's design life so the new surface will remain in good working condition, without
        utility patches impacting the newly placed pavement mat.
This Functional Design Report (FDR) is a necessary component for all Transportation and Safety
Improvement Projects submitted to MassDOT, including mitigation projects developed through
the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency (MEPA) process.

This FDR documents and studies conditions and activities in the corridor as outlined in the Table
of Contents.

1. Existing Conditions

A. Study Area
A plan of the existing study area and
its relation to the surrounding
roadway system is shown on Figure 1-
1. The following is a description of
the study area roadways noted on the
plan.
Beacon Street is an urban arterial that
runs northwest from the Cambridge
city line to Somerville Avenue. The
Beacon Street project area extends
from the bridge abutment at Oxford
Street to Dickinson Street, a distance
of approximately 1.1 miles. The
existing roadway width is
approximately 44 feet with a 66 foot
city layout. Existing sidewalks are 10
feet wide. The posted speed limit is
                                            Figure 1-1: Existing Study Area
30 mph along the corridor. Abutting
land use is a dense mix of commercial and residential with parking provided along both sides
throughout most of the project area.

The roadway pavement is in poor condition. From Oxford Street in the northwest to the city line
in the southeast the pavement is a series of patches, potholes, failing trench repairs, lateral and
longitudinal cracks, shoving, heaving and rutting.
The sidewalks are substantial in width, however are in poor condition and have non-compliant
cross slopes in many cases. While there are sections of new sidewalk, much of the sidewalk is
very old with cracks, settlement and heaved sections. Additionally throughout the project there
are frequent repairs, poorly constructed of bituminous concrete pavement.
The curb ramps throughout the corridor are in poor condition and not ADA compliant.
Additionally in numerous locations curb ramps do not exist at all.
With regard to traffic, Beacon Street operates as one travel lane in each direction with areas of
metered and 2 hour parking permitted along both sides. A variable width bicycle lane
approximately 4 feet wide is provided along both sides of the Beacon Street. Traffic
signalization is provided at several locations along the corridor to control vehicular traffic and/or
provide for pedestrian crossings. The intersections of Beacon Street/Washington Street and
Beacon Street/Park Street/Scott Street are fully signalized. The intersections of Buckingham
Street/Cooney Street and Museum Street/Kent Street provide pedestrian actuated traffic
signals. There is a lack of turn lanes or protected movements at Washington Street and at Park

                                                                                         July 2012
                                                                        Functional Design Report      4

Street as well as antiquated fixed time signal controlers, resulting in significant back-ups and
delays. Traffic and pedestrian signal equipment do not conform to MUTCD and ADA standards.
The existing typical section for Beacon Street provides for two travel lanes and bicycle lanes and
parking (about 22 feet) in each direction. Field observations and intersection count data
indicate that pedestrian and bicycle activity is high.
Following are descriptions of the Beacon Street study area intersections.

Beacon Street/Sacramento Street
Beacon Street at Sacramento
Street is 44 feet wide
providing for one travel lane
in each direction, a bicycle
lane and parking on both
sides. A pedestrian
crosswalk is provided on
Beacon Street as Star Market
is located on the northeast
corner of the intersection
and a pedestrian connection
is located along Sacramento
Street to Somerville Avenue.
Sacramento Street is one-
way eastbound from
Massachusetts Avenue to
Carver Street near the Somerville/Cambridge city line where it turns northerly and becomes
two-way to its intersection with Beacon Street where it is stop sign controlled. The northern leg
of Sacramento Street borders the Star Market parking lot and comes to an end at the railroad
tracks running behind the supermarket. A pedestrian underpass provides pedestrian access to
the other side of the tracks and Somerville Avenue. This connection is critical for pedestrians to
access the bus routes along Somerville Avenue, because of Beacon Street's proximity to
Somerville Avenue at the west end of the project where no bus stops exist. Pedestrians must
use this vital link to access public transportation. Star Market is located on the northeast corner
of the intersection and deliveries utilize the north leg of Sacramento Street.

Beacon Street/Kent Street/Museum Street
This intersection is located approximately 900 feet northwest of the Beacon Street/Park Street
intersection and is controlled by flashing traffic signals which provide a Beacon Street pedestrian
crossing by displaying red/yellow indications to all approaches during the pedestrian actuation.
Beacon Street north of this intersection is 44 feet wide providing one lane in each direction with
bicycle lanes and parking on both sides. Beacon Street south of this intersection to the
Scott/Park Street intersection is 42' wide providing one lane in each direction with bicycle lanes



                                                                                        July 2012
                                                                       Functional Design Report      5

and parking on both sides
and a sidewalk on the east
side only. Abutting land use
is a dense mix of
commercial, retail and
residential.
Museum Street travels
north-south from Hammond
Street to Beacon Street.
Museum Street is 24 feet
wide providing one lane in
each direction with parking
along both sides and is
controlled by a flashing red
indication at its intersection
with Beacon Street.
Kent Street is 16 feet wide travelling from Beacon Street to its dead end terminus. Kent Street is
also controlled with a flashing red indication and a stop sign.
This pedestrian actuated intersection is provided to protect pedestrians that must cross Beacon
Street as no sidewalk is provided along the south side of Beacon Street from Museum Street to
Scott Street. The lack of sidewalk is a direct result of an encroachment upon the right of way by
a historic brick wall.
All traffic signal equipment is antiquated and not up to current MUTCD and ADA standards.
Pedestrian push buttons are not plunger type and visible and audible indicators do not exist.

Beacon Street/Park Street/Scott Street
This four legged signalized
intersection is located 0.2
miles northwest of the
Beacon Street/Washington
Street intersection. Park
Street is a major north-south
link between Beacon Street
and Somerville Avenue. Park
Street is 33 feet wide
providing one lane in each
direction with parking along
both sides. Scott Street
travels one-way from Holden
Street to its intersection with
Beacon Street. Scott Street


                                                                                       July 2012
                                                                        Functional Design Report      6

is 33 feet wide and provides parking along both sides. A counterflow (southerly) bike lane is
provided on Scott Street from Beacon Street to Bryant Street in Cambridge.
All bus routes that service the south end of Beacon Street turn at this intersection, continue
along Park Street, and turn onto Somerville Avenue.
Beacon Street south of this location is 44 feet wide providing one travel lane in each direction
with parking allowed along the south side near the intersection. Beacon Street north of this
intersection to the Kent/Museum Street intersection is 42' wide providing one lane in each
direction with bicycle lanes and parking on both sides and a sidewalk on the east side only.
Traffic signal control at this intersection consists of 2-phase pre-timed control with an exclusive
pedestrian phase.

Beacon Street/Washington Street
Washington Street intersects
Beacon Street just north of
the Somerville/Cambridge
city line forming a 4-legged
signalized intersection that is
the center of activity along
the corridor. Washington
Street travels east-west from
Somerville Avenue to the
City of Cambridge where it
becomes Kirkland Street.
Beacon Street is 44 feet wide
providing one travel lane in
each direction with parking
along both sides.
Washington Street is 40 feet
wide and also provides one
lane in each direction with parking along both sides. Traffic control consists of pre-timed, two-
phase control with an exclusive pedestrian phase. The Washington Street northbound left turn
movement is significant and creates back-ups on Washington Street as there is no separate turn
lane or protected movement. Existing handicapped ramps and pedestrian signal equipment do
not comply with the current MUTCD and ADA standards. Abutting land use is commercial and
residential.

Beacon Street/Buckingham Street/Cooney Street
Buckingham Street and Cooney
Street intersect Beacon Street
approximately 1,000 feet
southeast of the Beacon
Street/Washington Street
intersection. The two side
streets are offset by
approximately 65 feet.
Buckingham Street is 26 feet
wide travelling north-south
from Beacon Street to
Dimick Street. Cooney
Street is 20 feet wide
travelling one-way
southbound from Beacon
Street to Line Street. A
signalized pedestrian
crosswalk is provided on Beacon Street between Buckingham and Cooney Streets. The traffic
signals provide flashing green for Beacon Street and flashing red for Buckingham Street. The
traffic control equipment is antiquated and not up to current MUTCD and ADA standards.


2. Traffic Volumes
Automatic traffic recordings (ATR's) were taken during April, 2012 at several locations to
determine the average daily traffic (ADT) on the Beacon Street study area. These counts were
not adjusted for seasonal variation as April volumes are indicative or slightly higher than average
annual conditions.

Manual turning movement counts including vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians were taken in the
AM (7-9) and PM (4-6) peak periods in April, 2012 at the five (5) following study area
intersections:

       Beacon Street/Sacramento Street

The recorded 2012 peak hour volumes are shown in Figure 2-1 for the signalized intersections at
Park Street/Scott Street and Washington Street.
The traffic count data details are provided in Appendix A.


3. Transit
The following identifies current Bus Routes along or crossing Beacon Street. (refer to Appendix
B)

        MBTA Route 83 ­ connecting Ridge Avenue to Central Square in Cambridge via Porter
        Square. This route travels along the Beacon Street corridor project from the Cambridge
        city line to Park Street then on to Somerville Avenue. The route directly serves the
        project corridor.
        MBTA Route 86 ­ connecting Sullivan Square and Cleveland Circle via Harvard Square in
        Cambridge. This route crosses the corridor at the intersection of Washington
        Street/Beacon Street with near-side stops along Washington Street (located back from
        the intersection). This is the busiest location along the route acting as a hub location.
        MBTA Route 87 ­ connecting Arlington Center and Lechmere Station via Somerville
        Avenue. This route does not directly cross the project but given the close proximity of
        Somerville Avenue and Beacon Street on the westerly end of the project limits, the
        existing pedestrian connection at Sacramento Street was made to improve pedestrian
        access to this bus route.
All of these routes terminate or intersect with a major multimodal hub such as Sullivan Station
(Orange Line), Lechmere Station (Blue Line), Harvard Square (Red Line) or the Porter Square
station (Red Line and Commuter Rail). Hence the project leverages these other modes of
transportation by enhancing bus stop location and size, handicapped accessibility, bicycle racks
and safety.


4. Safety Analysis
To identify vehicle crash trends along Beacon Street and at the study area intersections,
accident data was obtained from the Somerville Police records for January 2009 to April 2012. A
record of the accident data is presented in Appendix C.
Crash rates for intersections are calculated based upon the number of crashes at an intersection
and the volume of traffic travelling through an intersection on a daily basis. The MassDOT
average crash rates are based upon the average number of crashes occurring per million
vehicles entering signalized and unsignalized intersections. The average crash rates for
MassDOT District 4 are 0.78 and 0.59 for signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively.
Based upon the reviewed accident data and the recent April 2012 traffic counts, DCI has
calculated the following crash rates for the study area intersections. As indicated in Table 4.1
the signalized intersections of Beacon Street/Washington Street and Beacon Street/Park Street


                                                                                      July 2012
                                                                                                 Functional Design Report     10

had the highest 3-year accident totals (32 and 19 respectively). The resulting crash rates of 1.13
and 0.94 are somewhat higher than the District 4 average of 0.78, indicative of a safety concern.
The unsignalized and pedestrian actuated intersection crossing locations shown on Table 4.1
show fewer accidents with resulting crash rates that are at or below the District 4 average of
0.59.

 * - Based on 2012 peak hour counts and 3 year accident data provided by the City of Somerville
 Note - All other unsignalized intersections experience 3 accidents or less during the three-year period.



The unsignalized intersection at Beacon and Sacramento streets has a slightly higher crash rate
than the district average of 0.59. A total of 187 crashes over a 3-year period occurred along the
1.1 mile stretch of roadway, with numerous closely spaced intersections, poor pavement
conditions, mid-block pedestrian/bike related crashes as well as parked vehicles. This translates
to a crash rate of 11.9 per million vehicles-miles of travel for the roadway segment; much higher
than the latest available state-wide average crash rate of 3.72 in the year 2009 for Urban Minor
Arterials.

MassDOT intersection and segment crash rate worksheets are provided in Appendix C.

Bicycle-related Crashes
The 3-year crash data was summarized by accident type and shown in the following Table 4.2.
The data shows a significant portion of accidents were bicycle-related at 18.2 % , consistent with
the higher bicycle volumes relative to motorized-vehicle traffic.

5. MUTCD Signal Warrants
MUTCD Warrants were reviewed based on the prevailing geometric conditions to confirm that
current signals remain warranted at the Park Street and Washington Street intersections. The
proposed new pedestrian actuated signal at Beacon Street and Sacramento Street is estimated
to meet warrants based on proposed increased pedestrian activity, including the proposed
removal of the existing crossing at nearby Museum Street/Kent Street. The results are
contained in Appendix D.


6. Intersection Analysis
To assess quality of traffic flow, intersection capacity analysis were conducted for the study area
intersections for existing conditions and future conditions with and without intersection
improvements. Capacity
analysis determines
Level-of-Service (LOS)
based upon delays
for intersection
operating
conditions.

Level-of-Service is
used to denote the
different operating
conditions for
roadways and
intersections under
various traffic
volume loads. LOS
designations range
from "A" at best
with little or no
delays to "F" at
worst with long
delays and forced
flow conditions. LOS
ratings for an
intersection are
based upon delay
per approaching
vehicle. The amount
of delay is
dependent upon
traffic volumes,


                                                                                        July 2012
                                                                            Functional Design Report      12

roadway characteristics, speed and phasing and timing of traffic signals. A LOS ranking of "C" is
considered stable flow which is desirable for peak design flows in urban areas. A LOS "D" is
considered acceptable during peak periods in urban areas.

FUTURE TRAFFIC VOLUMES
DCI has compared recent 2012 peak hour volumes with previous volume data collected for the
Beacon Street/Park Street/Scott Street and Beacon Street/Washington Street intersections and
found traffic volumes have decreased over the past several years. This is most likely a reflection
of the poor ride-ability of Beacon Street relative to nearby alternative routes (Massachusetts
Avenue and Somerville Avenue). The lower vehicle-traffic levels are also a reflection of the
suppressed economic activity in recent years as well as the general shift in travel mode to
transit, bicycle and walking that continues to develop in this area of Somerville/Cambridge.
To present a conservative analysis of future 2032 (20 year projection), DCI has increased the
2012 peak hour motor vehicle volumes by an annual growth factor of 0.5%, and
bicycle/pedestrian activity at 1%. The resultant 2032 peak hour intersection volumes are shown
in Figure 6-1.

TRAFFIC LEVELS OF SERVICE
The extensive count program has allowed for development of a detailed traffic network for the
two peak travel periods for capacity analysis utilizing HCS software. A Level of Service analysis
was done for the existing 2012 and future 2032 "Build" and "No Build" conditions for the
Beacon Street/Park Street/Scott Street and Beacon Street/Washington Street intersections.
Definitions of Levels of Service at signalized and unsignalized intersections are presented in the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual and the following tables define the relationship between Level
of Service, control delay, and qualitative traffic flow.

Results for the existing 2012 condition (Table 6-2) show that the signalized intersection of
Beacon Street/Park Street/Scott Street operates at LOS "B" and "C" during the AM and PM peak
hours, respectively.
The intersection of Beacon Street/Washington Street operates at LOS "D" and "E" during the
peak hours due to the high number of left turning vehicles from Washington Street northbound
to Beacon Street westbound, single lane approaches on all four legs of the intersection, and the
fixed time traffic control.
The projected 2032 No Build conditions (Table 6.3) indicate that the Beacon Street/Park
Street/Scott Street intersection will drop to LOS "C" in the AM peak and will drop to a LOS "D" in
the PM peak.
For 2032 No Build conditions at Beacon Street/Washington Street, the LOS will be "E" and "F",
during the AM and PM peak hours.

Bicycle Level of Service
Bicycle Level of Service criteria is presented in Exhibit 6-9 of the MassDOT Project Development
Design Guide. For random arrivals of bicycles in bicycle lanes at signalized intersection, the
average delay is one half of the signal red and yellow time facing the intersection approach. The
red and yellow signal timing for Beacon Street bicycles at Washington Street is approximately
30 seconds without pedestrian actuation and 50 seconds with pedestrian actuation. Based
upon one half of these values, the Level of Service is B or C depending on pedestrian actuation.

The proposed Beacon Street signal upgrades will include bicycle detection on all approaches
that will substantially reduce bicycle waiting time and level of service during off-peak hours.

Proposed cycle track locations will provide an overall improvement to the existing mid-block
condition due to the physical separation from motorized vehicle traffic and slightly wider travel
way.

Pedestrian Level of Service
The existing 10 foot-wide sidewalks are in poor condition, but have sufficient width to otherwise
provide a good level of service for the moderate levels of pedestrian traffic along Beacon Street.
The proposed reconstruction of the street will provide new concrete sidewalks that will
maintain the existing 10-foot widths. Where the current sidewalk is missing (south side from
Museum Street to Scott Street), a new 5 foot-wide sidewalk is proposed that will provide an
adequate level of service.

7. Proposed Improvements

Proposed Typical Sections

The proposed typical sections within the available 66 foot-wide road right of way have been
developed to provide an improved level of safety and mobility for bicycles while maintaining
acceptable levels of service for all other travel modes, including on-street parking (refer to
Beacon Street Study Report, July 2012, prepared for City of Somerville). These typical sections
are shown on Figures 7-1 to 7-3 and are described as follows:

Oxford Street to Museum Street (Sta 103+25 to Sta 123+00)

A 7 foot-wide cycle track (including clearance zones) is proposed adjacent to a 10 foot-wide
concrete sidewalk on both sides. On-street parking (7 feet in width) will be maintained on the
northeast side only. This results in 11 foot-wide travel lanes in each direction for vehicle traffic

Museum Place to Park/Scott Streets (Sta 123+00 to Sta 132+25)

A 5 foot-wide bike lane is proposed adjacent to an 11 foot-wide travel lane in both directions.
The existing 10 foot sidewalk and on-street parking (7 feet in width) will be maintained on the
northeast side. A new 5 foot-wide sidewalk will be added on the southwest side while
maintaining the existing adjacent wall structure at the back of sidewalk.




Park/Scott Street to Washington Street (Sta 132+25 to Sta 141+75)

A 7 foot-wide cycle track (including clearance zones) is proposed adjacent to a 10 foot-wide
concrete sidewalk on both sides. On-street parking (7 feet in width) will be maintained on the
northeast side only. This results in 11 foot-wide travel lanes in each direction for vehicle traffic
and a 2 foot shoulder adjacent to the parking lane and a 1 foot paved shoulder off the raised
curb.

Washington Street to Cambridge City Limit (Sta 141+75 to Sta 161+00)

A 5 foot-wide bike lane is proposed adjacent to an 11 foot-wide travel lane in both directions.
The existing 10 foot-wide sidewalk and on-street parking (7 feet in width) will be maintained on
both sides of the street.




General Traffic Signal Improvements
Traffic signal reconstruction is proposed at the following signalized intersections:

        Beacon Street/Park Street/Scott Street
        Beacon Street/Washington Street
        Beacon Street/Buckingham Street/Cooney Street (pedestrian crossing)
A new flashing signal (pedestrian crossing) is proposed for the Beacon Street/Sacramento Street
intersection while the existing pedestrian crossing signal at Beacon Street/Kent Street/Museum
Street is to be removed.
Basic traffic signal strategy is to replace all existing traffic equipment to bring traffic control up
to MassDOT and MUTCD and ADA standards. New traffic signal control will include vehicle and
bicycle detection and provisions for emergency vehicle pre-emption. Handicapped ramps and
pedestrian push buttons will be designed to meet current ADA requirements. The Beacon Street
signalized intersections at Washington Street and Park Street (0.2 miles apart) will be
interconnected for coordination.

Beacon Street/Sacramento Street
Flashing control signalization is proposed at this location to replace the uncontrolled Beacon
Street crosswalk between the northern and southern legs of Sacramento Street. Beacon Street
will be under mast arm mounted flashing yellow control for maximum visibility while the
Sacramento Street approaches will be under flashing red control. Upon activation, all vehicle
movements will be under stop (red) control while pedestrian walk and walk clearance intervals
are provided. Handicapped ramps and pedestrian push buttons and indications will conform to
the latest ADA requirements. New pavement markings and signage will also be installed.



                                                                                          July 2012

Beacon Street/Kent Street/Museum Street
It is recommended that the traffic signals at this location be removed. The signals at this
location consist of flashing control which provides a substandard red/yellow Beacon Street
pedestrian crossing. This pedestrian crossing was provided as no sidewalk currently exists along
the south side of Beacon Street from Museum Street to Park/Scott Streets. The proposed
Beacon Street improvements include a new sidewalk along the south side of Beacon Street from
Museum Street to Park/Scott Streets and therefore the existing pedestrian crossing is
unwarranted.

Beacon Street/Park Street/Scott Street
The proposed signal improvements will provide for fully actuated control. With the
recommended improvements the Levels-of-Service will remain good in the AM peak and
improve in the PM peak to "D" and "C". As with the Washington Street intersection, the
proposed signal equipment will provide for bicycle detection and pre-emption for emergency
vehicles in accordance with the latest MassDOT accepted MUTCD and ADA standards. New
pavement markings and signage will also be provided at this location.

Beacon Street/Washington Street
The capacity analysis for this location indicates poor Level-of-Service and excessive delays. This
is a result of high traffic volumes, fixed-time control and lack of any exclusive left turn lanes.
There is a heavy left turn movement from Washington Street eastbound to Beacon Street
northbound and it is recommended that an exclusive left turn lane and a protected phase be
provided for this conflicting movement. The proposed improvements include a new fully
actuated traffic controller, new traffic and pedestrian signals and creating a two lane approach
to the Washington Street northbound approach. Proposed phasing will call for a
protected/permissive phase for the Washington Street eastbound left turn movement. As
indicated by the following LOS table, the proposed signal and geometric changes will improve
the Levels-of-Service and reduce delays for future conditions. All proposed signal equipment
will provide for bicycle detection, emergency vehicle pre-emption and meet the latest MassDOT
accepted MUTCD and ADA standards.
The intersection improvements will include new sidewalks and pedestrian ramps and new
pavement markings and signage.

Beacon Street/Buckingham Street/Cooney Street
The proposed traffic signal control will replace the existing non-conforming red/yellow
pedestrian crossing. Mast arm mounted signal indications will be provided for Beacon Street for
maximum visibility. Beacon Street will dwell on flashing yellow while Buckingham Street will be
under flashing red control. Upon pedestrian activation, all vehicle movements will be stopped
and pedestrian walk and walk clearance phases will be provided. ADA complaint handicapped
ramps and pedestrian push buttons and count down walk indications will be specified. New
pavement markings and signage is also proposed at this location.

8. Design Exceptions
The FHWA and MassDOT recognize 10 controlling criteria from AASHTO's policy which if not
met, require a formal approval of Design Exception. They are as follows:
    1.    Design Speed
    2.    Lane Width
    3.    Shoulder Width
    4.    Horizontal Alignment
    5.    Vertical Alignment
    6.    Grades
    7.    Stopping Sight Distance
    8.    Cross Slope
    9.    Superelevation
    10.   Horizontal Clearance
Beacon Street has been in operation as currently constituted for over one-hundred and fifty
years. As such the profile and alignment is fixed by the development that occurred during that
time. Fortunately, the arterial is in an area of gentle topography, hence vertical and horizontal
alignment is desirable. The vertical alignment ranges from ¾% to 2%. The horizontal alignment
for all intent and purpose is straight with several minor angle points. As a result, the only
potential design exceptions are for shoulder widths northwest of Washington Street and
horizontal clearance to existing utility poles for the segment southeast of Washington Street. A
separate Design Exception Report is being prepared.

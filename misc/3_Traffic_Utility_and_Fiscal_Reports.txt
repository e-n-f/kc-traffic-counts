I. INTRODUCTION

Conor Commercial Real Estate is planning to redevelop the property located at 10 Parkway
North in the Village of Deerfield, Illinois. The site is located at the northeast corner of Parkway
North Center and is bounded by Deerfield Road to the north, I-94 (Tri-State Tollway) to the east,
and office complexes to the south and west. A synagogue is currently located on the subject
parcel with two access points to Deer Run Drive. A site location map is included as Figure 1.

The development will consist of a four-story multi-family housing complex with 247 apartments.
A total of 440 parking spaces will be provided in a parking structure and adjacent surface lot.
The primary access point is located at an existing driveway on Parkway North west of the site.
A secondary emergency access point is located at an existing driveway on Deer Run Drive
north of the site. The second existing driveway to Deer Run Drive will be removed. The
conceptual site plan is provided in Figure 2.

The purpose of this report is to evaluate the anticipated traffic impact from the proposed project,
which is expected to be constructed and occupied by 2014. Traffic estimates were determined
for the year 2019, which is five years beyond the anticipated build-out. The study area consists
of the signalized intersection of Saunders Road and Parkway North, and the unsignalized
intersection of Deerfield Road and Parkway North in addition to the proposed primary access
point on Parkway North.

This report includes a description of existing conditions, data collection and analysis, evaluation
of data, and conclusions.

II. PROJECT CONDITIONS

Land Uses

A variety of land uses exist near the project site, primarily consisting of office, hotel, and
residential uses. The adjacent land uses and locations are presented in Figure 3.

Roadway System

The characteristics of the roadways in the vicinity of the site are presented below. The existing
lane configurations at the study intersections are illustrated in Figure 4.

Deerfield Road (Lake County A47) is four-lane east-west arterial with a striped median and a
posted speed limit of 45 mph. A multi-use path is provided along the north side of Deerfield
Road adjacent to the site. A partial access interchange is located at I-94 east of the project that
provides a southbound on-ramp and northbound off-ramp. A right turn lane is provided for
eastbound traffic and a left-turn lane is added for westbound traffic at the Parkway North
intersection. Deerfield Road is under the jurisdiction of Lake County.

Saunders Road (Lake County W24) is four-lane north-south arterial with a striped median and a
posted speed limit of 40 mph. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of Saunders Road, as well
as a multi-use path on the east side through the Parkway North development. A right-turn lane
is provided for northbound traffic and a left-turn lane is added for southbound traffic at the
Parkway North intersection. Saunders Road is under the jurisdiction of Lake County.

Parkway North is a private internal roadway through the Parkway North Center. Parkway North
runs east-west beginning at the signalized intersection with Saunders Road, and curves to the
north where it intersects Deerfield Road. Although there are no lane markings present, Parkway
North was observed to operate as though there are two travel lanes in each direction. A raised
landscaped median is provided along the entire length of Parkway North with access drives for
the various office and service buildings. Two of the internal roadway intersections are all-way
stop controlled. The posted speed limit is 25 mph.

Deer Run Drive is an east-west local street that provides direct access to the existing
synagogue and several residential homes on the south side of Deerfield Road. It provides one
travel lane in each direction. There is no posted speed limit along this roadway.

Traffic Volumes

Existing intersection traffic volumes were collected at the intersections of Deerfield Road and
Parkway North and Saunders Road and Parkway North to evaluate the traffic impact on the
roadway system resulting from the proposed development. Manual counts were conducted for
the AM peak period (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM), and PM peak period (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) on
Wednesday, February 13th, 2013. The peak periods are consistent with traditional arterial peak
periods.

The AM and PM peak hours for the traffic volumes collected occur between 7:45 AM ­ 8:45 AM
and 4:45 PM ­ 5:45 PM, respectively. The existing peak hour volumes at the study area
intersections are illustrated in Figure 5. A summary of the traffic volumes collected at the study
area intersections in fifteen minute increments are provided in Appendix A.

Public Transportation System

Two key transit agencies provide public transportation options in the vicinity of the study area ­
Pace operates fixed bus routes through the Parkway North Center and Metra provides
commuter heavy rail east of the proposed development. Pace routes that travel through
Parkway North Center as well as locations of bus stops are illustrated in Figure 3.

Two Pace routes travel through and provide access to several office buildings within the
Parkway North Center. Bus stops are provided near One Parkway North and Four Parkway
North.

Pace Route 628 provides AM and PM weekday rush hour service from the Braeside Metra
Station to Parkway North Center. This route operates three morning runs and three evening
runs.

Pace Route 632 provides AM weekday rush hour service from the Lake Cook Metra Station to
Parkway North Center while evening service returns passengers to the Deerfield Metra Station.
This route operates four morning runs and five evening runs.

Proposed Development

Land Use Development

There are no known proposed land development projects in the vicinity of the site that will
impact the study area intersections.

Roadway Development

There are no known planned roadway improvements in the vicinity of the site that will impact the
study area intersections.

III. TRAFFIC FORECASTS

Project Traffic Volumes

Trip Generation

The proposed development consists of a 247-unit apartment complex. To provide flexibility with
the site plan, this traffic analysis is based on 250 apartments. Project traffic is estimated using
the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. The
following Trip Generation Manual category is used to determine project traffic:

       Apartment (220) ­ Apartments are rental dwelling units located within the same building
       with at least three other dwelling units, for example, quadraplexes and all types of
       apartment buildings. The studies included in this land use did not identify whether the
       apartments were low-rise, mid-rise, or high-rise.

ITE Trip Generation Manual assigns trip generation rates for apartments based dwelling units.
Separate generation rates and directional distributions are provided for weekday, AM peak hour,
and PM peak hour. The generation rates and peak hour traffic volumes are provided in Table 1.

While a synagogue currently occupies the site, existing vehicle trips to and from the site during
the peak hours was observed to be minimal. Therefore, no trip reductions have been taken to
account for existing trips to and from the site.

Trip Distribution and Assignment

The direction from which traffic approaches and departs a site is a function of numerous
variables, including location of residences, location of employment centers, location of
commercial/retail centers, available roadway systems, location and number of access points,
and level of congestion on adjacent road systems.

The directional distribution of project traffic is based on existing traffic patterns in the area. A
significant portion of project generated peak hour traffic is expected to be commuters bound to


                                               -9-
Conor Commercial Real Estate


and from major arterials and the regional freeway network. Traffic to and from the south on I-94
can use the partial interchange on Deerfield Road and while traffic to and from the north will
likely travel on Saunders Road to access the interchange located on Lake Cook Road. The
directional distribution and assignment of project traffic is illustrated in Figure 6.

Background Traffic Volumes

Background traffic volumes were estimated for the year 2019, which is five years beyond the
anticipated build-out in 2014. These volumes account for future (non-project related) growth in
the area. A growth rate of 1.0 percent per year has been applied to the existing traffic volumes
to estimate 2019 peak hour traffic. The background traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 7.

Future Traffic Volumes

The project traffic volumes are added to the background traffic volumes to obtain future year
2019 traffic volumes. Future volumes for the year 2019 are depicted in Figure 8.

IV. TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

Capacity Analysis

The operation of a facility is based on level of service (LOS) calculations using analytical
methods defined in the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual (HCM),
2000 Edition. The concept of LOS is defined as a quality measure describing operational
conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures as speed and
travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and convenience.

There are six LOS letter designations, from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating
conditions and LOS F the worst. In general, the various LOS are defined as follows:

       LOS A represents free flow. Individual users are virtually unaffected by the presence of
       others in the traffic stream. Freedom to select desired speeds and to maneuver within
       the traffic stream is extremely high. The general level of comfort and convenience
       provided to the motorist, passenger, or pedestrian is excellent.
       LOS B is in the range of stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream
       begins to be noticeable. Freedom to select desired speed is relatively unaffected, but
       there is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from LOS A.
       The level of comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less than at LOS A,
       because the presence of others in the traffic stream begins to affect individual behavior.
       LOS C is in the range of stable flow, but marks the beginning of the range of flow in
       which the operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions
       with others in the traffic stream. The selection of speed is now affected by the presence
       of others, and maneuvering within the traffic stream requires vigilance on the part of the
       user. The general level of comfort and convenience declines at this level.
       LOS D represents high-density, but stable flow. Speed and freedom to maneuver are
       restricted and the driver or pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of comfort and
       convenience. Small increases in traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at
       this level.
       LOS E represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level. All speeds are
       reduced to a low, but relatively uniform value. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic
       stream is difficult, and it is generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian to
       "give way" to accommodate such maneuvers. Comfort and convenience levels are poor,
       and driver or pedestrian frustration is generally high. Operations at this level are usually
       unstable, because small increases in flow or minor disturbances within the traffic stream
       will cause breakdowns.
       LOS F is used to define forced or breakdown flow. This condition exists wherever the
       amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount, which can traverse the point.
       Queues form behind such locations. Operations within the queue are characterized by


                                              - 14 -
Conor Commercial Real Estate


       stop-and-go waves, and they are extremely unstable. Vehicles may progress at
       reasonable speeds for several hundred feet or more, and then be required to stop in a
       cyclic fashion. LOS F is used to describe the operating conditions within the queue, as
       well as the point of breakdown. It should be noted, however, that in many cases
       operating conditions of vehicles or pedestrians discharged from the queue may be quite
       good. Nevertheless, it is the point at which arrival flow exceeds discharge flow, which
       causes the queue to form.
The LOS of an intersection is based on the average control delay per vehicle. For a signalized
intersection, the delay is calculated for each lane group and then aggregated for each approach
and for the intersection as a whole. Generally, the LOS is reported for the intersection as a
whole. For an unsignalized intersection, the delay is only calculated and reported for each
minor movement. An overall intersection LOS is not calculated.

There are different LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections primarily due to
driver perceptions of transportation facilities. The perception is that a signalized intersection is
expected to carry higher traffic volumes and experience a greater average delay than an
unsignalized intersection. The LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized intersections are
summarized in Table 2.

Typically, various state and local governments adopt standards varying between LOS C and
LOS E, depending on the area's size and roadway characteristics. Based on our past
experience in the Village of Deerfield and Lake County, a LOS D or better has been the
accepted operating standard. For purposes of this analysis, a LOS D has been assumed to be
the threshold.

The study area consists of the signalized intersection of Saunders Road and Parkway North, the
unsignalized intersection of Deerfield Road and Parkway North, and the unsignalized driveway
on Parkway North. The secondary access point along Deer Run Drive is an emergency access;
therefore, all of the site traffic has been assigned to the Parkway North primary driveway.

The capacity analysis was conducted using Highway Capacity Software (HCS+ v5.5) which
utilizes the methodology of the 2000 HCM. HCS+ files are created for the existing conditions,
background volumes, and future project traffic conditions for the three study intersections.

Results for the weekday AM and PM peak hour capacity analysis for the study area
intersections using the existing roadway configurations is illustrated in Table 3 for the existing,
background (2019), and future (with project) scenarios. Supporting analysis worksheets from
HCS+ for the existing, background, and future traffic conditions are provided in Appendices B,
C, and D, respectively.

Results for the capacity analysis indicate that all intersections operate at a LOS D or better for
all three scenarios with the exception of the northbound approach at Deerfield Road and
Parkway North during the PM peak hour. Under existing conditions, the northbound approach is
operating at LOS E. The intersection movement operates at a LOS F under the background
and future (plus project) scenarios. Based on these analysis results, a traffic signal warrant
analysis has been conducted to determine if a signal is warranted.

Traffic Signal Warrant Analysis

A planning-level traffic signal warrant analysis was conducted at the intersection of Deerfield
Road and Parkway North following the guidelines of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD) and the IDOT BDE Manual. IDOT typically requires that an intersection meet


                                                            - 16 -

Warrant 1, Eight Hour Vehicular Warrant. IDOT guidelines allow using a factor of 55 percent of
the peak hour traffic volumes to estimate the eighth highest hour of traffic at an intersection. In
addition, IDOT requires that a right-turn reduction analysis be conducted to determine if right
turn volumes should be decreased based on lane configuration and traffic volumes.

Following the MUTCD and IDOT guidelines, the intersection of Deerfield Road and Parkway
North meets Warrant 1, Eight Hour Vehicular Warrant under existing conditions. Since
Deerfield Road is maintained by Lake County, a full traffic signal warrant analysis will be
required in accordance to Lake County's Highway Access Regulation Ordinance.

Since the intersection of Deerfield Road and Parkway North meets signal warrants under
existing conditions, a capacity analysis has been conducted for the existing, background (2019),
and future (with project) scenarios at the intersection under signal control. Results of the
capacity analysis are summarized in Table 4. Figure 9 illustrates the future lane configurations
at the study area intersections. With a traffic signal, this intersection will operate at LOS B or
better.

On-Site Circulation

A review of the proposed on-site circulation has been conducted based on the site plan dated
March 8, 2013 by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture. The proposed plan includes an east-west
drive aisle connecting to Parkway North and a north-south drive aisle connecting to Deer Run
Drive. Striped crosswalks are provided at several locations to allow for pedestrian movements.
It is our professional opinion that the drive aisles and parking areas will operate acceptably.

Parking

The Village of Deerfield requires off-street parking based on the Village parking ordinance,
Municipal Code 8.02-E. The Village Code requires the following off street parking for multiple
family dwellings:

       Efficiency and one-bedroom units ­ one and one half parking spaces for each dwelling
       unit
       Two or more bedroom units ­ two parking spaces for each dwelling unit

Based on the proposed site plan of 247 apartments, with 159 studio/one-bedroom units, 85 two-
bedroom units, and three three-bedroom units, the site will require 415 parking spaces. The site
plan provides 440 parking spaces, which includes a 415-space parking garage and 25 surface
spaces.

The site meets the Village Code requirement of 415 parking spaces.

Public Transportation

Pace bus routes currently travel through the Parkway North Center and provide access to three
area Metra stations, other area businesses, and numerous connections to other Pace bus
routes. A bus stop currently exists at the office building directly west of the proposed
development along Parkway North. This will provide future residents an opportunity to utilize
the area public transportation system and access Metra.

V. CONCLUSIONS

This study analyzed the traffic impacts for the proposed development consisting of a 227-unit
apartment complex located at 10 Parkway North in the Village of Deerfield, Illinois which is
expected to be constructed and occupied by 2014. A synagogue is currently located on the
subject parcel with two access points to Deer Run Drive. The development proposes a full
access driveway along Parkway North and will close one driveway to Deer Run Drive and
modify the second as an emergency access driveway.

A capacity analysis was performed at the study area intersections for the existing, background,
and future (with project) conditions during the weekday AM and PM peak hours. Traffic was
estimated to the year 2019, which is five years beyond the anticipated build-out. The study area
consists of the signalized intersection of Saunders Road and Parkway North, and the
unsignalized intersection of Deerfield Road and Parkway North in addition to the proposed
primary access point on Parkway North.

Results for the capacity analysis indicate that all intersections operate at a LOS D or better for
all three scenarios with the exception of the northbound approach at Deerfield Road and
Parkway North during the PM peak hour. Under existing conditions, the northbound approach is
operating at LOS E. The intersection movement operates at a LOS F under the background
and future (plus project) scenarios. Based on these analysis results, a traffic signal warrant
analysis has been conducted to determine if a signal is warranted.

Utilizing the guidelines of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and the
IDOT BDE Manual, a planning-level signal warrant analysis was conducted at the intersection of
Deerfield Road and Parkway North using existing traffic volumes. The results of the analysis
indicate that the intersection meets Warrant 1, Eight Hour Vehicular Warrant under existing
conditions. When analyzed with a traffic signal, the intersection operates at LOS B or better for
all three scenarios. Since Deerfield Road is maintained by Lake County, a full traffic signal
warrant analysis will be required in accordance to Lake County's Highway Access Regulation
Ordinance.

The Village of Deerfield requires off-street parking based on the Village parking ordinance.
Based on the proposed site plan of 247 apartments, with 159 studio/one-bedroom units, 85 two-
bedroom units, and three three-bedroom units, the site will require 415 parking spaces. The site
plan provides 440 parking spaces, which includes a 415-space parking garage and a 25-space
surface parking lot. The site meets the Village Code requirement of 415 parking spaces.

Pace bus routes currently travel through the Parkway North Center and provide access to three
area Metra stations, other area businesses, and numerous Pace bus routes. A bus stop
currently exists at the office building directly west of the proposed development along Parkway
North. This will provide future residents an opportunity to utilize the area public transportation
system and access Metra.

Re:            Parkway North Center ­ Northeast Parcel/Synagogue property

Subject:    Utility Capacity Research
____________________________________________________________________________

This memo documents V3's review of the sanitary sewer and water main utilities
available to service proposed developments on the Synagogue property in
unincorporated Lake County, IL, adjacent to the Parkway North Center development
located at the southeast corner of Saunders Road and Deerfield Road. It is our
understanding that this site may be developed as multi family, with up to 250 units (162
one bedroom and 88 two bedroom), however there is no site plan developed yet. It is our
understanding the future development of Buildings 7A and 7B within the Parkway North
Center development are assumed to be a total of 255,000 SF of office for the purpose of
this analysis. Research for this analysis includes review of atlas maps/surveys provided
by the Village of Deerfield, Lake County Public Works, and Compass Surveying, Ltd,
email correspondence and telephone conversations with the aforementioned agencies,
and prior engineering plans prepared by V3 Companies for various portions of the
Parkway North Center development. Please note while available survey documents were
reviewed, V3 did not obtain or review additional recorded documents pertaining to
easement rights or private developer agreements at the time of this analysis.


Water Main
There is a 12" water main that loops through the PNC development. This water main is owned
by the Village of Deerfield but maintained by the owner of the PNC development (hereinafter
presumed to be The John Buck Company and referred to as JBC). The 12" water main is within
a 15 foot water main easement. There is also an existing 12" water main along Deerfield Rd.
which is owned and maintained by the Village of Deerfield and located within the public Right-of-
Way. It extends from the intersection at Parkway North Boulevard westward along the south
side of Deerfield Rd.

There are two options for providing water main service for these properties:

Option 1 ­ Connect to the Parkway North Center Water Main
The 12" water main within the PNC development is owned by the Village, and in a phone
conversation, the Village said they would allow a connection to it. If the connection has to cross
any private property, then the connection would require an easement and agreement with JBC.

Based on the survey documents reviewed, however, additional easements would likely be
necessary to connect water main from the subject property to the private 12" water main.

Option 2 ­ Connect to the Public Water Main at Deerfield Road and Parkway North
Boulevard
In the event that a connection could not be made to the water main along Parkway North
Boulevard because an agreement could not be reached with JBC, then the proposed
development would need to extend water main westward approximately 900 feet within the
Deerfield Rd. Right-of-Way to connect to the public 12" water main.


Sanitary Sewer
There are three components to the sanitary treatment system that require capacity verification.

    1. Lake County Public Works ­ southeast interceptor and treatment plant.

It has been confirmed by Lake County Public Works (LCPW) that the county's southeast
interceptor system and treatment plant was designed to accommodate the subject property.
The planning for this property anticipated 315 P.E. for the design of the recent interceptor
system upgrades. At a targeted unit count of 250 apartment units the resulting demand would
be 507 P.E. While this is over the allocated amount for this property, the Parkway North Center
development is not expected to utilize the capacity that is allocated to it. Calculations
supporting this conclusion are included herein. The "sharing" of the capacity allocation between
the properties would require approval from both the John Buck Company and LCPW.

LCPW will require a connection fee for developments tributary to their wastewater treatment
system. The current fee structure for this region is $5,838 per Residential Equivalent (1 R.E. =
250 GPD). The R.E. for 250 unit apartment building would be 203 (based on 100 GPD/person
and using IEPA's guidelines of 1.5 persons per 1 bedroom apartment and 3 persons for 2
bedroom apartments). 203 R.E. equates to approximately $1,185,114 fee. Flow rates and fees
are based on current LCPW requirements and are subject to change.

    2. Parkway North Center Lift Station and Hawthorne Force Main capacity.

Metropolitan Industries has completed a review of their pump design to determine the potential
need for replacing the pumps in the lift station to accommodate the additional flow. The pumps
were upgraded in 1999 to 7.5 HP utilizing a 10 inch impeller. To accommodate the increase in
flow volume from the proposed multi-family development, as well as the anticipated build out of
the remaining office buildings within the Parkway North Center business park, the pumps would
need to be upgraded to 10 HP and the impeller would increase to 10.875 inch. The cost of the
pumps and impeller upgrade would be approximately $25,000.

Metropolitan Pump also indicated that with the additional flow, the storage capacity of the lift
station may be near the maximum volume relative to the recommended/starts per hour. This
will require a more detailed analysis based on actual flows and field data. If this is the case, it is
possible that either the storage would need to be increased, or a Variable Frequency Drive
would need to be installed. It is estimated that the cost of this upgraded system would be
$75,000-$85,000 for materials and installation. At this time it this is not an expected outcome,
however, Conor and JBC should be aware of this possibility upon full build-out and full capacity
of the Business Park and apartments.

    3. Parkway North Center 8" gravity sewer capacity

There is an existing 8" sanitary sewer within the PNC development that runs along Parkway
North Boulevard, in between Building 1 and the hotel building and to the PNC lift station. The
PNC 8" gravity sewer has been verified that it does have capacity to accommodate the
additional flows from the proposed 250 unit multi-family development.

There are two options for providing sanitary sewer to service these properties:

Option 1 ­ Connect to the Parkway North Center Sanitary Sewer System
The sanitary sewers within the Parkway North Center (PNC) development are privately owned
and maintained. Connecting to these sewers would require an agreement between the
developer and private sewer owners JBC, as well as a maintenance agreement to share the
cost of maintaining the shared existing gravity sewer line, lift station, and forecemain.


Option 2 ­ Connect to the Public Sanitary Sewer at Saunders Road and Parkway North
Boulevard
There is public gravity sewer along Saunders Rd., both north and south of Deerfield Rd. that
combines at the intersection and extends west along Deerfield Rd., however this sewer does
not have any remaining capacity. There is also a public force main along Saunders Rd. that
flows south, but Lake County Public Works will not allow a connection to this force main.
Therefore, the nearest public sanitary sewer with sufficient capacity for this development is the
18" gravity interceptor sewer that ends at Saunders Rd. and Parkway North Blvd. and continues
along the east side of Saunders Rd. south towards Lake Cook Rd. The developer would be
required to bear the cost of extending sewer from the proposed development and connecting to
this public interceptor. The sewer extension could be routed through the PNC development, or
along the public Right-of-Way of Deerfield Rd. and Saunders Rd. Extending sewer through the
PNC development would require utility easements through JBC. Extending sewer along
Deerfield Rd. and Saunders Rd. would not require additional easements if routed within the
Right-of-Way, but this route would be a longer distance (approximately 3,000 feet total). It is
anticipated that either route for the sewer extension would require a new lift station and force
main due to the elevations of the existing interceptor sewer, however the exact invert elevations
of the existing sewer should be verified to confirm. V3 did not review specific routing and
potential conflicts/issues with either sewer extension route, but would require a utility survey of
the proposed route to complete that analysis.

RE:             Fiscal Impact Study for Woodview Apartments Development in Deerfield, IL

Pursuant to our recent discussions, SB Friedman Development Advisors is pleased to present these
preliminary findings of a fiscal impact study for the proposed Woodview Apartments project.

Introduction and Background
In April of 2013, SB Friedman Development Advisors ("SB Friedman") was engaged by Conor Commercial
Real Estate ("Conor") to conduct a fiscal impact study for the proposed Woodview Apartments project
("the Project") adjacent to the Village of Deerfield, IL ("the Village"). The proposed development site
("the Site") is approximately 7.7 acres and consists of four tax parcels at the southwest corner of
Deerfield Road and the Tri-State Tollway (I-94). The Site is currently in unincorporated Lake County, but
would be annexed by the Village prior to construction. The Project, as we understand it, consists of 260
for-rent apartment units, including a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, with an
estimated average monthly rent of approximately $1,900. Amenities are expected to include structured
parking, an outdoor pool, a fitness room, and a community garden.

This memo serves as a presentation of our preliminary findings regarding the fiscal impact of the Project
on the Village and selected taxing districts. We are assuming that subsequent to annexation, the Village
of Deerfield, the Deerfield Library and Deerfield Park districts will be added to the current taxing districts
serving the Site. We describe projected operating revenues and expenses generated by the Project for
the Village, Deerfield-Bannockburn Fire Protection District ("Fire District"), Deerfield Park District ("Park
District"), Deerfield Library District ("Library District"), Deerfield School District #109 ("SD #109"), and
Highland Park High School District #113 ("SD #113").

The memo closes with a discussion of the key findings and methodology of our preliminary analysis and
suggestions for next steps.

Summary of Projected Net Fiscal Impacts
Table 1 below summarizes the projected annual revenues, expenses, and net impacts of the Project on
the aforementioned taxing districts at project stabilization. Our expense projections are based on the
average cost approach, which is explained in more detail herein. The key assumptions supporting these
projections are presented in Tables 1A through 8A in the Appendix. Further discussion of the
assumptions and methodology used in the analysis will be included in the final draft of the full fiscal
impact report.

The aggregate net fiscal impact of the Project for all taxing districts is expected to be positive. However,
each district has a separate property tax levy and budget, and the impacts are often considered
individually. The preliminary results indicate slightly negative net fiscal impacts for the Village, Park
District, Library District and Fire District. A net positive fiscal impact is projected for both SD #109 and SD
#113.

Conor anticipates paying several development-related fees to the Village and the other taxing districts.
These fees include impact fees, utility tap on fees, building permit and review fees, and cash
contributions in lieu of land dedication. Table 2 below shows the calculated fees based on the Village's
published equations. They have not yet been applied to the Woodview project with appropriate credits.

Conor Commercial Real Estate                              Woodview Apartments Project Fiscal Impact Analysis


Analysis Approach
This memo presents our preliminary findings of the fiscal impacts for the Project using the conservative
average cost method.

The average cost approach typically involves estimating the taxing district's operating budget on a per
capita (or other appropriate allocation method) basis and allocating the cost to the development, based
on the population (or employee, trip or other appropriate metric) generation of that development. In
our experience, the average cost approach tends to overstate the service cost impacts of new
development, particularly in relatively mature communities with adequate service capacity.

In a more mature community, the marginal cost approach is often more accurate, since mature
communities have typically reached a stabilized level of service and service capacity, and therefore new
development is likely to have little financial impact on most taxing district budgets. The marginal cost
approach involves a more detailed review of taxing district costs, based on interviews with
representatives of each district. Through these interviews, we would evaluate the proportion of fixed
versus variable costs of each departmental budget, levels of service, and the sizes, locations and service
areas of current service facilities (e.g., police and fire stations, public works facilities, libraries) If the
marginal cost approach is conducted, it is likely that the Project would generate net positive impacts for
many of the taxing districts.


Conclusions
In summary, the key findings of our analysis under the average cost approach are as follows:

    ·   Overall, the projected net fiscal impact of the Project is positive if all taxing districts are
        examined in aggregate.
    ·   The Project is projected to generate a net negative fiscal impact for the Village, Park District,
        Library District and Fire District.
    ·   The Project is projected to result in a net positive fiscal impact for SD #109 and SD #113.
    ·   In our experience conducting fiscal impact analyses in mature communities with a stable
        population, such as Deerfield, the average cost approach tends to overstate the cost impact of
        development.
    ·   It is likely that many of the taxing districts currently have adequate service capacity to
        accommodate development without incurring additional costs.
    ·   By using a marginal cost approach, the net fiscal impact of the Project will likely be positive for
        taxing districts with adequate service capacity to serve new development.

Next Steps
After receiving feedback from the Village and Conor, we may consider the marginal cost approach and
will produce a final report detailing our methodology, data sources and assumptions.

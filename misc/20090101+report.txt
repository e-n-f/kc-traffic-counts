INTRODUCTION
SECTION 1.


The intersection of Woodside Road & Broadway is located in the southeasterly portion of the
City of Redwood City near the Bayshore Freeway (U.S. 101). Woodside Road from U.S. 101
westerly is State Route 84. It is a 5-leg intersection with the southbound off-ramp from U.S. 101
to westbound Woodside Road forming the fifth leg of what would otherwise be a conventional 4-
way intersection. The Intersection Diagram, Figure 1, page 2, shows how the intersection is
configured.

The intersection is controlled by a vehicle/pedestrian actuated, 6-phase traffic signal. The off-
ramp and the two approaches of Broadway have their own exclusive traffic signal phases. There
are pedestrian crosswalks on three legs of the intersection controlled by pedestrian actuated
signals.

Traffic through the intersection averages 60,500 vehicles per day with 44,000 vehicles per day on
Woodside Road and 16,500 vehicles per day on Broadway.1

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the installation of an automatic red
light enforcement system (ARLES) on the southbound to westbound off-ramp approach to the
intersection due to a high collision rate at the intersection.

COLLISION DATA
SECTION 2.

Reported traffic collisions for a five year period from January, 2004, to approximately the end of
January, 2009, have been evaluated for the study intersection as well as two adjacent
intersections on Woodside Road, those being at Bay Road and at Middlefield Road. The Bay
Road intersection is approximately 0.12 mile west of the Broadway intersection and is a 4-way,
traffic signal controlled intersection. The Middlefield Road intersection is approximately 0.5
mile west of the Broadway and it, too, is a 4-way, traffic signal controlled intersection.

The reported traffic collision data is summarized in Table A below for the three intersections.
Collision data is summarized in tables in Appendix A.

The Woodside Road & Broadway intersection experiences collision rates 2-3 times that of the
other two intersections and the red light violation accident rate is also 2-3 times that of the other
two intersections

A breakdown of the red light violation collisions at the Woodside Road & Broadway intersection
is provided in Table B on the following page.

Forty-four percent of the RLV accidents occurred at night. The westbound off-ramp approach
accounted for 40% of the RLV accidents. Of those accidents, 70% occurred at night. In a few of
the westbound approach nighttime accidents the drivers indicated confusion with the signal
indications. The far side signal heads for the westbound Woodside Road and the westbound off-
ramp approach are the programmed visibility type. This type of signal head is designed to
convey the indication only to the lanes that are programmed into it. However, at night these
signal heads do display a faintly visible indication to approach lanes other than those for which
they are programmed.

COUNTERMEASURES
SECTION 3.

There are a number of countermeasures that could be applied to the intersection and its
approaches that may provide effective in reducing the number of RLV collisions in lieu of the
installation of an ARLES. Some of these countermeasures have already been installed at the
intersection.

A.   IMPROVED SIGNAL HEAD VISIBILITY

The southbound to westbound Route 101 off-ramp approach to the intersection has five signal
heads controlling the approach, three at near side and two at far side locations. The adjacent
westbound Woodside Road approach is controlled by only three signal heads, one at near side
and two at far side locations. The far side signal indications for these two westbound approaches
are the programmed visibility type in order to separate the conflicting signal indications. Figure
2, page 6, Traffic Signal Indications, shows the location and type of traffic signal heads for the
entire intersection.

All of the signal heads and indications for all of the traffic movements appear to be in
conformance with Caltrans and the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(CAMUTCD). There are almost as many RLV's for the eastbound Woodside approach as there
are for the southbound to westbound off-ramp approach. Visibility of signal indications does not
appear to be the problem but rather driver inattention.

B.   ADDITIONAL SIGNAL HEADS

As discussed in the previous sub-section the number and visibility of signal heads does not
appear to be a significant contributor to the RLV collisions on any approach.

C.   YELLOW CHANGE INTERVALS

The timing plan for the intersection as provided by Caltrans has the settings shown in Table C on
page 7.

The minimum yellow change interval is set by Table 4D-102 in the California MUTCD using the
formula T = V/2d + tR where T is the yellow time, V is the posted speed or prima facie speed in
ft/sec, d is the deceleration rate of 10 ft/sec2, and tR is the reaction time taken at 1.0 sec.

The Institute of Transportation Engineers formula2 is similar to the California MUTCD formula
as is the formula contained in a U.S. Department of Transportation publication.3

     CP = t + V/(2a + 64.4g) + (W+L)/V

     CP = change period, sec.
     t = perception-reaction time, typically 1.0 sec.
     V = speed of approach, ft/sec
     a = comfortable deceleration rate, typically 10 ft/sec2
     W = width of intersection, curb to curb, ft.
     L = length of vehicle, typically 20 ft.
     g = grade of the intersection in percent, positive or negative

However, the ITE formula contains consideration for the width of the intersection. The third
term in the formula is typically used as the all red clearance interval.

Two field observations of the intersection were conducted during an off-peak, mid-week day
period and one during the afternoon peak period of the same day. The observations focused on
how traffic cleared the intersection at the end of each signal phase. Figure 3, Intersection
Clearance, page 8, shows the clearance distances from the limit lines to the rear crosswalk line on
the opposite side of the intersection for traffic on westbound Woodside Road and on the off-

ramp. The clearance times were measured using a stop watch and the range of observed times
are shown on Figure 3.

Assuming a 35 mph speed of approach and using the ITE formula, the CP for westbound
Woodside Road should be 6.3 seconds (3.6 sec. yellow clearance and 2.7 sec. all-red). The
present timing is 4.5 seconds of yellow clearance and no all-red timing. The maximum observed
clearance time for this movement was measured at 4.5 seconds.

This same analysis applies to the off-ramp approach as well. For this movement the CP is
calculated to be 6.3 seconds. The CP for this movement is 6.0 seconds including 2.0 seconds of
all-red timing. For straight through movements the maximum observed clearance time was
found to be 4.5 seconds. Left turn movements from the off-ramp must cover 175 feet to clear the
intersection. Observation found this movement to take up to 8.5 seconds to clear the
intersection. With the next phase in the signal sequence being southbound Broadway,
lengthening the CP would not necessarily improve intersection safety. In the five year review
period there was only one accident involving westbound off-ramp traffic with southbound
Broadway traffic.

A review of the RLV collisions involving westbound Woodside Road and the off-ramp has found
an increase in the rate of these type of collisions following the timing change. The rate of RLV
collisions for westbound Woodside Road increased by 48.3% and the rate of RLV collisions for
the off-ramp increased by 234%. For the total intersection the rate of RLV Collisions increased
by 47.2%. However, there was an overall 14.6% reduction in the rate of total collisions at the
intersection following the timing change.

During field observation the signal cycle length averaged 225 seconds during the afternoon peak
traffic period. Additional increases in the CP will lengthen an already long cycle length leading
to further delay. Frustration of drivers over lengthy delays contributes to red light violations and
an increase in rear end accidents.4

D.    ALL-RED INTERVALS

Presently only the southbound to westbound off-ramp approach signal phase 7 CP contains an
all-red time. The CP for signal phase 2 (eastbound Woodside Road) and signal phase 6
(westbound Woodside Road) could have all red intervals according to the calculation in
subsection 3.C. above. Table D on page 9 shows suggested CP timing for the intersection based
on the ITE formula. The addition of all-red timing will increase the peak period cycle length by
only about 1%. However, the increase in cycle length has the potential to increase RLV and rear
end accidents.

E.    ADVANCE WARNING SIGNING

Advance warning signs (Signal Ahead, W3-3) are in place on both sides of the southbound to
westbound off-ramp approximately 200 feet in advance of the limit line. There are no other
advance warning signal ahead signs on any other approach to the intersection. Because of the
curve of the road and foliage along side it, visibility of the intersection is obstructed for traffic
exiting the freeway. There are advisory, 45 mph speed limit signs on the off-ramp.

The minimum approach sight distance for a 35 mph posted speed limit is 325 feet for signalized
intersections. All of the other approaches have intersection sight distance in excess of the
minimum. No additional advance warning signs are needed.

F.    ADVANCED YELLOW FLASHING BEACONS

The two advance warning signs on the off-ramp each have 12-inch yellow flashing beacons as
part of the sign structure. No other advanced yellow flashing beacons are provided on any of the
other approaches to the intersection.

G.    TRAFFIC SIGNAL COORDINATION

The intersection traffic signal is coordinated with the two adjacent signalized intersections on
Woodside Road at Bay Road and Veterans Boulevard. The master controller is located at the
Bay Road intersection.

H.    ADDITIONAL ADVANCE DETECTION

All of the through lane approaches have advance, in-pavement loop detection as well as limit line
loop detectors. No additional advance detection is needed.

TRAFFIC SIGNAL TIMING PLAN
SECTION 4.
An evaluation of the intersection was made for the morning peak hour (7:30-8:30 a.m.) and the
afternoon peak hour (4:30-5:30 p.m.) using count data provided by the City and the Synchro 6
program5 to optimize the cycle length and phase splits. The analysis evaluated the timing using
the current plan and one with modified change periods, CP, as shown in Table D, page 9. The
current timing plan is provided in Appendix B together with the peak period turning movement
count data.

The analysis found the optimal cycle length did not change with the addition of all-red times in
the CP for phases 2 and 6. Table E below shows the phase splits for both the morning and
afternoon peak hours.

The intersection operates at LOS (level of service) F during the peak hours of the day and will
continue to operate at this level even with the recommended changes in the maximum phase
extensions. However, a more equitable balance of phase splits should lessen frustration by
drivers on the critical phases, particularly phase 7. Driver frustration is a contributor to RLV
collisions.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
SECTION 5.

CONCLUSIONS

The intersection of Woodside Road & Broadway experiences 2-3 times the rate of RLV
collisions as do two nearby intersections on Woodside Road. The southbound to westbound 101
off ramp traffic accounts for 40% of the RLV collisions at the intersection. Eight
countermeasures were evaluated to determine if any of them could reduce the potential for RLV
collisions. Timing changes made in 2005 to lengthen the CP for all signal phases resulted in a
14.6% reduction in the rate of all collisions at the intersection, but the rate of RLV collisions
actually increased, particularly on the off-ramp approach.

Most of the countermeasure actions have already been applied to the intersection or would have
no effect on the rate of RLV collisions. The suggestions for modifying the timing plan may
reduce driver frustration on some of the approaches which in turn may reduce RLV collisions,
but with the intersection operating at LOS F during the peak traffic hours, the effect will be
minimal.


RECOMMENDATIONS

1.   Install an ARLES (automatic red light enforcement system) on the southbound to
     westbound off-ramp approach to the intersection to reduce the number of RLV collisions.

2.   Consider for future installation an ARLES on the eastbound Woodside Road approach to
     the intersection.

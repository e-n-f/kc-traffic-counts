RE:         Transportation Impact Study
            Eco Express Car Wash ­ Aurora, Colorado


Dear Mr. Wells:

This traffic impact analysis provides a study of the traffic impact occasioned by a proposed
automatic car wash in Aurora, Colorado. The project proposes to build an approximately 4,300
square foot facility with one drive through wash lane and several self-serve vacuum stations. The
                                                    site is located on the northeast corner of East
                                                    Asbury Ave. and South Havana Street. The
                                                    exhibit to the left shows the location and
                                                    surrounding area on an aerial photograph.
                                                    Access to the site will be from East Asbury
                                                    and South Havana. Both accesses will be full-
                                                    movement. The appendix contains the site
                                                    plan.

                                                    EXISTING CONDITIONS
                                                    South Havana Street is a six-lane principal
                                                    arterial roadway. It is a state highway (SH-
                                                    30). The speed limit is 45 mph. Currently
                                                    South Havana Street carries approximately
                                                    40,000 AADT according to CDOT's OTIS
                                                    website. The center left turn lanes allows left
                                                    turns in and left turns out. East Asbury Ave.
                                                    is a two-lane collector that carries about
                                                    1,000 ADT. The intersection of South
                                                    Havana and East Asbury is two-way stop
                                                    sign controlled. The existing AM and PM
                                                    peak hour counts at South Havana and East
                                                    Asbury were taken October 16, 2013 by All
                                                    Traffic Data Services, Inc., a professional

PROJECT TRAFFIC
The proposed land use is a 4,300 square foot automatic car wash. The estimated trip generation is
based on rates and values from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition. However,
because this particular car wash could service a higher volume (theoretically, 90 vehicles per
hour) we have doubled the observed volume from ITE to be conservative in the analysis. The
following chart shows the adjusted trip generation for the PM peak hour, which is the heaviest
time of travel on the adjacent streets and intersections. Because the PM peak hour is heaviest time
of travel, it is considered the design hour volume (DHV) for geometric design and traffic control
purposes. It is important to note that the theoretical maximum of 90 vph would not occur during
the PM peak hour (one hour between 4 and 6 pm on an average weekday). The maximum hourly
volume is possible, though, on a Saturday afternoon, the busiest time for a car wash.

TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
Undoubtedly, the majority of trips in and out of the car wash will use the entrance on South
Havana St. For this analysis, we have assumed that two thirds of the total (66%) will use the
Havana entrance. The other one third will use the East Asbury entrance with about half entering
and exiting to and from the neighborhood to the east and the other half from the west, which
assumes some will turn in from South Havana at the intersection with East Asbury. In terms of
numbers, we expect 20 vph entering and 20 vph exiting on northbound South Havana and 20 vph
entering and 20 vph existing on southbound South Havana. On East Asbury, 10 vph is expected
to enter and 10 vph exit on westbound Asbury and likewise 10 vph to enter and 10 vph to exit on
eastbound Asbury. On Asbury to the east of the site, 20 vehicular trips (10 vph westbound and 10
vph eastbound) are projected in the PM peak hour. On a Saturday afternoon, the total could rise to
30 vehicular trips in a one-hour period. Again, these are highly conservative numbers. It is
entirely possible that there would be zero trips on Asbury during the PM peak hour and on
Saturday afternoon. Note that the majority if not all the entering and exiting traffic is "passer-by"
or traffic that is already on the street and stops in for a car wash. In addition, we expect that most
of traffic from the east on Asbury will be residents of the adjacent neighborhoods.

SITE CIRCULATION AND QUEUING EVALUATION
The site will have three stations for point of sale functions prior to entering the wash line. From
Havana, the stations are approximately 500 feet away. From Asbury, they are approximately 200
feet away. Each station has about 100 feet of queuing space for a total of 300 feet or at 25 feet per
                                              Aldridge Transportation Consultants, LLC
                                                                                            Page 3 of 4


vehicle, the three stations could queue 12 vehicles. Queuing for a car wash is dynamic and
continually moving. At 60 vph, that is one vehicle every minute. However, arrivals are random
and not spaced equally apart. Consequently, queues will likely accumulate or "bunch." To
determine if there is sufficient space for queues that would not extend beyond the station queuing
area, we evaluated the probability of exactly n vehicles in the queue with a stochastic queuing
performance equation for random arrivals and random service single (one car wash line) channel
systems1. The equation, P (n) = p^n(1-p), where P(n) = probability of exactly n vehicles in the
queue, p = traffic intensity and n = number of vehicles in the queue was applied to the number
(60) of vehicles expected to enter during the PM peak period (60 minutes). Assuming that the car
wash can service 90 vehicles per hour then the value for traffic intensity (p) is equal to 60/90 or
.66. The probability that 12 vehicles would queue during the PM peak hour ((.66^12(1-.66) =
.0023)) is .2 percent which is obviously exceptionally low and therefore the chances of 12
vehicles being in the queue is virtually non-existent.

Note also that the car wash is equipped with sensors that stop the car wash line in the event of
blockage caused by queuing or breakdown. This is a standard safety feature.

TRAFFIC IMPACT CONSIDERATIONS
ATC uses Synchro v.8 for operations analyses. The Synchro methodology is based on the
Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM). The Synchro HCM reports are attached for reference.
The chart summarizes the existing and forecast 2033 LOS (level of service). LOS is letter rating
from A to F. LOS A indicates free-flow traffic conditions and no delay at intersections. LOS F is
heavy traffic congestion with significant delay. LOS is provided for the overall operations at
signalized intersections. LOS D is generally the benchmark for acceptable signalized intersection
operations during the weekday peak hours. The LOS rating for unsignalized intersections is
provided by the critical movement - not the overall - which is generally a left turn from the minor
street. Caution must be used when evaluating the LOS at unsignalized intersections particularly
when LOS F is shown. In the case of an LOS F, the HCM2 suggests that other evaluation
measures should be considered such as the volume over capacity ratio and 95th percentile queue
length to make the most effective traffic control decision. LOS F at unsignalized intersections is
often normal for the weekday peak hour when either the v/c ratio or the 95th percentile queue
length is acceptable. Note also that in conditions where the major street (South Havana) carries
greater than 15,000 average daily traffic, the minor street left turn (East Asbury or the Havana
entrance) will always register LOS F even if it is only one vehicle making the turn. Therefore, in
this case the other performance measures are vitally important.

At the Havana/Asbury intersection in the AM peak hour the control delay is 115.9 seconds per
vehicle, however the 95th percentile queue length is only one vehicle in a one hour period. In the
PM peak hour the control delay exceeds 300 seconds however, the 95th percentile queue is just

two vehicles in a one-hour period. The 95th percentile queue is acceptable. Note that LOS F is
normal for an unsignalized intersection in an urban area. The volumes on the minor street (East
Asbury) approach are too low to qualify for a traffic signal. The impact of the car wash on the
intersection is too small to have any measurable impact on the intersection.

The access to Havana will operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour, however, the volume over
capacity for the movement is .45 and the 95th percentile queue is about two vehicles in a one-hour
period. This condition is normal and acceptable.

The access to Asbury will operate at LOS A in the PM peak hour. The movement in and out will
have no impact on the east/west through movements on Asbury.

MITIGATION MEASURES
The primary concern for the neighborhood to the east of the site is unwanted traffic using Asbury
to access the car wash. A review of the neighborhood streets reveals that the only users of the car
wash from this direction would be the residents themselves. With the exception of Joliet and
Lima, the connecting streets to Asbury are short cul-de-sacs. The chances of any "cut-through"
traffic using Asbury to access the car wash must be considered random and occasional at best. No
mitigation measures are necessary to limit the use of the Asbury entrance. Moreover, prohibiting
the left turn out from the Asbury entrance, as has been indicated, would be a disservice for those
residents wanting to return home after having their car washed.

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS
This analysis finds that the proposed Eco Express Car Wash will have no impact on the adjacent
streets and intersections. The access locations and circulation will function harmoniously with the
current and future traffic flow on South Havana and East Asbury. No improvements to the
adjacent streets and intersections are occasioned by the additional traffic from the development.

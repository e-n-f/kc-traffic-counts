Route 62 Smart Transportation Corridor Study
Final Report October 2010
                                                               Section 1

Section 1.0 Introduction
The City of Oil City is located in Venango County at the
confluence of Oil Creek at the Allegheny River. Oil City
is bordered by Cornplanter Township, Cranberry
Township, and Sugarcreek Borough. The City
encompasses 4.7 square miles of a predominately
rural community of wooded lots and rolling hills. The
region of Oil City was first established as an American
settlement in the early 1800s, but grew in size and
population following the development of commercial
oil wells, refineries and support businesses. The
growth of Oil City was a direct result of its location
where Oil Creek and the Allegheny River come               Oil City's South Side
together, and the use of the Allegheny River as the
primary means of transporting the local resources.

The downtown area of Oil City is split by the
Allegheny River. The two areas of Oil City's downtown
are commonly known as the "north side" and "south
side." US Route 62 runs through Oil City and provides
access to the City's south side area. US Route 62, or
East Front Street/East First Street as it is named on
the south side, runs along the Allegheny River through
the downtown area and crosses the River by way of
Petroleum Street.

Section 1.1 Plan Purpose
Venango County, in cooperation with the City of Oil
City, realized the need to examine the land use and
transportation needs impacting the sustainability,
accessibility and safety of US Route 62 through Oil
City. This corridor traverses an urban, densely
developed portion of the south side of Oil City.
                                                              Latonia Theatre
Therefore, as with any downtown area, there is a mix
of various transportation modes that must be
considered in developing appropriate transportation
and land use enhancements.

The study emphasis is to coordinate transportation
improvements with land use, infrastructure and other
community development decisions that will respond
to the unique land use and transportation needs of
the south side business and commercial districts and
that will be cohesive with goals and objectives defined           Wye Bridge
by the stakeholders at the outset of the project. In



                                                                      Page |1

2005, Hickory Engineering (a Herbert, Rowland & Grubic, Inc. Company) prepared a "Route 8 and Route
62 Corridor Evaluation" under contract with the Oil Region Alliance and the municipalities of the City of
Oil City, Cornplanter Township, City of Franklin, Sugarcreek Borough, and Rouseville Borough. This study
generated (a) a database of all buildings, land parcels, and properties along Routes 8 and/or 62 in the
subject governmental entities; (b) detailed building condition reports and adaptive use/reuse plans for
13 sample buildings throughout the corridor; (c) riverfront access and recreation development
recommendations; and (d) policy/planning recommendations to showcase these highways which in
essence function as the Main Street of the heart of Venango County, Pennsylvania. The City of Oil City
has also undertaken a Comprehensive Waterways Plan to address the waterways assets running through
the City and capitalizing on them to improve the quality of life for residents and to promote economic
development and increased tourism. The Route 62 Smart Transportation Study will coordinate with
these and other efforts so that the recommendations of this study will complement and work with these
other studies to reach the overall goals of the City. The transportation recommendations and land use
decisions along the US Route 62 Corridor are important to the overall transportation network and future
economic growth of Oil City.

Section 1.2 Planning Process
The process for developing the US Route 62 Corridor Plan was based on a collaborative planning effort
focused on gaining an understanding of the community's vision for the study area. Several key parties
were involved through discussions about the project and initiatives to assist in developing an
understanding of future growth in the area. The project Steering Committee included representatives
from the City of Oil City, Northwest Pennsylvania Regional Planning and Development Commission
(NWPRPDC), PennDOT District 1-0, Venango County Regional Planning Commission, South Side Business
Association, and other key stakeholders. The planning process also included coordination with the
general public to assist with the development of future plans for the project study area. Documentation
of the planning process is contained in Appendix A: Community Participation Report.

Section 2.0 Vision, Goals & Objectives
The Vision for the study corridor, including its goals, objectives, implementation concepts and strategies,
creates the foundation that guides future transportation enhancements, development and
redevelopment/revitalization projects. Such strategies and future development policies are created
through a collaborative step-by-step planning process used to create a Vision for the Corridor. The
planning process for the Route 62 Corridor Study followed these steps for strategic vision planning:

        Step 1:      Vision - Define the vision and set a strategy containing a hierarchy of goals.
        Step 2:      SWOT - Analysis conducted to understand a community's "perceived" issues and
                     assets (conducted at first public forum).
        Step 3:      Goal Setting ­ Prepare measurable, meaningful, and attainable goals based on
                     community sustainability indicators (business meeting, first public meeting,
                     committee meetings).
        Step 4:      Formulate Strategies - Formulate actions and processes to be taken to attain these
                     goals (Map your Path).

Section 2.1 Vision
An initial Vision Statement was prepared using key words identified by the project's Steering Committee
at the kick-off meeting. Committee members were asked: What key words would you use to describe
the future corridor?

       Key Words
             Development / Re-Development                    Smart Transportation
             Implementation Strategy                         Pedestrian Safety
             Vehicular Safety                                River Access
             Improved Sight Distance                         Aesthetically Pleasing
             Accessible                                      Sustainable

A second draft of the Vision Statement was prepared and finalized after the first public meeting. The
following is the statement refined through the planning process, and accepted as a Vision for the
corridor:

        Corridor Vision Statement
        Enhance the Route 62 Corridor within Oil City to be a model of PennDOT's Smart Transportation
        initiative by coordinating transportation improvements with land use, infrastructure, economic
        development and community revitalization. Implementation strategies and community
        revitalization projects will strengthen a sense of place and establish safe, inviting, aesthetically
        pleasing and sustainable commercial and residential neighborhoods within the South Side
        Business District. Transportation improvements will address vehicular, transit, bicycle and
        pedestrian safety, accessibility and mobility. Improvements will enhance the Corridor and other
        streets to provide connections to and from residential and commercial neighborhoods and the
        waterfront for all modes of transportation. Transportation improvements will provide an
        opportunity for renewed development within and around the Corridor, continued community
        growth and a variety of amenities which establish this area as a unique place attracting
        residents, businesses and visitors.

Section 2.2 Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats (SWOT)
The purpose of the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats) activity was to provide an
opportunity for residents, business owners and other key stakeholders to identify the community's
assets or strengths and opportunities as well as weaknesses and threats. The planning process for the
Route 62 Corridor included a two-part process. The initial step involved obtaining thoughts on the
area's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats from the Project Steering Committee and the
South Side Business Association. The following identifies the framework for the SWOT activity as it was
conducted with the two groups.

The results of the SWOT analysis, in coordination with the preliminary discussions with the Steering
Committee, were used to help establish the potential improvements throughout the project study area.

Section 2.3 Goal Setting
Project goals were developed based upon issues and concerns expressed by the Steering Committee,
Business Association, public meeting attendees and by local officials and staff. The goals and objectives
outlined provide the basis for future transportation improvements, development/redevelopment and
revitalization programs, policies, regulatory changes, and implementation projects.

 The planning process has revealed six focus topics to which goals and objectives have been created:
 n Safety
 o Aesthetically pleasing improvements

Section 2.4 Formulating Strategies
Formulating strategies requires the planning process to formulate actions and strategies to be taken to
attain the goals and objectives outlined in the previous section. In order to understand all necessary
actions, consistency with State, County and City initiatives must be clearly identified and incorporated
into action planning. The Route 62 Transportation Corridor Plan incorporates the guiding principles
recognized by the Commonwealth.

The following guiding principles outline the characteristics and identify broad guidelines for
transportation and community revitalization. The Smart Transportation Initiative is a leading statewide
initiative that stresses the importance of creating solutions that are appropriate and specific to your
community.

Section 2.4.1 Smart Transportation
Smart Transportation asks us to understand the financial, environmental, technological, and social
contexts to which the State and others approach a community's transportation challenges. Engineers
are asked to apply the most innovative and cost-effective tools, ideas and design solutions to solve
transportation challenges, while also helping to build or rebuild downtowns. The guiding principles that
govern Smart Transportation include:

    Solutions tailored to the context of the community.
    Oil City has a unique mix of commercial and residential uses within and adjacent to the
    downtown core. An example of a solution unique to the community includes promoting the use

                                                                                             Page |8

       of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and bicycling, to take advantage of the
       unique land use mix that exists around the downtown core.

    Approach and solution tailored to meet specific project needs.
    The analysis of the issues, concerns and needs integrate smart transportation solutions with
    downtown revitalization strategies that help create an increased sense of place.

   Projects planned in collaboration with the community.
   The planning process is a collaborative process that includes community businesses, local
   government staff, regional coordinating agencies, appointed steering committee and the general
   public, integrating the technical aspects of the project with public input.

                                         Supporting agencies:
       City of Oil City                                Oil Valley Chapter of the PA

                                                         Association

    Solutions address needs for alternative modes of
    transportation.
    This community has great potential in that
    solutions for alternate modes of transportation
    are viable and are considered part of the strategy
    for short-term implementation solutions.

    Solutions formulated using `sound professional
     judgment.'
    Sound planning and engineering design solutions
    ranged from community revitalization projects, to
    linkages to transit, to safe pedestrian walk and
    crossways and to context sensitive land use and
    transportation solutions that achieve the desired
    vision for the community.
    Scale of the solution is designed based upon the
    problem.
    Oil City has historic and cultural value to the
    region. The scale of recommended project work is
    appropriately sized with respect to this urban
    environment. Design solutions are innovative and
    meet the needs of all modes of travel depending
    upon corridor location.

Section 3.0 Existing Conditions
Analysis of existing conditions within the study area provides an understanding of the current social,
economic and physical environment. This section presents a summary of the existing conditions along
the Route 62 Corridor and surrounding study area.

Section 3.1 Study Area Conditions
The initial study area was defined as the Route 62 Corridor leading into the south side of Oil City from
Pumphouse Road to Petroleum Street. While this area defined the Route 62 Corridor along the south
side, the study area was expanded through discussions with the Project Steering Committee to include a
larger portion of the downtown area within the south side of Oil City. A Smart Transportation Study is
focused on studying a network of streets, pedestrian facilities and transit services within a defined area
with the goal of balancing the transportation, community and land use improvements which benefit all
users. Based upon the goal of a Smart Transportation Study, the project study area was redefined to
encompasses the transportation network of the area bounded by US Route 62 (Front Street), Petroleum
Bridge and Second Street. Figure 2 provides a graphical summary of the final study area.

Section 3.1.1 Transportation Facilities
A section of US Route 62 (Front Street) in Oil City is a four-lane
                                                                      Signalized Intersections along
roadway that prohibits parking anywhere along the Corridor
from Pumphouse Road to the First Street/Wilson Avenue                           Front Street
intersection. At the intersection of Wilson Avenue, Front Street               State Street
becomes a part of a one-way-pair roadway system with First                     Petroleum Street
Street. From this point, Front Street consists of one or two
northbound travel lanes to the intersection with Petroleum            Signalized Intersections along
Street, while First Street consists of two southbound travel lanes               First Street
between Petroleum Street and Wilson Avenue. The posted                         State Street
speed limit within the study area is 40 mph along the four-lane                Central Avenue
roadway section and 25 mph within the downtown core area.                      Petroleum Street
The study area consists of a total of five (5) signalized
intersections; with two along Front Street and three along First
Street. The overall condition of the existing roadways within the study area range from good to fair.

There currently are no sidewalk facilities along the Front Street Corridor from Pumphouse Road to State
Street. Pedestrian facilities do exist within the downtown area of the study area, including along First
Street, Front Street (from Wilson to Petroleum), State Street, Central Avenue, Petroleum Street and
Second Street. The condition varies throughout the study area. In addition, most of the existing ADA
curb ramps do not meet current PennDOT requirements.

Section 3.1.2 Parking
The Front Street Corridor prohibits parking along the four-lane section leading into town from the
southeast. The properties located adjacent to Front Street along this four-lane section are commercial
and include off-street parking at each of the individual businesses. Front Street, from Wilson Avenue to
Petroleum Street includes on-street parallel parking on one or both sides of Front Street. Petroleum
Street between Front Street and First Street does not provide on-street parking, but does have a drop-
off area adjacent to the YMCA. Wilson Avenue has no on-street parking between Front Street and
Second Street. All of the remaining streets within the study area provide on-street parking. This

                                                                                             P a g e | 11

includes Petroleum Street south of First Street, Central Avenue, State Street, Wilson Avenue south of
Second Street, First Street and Second Street. Most of the parking spaces are parallel with the roadway,
except that portions of the parking on Central Avenue and State Street are angled. Figure 3 provides a
summary of the on-street parking facilities and Figure 4 provides a summary of off-street facilities.

Section 3.2 Traffic Operations
Average daily traffic (ADT) data from PennDOT's Roadway Management System (RMS) database was
obtained from PennDOT District 1-0. In addition, manual turning movement (MTM) traffic counts were
performed at the 13 key study intersections during "typical" weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday) in November 2009; vehicular weekday peak hour traffic was also recorded in July 2010. These
MTM counts recorded passenger vehicles, truck traffic (3+ axles), and bicycle traffic in 15-minute
increments during the AM (7-9 a.m.) and PM (4-6 p.m.) peak periods. During the MTM counts noted
above, pedestrian movements were also recorded at each intersection location. Each pedestrian
movement was recorded in 15-minute increments by the approach that was crossed.

During project steering committee meetings, it was noted that pedestrians are utilizing the railroad Wye
Bridge near Pumphouse Road to cross the Allegheny River, as this crossing is the most direct route for
pedestrians to achieve access to the southside, particularly to shopping destinations, from the Siverly
neighborhood. Therefore, a pedestrian traffic count was conducted in the vicinity of the SR
62/Pumphouse Road intersection on July 8, 2010. The purpose of this count was to determine the
number and location of pedestrian crossings across Route 62 in this area.

Section 3.2.1 Traffic Count Data Summary
The MTM traffic counts noted above were conducted during the month of November 2009 (November
3rd thru November 18th) at 13 key study intersections. AM and PM peak hour vehicular and pedestrian
traffic volumes were determined from this data and are summarized in Figure 5.

Additional MTM traffic counts were conducted at seven of the 13 key study intersections during the
month of July 2010. These traffic counts data were collected for comparison with the November data; it
was anticipated that pedestrian and bicycle activity would be greater during summer months versus
during late fall, due to inclement weather conditions. The AM and PM peak hour vehicular and
pedestrian traffic volumes for this July 2010 data are shown in Figure 6. Copies of all traffic count data is
contained in Appendix B.

A comparison of the November 2009 and July 2010 traffic volume data revealed the following:

            Vehicular traffic volumes were greater in November 2009 than July 2010.
            There were no significant differences in pedestrian activity at the key study intersections.
            This indicates that pedestrian activity appears to be consistent throughout the year within
            the study corridor.

Section 3.2.2 Future Traffic Projections
One redevelopment project for the southeast corner of Petroleum and First Streets is in preliminary
planning stages. The former use of this land was a funeral home, and a bank is planning to build a
branch office on that site. A transportation improvement project located to the south of the project
corridor at the intersection of Route 62 and SR 257 is currently in the final design stages; a new traffic
signal is planned for that location. The PennDOT Traffic Unit suggested using a background growth rate
of 0.5% per year for future year traffic projections along the Corridor; this growth rate will capture
increases in future traffic volumes along the corridor due to these development/redevelopment and
transportation enhancement projects.

Spreadsheets showing the calculated future traffic volume projections are contained in Appendix C.

                                                                                                P a g e | 15

Section 3.2.3 Safety Analysis
Available reportable and non-reportable crash data for the most recent five-year period was provided by
the City of Oil City and PennDOT District 1-0. This data showed that most of the crashes occurred at
intersections. The table below provides a summary of the crash data for the study area intersections.

                                     TABLE 3.1: Five-Year Crash History

                     Front St / Pumphouse Rd      4                Rear End

The intersection of Front Street / Petroleum Street experienced the most crashes in the Corridor. The
midblock location with the highest number of crashes was the two-lane section of First Street between
the intersections of Central Avenue and State Street; there were seven crashes (three rear-end and
three struck fixed object).

It should also be noted that even though the crash data showed there were seven crashes at the First
Street / Wilson Avenue intersection over the 5-year data period, several people (during the project
steering committee meetings, at a meeting with the south side business group, and at public meetings)
commented that many near misses regularly occur at this intersection and sometimes involve
pedestrians. These people stated that it is a daily occurrence.

Section 3.2.4 Traffic Signals
Within the study area, there are five signalized intersections. Existing traffic signal permit plans for each
of these intersections was obtained from PennDOT. The existing timings programmed in each signal
controller are shown on the signal permit plans.

The signal permit plans also indicate that the existing signals operate under time-based coordination; no
physical signal interconnect (hardwire, fiber or wireless) currently exists.

The Oil City Fire Department maintains the existing traffic signals. JMT conducted a traffic signal
inventory with the Fire Department. The purpose of this inventory was to field visit each signalized
intersection and verify/record the existing signal equipment located at each intersection, for use in
determining appropriate traffic signal upgrades/improvements.




                                                                                                P a g e | 21

In discussions with the Fire Department personnel responsible for maintaining the traffic signals, JMT
discovered the following:

            Traffic signal heads have been upgraded to LED.
            The controller clocks "drift" out of time. Approximately once a month, the fire department
            manually resets each controller clock.
            The current signal timing and phasing programmed in each controller correspond to those
            shown on the signal permit plans.

Section 3.2.5 Traffic Analysis
The Synchro Version 7 traffic engineering software was used in performing the traffic analysis for this
project; the HCM report output generated from the Synchro capacity analysis implements the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology and delay/LOS calculation. The existing roadway and signal
network was coded in Synchro utilizing the intersection lane configurations obtained from field site
visits, signal permit plans, and current AM and PM peak hour traffic volume data obtained from the
MTM counts discussed in Section 3.2.

The results of the signalized and unsignalized intersection capacity/Levels of Service (LOS) analyses for
existing conditions are shown in Tables 3.2 and 3.3, respectively. These results show the overall
intersection operation; the detailed Synchro HCM Reports showing the delay and LOS for each approach
and individual lane group movement are contained in Appendix D.

These results show that all study intersections are currently operating near or under capacity at LOS D or
better during both the morning and evening peak hours.

For use as a baseline in comparing potential improvement alternatives, an analysis of future "no-build"
conditions was performed for the projected Year 2030 traffic volumes.

                     Notes:
                     (1) LOS and delay shown are conditions for worst case conflicting movement
                         of un-signalized intersection.


These results show that with a projected slight growth in traffic volumes along the study corridor and
the existing intersection configurations (i.e. no improvements) most study intersections are expected to
operate under capacity at LOS C or better in Year 2030 during both the morning and evening peak hours;
with relatively small increases in average delay per vehicles. In approximately 20 years, delay on the
unsignalized side street approaches of Wilson Avenue at First Street and East Second Street at Front
Street will increase by approximately five (5) seconds and operate at LOS D with vehicles on these
approaches waiting an average of about 30 seconds.

Section 3.2.6 Access Management
The Transportation Research Board (TRB) has defined access management as "...the systematic control
of the location, spacing, design, and operation of driveways, median openings, interchanges, and street
connections to a roadway. It also involves roadway design applications, such as median treatments and
auxiliary lanes, and the appropriate spacing of traffic signals. The purpose of access management is to
provide vehicular access to land development in a manner that preserves the safety and efficiency of the
transportation system."

Per PennDOT's Access Management Model Ordinances for Pennsylvania Municipalities Handbook,
"Access management is a means of controlling the ways in which vehicles can access major roadways,
using techniques such as limiting the number of driveways and intersections with local roadways." The
main goals of access management are to improve safety and reduce congestion. According to the
National Highway Institute, it has been shown that with an effective access management program,


                                                                                                    P a g e | 24

crashes can be reduced by up to 50 percent and roadway capacity can be increased by 23 to 45 percent,
resulting in decreased delay and travel times.

Additionally, locations with difficult driveway access can result in driver frustration and low patronage.
Motorists prefer to visit places of business that are easy to get into and out of.

With these goals in mind, and in working with the project steering committee, several driveways and
intersections were investigated within the study corridor. These efforts included developing
intersection sightline requirements as well as developing proposed driveway access modifications. The
areas specifically mentioned as locations of concern included the Country Fair located on Wilson Avenue
between Route 62 and East Second Street, and East Second Street. Proposed improvement options are
discussed in more detail in Section 4 of this document.

Section 3.2.7 Transit
There is limited bus service in the Route 62 Corridor.
There is one bus stop located on the eastern end of the
Corridor on Imperial Street between Route 62 and East
Second Street at the Giant Eagle parking lot. It has a
shelter and street lighting (see photo at right). The
transit stop is a part of the Oil City Route and Inter-City
Route of the Venango Bus transit service offered
throughout Venango County. The Oil City Route provides
transportation services within the City of Oil City, while
the Inter-City Route provides services and connection
between Oil City, Franklin, and Cranberry Township.

Section 3.3 Existing Land Use
The Route 62 Transportation Corridor passes through Oil
City's South Side downtown area. Through a detailed analysis of the land uses, intensity of land uses and
locations of basic needs and services, several distinct areas of the Route 62 Corridor are depicted in
Figure 5 including:

        Core Downtown ­ The Core Downtown can be described to include the properties to the west
        of Wilson Avenue. The core area extends from Wilson Avenue west to Petroleum Street and
        north to south from the River south to East Second Street. The Core area includes retail
        (sporting goods, home furnishings and gifts, antiques and appliances), professional and personal
        services, small eateries, public spaces, and several churches. The Core Downtown area also
        contains small pockets of transitional residential areas on Front Street and East Second Street.
        Such properties have the ability in the future to convert to mixed commercial properties. Oil City
        is distinct in that their Core Downtown area contains historical monuments within their
        transportation network on Central Avenue.

        Transition Mixed Commercial ­ Several areas, over decades of time, have changed the
        residential component of the Route 62 Corridor outside of the Core Downtown. Transitional
        Mixed Commercial areas are located on East Second Street between Wilson Avenue and
        Imperial Street as well as Petroleum Street between Orchard Street and West Second Street.



                                                                                             P a g e | 25

        Today, these mixed commercial properties contribute to the downtown and region's business
        economy.

        Suburban Commercial ­ The northern edge of the Route 62 Corridor has transitioned from a
        rural landscape into a commercial corridor for suburban retail. This occurred as this area was
        redeveloped in the late 1950's. Lot sizes are larger and not bound by alleyways. The roadway
        corridor is a comfortable width along East Second Street from Wilson Avenue to Allegheny
        Avenue. Lot sizes, building size and business signage are all visibly larger in the suburban
        commercial area of the Corridor. East Second Street is bound by Highway Commercial and
        Mixed Uses.

        Residential ­ Several blocks of residential living still exist within the study area, primarily on
        Third Street and Second Street. Two different types of residential areas exist within the
        Corridor:

                 Transitional Residential ­ Transitional Residential areas are located within or adjacent to
                 areas that have transitioned over time into mixed commercial areas. These transitional
                 residential areas exist along Second Street and primarily contain multi-family units,
                 attached units and duplexes along with small scale to medium scale commercial uses.
                 Pockets of transitional residential uses can be seen outside of the downtown core.
                 Along the west side of Petroleum Street, single-family and multi-family residential units
                 are surrounded by commercial and mixed uses.

                 Traditional Residential ­ These traditional residential neighborhoods are designed to be
                 walkable and are located within a short distance from the downtown, schools and
                 churches. In the study area traditional neighborhood developments along both Second
                 Street and Third Street can be characterized as less intensive and primarily contain
                 single-family and multi-family residential units.

        Industrial ­ The area bounded by the Allegheny River and the Route 62 four-lane is zoned
        Manufacturing and Industrial; however, the area was formerly a railroad yard and roundhouse
        and is now vacant land with one active rail line.

        Other Uses ­ Park and recreational land uses are located at the intersection of East Front Street
        and State Street.

The following figures describe the current land use within the study area and the surrounding blocks.

Section 3.3.1 Northern Venango County Multi-Municipal Regional Plan
The Northern Venango County Multi-Municipal Regional Plan addresses land use, housing,
transportation, community facilities, the protection of natural resources, and economic development
throughout the Northern Venango County Region. The plan is divided into three sections by
municipality. An overview of each municipality is provided with facts describing the future trends of
each jurisdiction. Recommendations are provided to guide the municipalities towards areas of interest
and changes that should be made.

        The Northern Venango County Multi-Municipal Regional Plan is comprised of Cornplanter
        Township, City of Oil City, and Rouseville Borough. The Regional Plan is designed to address:

                 Use existing resources first--physical, governmental, or institutional. They should
                 always be the primary options.
                 Choose a few projects from the many presented by this Plan to accomplish in the first
                 year to give the Plan implementation traction.
                 Explore, use, and promote avenues to regional cooperation.

        Cornplanter Township
        Cornplanter Township lies on the northern border of the three municipalities. Currently 2,687
        residents live within the Township. The Township is the largest of the three municipalities with
        23,872 acres or 37.3 square miles. The land within the Township is primarily publicly owned
        land (Oil Creek State Park and Game Lands 253). Lightly settled residential developments are
        focused around small villages within the Township. Housing conditions within the Township
        were rated as being good. The majority of housing is single-family units (90%) and mobile
        homes (8.7%). The number of housing units has declined from 1990 to 2000, but on average
        five (5) to six (6) units are being built annually. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
        Commission recognizes Pithole City as being historically significant. Large mineral extraction
        within the region has led to focused efforts on preserving the beauty of the natural
        environment. Currently, the exploration for natural gas within the Township is occurring with
        two drilling rig permits acquired.

        City of Oil City
        The City of Oil City is one of the major arterial corridors within Venango County. Base upon the
        2000 census, 11,504 residents lived within Oil City, which encompasses 4.7 square miles. The US
        Census Board has estimated the population within Oil City has decreased annually since the
        2000 census to 10,502 residents. The discovery and exploration of oil in the region as well as
        the geographic proximity to the Allegheny River helped to develop an early trading and shipping
        center. Heavy industrial uses within the region led to the widespread railroad network. Early
        development in Oil City was prominent around the water, thus small lots and homes were built
        so workers could walk to and from work. Nearly 17 percent or 497 acres of the City is listed on
        the National Register of Historic Places. Housing is a major concern on both the north and south
        side of Town. The overabundant amount of housing available within Oil City coupled with the
        poor housing market has led many units to become dilapidated or vacant. The Oil City Fire
        Department and the Oil City Police Department patrol and oversee the City. Recreational uses
        (parks and trails) and community facilities (library) are provided within the City. Transit and bus
        services are also provided throughout the City.

        Rouseville Borough
        Rouseville Borough has gone through much change over the past fifty years. The change has not
        involved new construction; instead the area has seen significant demolition of commercial
        buildings and generally far less retail activity. The primary difference during this time period
        was the closure and demolition of the Pennzoil refinery and offices that were located in the
        heart of Rouseville. Currently 429 residents live within the Borough of Rouseville, which
        encompasses 0.9 square miles. The majority of the Borough is comprised of residential land
        uses. A large portion of the residential housing community lies east of Route 8 and north of
        Route 227. Smaller pockets of residential development can be found south of Cherry Run and to
        the east of Route 8. Development has been limited in the Borough due to steep slopes and
        widespread floodplains. There is very little commercial and industrial land uses remaining in the
        Borough. Buildings remain vacant from commercial and industrial uses that have left the
        Borough. The housing market is very slow within the Borough due to poor economic conditions.
        The Rouseville Volunteer Fire Department and Borough park are community facilities and
        services that are provided to the residents.

        Regional Initiatives
        A regional task force has been created with the three municipalities and the County to address
        the basic needs for the region. Four task force teams will address policies relating to land use,
        housing, community facilities and public safety.

        The Regional Transportation Plan
        The primary funding source for transportation projects in the region is the United States
        Department of Transportation. The Regional Transportation Plan identifies transportation
        projects that will include upgrades to transit, rail, roadways and highways.

        Economic Plan
        The economic status throughout the Cornplanter ­ Oil City ­ Rouseville Area (COR) has
        remained constant or unchanged. Cornplanter Township and Rouseville Borough have seen a
        decrease in median household income from 1990 to 2000, whereas Oil City experienced an
        increase in median household income over the same time period. Opportunities for economic
        development exist within the region. Tourism and retail are the main providers of revenue to
        the current status of the Region's economic value. Tourism is one of Venango County's major
        industries. Tourism provides a large source of revenue for the Region as well as employment
        opportunities. Oil City is the most prominent location for retail within the three municipalities;
        however, retail trade has been declining in Oil City over the past decades. Advanced
        manufacturing, health care, and energy are three sectors that appear to be potential growth
        opportunities for the Region's economy.

        Other Plans and Policies
        The Bike Trail is a major priority for the Oil Region Alliance. The Bike Trail Plan suggests positive
        additions to the current bikeways plan and recommendations for continued trail improvement.
        The Oil City Bike Trail and Justus Trail are designated as being segments of the main stem of the
        Erie to Pittsburgh Trail which is now being linked and developed. The ARTS and Culture Plan
        strives to make Oil City a destination for artists. The National Transit Building currently houses
        25 artist tenants in the North Side downtown. New businesses and existing businesses are
        relocating to the downtown where the revival of the Arts is taking place.

                                                                                                P a g e | 30

Transportation and land use improvements recommended as a part of the Route 62 Smart
Transportation study need to be focused on the retail and tourism opportunities available within the
City of Oil City. The improvements should be focused on a multi-modal approach that not only enhances
the existing motor vehicle network, but also promotes pedestrian safety, transit use and commuter and
recreational bicycle facilities.

Section 3.4 Open Space and Greenways
Section 3.4.1 Venango County Greenways Plan
The Venango County Greenways Plan is a part of the Northwest Pennsylvania Greenways Planning
effort. The Northwest Planning and Development Commission completed the multi-county effort for six
counties.

        Venango County is plentiful with recreational opportunities. These natural resources are
        important to the County and the surrounding Region. These resources include:

                 The Oil Heritage Region: The Region is historically significant for its legacy as the
                 creation of the petroleum industry. Artifacts, scenic vistas, and museums are a few of
                 the incredible areas to explore within the Region.
                 Oil Creek State Park: The Park is approximately 6,250 acres and is located in the Oil
                 Creek Valley. Drake Well Museum and Park is situated immediately north and east of
                 Oil Creek State Park.
                 Two High Quality Streams (Cherry Run and Little Sandy Creek) and two Exceptional
                 Value Streams (Hemlock Creek and Dennison Run)
                 Important Bird Areas
                 Washington's Trail: Historic and scenic route commemorating George Washington's first
                 military and diplomatic journey
                 Allegheny River: The River stretches from its northern headwater in central Potter
                 County downstream to Pittsburgh. The 325-mile river flows into the Monongahela to
                 form the Ohio River in Pittsburgh.
                 French Creek
                 North Country National Scenic Trail: The Trail encompasses 4,600 miles from its western
                 point in North Dakota to its eastern point in New York.

        Through conservation and proper planning efforts to preserve greenways and their corridors in
        Venango County, future generations will be able to experience these exceptional resources.

        Greenways provide a vast number of recreational opportunities for visitors. A greenway may
        offer trails for hiking, jogging, biking, canoeing / kayaking, and other outdoor recreational
        activities. Greenways also create naturally occurring buffers that separate developed and non-
        developed lands. These aspects present benefits to local municipalities and their residents.
        Benefits would include:

                 Promotes environmentally sound land development
                 Promotes land and water restoration
                 Encourages a network of non-motorized and motorized land and water transportation
                 corridors to connect people to our resources

                                                                                           P a g e | 31

                 Promotes healthy living
                 Enhances the quality of life

        The Venango County Greenways Plan defines implementation strategies that must be put in
        place in order to create the vision for greenways in Venango County. The County has the
        opportunity to complete the following tasks if the recommendations are fulfilled.

                 Guide growth and development in a sustainable manner
                 Improve the economy in Venango County by enhancing tourism opportunities and
                 venues and by providing goods and services to meet the needs of our residents and
                 tourists
                 Provide alternate forms of transportation to improve air and water quality and to
                 reduce traffic congestion
                 Connect its residents and neighborhoods to one another, as well as its parks, schools,
                 and cultural and natural resources
                 Conserve natural resources, which provide life sustaining functions and create the
                 character of place, for current and future generations of Venango County residents

        Proposed facilities identified in the plan are shown on Figure 9.

The Venango County Greenway is consistent with the Smart Transportation approach to make trails an
integral part of the overall transportation network.

Section 3.4.2 Oil City Comprehensive Waterways Plan
The City of Oil City has contracted with Mackin Engineering Company to develop a Comprehensive
Waterways Plan for the City focused on identifying opportunities and developing strategies that would
enhance the waterfront at eight (8) key locations along the Allegheny River and Oil Creek. In addition,
general corridor-wide recommendations are also being included in the Plan. The evaluation of each of
the eight areas provided recommendations pertaining to the following:

        Recreational Enhancements
        Economic Development Opportunities
        Access Management
        Educational Opportunities
        Aesthetic Enhancements

The Waterways Plan has made initial recommendations for the area of the South Side Business District,
including designating a white-water loop under the Veteran's Memorial Bridge (State Street), improving
River access for fishing and boating, and redeveloping and strengthening the south side business
section. Recommendations have also been made with regard to the Siverly Railroad Bridge, which
connects the City's Siverly neighborhood to the south side commercial and residential areas.


                                                                                          P a g e | 32

Section 4.0 Analysis of Improvement Options and Solutions
The Smart Transportation principles provided a guide for the collaborative planning process, including
the development of improvement options and solutions for the south side of Oil City that enhance the
Route 62 Corridor and surrounding study area. The solutions identified through the planning process
are focused on addressing the critical issues by improving the quality of the area within the study and
developing a plan for transportation and land use improvements that promote safety and encourage
development/re-development opportunities within the south side.

Section 4.1 Front Street (Route 62) Corridor

intersections.

Road Diet
The term "road diet" is associated with the reduction of travel lanes along a roadway while still
providing a facility that meets the current and future traffic demand. The proposed lane reduction
would reduce the existing four-lane roadway (two lanes in each direction) to a three-lane roadway,
which would include one lane per direction and a left turn lane/median area. The elimination of two
thru lanes would allow sufficient space for the median/left turn area, as well as designated
pedestrian/bicycle facilities. The median area would provide an opportunity for a landscaped area to
provide a more welcoming entrance to the City's south side. The goal of the pedestrian/bicycle facilities
would be to provide a sidewalk facility on the south side of Front Street and a shared-use facility on the
north side. These improvements should also help to reduce the travel speeds along this section of Front
Street.

Implementation of the "road diet" improvements could be completed in a phased approach. The initial
phase would reduce the number of travel lanes through pavement marking improvements which would
provide a cost-effective means for calming traffic entering the City. The second phase would implement
the full improvements which would include a curb, median, pedestrian/bicycle facilities and landscape
plantings.

Coupled with the "road diet" (under either the initial phase or full improvements) would be the
reconfiguration of the Wilson Avenue approach at its intersection with First Street and Front Street,

                                                                                             P a g e | 35

reducing it to a single-lane approach. The existing two-lane configuration adds to driver confusion and
reduced sight distance for vehicles on Wilson Avenue. Thus, a single-lane approach should improve
safety.




A traffic capacity analysis was performed at the following unsignalized study area intersections with the
three-lane concept on Front Street, and the single-lane concept on Wilson Avenue:

                           Front Street/Wilson Avenue
                           First Street/Wilson Avenue
                           Front Street/Imperial Street
                           Front Street/East Second Street

As shown in Table 4.1 below, the results of the intersection capacity analysis with 2009 traffic volumes
indicate that acceptable LOS D or better would be provided with the proposed three-lane configuration;
LOS D operations would occur on the stop-controlled side street at the First Street/Wilson Avenue and
Front Street/East Second Street intersections during the PM peak hour. Comparing this with the existing
conditions analysis (Table 3.3) reveals that delays would increase slightly in the AM peak hour and
moderately in the PM peak hour.

In Year 2030 with the three-lane configuration, LOS C conditions would exist at all intersections during
the AM peak hour. During the PM peak hour all but the intersection of First Street/Wilson Avenue
would operate at LOS D or better; the Wilson Avenue approach at First Street would experience LOS F
conditions with vehicles on Wilson Avenue waiting approximately 50 seconds on average before
proceeding through the intersection. Therefore, additional long-term improvements were considered at
the First Street/Wilson Avenue intersection and are discussed below.

Roundabouts
Improvements to the Front Street corridor could include roundabouts at the First Street/Wilson Avenue
intersection and/or the Second Street intersection. The inclusion of a single-lane roundabout at either
of these locations would provide a means of traffic calming as motor vehicles enter the downtown area.
In addition, the roundabout at the First Street/Wilson Avenue intersection would provide a gateway to
the City of Oil City's south side. Sufficient space is available to provide a roundabout at this location that
incorporates the existing fountain into the center island, while minimizing impacts to surrounding
properties and businesses. It appears that constructing a roundabout at the Second Street intersection
would be more challenging and potentially costly than at the First Street/Wilson Avenue intersection for
several reasons, including anticipated right-of-way impacts, roadway geometry, and the potential for a
retaining wall adjacent to the railroad tracks to limit grading impacts and the need for track relocation.
For these reasons, analysis of traffic operations of a roundabout at the Second Street intersection was
not performed.

A traffic analysis using the PennDOT roundabout evaluation spreadsheet was conducted for a
roundabout at the First Street/Wilson Avenue intersection. One of the evaluation measures used in this
analysis is the volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of the approaches to the roundabout; this measure is the
ratio of the demand volume on the approach to the capacity (how much volume the roadway can
handle) of the approach. For the roundabout analysis, a v/c ratio of 0.85 (or 85% of the capacity) is
accepted as the threshold of acceptable level of service (LOS). The results of the analysis of the First
Street/Wilson Avenue roundabout for existing traffic volumes and future year 2030 traffic volume
projections showed that all roundabout approaches would operate below an acceptable volume to
capacity (v/c) ratio of 0.85.

A more detailed roundabout traffic analysis of the First Street/Wilson Avenue intersection was
performed using the SIDRA traffic engineering software. The results of this analysis were consistent
with the PennDOT roundabout spreadsheet. The SIDRA analyses showed a LOS A operation for the
overall roundabout for 2009 and 2030 traffic volumes during the AM and PM peak hours. All
approaches are expected to operate below an acceptable v/c ratio of 0.85; the worst approach would be
First Street operating below a v/c ratio of 0.74. Based upon the level of service analysis, a roundabout
would operate more efficiently during existing and future (2030) traffic conditions when compared to
stop-controlled intersection. The results of the SIDRA analyses are contained in Appendix E.

bring together transportation improvements with land
use, and coordinate pedestrian facilities within the
business and commercial districts of the study area.
Improvements in this area are to include full
streetscape enhancements, including the following:

        Concrete sidewalks
        Decorative brick pavers (buffer area)
        Pedestrian lighting
        Traffic Signal Improvements
        Amenities (Benches, Trash receptacles, Bicycle Racks)
        Decorative crosswalks
        ADA curb ramps
        Infrastructure Improvements (Water & Stormwater Improvements)
        Street trees
        Signage

The streetscape improvements along the Second Street corridor would have the same focus, including
providing a safe and aesthetically pleasing facility for the pedestrians. However, the design would be
less elaborate than the downtown core area and would be designed to establish dependable pedestrian
facilities which adhere to the current ADA guidelines. Providing such improvements would present the
residential area of the study area as being comfortable, inviting, and having a safe environment.

A critical component of the pedestrian facilities in any area is adherence to current ADA guidelines,
including ADA curb ramps. PennDOT is focused on upgrading the ADA curb ramps throughout the state.
The City will need to work closely with PennDOT to understand their future roadway maintenance and
construction project schedule as it relates to state routes within the study area. It is recommended that
the City coordinate closely with PennDOT with the goal that all ramps at a given intersection are
improved at one time and meet the aesthetic standards that are associated with future streetscape
improvements.

Five access management techniques that could be made
in this area to better delineate vehicle and pedestrian
areas include:

                 Driveway delineation ­ eliminate the wide open driveway access on Wilson Avenue and
                 First Street by adding channelization and islands
                 Driveway consolidation ­ eliminate the driveway on East Second Street due to its
                 proximity to Wilson Avenue
                 Cross access with CVS ­ provide a cross access connection from Country Fair to CVS,
                 which would allow County Fair patrons to access Second Street via the existing CVS
                 driveway
                 Pedestrian Sidewalks ­ improve pedestrian delineation by adding more sidewalk area
                 Street closure ­ eliminate the confusing roadway split of Wilson Avenue south of Second
                 Street

US Post Office/Thorne's Market
This area could benefit by adding cross access between the USPS parking lot and Thorne's Market
parking lot. It was observed that there were shoppers parking in Thorne's lot and entering the USPS
building. In addition to providing a cross access, one of the existing Thorne's Market driveway openings
could be eliminated to reduce the number of access points along Second Street.

Imperial Street
Imperial Street runs between Rite Aid and Giant Eagle. The area is currently wide open with no
delineation. Tractor trailers were observed turning from Front Street onto Imperial Street. There are
existing driveways on Imperial Street less than 100' from Front Street. This creates a situation where
sight distance is limited for turn vehicles. This area could benefit from better driveway delineation.
Providing an entry throat on Imperial Street for approximately 100' south of Front Street would
eliminate vehicle conflicts at the driveways with vehicles turning from Front Street. Head-in parking
could be maintained if necessary for Rite-Aid and the wide open access to Giant Eagle could be reduced
to one or two standard sized driveway openings.

East Second Street from Imperial Street to Front Street
Due to the narrow lot depth between East Second Street and Front Street, there is less opportunity for
shared/cross access in this area. However, existing driveway openings could be narrowed to standard
widths to provide better delineation and shorten pedestrian crossings of driveways.

Concept sketches illustrating the proposed access management improvements, as well as a draft model
access management ordinance are contained in Appendix H.

meet the minimum volume criteria to warrant a traffic
signal (see Appendix I for the detailed worksheets of
the warrant analyses):

                 First Street/Petroleum Street
                 First Street/Central Avenue
                 First Street/State Street

The pedestrian volumes collected during the intersection manual turning movement traffic counts was
also reviewed and compared with the criteria for MUTCD Traffic Signal Warrant 4 (Pedestrian Volume).
The existing pedestrian crossings across First Street (the major street) at any of these intersections did
not meet the minimum 100 crossings per hour.

Intersection capacity analyses were then performed at these three (3) intersections for 2009 and 2030
traffic to determine impacts on traffic operations and anticipated delays that would be anticipated if
these existing traffic signals were removed. Multi-lane approaches at stop controlled intersections can
lead to driver confusion; therefore, single-lane approaches were used for all intersection approaches.
These analyses showed that for all-way stop control with a single lane on all intersection approaches
Petroleum Street would experience LOS F conditions with an average vehicle stop control delay of over
one minute during the PM peak hour. This could result in vehicles queuing back into the Front
Street/Petroleum Street intersection and across the bridge. This is already known to occur during
weekend peak traffic volumes. Two lanes exist now on Petroleum Street at the intersection of First
Street to allow a single left turning lane separate from the right turn/straight through lane. Two lanes
also exist on the approach of West First Street onto Petroleum, providing separate left turn and right
turn/straight through lanes. For these reasons, the removal of the traffic signal at First
Street/Petroleum Street is not recommended and was removed from further consideration.

The capacity analyses for single-lane approaches at the First Street/Central Avenue intersection showed
that with current traffic volumes and all-way stop control, all approaches would operate acceptably at
LOS C or better during both the morning and evening peak hours.

It should be noted that following a pedestrian fatality that occurred at the intersection of First
Street/Central Avenue, the Oil Valley Chapter of the PA Council of the Blind requested the City of Oil City
to upgrade the traffic signal to provide audible pedestrian traffic signal operation. This upgrade would
include an exclusive pedestrian signal phase, meaning pedestrians would be able to cross the
intersection while all vehicles would be stopped. In order to provide this exclusive pedestrian
movement, the traffic signal at First Street/Central Avenue must be maintained.

The capacity analyses performed for current traffic volumes and single-lane approaches at the First
Street/State Street intersection showed that the First Street approach would operate at capacity LOS E
during the evening peak hour. This delay would increase in time with an increase in traffic volumes.
With the traffic signal and current weekday traffic volumes, the intersection runs at LOS A or B. With
increased volumes, signal timings can be adjusted to relieve the Route 62 straight-through traffic.
Therefore, it is recommended the traffic signal be maintained.

The traffic signal warrant analyses also showed that based on existing traffic volumes, traffic signals are
not currently warranted at the following unsignalized intersections; however, peak weekend traffic
counts should be collected at these intersections and analyzed prior to any traffic control modifications:

                 Front Street/Central Avenue
                 Front Street/Wilson Avenue

improvements such as open space or trail improvements.

space area would provide a year-round passive space.
The open space could also be used for special events,
including the Oil Heritage Festival and other community events.

Elements of the plaza space would need to include a retaining wall to increase the level area at the Front
Street elevation. The level area could be constructed of concrete sidewalk, concrete paver sidewalk, a
combination of concrete and concrete paver sidewalk or another type of hard walkway surface. The
plaza would provide a river overlook outlined by an appropriate height railing. Potential exists for the
plaza area to include a seating area, possibly integrated within a series of retaining/seating walls, to
provide bleacher type seating for viewing of kayaking or other events along the river. The plaza area
would need to provide pedestrian access to other potential improvements within the area. This would
include a pedestrian walkway to the downtown core via the Front Street and State Street intersection, a
pedestrian walkway to the commercial area via the Front Street and First Street intersection and
pedestrian access to a future trail along the Allegheny River via an ADA accessible ramp from the plaza
area to the lower banks of the river. Other key elements of the Public Plaza would include appropriate
scaled lighting to provide the necessary security and site furnishings including benches, trash receptacles
and bicycle racks.

Section 4.8 Land Use and Economic Development Opportunities
Coordinating land use, economic development and transportation is considered a facet of "smart
growth" or "sustainable development." This section explores opportunities for land use and economic
development based upon transportation system enhancements increasing viable options for people to
access opportunities, goods, services and other resources that improve the quality of life for City
residents as well as residents of the region. The goal is to create a balance of mixed uses including
housing, educational, employment, recreational, retail and service opportunities within the South Side
Business District through:

        improved access;
        increased variety of consumer goods and services within clusters;
        increased spending for consumer goods and services from residents of the City and region;
        enhanced amenities and aesthetics to provide an inviting environment for residents, businesses,
        shoppers and visitors; and
        improved regulation of land use and building condition to support business development.

Section 4.8.1 Methods for Determining a Balanced Mix of Uses
The following outlines the methods for assessment and analysis to support development of
revitalization strategies with respect to land use and economic development opportunities:

        Assessing Building and Business Inventory
        Business Community SWOT Analysis and Visual Preference Survey
        Analyzing the Business Mix using a Gap Analysis
        Analyzing Local Economics
        Revitalization Strategies

Section 4.8.2 Assessing Building and Business Inventory
A building and business inventory provides the foundation for describing, understanding, and
restructuring the economy of the business district and downtown area. The "Route 8 and Route 62
Corridor Evaluation" performed by Hickory Engineering in 2005 generated a database of all buildings,
land parcels, and properties along Route 62 in Oil City and detailed building condition reports and
adaptive use/reuse plans for two buildings in the current Route 62 study area - the Latonia Theater
building at 1 East First Street and the C. F. Cramer block at 2-30 West Front Street. Some basic
information has been compiled as part of the current Route 62 Smart Transportation Study with respect
to building condition, use/occupancy and business type for each structure located in the core of the
South Side Business District. Over time, this information can be routinely updated and augmented with
more detailed assessment and analysis. A summary of this information is depicted on maps and street
profiles contained in Section 5. Based upon the information assembled, assessed and analyzed to date,
the following key issues of concern have been identified with respect to building condition and business
type.

Key issues of concern with respect to building condition and integrity include:
        Underutilization of first floor space;
        Vacant and underutilized upper floor space;
        Substandard minor and major conditions of upper floors and roof damage to several buildings;
        and

                                                                                           P a g e | 46

        Façade modifications altering original architectural character of the building detracts from the
        physical appearance and aesthetics of the environment.

Key issues of concern with respect to business inventory include:
        Quality of business establishments;
        Lack of business clusters with respect to specialty stores;
        Although a cluster of restaurants is in place, a more robust mix is necessary to achieve higher
        attraction rates;
        Although a cluster of retail operations with convenience and household items exists, a more
        robust mix is necessary to achieve higher attraction rates; and
        Lack of business services available.

Section 4.8.3 Business Community SWOT Analysis and Visual Preference Survey
The South Side Business Association participated in the planning process and was actively engaged in
discussions about study area strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats as well as provided
responses to a Visual Preference Survey (VPS). The results of each of these activities is summarized in
Appendix A: Community Participation Report. Input received from the business community was used to
guide technical analysis and strategy development contained in this section.

Section 4.8.4 Analyzing the Business Mix using a Gap Analysis
A Gap Analysis was conducted for three areas within a defined trade area. Retail spending was assessed
considering the trade area as the study area plus an eight-mile radius. Within this trade area retail
spending was also assessed for the study area, Oil City (an approximate two-mile radius around the
study area) and Oil City with an eight-mile radius.

The Gap Analysis was used to analyze the business mix indicating the general areas where opportunity
gaps as well as surplus gaps may be for retail goods and services. The following briefly describes an
opportunity and surplus gap. Refer to Appendix F for a detailed GAP Analysis for Oil City and the
surrounding area defined as the Trade Area for this analysis.

Opportunity and surplus gaps can be defined as follows:
       An opportunity gap occurs when a household must resort to spending their retail dollars on
       goods and services outside their neighborhood or locale due to one or more of the following
       conditions:

            The specific type of retail opportunity does not exist in the neighborhood;
            The quality of goods and services is simply better outside the region;
            The existing retail establishments do not carry enough product to service the neighborhood;
            or
            The type of retail goods or services does not meet the needs of the neighborhood residents.

        This circumstance is referred to as an opportunity gap because, due to reasons mentioned,
        there is the potential for new or expansion of existing businesses to meet local demands.

A surplus gap occurs when local retail sales of goods and services exceed household spending for goods
and services. A surplus indicates that local retail stores are making sales to non-local households. This
circumstance is referred to as a surplus because it indicates that locally there are more goods and

                                                                                              P a g e | 47

services than the actual number of household residents can consume. If the surplus gap is exceptional
or unique to a specific locality, this type of repeating expenditures could be considered a "niche" within
a market area.

The opportunity gaps indicating the expenditure of local dollars outside the community (goods and
services not adequately provided for in the local community) and the surplus gaps of goods and services
provided in the City or Surrounding Area are further identified and quantified in Appendix G: Gap
Analysis.

The results of this analysis can be used to identify business development opportunities, such as those
identified on the following table, identifies areas to target business development in the context of
physical space and configuration of land use patterns in a small town business district. The following
information identifies potential opportunities to establish business clusters and niche businesses in
vacant and underutilized space as well as in occupied space as uses change. The information presented
represents the unmet demand for retail goods and services within the Trade Area. These opportunities
should be viewed as areas for further exploration with current businesses and prospective business
owners on a small scale. The information in the table below indicates the maximum amount of space
that could supply goods and services to meet the demand for those services purchased outside of the
Trade Area.

Section 4.8.6 Revitalization Strategies
The following describes various revitalization strategies targeted to the South Side Business District and
Route 62 Corridor.

nTransportation Investments Consistent with Land Use Planning and Development
 Smart transportation solutions outlined in Section 2 that generally:
      Enhance or improve accessibility, mobility and safety for all modes of transportation (i.e.
      vehicular;
      Provide adequate access and space for loading and unloading of goods, materials and supplies;

                                                                                              P a g e | 49

        Provide sufficient design of space at intersections for truck turning movements;
        Provide transit connections and pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements with connections
        to open space and recreational areas; and
        Provide amenities for pedestrians as part of streetscape elements.

oUpper Floor Usage & Building Rehabilitation
 A considerable number of structures within the core of the South Side Business District have vacant or
 underutilized (storage) upper floors. Second floor use for retail and office space is important as well
 as upper floor use for apartments, and should be targeted for this area. One important factor is the
 condition of upper floors in the South Side Business District. Many of the upper floors require
 substantial or major rehabilitation resulting in considerable private or public-private investment.
 Programs and incentives should be developed to support rehabilitation of structures.
         Office uses play an important role in supporting the expansion or addition of retail space.
         Office uses such as real estate agents, mortgage brokers, accountants, doctors' offices and
         lawyers, if signed appropriately, can benefit from a second or third floor location above a
         vibrant retail establishment.
         Build upon existing loan programs, including the Oil Region Alliance's Revolving Loan Fund for
         Route 8/62 for historic preservation and/or increased adaptive reuse, by developing a Mixed-
         Use Rehabilitation Loan Program with requirements for first floor commercial and upper floor
         office or apartment uses.
              o Ensure rehabilitation efforts incorporate design requirements for rehabilitation of
                  existing or infill development for ground floor spaces that are appropriate for retail
                  tenants, even if retail tenants do not occupy them. Architectural features, access and
                  window configuration should be such to support retail space.
              o Support the development of second and third story office or residential uses.

pFaçade Improvement Program
Continue a Façade Improvement Program designed to promote the continued use and maintenance of
commercial buildings in the South Side Business District by helping property owners and tenants
rehabilitate and restore eligible structures. Support implementation of this program by:

        Allocating dedicated grants for a Façade Improvement Program for historic renovations.
        Enhancing and promoting the City's Façade Improvement Program.
        Establishing eligibility criteria for façade improvements (exterior improvements) such as:
            o Exit doors;
            o Painting;
            o Shutters and awnings;
            o Signs;

        Continue to identify key businesses creating business clusters and niches.

rNiche Retail Opportunities
 In the South Side Business District, niches already exist, but simply need to be organized. Strategies to
 grow these niches to become more visible can be achieved through store expansion, recruitment of
 new businesses and cooperative advertising and promotion (i.e. branding). The following describes
 the strategy for strengthening the existing niche markets:

        Build upon the Farmers' Market by creating a Festive Marketplace consisting of restaurants and
        specialty shops along with several stores offering convenience items to local residents. Build
        upon existing niches targeting the following opportunities.

    Restaurant Niche Opportunities
    The following are opportunities for consideration that build upon an existing cluster of restaurant
    uses:
            o Expand dining opportunities by offering a mix of dining opportunities from take-out,
                casual to fine dining (breakfast, lunch and evening dining opportunities);
                     Full-Service Restaurants;
                     Special Food Services;
                     Limited-Service Eating Places; and
            o Specialty food stores combined with dining opportunities.

  Restaurants should be encouraged to use outdoor areas where possible. The sidewalk and plaza area
  in front of the restaurants can serve this purpose. Adding a few tables with colorful umbrellas can add
  greatly to the visual quality of the street. Besides enhancing the vitality of the street scene, outdoor
  areas increase restaurant capacity with minimal increase in fixed costs. With the addition of heating
  elements, these tables can be used into the colder months (Fall and Spring) of the year.

  Residents of the downtown area are an important market segment for existing and future dining
  operations in the downtown. This opportunity can be strengthened by daytime workers and tourists.
  The National Restaurant Association has identified four major groups of frequent diners.

            o    Busy parents of children often involved in after-school activities and sports typically use
                 drive-thru and carry-out restaurants.
            o    Older adults and empty nesters typically eat on-premises at inexpensive sit-down
                 restaurants, buffets and fast food eateries.
            o    People who are convenience driven and dislike cooking (with no young children)
                 typically use a variety of carry-out sources including restaurants and grocery stores.
            o    Young, urban professionals with no children dine at higher priced establishments.

Specialty Niche Opportunities
The following are a list of potential specialty niche opportunities that tend to cluster in smaller urban
areas:
            o Camera and Photographic Equipment Store;
            o Luggage and Leather Goods;
            o Hobby, Toy and Game Store;
            o Book Store and Newsstand;
            o Gift, Stationery, Office Supply and Novelty Store;
            o Sporting Goods; and
            o Music and Musical Instrument Store.

sFestive Marketplace with Connection to the Waterfront
 The festive marketplace strategy is used to reverse the negative trends by attracting local residents,
 suburban residents and out-of-town visitors to downtown areas. A typical festive marketplace
 includes local involvement in the creation of a safe and trendy attraction intended to serve as a major
 catalyst for other redevelopment. Generally, a festive marketplace offers major restaurants, specialty
 retail shops, and a cluster of international foods. The more successful projects seem to benefit from
 waterfront locations and secure parking. The festive marketplace attracts the recreational
 shopper/tourist shopper but is also likely to attract the convenience shopper as more residential
 development on upper floors takes place. The area is likely to continue attracting area residents for
 dining and entertainment.

  An opportunity for further exploration is expansion of the existing seasonal farmers market with
  connection along First Street to designated space along the waterfront for additional vendors with
  opportunities for shopping and dining as local residents and visitors travel on foot or bicycle along
  First Street from Central Avenue (location of traditional farmer's market) to the waterfront (new

  location for additional vendors). This opportunity may not succeed, however, without additional
  parking opportunities in this area.

tAdequate Parking Supply
Maintain sufficient parking on-site, on-street and in shared parking lots throughout the South Side
Business District. Ensure sufficient time restrictions are placed based upon location of high demand and
higher frequency of use. Develop a Parking Management Strategy as revitalization efforts warrant.

uStrengthen Residential Neighborhoods
Strengthen residential neighborhoods through rehabilitation, renovation and property maintenance
with an increase in property values. Provide for appropriate pedestrian and bicycle safety measures to
allow for these modes of travel to and from neighborhoods to the South Side Business District. Provide
for sufficient densities to support commercial revitalization efforts.

vLand Use Regulation and Building Codes
Review and update land use regulations and building codes to address the following while maintaining
consistency with the recently revised Multi-Municipal Regional Plan:
        Consider Form-based Zoning for the South Side Business District with emphasis on design of
        public and private space with emphasis on vertical mixed use where retail or commercial are on
        the ground floor and residential or commercial are on upper floors.
        Strengthen the property maintenance code.
        Adopt a sign code conducive to urban environment with consideration of mass, scale, location
        and materials.

aRegional Tourism and Marketing Strategy
      Establish connections between North Side Business District and South Side Business District
      through coordination and promotion of events, wayfinding signage, access to the waterfront,
      streetscape improvements, aesthetics and other means.
      Conduct joint business association meetings for the North Side Business District and the South
      Side Business District in order to cross market, establish a brand for Oil City and jointly promote
      shopping, dining, entertainment, recreation and tourism opportunities.
      Identify target markets.

Section 5.0 Action Plan
Several improvements have been identified to address the overall project purpose of providing the City
of Oil City with an approach to the development of transportation and land use improvements within
the city's south side area based upon PennDOT's Smart Transportation initiative. These improvements
focus on solutions that meet the goals defined by the City and project steering committee.

Section 5.1 Project Prioritization and Implementation
The various projects that contribute to fulfilling the vision for Smart Transportation solutions along the
Route 62 Corridor and surrounding south side area have been analyzed in terms of cost, impact to the
community, financing, necessary partnerships, and improvement to the local economy. Through this
analysis the following project implementation and prioritization strategy has been developed.

        High Level Priorities

            o    Central Avenue Streetscape Improvements
                     Central Avenue improvements would provide necessary infrastructure
                         improvements and an aesthetically pleasing upgrade to the pedestrian and
                         roadway facilities between the limits of Front Street and Second Street. The
                         improvements will accomplish these goals without impact to the existing
                         cannon and monuments within the central island area.

            o    Central Avenue and First Street Signal Improvements
                     Accessible (or Audible) Pedestrian Signal (APS) improvements at the intersection
                         of Central Avenue and First Street will provide a safer crossing condition for the
                         visually impaired pedestrian, as well as all pedestrians. The goal of an APS is to
                         provide an audible notification of when it is safe to cross at an intersection. In
                         addition, most modern devices are equipped with Braille to provide additional
                         directions for operating the pedestrian push button.

            o    Second Street Streetscape Improvements
                      Streetscape improvements along the Second Street Corridor, from Wilson
                        Avenue to Front Street would provide functional and aesthetic improvements to
                        the existing pedestrian facilities along this commercial/residential corridor. The
                        improvements should be completed in coordination with access management
                        improvements along the commercial side of the corridor, as well as
                        infrastructure upgrades to the existing public water facilities.

            o    Front Street (Route 62) Corridor
                      A "road diet" project along the Route 62 Corridor will establish a transportation
                         facility that is consistent with existing and projected traffic volumes while
                         promoting alternative modes of transportation through the inclusion of
                         pedestrian facilities. This can be done in a phased approach, with the first
                         phase establishing the new traffic patterns with turning lanes through the use of
                         pavement markings only.

                          Front Street will provide a gateway into the business district of the south side of
                          Oil City while calming traffic and improving the overall safety of motor vehicles
                          and pedestrians.

            o    Land Use Initiatives
                     Incorporation of the various revitalization strategies identified in the previous
                        section with a focus of balancing the transportation and land use initiatives to
                        enhance the downtown core of the south side business district.

        Middle Level Priorities

            o    Downtown Core Streetscape
                     Streetscape improvements within the downtown core area will provide an
                       impact related to the Smart Transportation goals and objectives that were used
                       as guidance through the development of the corridor study. The streetscape
                       improvement would be focused on safety and aesthetic improvements to the
                       pedestrian facilities. These improvements could be completed at once or
                       packaged as smaller, more affordable projects.

            o    Railroad Wye Bridge
                      Currently, the railroad bridge is posted for no pedestrians, however, the bridge
                         is commonly used as an access means between the north side and south side of
                         Oil City. Bridge safety improvements, as well as upgraded pedestrian and
                         bicycle facilities would provide a safe and convenient access between the
                         residential area on the north side and the commercial area on the south side.
                         Implementation of these improvements will require coordination and buy-in
                         from leaseholder Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad.

            o    Rail Trail
                       Open space along the southern banks of the Allegheny River provides a
                          convenient opportunity for a hiker/biker trail within the study area. The
                          proposed trail could stretch from the Veteran's Memorial Bridge to the Wye
                          Railroad Bridge and connect to future trail extensions. The goal of this
                          improvement is to create a pedestrian facility that promotes pedestrian and
                          bicycle use for recreational purposes, as well as transportation purposes.
                          Implementation of these improvements will require coordination and buy-in
                          from leaseholder Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad.

            o    Public Plaza
                     The proposed public plaza is located adjacent to the State Street and Front
                         Street intersection. The goal of this improvement is to create a beautiful
                         pedestrian gathering facility within the study area in a location that is close to
                         the downtown core area of the south side, as well as access to the views and
                         potential recreation opportunities along the Allegheny River.

While the above solutions are categorized in "High Level" and "Mid-Level" priorities, the final
implementation of these improvements will be finalized based upon available funding and partnership
opportunities. It is recommended that the City of Oil City utilize the priorities to allow for a focused
effort to obtain funding, but be willing to modify their course for the better good of the City.

The following project sheets provide the base information pertaining to each of the proposed
improvements, including the necessary information for the County's Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP).

                      Central Avenue Streetscape
                                            Project Description:
                                            Accessible (or Audible) Pedestrian Signal (APS)
                                            improvements at the intersection of Central Avenue
                                            and First Street will provide a safer crossing
                                            condition for the visually impaired pedestrian. The
                                            goal of an APS is to provide an audible notification




                                                                                                     Accessible Pedestrian Signal
                                            of when it is safe to cross at an intersection. In
                                            addition, most modern devices are equipped with
                                            Braille to provide additional directions for operating
                                            the pedestrian push button. To implement the APS
                                            improvements, several upgrades would be required
                                            to the existing signal, including:

                                                    New signal control cabinet
                                                    Additional conduit and wiring

Project Location                                           The term "road diet" is associated with the
                                                           reduction of traveled lanes along a roadway while
still providing a facility that meets the current and future traffic demand. The proposed lane reduction would
reduce the existing four-lane roadway (two lanes in each direction) to a three-lane roadway, which would
include one lane per direction and a left turn lane/median area. The elimination of two thru lanes would allow
for sufficient space for the median/left turn area, as well as designated pedestrian/bicycle facilities. The
median area would provide an opportunity for a landscaped area to provide a more welcoming entrance to the
City's south side. The goal of the pedestrian/bicycle facilities would be to provide a sidewalk facility on the
south side of Front Street and a shared-use facility on the north side. These improvements should also help to
reduce the travel speeds along this section of Front Street.

                                             Project Description:
                                             The existing intersection of Front Street/Wilson
                                             Avenue/First Street provides a unique opportunity
                                             for a gateway to the City of Oil City's south side.
                                             This could be accomplished through the inclusion
                                             of a single lane roundabout at this location. In order
                                             for the roundabout to function as a single lane
                                             facility, it would need to be implemented following
                                             or along with the Front Street Corridor

                                             section from a 4-lane to a 3-lane section. A
                                             roundabout would not only provide the necessary
                                             gateway feature, but it would also provide an

                                             speeds as vehicles enter town.

                                             The proposed roundabout could be constructed to
                                             incorporate the existing fountain and associated
                                             landscaping into the center island area.

                                                           pedestrian gathering facility within the study area in
                                                           a location that is positioned close to the downtown
                                                           core area of the south side, as well as access to
                                                           the views and potential recreation opportunities
                                                           along the Allegheny River.

                                                           The proposed plaza space could include an open
                                                           space area that includes the existing pavilion. The
                                                           open space area would provide a year-round
                                                           passive space. The open space could also be
                                                           used for special events, including the Oil Heritage
                                                           Festival, fairs and other community events.

                                                           Elements of the plaza space would need to include
                                                           a retaining wall to increase the level area at the
Project Location                                           Front Street elevation. The level area could be
                                                           constructed of concrete sidewalk, concrete paver
sidewalk, a combination of concrete and concrete paver sidewalk or another type of hard walkway surface.
The plaza would provide a river overlook outlined by an appropriate height railing. Potential exists for the
plaza area to include a seating area, possibly integrated with a series of retaining/seating walls, to provide
bleacher type seating for viewing of kayaking or other events along the river. The plaza area would need to
provide pedestrian access to other potential improvements within the area. This would include a pedestrian
walkway to the downtown core via the Front Street and State Street intersection, a pedestrian walkway to the
commercial area via the Front Street and First Street intersection and pedestrian access to a future trail along
the Allegheny River via an ADA accessible ramp from the plaza area to the lower banks of the river. Other key
elements of the public plaza would include appropriate scaled lighting to provide the necessary security and
site furnishings including benches, trash receptacles and bicycle racks.
                                                                                                                    Public Plaza

Appendix A.1: Introduction
Appendix A.1.1: Study Area / Vision Statement
A Vision Statement describes desired future conditions for a community, neighborhood or
transportation corridor such as the Route 62 Corridor. The following Draft Vision Statement for the
Corridor was distributed for comment by the steering committee.




Draft Corridor Vision Statement (Original)
Enhance the Route 62 Corridor in the city of Oil City to be a model of PennDOT's Smart Transportation
initiative by coordinating transportation improvements with land use, infrastructure and community
development decisions. The developed implementation strategy will establish a safe, inviting and
sustainable commercial area within the south side business district focused on improving vehicular and
pedestrian safety. This desirable destination will provide an exceptional shopping and dining experience
on the south side of Oil City as well as provide amenities that identify this area as an essential part of our
community.




                                                                                                  Page |1

Draft Corridor Vision Statement (Revised)
Enhance the Route 62 Corridor within Oil City to be a model of PennDOT's Smart Transportation
initiative by coordinating transportation improvements with land use, infrastructure, economic
development and community revitalization. Implementation strategies and community
revitalization projects will strengthen a sense of place and establish safe, inviting, aesthetically
pleasing and sustainable commercial and residential neighborhoods within the South Side
Business District. Transportation improvements will address vehicular, transit, bicycle and
pedestrian safety, accessibility and mobility. Improvements will enhance the Corridor and other
streets to provide connections to and from residential and commercial neighborhoods and the
waterfront for all modes of transportation. Transportation improvements will provide an
opportunity for renewed development within and around the Corridor, continued community
growth and a variety of amenities which establish this area as a unique place attracting
residents, businesses and visitors.

Appendix A.3.2.3: Visual Preference Survey
Summary of Visual Preference Survey
A visual preference survey (VPS) is an innovative and successful technique that enables citizens to
evaluate physical images of natural and built environments. The process involves asking participants to
view and evaluate a wide variety of slides depicting streetscapes, land use, site design, building type,
aesthetics and amenities. Individual scores indicate the level of preference for images viewed during
the survey. The results are analyzed to determine what is appropriate for the Corridor. The visual
preference survey was conducted during the Business Association Meeting on February 1, 2010. The
following includes analysis methodology, presentation of results, a summary of preferences and the
images used in the VPS.

Methodology
Individuals attending the meeting were asked to view numbered pictures which depicted various images
of natural and built environments. Each participant was provided a sheet or a response card to record
their response indicating appropriateness of the suitability of the development or setting for the
Corridor. Individuals responded to twenty nine images. Response options included strongly oppose,
oppose, no preference, some preference, and strong preference.

Following the meeting, the survey sheets were collected and tallied. Each response option was assigned
a weight factor, whereby the weights included: strongly oppose (-2), oppose (-1), no preference (0),
some preference (1), and strong preference (2). The number of responses for each response option was
summed and an average response value was calculated for each slide.

Visual Preference Survey Results
Overall, responses to the survey were favorable with some preference, or an average response value of
0.50. There were several images with strong preference, and several with strong opposition. The top
preferred images included 10, 13, 15, 20, 21 and 25, with an average value of 1.53 (strong preference);
while the top opposed images included 2, 12, 14, 22, 24 and 29, with an average value of -0.68. The
following is a summary of images of the highest preferred and least preferred images.




                                                                                           P a g e | 11

Appendix A.3.5.2: Study Area / Vision Statement
A Vision Statement describes desired future conditions for a community, neighborhood or
transportation corridor such as Route 62 Corridor. Please review the Draft Vision Statement for the
Corridor and provide and suggested changes.

Draft Corridor Vision Statement (Revised)
Enhance the Route 62 Corridor within Oil City to be a model of PennDOT's Smart Transportation
initiative by coordinating transportation improvements with land use, infrastructure, economic
development and community revitalization. Implementation strategies and community
revitalization projects will strengthen a sense of place and establish safe, inviting, aesthetically
pleasing and sustainable commercial and residential neighborhoods within the South Side
Business District. Transportation improvements will address vehicular, transit, bicycle and
pedestrian safety, accessibility and mobility. Improvements will enhance the Corridor and other
streets to provide connections to and from residential and commercial neighborhoods and the
waterfront for all modes of transportation. Transportation improvements will provide an
opportunity for renewed development within and around the Corridor, continued community
growth and a variety of amenities which establish this area as a unique place attracting
residents, businesses and visitors.

Comments provided by the public include:
     Long
     I feel the Southside of Oil City to be the future heart of a new Venango City, because of Venango
     campus, stores, library and Y's. Future Venango City should extend to Bredinsburg Road.
     Yes
     Sounds good
     Good vision
     Sounds good

Appendix A.3.5.3: SWOT Activity
The Corridor possesses the following strengths:
       Proximity of residential and commercial districts
       Diverse business mix with full capacity
       High volume of traffic to access commercial uses
       Scenic River Views
       Library, Churches, YMCA / YWCA and other attractions

The following is a summary of key corridor issues identified as weaknesses, opportunities and threats.
The Key Corridor issues were ranked from 1 to 12, with 1 being the highest priority.

Appendix A.3.5.4: Build ­ A ­ Streetscape (Business District)
Please select all components that you would like the study to consider for future streetscape
improvements within the South Side Business District.




Comments provided by the public include:
     Landscape plantings for stormwater management and shading, etc.
     I would like the Southside (present) to become the new Venango City like it originally was back
     in the 1840's and 1850's before oil. If the speeders won't slow down on Route 62 East I would
     like to see some speed bumps in place.
     No bumpouts.
     Try to work with Main Street Design Committee and Garden Club. Stormwater runoff should be
     assessed with a more environmental approach. Streetscape on the east end would enliven a
     utilitarian avenue.

Please identify all features the study should analyze as part of the alternatives considered for Route 62.




Comments provided by the public include:

     Maintenance and above. Do the bike and pedestrian trail.
     Without a proper riverfront any walkways would be underutilized.


Appendix A.3.5.6: Roundabouts
Proper implementation of roundabouts can provide the following benefits:
        Provide a means to calm traffic
        Can serve as a gateway feature
        Reduces frequency and severity of crashes
        When compared to a signal alternative, roundabouts can reduce traffic delays and increase
        traffic capacity

Please provide your opinion on consideration of a roundabout to be studied to address traffic safety and
traffic speed issues.




Comments provided by the public include:
     Too much for our little town.
     Concerns about east side pedestrian crossing.
     Wilson / Second is a wonderful intersection for pedestrians.

Appendix A.3.5.7: Visual Preference Survey
Summary of Visual Preference Survey
A visual preference survey (VPS) is an innovative and successful technique that enables citizens to
evaluate physical images of natural and built environments. The process involves asking participants to
view and evaluate a wide variety of slides depicting streetscapes, land use, site design, building type,
aesthetics and amenities. Individual scores indicate the level of preference for images viewed during
the survey. The results are analyzed to determine what is appropriate for the Corridor. The visual
preference survey was conducted during the Public Meeting on April 21, 2010. The following includes
analysis methodology, presentation of results, a summary of preferences and the images used in the
VPS.

Methodology
Individuals attending the meeting were asked to view numbered pictures which depicted various images
of natural and built environments. Each participant was provided a sheet or a response card to record
their response indicating appropriateness of the suitability of the development or setting for the
Corridor. Individuals responded to twenty nine images. Response options included strongly oppose,
oppose, no preference, some preference, and strong preference.

Following the meeting, the survey sheets were collected and tallied. Each response option was assigned
a weight factor, whereby the weights included: strongly oppose (-2), oppose (-1), no preference (0),
some preference (1), and strong preference (2). The number of responses for each response option was
summed and an average response value was calculated for each slide.

Visual Preference Survey Results
Overall, responses to the survey were marginal with some preference, or an average response value of
0.18. There were several images with strong preference, and several with strong opposition. The top
preferred images included 13, 10, 23, 5, 7 and 25, with an average value of 1.45 (strong preference);
while the top opposed images included 2, 12, 14, 22, 24 and 29, with an average value of -1.05. The
following is a summary of images of the highest preferred and least preferred images.




                                                                                           P a g e | 21

Appendix G.1 GAP Analysis
For reference, opportunity gaps indicate the expenditure of local dollars outside of the community
(goods and services not adequately provided for in the local community) and the surplus gaps of goods
and services provided in the City or Surrounding Area that meet regional demand.

Appendix G.1.1: Oil City Study Area / Gap Analysis Results
The data indicates that the Oil City Study Area may be able to support a
motor vehicle and parts dealer, gasoline station, a general merchandise
store, or clothing and clothing accessory store. The data also indicates that
the Oil City Study Area is meeting a regional demand for electronics and
appliances, building materials and garden equipment, food and beverage
products, health and personal care facilities and products, and food services
and drinking places. Utilizing a gap analysis provides an initial indicator
for retail and services opportunities for a selected region, therefore
further market study and analysis is considered prudent.

                  Introduction to Access Management and
              Sample Access Management Ordinance for Oil City
Access management is a means of controlling the ways in which vehicles can access major roadways,
using techniques such as limiting the number of driveways and intersections with local roadways.
Although it involves a sometimes complex balance of the need for local accessibility with the need for
overall mobility, properly managed access is vital to the safety and efficiency of your community's road
network. Conversely, when highway access points are not managed effectively, accidents and
congestion increase and a community's quality of life can deteriorate.

The Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Access Management Manual defines access management as:
..the systematic control of the location, spacing, design, and operation of driveways, median openings,
interchanges, and street connections to a roadway. It also involves roadway design applications, such as
median treatments and auxiliary lanes, and the appropriate spacing of traffic signals. The purpose of
access management is to provide vehicular access to land development in a manner that preserves the
safety and efficiency of the transportation system.

10 Principals of Access Management
        Provide a specialized roadway system
        Limit direct access to major roadways
        Promote intersection hierarchy
        Locate signals to favor through movements
        Preserve the functional area of intersections and interchanges
        Limit the number of conflict points
        Separate conflict areas
        Remove turning vehicles from through-traffic lanes
        Use non traversable medians to manage turn movements
        Provide a supporting street and circulation system

Benefits of Access Management
An effectively implemented access management program can improve public safety and reduce traffic
congestion. Studies show that as the number of access points increases, crash rates increase. In addition
to fatalities and injuries, roadway incidents are responsible for nearly 25 percent of delays.

Access management ordinances only apply to new or altered development, not existing homes and
businesses, so they will not immediately solve access problems that have already emerged. However,
land uses change over time. For example, a house may become a business, or a current use may wish to
expand. Having access management ordinances and a plan in place ensures that when changes do occur,
sound access management techniques can be instituted.

Model Ordinance Tiers
The access management practices have been categorized into three tiers of model ordinance language
based on ease of implementation; timeline to achieve desired outcomes; and the level of coordination
required between the municipality, property owners, affected stakeholders, and PennDOT.
Tier 1
Tier 1 practices relate to the number and location of driveways and basic design elements that should be
evaluated for every access. These practices should be implemented during the land development
approval process and require coordination between the municipality, property owner, and possibly
PennDOT. Additional practices such as shared driveways and internal access to outparcels attempt to
consolidate access points among adjacent property owners. The practices included in this tier are
generally the easiest to implement because they cost the least, take the least time to implement, and
require the least amount of coordination between the property owner, municipality, and PennDOT.

· Number of Driveways
· Corner Clearance
· Safe Sight Distance
· Driveway Channelization
· Joint and Cross Access
· Access to Outparcels
· Driveway Throat Length
· Driveway Throat Width
· Driveway Radius
· Driveway Profile

Tier 2
Tier 2 practices involve more complex design elements for individual driveways, such as left turn lanes
and deceleration lanes. Other practices, such as driveway and signalized intersection spacing, involve
multiple driveways or off-site intersections. The practices in this tier can be implemented during the
land development approval process, but they could require a higher level of coordination among the
municipality, multiple property owners, and PennDOT. Some of the practices could require
implementation through multiple land development approvals or a comprehensive project involving
several properties. The practices in this tier can be more costly and require a longer period of time to
implement than the practices in Tier 1 due to the participation of multiple property owners.

· Auxiliary Lanes
· Left Turn Lane
· Acceleration Lane
· Driveway Spacing
· Signalized Intersection Spacing
· Driveway Clearance from Interchange Ramps

Tier 3
Tier 3 includes roadway design and planning practices such as medians, two-way center left turn lanes,
setbacks, frontage roads involving multiple driveways, intersections, and properties. These practices
cover a much larger corridor or area and typically require the highest degree of coordination among
property owners, the municipality, and PennDOT. In addition, this tier contains planning and regulatory
tools such as the official map and zoning overlay districts to implement these types of practices. In most
situations, these practices would require capital funding for implementation. These types of practices
could require years to fully implement. These practices are more expensive, require much higher levels
of coordination between stakeholders, and much more time to implement than Tier 1 and Tier 2
practices.

· Overlay Districts
· Official Map
· Two-way Left Turn Lanes
· Frontage/Service Roads
· Non-traversable Medians
· Setbacks
· Bonuses and Incentives
· Pre-existing Access

                    ACCESS MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE FOR OIL CITY
 (adapted from Access Management Model Ordinances for Pennsylvania Municipalities Handbook, PennDOT)

Purpose
The purpose of this ordinance is to provide vehicular access to land development in a manner that
preserves the safety and efficiency of the transportation system. Access management encompasses the
careful planning of the location, design and operation of driveways, median openings, interchanges, and
street connections. If access systems are not properly designed, the primary transportation network,
including arterials and highways, will be unable to accommodate the access needs of development and
retain their primary transportation function.

This ordinance is intended to promote safe and efficient travel within Oil City by limiting the number of
conflict points, providing safe spacing standards between driveways, encouraging shared access
between abutting properties, and ensuring safe access by emergency vehicles.

Applicability
This ordinance shall apply to all arterials and collectors within the City, as identified herein, and to all
properties which abut these roadways.

        List proposed streets

A. Driveways
1) Number of Driveways

    a) Only one access shall be permitted for a property.

    b) An additional access or accesses shall be permitted if the applicant demonstrates that an
    additional access or additional accesses are necessary to accommodate traffic to and from the site
    and it can be achieved in a safe and efficient manner.

    c) The municipality shall restrict access to right turn only ingress and egress or to another state
    maintained road or local road if safe and efficient movements cannot be accommodated.

    d) For a property that abuts two or more roadways, the municipality may restrict access to only that
    roadway that can more safely and efficiently accommodate traffic.

    e) If the municipality anticipates that a property may be subdivided and that the subdivision may
    result in an unacceptable number or arrangement of driveways, or both, the municipality shall
    require the property owner to enter into an access covenant to restrict future access.

2) Corner Clearance

    a) Corner clearance shall meet the following driveway spacing standards that are desirable for
    arterial and major collector roads:

        i) Principal arterial: 600 feet

        ii) Minor arterial: 400 feet

        iii) Major collector: 200 feet

    b) Access shall be provided to the roadway where corner clearance requirements can be achieved.

    c) If the minimum driveway spacing standards cannot be achieved due to constraints, the following
    shall apply in all cases:

        i) There shall be a minimum 10-foot tangent distance between the end of the intersecting
        roadway radius and the beginning radius of a permitted driveway.

        ii) The distance from the nearest edge of cartway of an intersecting roadway to the beginning
        radius of a permitted driveway shall be a minimum of 30 feet.
    d) If no other reasonable access to the property is available, and no reasonable alternative is
    identified, the driveway shall be located the farthest possible distance from the intersecting
    roadway. In such cases, directional connections (i.e., right in/right out only, right in only or right out
    only) may be required.

    e) The municipality shall require restrictions at the driveway if the municipal engineer determines
    that the location of the driveway and particular ingress or egress movements will create safety or
    operational problems.




3) Safe Sight Distance

    a) Safe sight distance shall be available for all permitted turning movements at all driveway
    intersections.

    b) PennDOT's Pub. 441 and Pub. 282 for driveways or Pub. 70 for local roads shall be referenced to
    determine minimum driveway and roadway intersection safe sight distance requirements.

    c) All driveways and intersecting roadways shall be designed and located so that the sight distance is
    optimized to the degree possible without jeopardizing other requirements such as intersection
    spacing, and at least minimum sight distance requirements are met.

4) Driveway Channelization

    a) For high and medium volume driveways, channelization islands and medians shall be used to
    separate conflicting traffic movements into specified lanes to facilitate orderly movements for
    vehicles and pedestrians.

    b) Where it is found to be necessary to restrict particular turning movements at a driveway, due to
    the potential disruption to the orderly flow of traffic or a result of sight distance constraints, the
    municipality may require a raised channelization island.

    c) Raised channelization islands shall be designed with criteria consistent with the latest AASHTO
    publication entitled A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.

5) Joint and Cross Access
    a) The municipality may require a joint driveway in order to achieve the following driveway spacing
    standards that are desirable for arterial and major collector roads:

        i) Principal arterial: 600 feet

        ii) Minor arterial: 400 feet

        iii) Major collector: 200 feet

    b) Adjacent non-residential properties shall provide a joint or cross access driveway to allow
    circulation between sites wherever feasible along roadways classified as major collectors or arterials
    in accordance with the functional classification contained in the municipal comprehensive plan. The
    following shall apply to joint and cross access driveways:

        i) The driveway shall have a design speed of 10 mph and have sufficient width to accommodate
        two-way traffic including the largest vehicle expected to frequently access the properties.

        ii) A circulation plan that may include coordinated or shared parking shall be required.

        iii) Features shall be included in the design to make it visually obvious that abutting properties
        shall be tied in to provide cross access.

    c) The property owners along a joint or cross access driveway shall:

        i) Record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties served
        by the driveway.

        ii) Record an agreement with the municipality so that future access rights along the driveway
        shall be granted at the discretion of the municipality and the design shall be approved by the
        municipal engineer.

        iii) Record a joint agreement with the deed defining the maintenance responsibilities of each of
        the property owners located along the driveway.

6) Access to Outparcels

    a) For commercial and office developments under the same ownership and consolidated for the
    purposes of development or phased developments comprised of more than one building site, the
    municipality shall require that the development be served by an internal road that is separated from
    the main roadway.

    b) All access to outparcels shall be internalized using the internal roadway.

    c) The driveways for outparcels shall be designed to allow safe and efficient ingress and egress
    movements from the internal road.

    d) The internal circulation roads shall be designed to avoid excessive queuing across parking aisles.

    e) The design of the internal road shall be in accordance with all other sections of this ordinance.

    f) All necessary easements and agreements required under Section A.6.c shall be met.

    g) A municipality may require an access covenant to restrict an outparcel to internal access only.
B. Driveway Design Elements
1) Driveway Throat Length

   a) For minimum use driveways, the throat length shall be a minimum of 25 feet.

   b) For low volume driveways, the throat length shall be a minimum of 50 feet or as determined by
   queuing analysis.

   c) For medium volume driveways, the throat length shall be a minimum of 120 feet or as
   determined by a queuing analysis.

   d) For high volume driveways, the throat length shall be a minimum of 150 feet or as determined by
   a queuing analysis.



2) Driveway Throat Width

   a) For driveways without curb:

       i) A minimum use driveway shall have a minimum width of 10 feet.

       ii) Low and medium volume driveways shall have a minimum width of 10 feet        for     one-way
       operation and a minimum width of 20 feet for two-way operation.

       iii) The design of high volume driveways shall be based on analyses to determine the number of
       required lanes.

   b) For driveways with curb, two feet should be added to the widths contained in Section a.i and a.ii.

   c) The municipality may require additional driveway width to provide turning lanes for adequate
   traffic flow and safety.

   d) The municipality may require that the driveway design include a median to control turning
   movements. Where medians are required or permitted, the minimum width of the median shall be
   four feet to provide adequate clearance for signs.
3) Driveway Radius

    a) The following criteria shall apply to driveway radii:

        i) For minimum use driveways, the radii shall be a minimum of 15 feet.

        ii) For low volume driveways, the radii shall be a minimum of 15 feet uncurbed and 25 feet
        curbed.

        iii) For medium volume driveways, the radii shall be a minimum of 15 feet uncurbed and 25 feet
        curbed.

        iv) For high volume driveways, the design should be reviewed by the municipal engineer on
        municipal roadways and PennDOT on state maintained roadways.

    b) For all driveways, the radii shall be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle expected to
    frequently use the driveway.

    c) Except for joint driveways, no portion of a driveway radius may be located on or along the
    frontage of an adjacent property.




4) Driveway Profile

    a) Driveway grade requirements where curb is not present on the intersecting street:

        i) Shoulder slopes vary from four percent to six percent. When shoulders are present, the
        existing shoulder slope shall be maintained across the full shoulder width.

        ii) The change in grade between the cross slope of the connecting roadway or shoulder and the
        driveway shall not exceed eight percent.

        iii) The driveway grade shall not exceed eight percent within 10 feet of the edge of travel lane
        for minimum use driveways and within 40 feet for low, medium, and high volume driveways.
        iv) A 40-foot minimum vertical curve should be used for a high volume driveway.

    b) Driveway grade requirements where curbs and sidewalks are present:

        i) The difference between the cross slope of the roadway and the grade of the driveway apron
        may not exceed eight percent.

        ii) The driveway grade shall not exceed eight percent within 10 feet of the edge of travel lane for
        minimum use driveways and within 40 feet for low, medium, and high volume driveways.

        iii) If a planted area exists between the sidewalk and curb, the following shall apply:

            (1) The grade of the planted area shall not exceed eight percent.

            (2) If the driveway grade would exceed eight percent in the area between the curb and the
            sidewalk, the outer edge (street side) of the sidewalk may be depressed to enable the
            driveway grade to stay within eight percent. A maximum sidewalk cross slope of eight
            percent must be maintained.

            (3) If the sidewalk cross slope exceeds two percent, the entire sidewalk may be depressed.
            The longitudinal grade of the sidewalk may not exceed six percent.

    c) Although site conditions may not allow strict adherence to these guidelines in this ordinance,
    every effort should be made to design and construct the safest and most efficient access onto the
    municipal or state roadway.




C. TRANSPORTATION IMPACT STUDIES
A transportation impact study is an engineering study that evaluates the effect that traffic generated by
a proposed development would have on surrounding roadway operations, and determines the
improvements to the existing transportation system necessary to accommodate that traffic. A
transportation impact study should be completed when thresholds are met based on the size of the
development and its impact on adjacent access points and intersections.

An application for access to a development shall include a traffic impact study if:

        The access is expected to have an average daily traffic volume of 3,000 or more,
      During any one-hour time period, the development is expected to generate either 100 or more
       new vehicle trips entering the development or 100 or more new vehicle trips exiting the
       development, or
      In the opinion of the City Planner, the development is expected to have a significant impact on
       highway safety or traffic flow even though it does not meet 1 or 2 above.

All transportation impact studies are to be prepared in accordance with the latest PennDOT
requirements for Transportation Impact Studies.

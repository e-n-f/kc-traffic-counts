INTRODUCTION
The City of Hinesville is the county seat of Liberty County, Georgia, located to the southwest of
Savannah. Along with nearby Fort Stewart, it is the principal city of the Hinesville-Fort Stewart
Metropolitan Statistical Area. Similarly, it is home to the Hinesville Area Metropolitan Planning
Organization (HAMPO), housed within the Liberty Consolidated Planning Commission (LCPC).

HAMPO and LCPC initiated the Veterans Parkway Sector Plan in early 2011 in order to address a
variety of transportation operational issues in the vicinity of Veterans Parkway. Over the course
of the study's duration the purpose of the plan (and study area) evolved to include a handful of
other considerations. These include:

   · To review a previous plan proposing to construct medians through the center two-way
     left turn lane of US 84
   · Review access at various commercial sites
   · Concerns about congestion and safety along South Main Street
   · Vehicle backups at the intersection of South Main Street and Veterans Parkway

The final boundaries of the study area are depicted in Figure 1.

The following report documents the project activities utilized to complete the plan organized by
major tasks. Therefore, the report is organized as follows:

   ·   Data Collection
   ·   Traffic Projections
   ·   Needs Analysis
   ·   Recommendations

DATA COLLECTION
Data collection for the Veterans Parkway Sector Plan included a variety of efforts most easily
organized under the following categories:

   · General Background Data
   · Previous Plans and Studies
   · Technical Data


General Background Data
General background data focused on basic data relating to the overall study area. This included:

   · The vehicular transportation network (depicted previously in the study area map on
     Figure 1) in the study area with Veterans Parkway serving as the major east-west
     connection with South Main Street along with General Screven Way, US 84, and E.G.
     Miles Parkway serving the major north-south connections. Several other roadways serve
     more localized connections that area primarily east-west such as Deal Street, Link Street,
     and Quarterman Drive.
   · Existing land use (depicted in Figure 2) indicated primarily commercial uses along US 84
     and General Screven Way, primarily residential uses along South Main Street, and a mix of
     uses along E.G. Miles Parkway.
   · Places of interest in the vicinity of the study area (depicted in Figure 3) include several
     places of worship, cemeteries, schools, and shopping areas. In particular, the shopping
     area concentrated around the intersection of Veterans Parkway and US 84 includes both
     big box stores (Wal-Mart and Lowes) and general shopping center uses.
   · The current transit route structure (depicted in Figure 4) shows US 84, South Main Street,
     General Screven Way, Veterans Parkway, and E.G. Miles Parkway being served by Liberty
     Transit. In particular, the transit stop located at the Wal-Mart located at the southwest
     corner of Veterans Parkway and US 84 is the highest utilized stop in the system and will
     serve as the major hub for transfers as part of a planned modification of the structure.
     Similarly, that modification will also include extending service down South Main Street
     south of Veterans Parkway.

Previous Plans and Studies
Previous plans and studies considered include the following:

   · US 84 Comprehensive Corridor Study: This planning study was completed for LCPC and
     HAMPO. The primary recommendations relevant to the Veterans Parkway Sector Plan
     were:
     o The installation of a raised median on the center two-way left turn lane along US 84
     o Other localized access improvements coordinated with the median installation, most
         notably including modifying the currently signalized intersection of US 84 and the
         Wal-Mart shopping center to prohibit eastbound left turns (out of the shopping
         center onto US 84).
   · The HAMPO 2035 Sustainable Mobility Plan completed in 2010 which serves as the
     region's current federally mandated Long Range Transportation Plan. This plan includes:
     o HAMPO Project 210: The widening of Veterans Parkway from two to four lanes
         between E.G. Miles Parkway and Fort Stewart estimated to be constructed between
         Fiscal Years 2015 and 2020
     o HAMPO Projects 319, 320, and 321: Reflecting the incorporation of the median
         installation and associated access improvements from the US 84 Comprehensive
         Corridor Study into the Long Range Transportation Plan with a staggered
         implementation beginning between Fiscal Years 2015 and 2020
     o HAMPO Project 302: Installation of a traffic signal at the intersection of E.G. Miles
         Parkway and Deal Street along with other associated improvements (realignment of
         driveways and turn lanes) to be completed between Fiscal Years 2015 and 2020
   · The 2030 Consolidated Comprehensive Plan for the region completed in 2008
   · The Wal-Mart Traffic Study completed for Wal-Mart in the year 2011 including a variety
     of site and access improvements most notably including the recommendation of a traffic
     signal at the driveway on Veterans Parkway utilized by both Wal-Mart and Lowes (on the
     other side of the street)

DATA COLLECTION
Technical Data
Technical Data included three major components:

·   A traffic count program
·   An engineering level analysis of crash data
·   Field reviews

Traffic Counts
Traffic counts included a variety of count types including peak period Turning Movement Counts
(TMCs), 12 hour TMCs, 24 hour tube counts, 24 hour vehicle classification counts, 24 hour
vehicle speed counts. The majority of counts were conducted on Wednesday August 15, 2012,
which was a military payday while local schools were in session. While URS coordinated the
counts collected on this data, HAMPO staff also performed a variety of independent counts on
that date to test the validity of the data. Due to an expansion of the study area during the study
process, HAMPO staff also performed a variety of counts along the South Main Street corridor in
the middle of October 2012. These counts were compared to the counts conducted in August
2012 for reasonability. The count locations are depicted in both Figure 5 and Table 1.
Additionally, Figure 6 depicts daily summaries of the data collected at the 24 hour count
locations while Figure 7 depicts peak hour summaries of the data collected. The raw count data
and peak hour turning movements are provided in Appendix A.

DATA COLLECTION
Crash Data
Crash reports completed by law enforcement throughout the study area were collected for the
years 2009, 2010, and 2011. These crash reports were analyzed, compiled, and plotted onto
aerial photography of the study area in order to best ascertain the specific location of the
reported crashes. The crashes are depicted in Appendix B.

Field Reviews
Field reviews were also conducted to determine general study area conditions, verify signal
timing parameters, lane configurations, and signage. Observations include:

·   PM peak hour congestion in the southbound direction on South Main Street due primarily to
    southbound left turns not clearing at the intersection of South Main Street and Veterans
    Parkway
·   Improperly placed sign locations at the curves on South Main Street in the vicinity of the
    intersection of South Main Street and Deal Street
·   Particularly wide pavement section on South Main Street between General Screven Way
    and Link Street
·   Inefficiencies in signal operations at the intersection of US 84 and Wal-Mart due primarily to
    use of split phasing necessitated by the offset driveways on the east (Wal-Mart) and west
    (shopping center) approaches

TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

Traffic projections were conducted to estimate conditions in the years 2025 and 2035. This was
conducted in a two-step process.


Growth Rate Projection
In the first step, an area wide growth rate was applied to all existing peak hour turning
movement volumes. This area wide growth rate was derived from comparing 2010 and 2035
projections from the HAMPO travel demand model as shown in Table 2.

Trip Generation
In the second step, anticipated future development on the Veterans Parkway corridor was
manually added to forecast. This anticipated development concerns seven sites, as depicted in
Figure 8, which are in different points of the project lifecycle. Generalized development data
was collected by HAMPO and then converted into specific land use units (as shown in Table 3) in
order to perform a trip generation analysis utilizing the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) Trip Generation Manual (as shown in Tables 4 and 5). Inter-parcel connectivity was
assumed for sites adjacent to each other (this is why some sites are combined) and internal
capture was removed from the number of net trips calculated. In order to provide a
conservative analysis, pass-by trips (trips that would already be on the roadway but would make
stops at the various sites) were not deducted from the net trips. It should be noted that this
analysis is not intended to be a substitute for any specific analysis as these seven sites finalize
site plans and specific development usage.

In the final steps, the net trips were distributed throughout the study area based on existing
patterns of traffic observed and then manually added to the growth-rate projected traffic. The
resulting 2025 and 2035 peak hour volumes are depicted in Figures 9 and 10 respectively.
Additionally, the entire turning movement profiles for both forecast years (including the initial
growth rate projected traffic, the trip generated traffic, and the final forecast) are provided in
Appendix C.

NEEDS ANALYSIS
The needs analysis was conducted based on three major analysis components:

· Capacity Analysis
· Crash Analysis
· Field Analysis


Capacity Analysis
The 2010 Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM) defines Level of Service (LOS) at
an unsignalized intersection by average
control delay per vehicle which
includes initial deceleration delay,
queue move-up time, stopped delay,
and final acceleration delay. Several
factors affect the controlled delay for
unsignalized intersections, such as availability and distribution of gaps in the conflicting traffic
stream, critical gaps, and follow-up time for a vehicle in the queue. For signalized intersections,
LOS for a signalized intersection is defined in terms of average control delay per vehicle, which
is composed of initial deceleration delay, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and final
acceleration delay. Table 6 presents LOS thresholds unsignalized and signalized intersections.
In general, LOS E and F are typically considered to be the LOS grades indicative of congestion.

NEEDS ANALYSIS
Synchro 8.0, a software program that utilizes the 2010 HCM methodologies was utilized to
analyze conditions in the year 2012 and the future years 2015 and 2035. In addition to
vehicular LOS, Synchro 8.0 is also able to provide pedestrian and bicycle LOS at signalized
locations. Vehicular LOS and corresponding delay is provided in Tables 7 and 8 respectively
while Pedestrian and Bicycle LOS is provided in Tables 9 and 10 respectively.

Based on the initial analysis, the majority of locations work fairly well in the existing year with
increasing observations of LOS E and F in the future years. In some locations (signalized
intersections such as E.G. Miles Parkway at Veterans Parkway) the lane configurations are
already built out and generally cannot be improved upon despite the LOS E or F. At other
locations (typically unsignalized intersections) LOS E and F are observed at the stopped
approaches but these results can often be due to limitations in the analysis in which the
assumptions regarding the gaps in vehicles on the main street are extremely conservative and
often not reflective of reality.

Despite this, improvements that were determined to be feasible and were tested and include
optimized signal timing at signalized locations, a new traffic signal at Veterans Parkway's full
access driveway with Wal-Mart and Lowes (a signal determined to be warranted by both the
Wal-Mart Traffic Study and independently verified as part of this analysis), realigning the
westbound approach of the US 84 and Wal-Mart intersection and removing the split phasing,
and constructing a single lane roundabout at the intersection of South Main Street and Deal
Street. As the LOS and delay results (shown in Tables 11 and 12 respectively) indicate, this
improves LOS at most of the locations. While some intersections still operate at LOS E or F, the
average vehicle delay is drastically reduced as shown in Table 13.

Additionally, all of the Capacity Analysis output is provided in Appendix D.

Crash Analysis
A review of all the segment and intersection crashes was conducted to focus on patterns in the
locations of crashes and the crash type. The findings are presented below.

· Multiple rear end crashes in the westbound channelized right turn lane at the intersection
  of Veterans Parkway and EG Miles Parkway. Removal of the channelized right turn
  configuration (with yield control) would likely mitigate these crashes.
· While there were only a few observations of crashes at the intersection of Deal Street and
  South Main Street, the majority of those crashes included vehicles losing control. In this
  short term, this can be mitigated by replacing pavement markings and sign locations at the
  intersection (as determined through the field analysis described below) and in the long term
  could also be mitigated though the use of a roundabout at the intersection (which would
  also mitigate anticipated future congestion).
· The proposed median projects on US 84 were reviewed to determine where median
  openings and closings would be constructed. Cross-referencing this review the crash

NEEDS ANALYSIS
    analysis indicated that the median project would mitigate many of the correctible crashes at
    current openings.


Field Analysis
As described earlier, the field review was used primarily to verify existing conditions but the
following points were made:

·   PM peak hour congestion in the southbound direction on South Main Street due primarily to
    southbound vehicles not clearing at the intersection of South Main Street and Veterans
    Parkway. A review of the real-time traffic conditions suggest that green time can simply be
    added to the southbound phase without negatively impacting the other phases or
    movements.
·   Improperly placed sign locations at the curves on South Main Street in the vicinity of the
    intersection of South Main Street and Deal Street which often contributes to the
    phenomenon of vehicles losing control at the intersection. As mentioned earlier, this can
    be mitigated by replacing pavement markings and adjusting sign locations at the
    intersection.
·   The particularly wide pavement section on South Main Street between General Screven
    Way and Link Street could easily be restriped to include a dedicated bicycle lane on each
    side of the street
·   Inefficiencies in signal operations at the intersection of US 84 and Wal-Mart due primarily to
    use of split phasing necessitated by the offset driveways on the east (Wal-Mart) and west
    (shopping center) approaches. As previously mentioned, a realignment of the intersection
    and subsequent removal of the split phasing would have a positive impact on LOS and delay.
    This would also be significantly more effective than the recommended removal of the
    westbound left turn lane at the intersection as part of the US 84 median project.

NEEDS ANALYSIS
Additional Considerations
Additionally, the following points and observations were made throughout the analysis:

   · With plans to extend transit onto the South Main Street corridor south of Veterans
     Parkway, bus pullouts should be considered where necessary to minimize impact to
     traffic flow. Additionally, pedestrian improvements should interface the residential
     neighborhoods along the corridor and planned stop locations
   · The HAMPO 2035 Sustainable Mobility Plan identified the need for a traffic signal at the
     intersection of EG Miles Parkway and Deal Street.              While the capacity analysis
     performed does indicate future LOS E and F at the intersection, this is in part due to the
     aforementioned limitations in the analysis. A review of the existing and projected future
     peak hour traffic volumes at the intersection suggest that this intersection would not
     pass a signal warrant analysis using the 2010 Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
     (MUTCD) and would subsequently not receive a permit from GDOT. This is because the
     MUTCD methodology requires at least 100 vehicles per hour (for up to eight hours)
     approaching the intersection on the side street. In this case, the approach volume on
     Deal Street is less than 100 vehicles in both the AM and PM peak hours even when
     projected to year 2035 conditions.
   · As mentioned previously, a signal warrant analysis was independently tested at the
     intersection of Veterans Parkway and Wal-Mart/Lowes. This analysis verified the Wal-
     Mart Traffic Study results indicating that a signal is warranted. The results of this analysis
     are provided in Appendix D.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the analysis, the recommendations are shown in Table 14 and depicted in Figure 11.
As the majority of recommendations are either operational or maintenance based in nature
and/or dependent on other factors, the prioritization of the projects is based primarily on the
ease to implement and the implied need based on the technical analysis. Additionally, Figures
12 through 15 depict conceptual drawings for four of the proposed projects.

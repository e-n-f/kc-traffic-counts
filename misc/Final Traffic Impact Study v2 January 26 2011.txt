1.0        INTRODUCTION
This traffic analysis has been prepared to identify and evaluate the potential traffic impacts of the
proposed South Sierra Madre Townhomes project. The proposed development project comprises
three parcels located at 158, 168 and 188 South Sierra Madre Boulevard in the City of Pasadena,
California. The project site is bounded by Oswego Street to the north, Del Mar Boulevard to the
south, existing residential development to the east, and Sierra Madre Boulevard to the west. The
proposed project site location and general vicinity are shown in Figure 1­1.

The traffic analysis follows City of Pasadena traffic study guidelines 1 and is consistent with traffic
impact assessment guidelines set forth in the 2004 Congestion Management Program for Los
Angeles County 2. This traffic analysis evaluates potential project-related impacts at six key
intersections in the vicinity of the project site. The study intersections were determined in
consultation with City of Pasadena Department of Transportation staff. The Intersection Capacity
Utilization method was used to determine Volume-to-Capacity ratios and corresponding Levels of
Service at the study intersections. Three street segments in the project vicinity were also evaluated
for project-related impacts based on criteria set forth in the City's traffic study guidelines. In
addition, a review was conducted of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
intersection and freeway monitoring stations to determine if a Congestion Management Program
transportation impact assessment analysis is required for the proposed project.

This study (i) presents existing traffic volumes, (ii) forecasts existing with proposed project traffic
volumes, (iii) forecasts future traffic volumes with the related projects, (iv) forecasts future traffic
volumes with the proposed project, (v) determines project-related impacts, and (vi) recommends
mitigation measures, where necessary.

1.1        Study Area
Based on direction from City of Pasadena staff, a total of nine locations, including six study
intersections and three street segments, have been identified for evaluation. These study locations
provide local access to the study area and define the extent of the boundaries for this traffic impact
investigation. Further discussion of the existing street system and study area is provided in Section
4.0 herein.

The general location of the project in relation to the study locations and surrounding street system is
presented in Figure 1­1. The traffic analysis study area is generally comprised of those locations
which have the greatest potential to experience significant traffic impacts due to the proposed project
as defined by the Lead Agency. In the traffic engineering practice, the study area generally includes
those intersections that are:

           a.         Immediately adjacent or in close proximity to the project site;

           b.         In the vicinity of the project site that are documented to have current or projected
                      future adverse operational issues; and

           c.         In the vicinity of the project site that are forecast to experience a relatively greater
                      percentage of project-related vehicular turning movements (e.g., at freeway ramp
                      intersections).

The locations selected for analysis were based on the above criteria, proposed South Sierra Madre
Townhomes project peak hour vehicle trip generation, the anticipated distribution of project
vehicular trips and existing intersection/corridor operations.

2.0        PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1        Site Location
The proposed development project comprises three parcels located at 158, 168 and 188 South Sierra
Madre Boulevard in the City of Pasadena, California. The project site is bounded by Oswego Street
to the north, Del Mar Boulevard to the south, existing residential development to the east, and Sierra
Madre Boulevard to the west. The proposed project site location and general vicinity are shown in
Figure 1­1.

The project site is located along Sierra Madre Boulevard, which is designated by the City as a multi-
modal corridor, as well as within close proximity to several other multi-modal corridors such as
Altadena Drive, Colorado Boulevard, and Del Mar Boulevard. As stated in the 2004 Mobility
Element of the City of Pasadena General Plan (November 8, 2004), multi-modal corridors are being
developed to promote the efficient and convenient travel by all appropriate modes (e.g., pedestrian,
bicycle, regional and local bus transit, light rail, vehicular, etc.). The City's intent is to "create an
environment where different modes of travel can co-exist and share the roadway, providing seamless
connections and reinforcing each other to develop a balanced and efficient transportation system." 3

2.2        Existing Project Site
The existing project site is situated along the east side of Sierra Madre Boulevard between Oswego
Street to the north and Del Mar Boulevard to the south. The project site presently comprises three
adjoining parcels that contain several vacant buildings, surface parking areas, and outdoor play
areas. The existing buildings and surface parking facilities will be removed to accommodate the
proposed project. An aerial photograph of the existing project site, including the existing buildings,
surface parking areas and driveway locations is contained in Appendix A.

2.3        Project Description
The project applicant seeks to obtain entitlements to construct a residential townhome complex with
a total of 60 dwelling units within three separate parcels. Site I, the Oswego Townhomes, is located
at 158 South Sierra Madre Boulevard and is planned to consist of 15 dwelling units. Site II, the
Sierra Madre Townhomes, is located at 168 South Sierra Madre Boulevard and is planned to consist
of 32 dwelling units. Site III, the Del Mar Townhomes, is located at 188 South Sierra Madre
Boulevard and is planned to consist of 13 dwelling units. Construction of the proposed project is
expected to commence in year 2011 with occupancy in the year 2013. The Site I (158 South Sierra
Madre Boulevard) project site plan is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The Site II (168 South Sierra Madre
Boulevard) project site plan is illustrated in Figure 2-2. The Site III (188 South Sierra Madre
Boulevard) project site plan is illustrated in Figure 2-3.

2.4        Project Parking
2.4.1 City Code Parking Requirements
In accordance with City of Pasadena Municipal Code parking requirements, a total of 126 parking
spaces is required for the proposed South Sierra Madre Townhomes project. The City of Pasadena
requirements for multi-family residential and retail land uses are set forth in Chapter 17 (see Section
17.46, Parking and Loading, and Section 17.46.040 ­ Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces
Required [Table 4-6, Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces Requirements]) of the Municipal Zoning
Code. The following parking requirements have been identified for the proposed project:

      · 1.0 covered space per unit for units with less than 650 square feet (SF) of net floor area;

      · 2.0 covered spaces per unit for units 650 SF or more of net floor area; and

      · 1.0 guest parking space for each 10 dwelling units for developments with 10 units or more

Based on the identified Code parking requirements, a total of 126 spaces is required for the proposed
South Sierra Madre Townhomes project as shown in the following calculations:

      ·    Site I ­ 158 South Sierra Madre Boulevard

           -          15 Units (>650 SF): 15 × 2.0 = 30 spaces

           -          15 Units (Guest Spaces): (15 ÷ 10) × 1.0 = 2 spaces

           -          Subtotal Site I Required Project Parking: 32 spaces

      ·    Site II ­ 168 South Sierra Madre Boulevard

           -          32 Units (>650 SF): 32 × 2.0 = 64 spaces

           -          32 Units (Guest Spaces): (32 ÷ 10) × 1.0 = 3 spaces

           -          Subtotal Site II Required Project Parking: 67 spaces

           -          Subtotal Site III Required Project Parking: 27 spaces

     ·     Total Required Project Parking = 126 spaces

2.4.2 Proposed Project Parking Supply
A total of 127 on-site parking spaces, including 120 resident spaces and 7 guest spaces, will be
provided in subterranean parking for the proposed project. Of this total, parking will be provided as
follows for the three separate project parcels:

     ·     Site I ­ 158 South Sierra Madre Boulevard: 32 spaces (30 resident and 2 guest)

     ·     Site II ­ 168 South Sierra Madre Boulevard: 67 spaces (64 resident and 3 guest)

     ·     Site III ­ 188 South Sierra Madre Boulevard: 28 spaces (26 resident and 2 guest)

It is noted that an overall total of 22 resident tandem spaces is planned within the 127 on-site parking
spaces (approximately 18 percent of the total number of residential spaces). In addition, a total of 41
bicycle parking spaces is planned to be provided as part of the proposed project including 10 bicycle
spaces for Site I, 18 bicycle spaces for Site II and 13 bicycle spaces for Site III.

As part of the parking supply, the project must also provide a minimum of five handicap accessible
spaces. This complies with the American With Disabilities Act (ADA) requirement of a minimum
of five ADA spaces for parking facilities with 101 to 151 spaces, with one in every eight handicap
spaces being van accessible.

The City of Pasadena Code parking requirement for the South Sierra Madre Townhomes project
totals 126 spaces. The South Sierra Madre Townhomes project planned parking supply totals 127
spaces. Thus, the project parking supply of 127 spaces satisfies the Code parking requirement.

2.4.3 Bicycle Code Parking Requirement
Use of bicycles as a transportation mode to and from the project site will be encouraged by the
provision of ample and safe parking. As identified in the City Code (refer to Table 4-16, Minimum
Number of Bicycle Spaces Required, in Section 17.46.320), the required number of bicycle parking
spaces for multi-family residential structures is one (1) Class 1 space for every six dwelling units.
Based on this requirement, a minimum total of ten bicycle parking spaces (60 ÷ 6 = 10 spaces) is
required to be provided on-site as part of the proposed project. As previously noted, a total of 41
bicycle parking spaces is planned to be provided as part of the proposed project including 10 bicycle

spaces for Site I, 18 bicycle spaces for Site II and 13 bicycle spaces for Site III. Thus, the project
parking supply of 41 bicycle spaces more than satisfies the Code parking requirement.

The type of spaces and dimensions will be provided based on City Code requirements, as well as to
meet the needs of a variety of bicycles. The bicycle spaces will be provided in a readily accessible
location. The selected location will encourage use and maintain visibility for personal safety and
theft protection. As needed, the project applicant will include site improvements such as planting
and trash receptacles wherever bicycle parking is provided. Further, appropriate lighting will be
provided to increase safety and provide theft protection during night-time parking.

3.0        SITE ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
Descriptions of the existing site access and proposed project site access and circulation schemes are
provided in the following subsections.

3.1        Existing Site Access
As indicated in the aerial photograph provided in Appendix A, vehicular access to the existing project
site is presently provided via a total of seven driveways: one driveway on the Oswego Street
property frontage, two driveways on the Sierra Madre Boulevard property frontage and four
driveways on the Del Mar Boulevard property frontage. Brief descriptions of the existing site
driveways are provided below:

      ·    Site I ­ 158 South Sierra Madre Boulevard

           -    Oswego Street Driveway: The existing site driveway on Oswego Street is located
                approximately mid-way along the northerly property frontage and accommodates full
                access (i.e., right-turn and left-turn ingress and egress turning movements).

           -    Sierra Madre Boulevard Northerly Driveway: The existing site northerly driveway on
                Sierra Madre Boulevard is located approximately 95 feet south of Oswego Street along
                the westerly property frontage and accommodates right-turn ingress and egress turning
                movements only due to the existing raised median island on Sierra Madre Boulevard.

      ·    Site II ­ 168 South Sierra Madre Boulevard

           -    Sierra Madre Boulevard Southerly Driveway: The existing site southerly driveway on
                Sierra Madre Boulevard is located approximately 140 feet north of Del Mar Boulevard
                along the westerly property frontage and accommodates right-turn ingress and egress
                turning movements only due to the existing raised median island on Sierra Madre
                Boulevard.

      ·    Site III ­ 188 South Sierra Madre Boulevard

           -    Del Mar Boulevard Driveways: The four (4) existing site driveways on Del Mar
                Boulevard are dispersed along the southerly property frontage and accommodate full
                access (i.e., right-turn and left-turn ingress and egress turning movements).

All of the existing site driveways, except for the easterly driveway on Del Mar Boulevard, will be
closed pursuant to City standards with concrete curb, gutter and sidewalk. The easterly driveway on
Del Mar Boulevard will be reconstructed as part of the proposed project to facilitate access to Site III
(188 South Sierra Madre Boulevard). Also, the project applicant will repair any existing or newly
damaged curb, gutter and sidewalk without cutting any pavement along the Oswego Street, Sierra
Madre Boulevard and Del Mar Boulevard property frontages.

3.2        Proposed Project Site Access
The proposed site access schemes for the South Sierra Madre Townhomes project are displayed in
Figures 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3 Access to the proposed project site will be provided via a total of three
driveways: one driveway on the Oswego Street property frontage for Site I (158 South Sierra Madre
Boulevard), one driveway on Sierra Madre Boulevard for Site II (168 South Sierra Madre
Boulevard), and one driveway on the Del Mar Boulevard property frontage for Site III (188 South
Sierra Madre Boulevard). Descriptions of the planned project site access points are provided in the
following paragraphs.

      ·    Site I ­ 158 South Sierra Madre Boulevard: Oswego Street Driveway

           This project driveway will be located along the south side of Oswego Street along the
           northerly property frontage, at the northeast corner of the project site. This project site
           driveway will be located easterly of the existing site driveway on Oswego Street which will
           be closed as part of the proposed project. The planned Oswego Street project driveway will
           accommodate full access (i.e., right-turn and left-turn ingress and egress turning movements).
           The Oswego Street project driveway, which is shown to be 12-feet in width, conforms with
           City of Pasadena Code design standards set forth in Section 17.46.150 (refer to Table 4-13)
           and will be constructed as such.

      ·    Site II ­ 168 South Sierra Madre Boulevard: Sierra Madre Boulevard Driveway

           This project driveway will be located along the east side of Sierra Madre Boulevard along the
           westerly property frontage, approximately mid-way between Oswego Street and Del Mar
           Boulevard. This project site driveway will be located roughly mid-way between the two
           existing site driveways on Sierra Madre Boulevard, which will be closed as part of the
           proposed project. The planned Sierra Madre Boulevard project driveway will be limited to
           right-turn ingress and egress turning movements only due to the existing raised median island
           on Sierra Madre Boulevard. The Sierra Madre Boulevard project driveway, which is shown
           to be 12-feet in width, conforms with City of Pasadena Code design standards set forth in
           Section 17.46.150 (refer to Table 4-13) and will be constructed as such.

           It is noted that the planned Site II project driveway is oriented southwest to northeast near the
           access point at Sierra Madre Boulevard. While the angle is not acute, it may impede sight
           distance for motorists exiting the site to see pedestrians walking southbound along the
           adjacent sidewalk. If possible, it is recommended that the driveway be oriented
           perpendicular with Sierra Madre Boulevard. Should this configuration not be possible due to
           design or other considerations, it is recommended that the north side of the driveway near the
           access point at Sierra Madre Boulevard be designed such that sight distance for exiting
           motorists not be impeded to the north. In addition, it is recommended that parking be
           prohibited south of the planned Site II project driveway via red curb markings in order to
           provide adequate sight distance for both exiting motorists as well as for northbound (i.e., on
           Sierra Madre Boulevard) motorists and bicyclists approaching the driveway.

      ·    Site III ­ 188 South Sierra Madre Boulevard: Del Mar Boulevard Driveway

           This project driveway will be located along the north side of Del Mar Boulevard along the
           southerly property frontage, at the southeast corner of the project site. This project site
           driveway will be generally situated at the same location as the existing easterly site driveway
           on Del Mar Boulevard. The planned Del Mar Boulevard project driveway will accommodate
           full access (i.e., right-turn and left-turn ingress and egress turning movements). The Del Mar
           Boulevard project driveway, which is shown to be 12-feet in width, conforms with City of
           Pasadena Code design standards set forth in Section 17.46.150 (refer to Table 4-13) and will
           be constructed as such.

3.3        Pedestrian Access
The project has been designed to encourage pedestrian activity and walking as a transportation
mode 4. As indicated in Figure 2­1, walkways and plaza areas are planned within the proposed
project which will connect to adjacent sidewalks in a manner that promotes walkability. Walkability
is a term for the extent to which walking is readily available as a safe, connected, accessible and
pleasant mode of transport. 5 There are several criteria that are widely accepted as key aspects of the
walkability of urban areas that should be satisfied. The underlying principle is that pedestrians
should not be delayed, diverted, or placed in danger. The widely accepted characteristics of
walkability are as follows:

·     Connectivity: People can walk from one place to another without encountering major obstacles,
      obstructions, or loss of connectivity.

·     Convivial: Pedestrian routes are friendly and attractive, and are perceived as such by pedestrians.

·     Conspicuous: Suitable levels of lighting, visibility and surveillance over its entire length, with
      high quality delineation and signage.

·     Comfortable: High quality and well-maintained footpaths of suitable widths, attractive
      landscaping and architecture, shelter and rest spaces, and a suitable allocation of roadspace to
      pedestrians.

·     Convenient: Walking is a realistic travel choice, partly because of the impact of the other criteria
      set forth above, but also because walking routes are of a suitable length as a result of land use
      planning with minimal delays.



4
  For example, refer to http://www.walkscore.com/, which generates a walkability score of approximately 77 (Very
Walkable) out of 100 for the project site. Walk Score calculates the walkability of an address by locating nearby stores,
restaurants, schools, parks, etc. Walk Score measures how easy it is to live a car-lite lifestyle--not how pretty the area is
for walking.

A review of the proposed project pedestrian walkway network indicates that these primary
characteristics are accommodated as part of the proposed project. The project is situated just south
of Colorado Boulevard where retail, restaurant, and other commercial businesses are located.
Further, regional and local public bus transit stops are provided adjacent to the project site as well as
nearby on Sierra Madre Boulevard. The pedestrian walkways should be appropriately landscaped
and adorned to provide a friendly walking environment.

3.3.1 Review of Sierra Madre Boulevard/Del Mar Boulevard Pedestrian Conditions
Existing pedestrian amenities are provided at the Sierra Madre Boulevard intersection and adjacent
to the project site. Specifically, the following pedestrian amenities are provided at the subject study
area:

     ·     Standard marked pedestrian crosswalks exist at all four approaches to the intersection (i.e.,
           13 feet in width and painted white)

     ·     Pedestrian countdown indicators and movement push buttons are provided for all walk
           movements at the intersection

     ·     Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) ramps are provided at all four corners of the
           intersection

     ·     Sidewalks and combination sidewalks/parkways are provided along the project site property
           frontages as listed below:

                      -    Oswego Street ­ combination 15-foot sidewalk/parkway (5 feet/10 feet)

                      -    Sierra Madre Boulevard ­ 10-foot sidewalk

                      -    Del Mar Boulevard ­ 10-foot sidewalk

     ·     An ADA ramp is provided at the southeast corner of the Sierra Madre Boulevard/Oswego
           Street intersection adjacent to the project site; however, it is noted that no ADA ramp is
           provided at the northeast corner of this intersection

The widths of the sidewalks and crosswalks, as well as the location of bus stops and shelters, traffic
signal pedestrian push buttons, etc., are shown in Figure 3-1. Photographs of the sidewalks adjacent
to the project site (i.e., Sierra Madre Boulevard property frontage, Oswego Street property frontage
and Del Mar Boulevard property frontage) are displayed in Figure 3-2. Additionally, existing AM
and PM peak period pedestrian volumes at the intersection are presented in Figure 3-3.

As illustrated in the photographs presented in Figure 3-2 and the peak period pedestrian volumes, a
relatively low level of pedestrian activity currently occurs at the Sierra Madre Boulevard/Del Mar
Boulevard intersection and along the westerly and southerly property frontages. It should be noted
that based on review of accident history data provided by PasDOT, a lower than average collision

rate is indicated for the subject intersection. Based on review of the existing pedestrian conditions
adjacent to the project site, the following measures are recommended for consideration to improve
pedestrian connections and enhance pedestrian safety near the project site (with the focus being on
the separation of pedestrians from vehicles and measures that increase the visibility of pedestrians):

      ·    Widen sidewalk along the Oswego Street property frontage to provide a wider walk area (i.e.,
           wider than the existing 5-foot sidewalk)
      ·    Update the existing ADA ramps provided at all four corners of the Sierra Madre
           Boulevard/Del Mar Boulevard intersection and at the southeast corner of the Sierra Madre
           Boulevard/Oswego Street intersection
      ·    Install additional traffic signal equipment to promote pedestrian safety and enhance
           pedestrian signal operations (e.g., ADA pedestrian push buttons, countdown pedestrian
           signals, etc.) at the Sierra Madre Boulevard/Del Mar Boulevard intersection

3.4        Bicycle Access
Bicycle access to the project site will be facilitated by the City of Pasadena bicycle roadway
network. A total of seven bicycle routes (i.e., Class II Bike Lanes, Class III Bike Routes or Enhanced
Class III Bike Routes) in the City's bicycle network are located within an approximate one-mile
radius from the project site. The following key bicycle routes are located near the South Sierra
Madre Townhomes project site:

      ·    North-South Routes

           -      Allen Avenue:           Class III Bike Route (Enhanced)

           -      Sierra Madre Boulevard: Class II Bike Lane

           -      Craig Street:           Class III Bike Route

Use of bicycles as a transportation mode to and from the project site should be encouraged by the
provision of ample and safe parking. As identified in the Section 17.46.320 of the City Code, the
required number of bicycle parking spaces is one (1) space for every six dwelling units. The type of
spaces and dimensions should be provided based on City Code requirements, as well as to meet the
needs of a variety of bicycles. The bicycle spaces should be provided in a readily accessible location.
The selected location(s) should encourage use and maintain visibility for personal safety and theft
protection. As needed, the project applicant should include site improvements such as planting and
trash receptacles wherever bicycle parking is provided. Further, appropriate lighting should be
provided to increase safety and provide theft protection during night-time parking.

3.4.1 Review of Sierra Madre Boulevard/Del Mar Boulevard Bicycle Conditions
Existing bicycle amenities are provided along Sierra Madre Boulevard and adjacent to the project
site. Specifically, the following bicycle amenities are provided at the subject study area:

     ·     Class II bicycle lanes that are five feet in width and sharrows (recently installed) are striped
           along both sides of Sierra Madre Boulevard near the project site (i.e., northbound and
           southbound on the roadway)

     ·     Del Mar Boulevard is posted as a bicycle route (Class III Enhanced Bike Route) along both
           sides of Sierra Madre Boulevard near the project site

Photographs of the Class II bicycle lanes and sharrows on Sierra Madre Boulevard are contained in
Appendix A. Additionally, existing AM and PM peak period bicycle volumes at the intersection also
are provided in Figure 3-3.

As illustrated in the photographs presented in Figure 3-2 and the peak period bicycle volumes, a
relatively low level of bicycle activity currently occurs at the Sierra Madre Boulevard/Del Mar
Boulevard intersection and along the easterly and southerly property frontages. It should be noted
that based on review of accident history data provided by PasDOT, a lower than average collision
rate is indicated for the subject intersection.

4.0        EXISTING STREET SYSTEM
4.1        Study Intersections
Immediate access to the project site is via Oswego Street, Sierra Madre Boulevard and Del Mar
Boulevard. The following six study intersections were selected for analysis in consultation with
PasDOT staff in order to determine potential impacts related to the proposed project:

           1. Sierra Madre Boulevard/Colorado Boulevard

           2. Sierra Madre Boulevard/Oswego Street

           3. Sierra Madre Boulevard/Del Mar Boulevard

           4. Altadena Drive/Colorado Boulevard

           5. Altadena Drive/Oswego Street

           6. Altadena Drive/Del Mar Boulevard

Intersection Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 6 are presently controlled by traffic signals while Intersection Nos. 2
and 5 are unsignalized. The existing lane configurations at the study intersections are displayed in
Figure 4-1.

4.2        Study Street Segments
The following three study street segment locations were identified for analysis by PasDOT staff for
inclusion in the street segment analysis:

           1. Oswego Street between Sierra Madre Boulevard and Altadena Drive

           2. Sierra Madre Boulevard between Oswego Street and Del Mar Boulevard

           3. Del Mar Boulevard between Sierra Madre Boulevard and Altadena Drive

The existing travel lanes and posted speed limits on the study street segments also are shown in
Figure 4-1.

4.3        Roadway Classifications
The City of Pasadena utilizes the roadway categories recognized by regional, state and federal
transportation agencies. There are four categories in the roadway hierarchy, ranging from freeways
with the highest capacity to two-lane undivided roadways with the lowest capacity. The roadway
categories are summarized as follows:

·     Freeways are limited-access and high speed travel ways included in the state and federal
      highway systems. Their purpose is to carry regional through-traffic. Access is provided by
      interchanges with typical spacing of one mile or greater. No local access is provided to adjacent
      land uses.

·     Arterial roadways are major streets that primarily serve through-traffic and provide access to
      abutting properties as a secondary function. Arterials are generally designed with two to six
      travel lanes and their major intersections are signalized. This roadway type is divided into two
      categories: principal and minor arterials. Principal arterials are typically four-or-more lane
      roadways and serve both local and regional through-traffic. Minor arterials are typically two-to-
      four lane streets that service local and commute traffic.

·     Collector roadways are streets that provide access and traffic circulation within residential and
      non-residential (e.g., commercial and industrial) areas. Collector roadways connect local streets
      to arterials and are typically designed with two through travel lanes (i.e., one through travel lane
      in each direction) that may accommodate on-street parking. They may also provide access to
      abutting properties.

·     Local roadways distribute traffic within a neighborhood, or similar adjacent neighborhoods, and
      are not intended for use as a through-street or a link between higher capacity facilities such as
      collector or arterial roadways. Local streets are fronted by residential uses and do not typically
      serve commercial uses.

4.4        Roadway Descriptions
A brief description of the important roadways in the project site vicinity is provided in the following
paragraphs.

Sierra Madre Boulevard is a north-south oriented roadway near the project site and borders the site
to the west. Sierra Madre Boulevard is classified as a Principal Arterial in the City's General Plan
Mobility Element (November 2004). Sierra Madre Boulevard is also designated as a multimodal
corridor in the City's General Plan Mobility Element. Two through travel lanes are provided in each
direction on Sierra Madre Boulevard in the project vicinity. Both exclusive left-turn and right-turn
lanes are provided in each direction at the signalized intersection with Colorado Boulevard and
exclusive left-turn lanes are provided in both directions at the Del Mar Boulevard intersection.
Sierra Madre Boulevard is posted for a speed limit of 35 miles per hour in the project vicinity. Class
II bicycle lanes and sharrows are striped along both sides of Sierra Madre Boulevard near the project
site. In addition, it is noted that parking is prohibited along Sierra Madre Boulevard adjacent to the
project during school days from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. It is recommended that this parking
restriction be rescinded should the proposed project be approved by the City of Pasadena.

                                                 - 22 -
Altadena Drive is a north-south oriented roadway that is located east of the project site. Altadena
Drive is classified as a Minor Arterial in the City's General Plan Mobility Element (November
2004). Altadena Drive is also designated as a multimodal corridor in the City's General Plan
Mobility Element. One through travel lane is provided in each direction on Altadena Drive in the
project vicinity. Exclusive left-turn lanes are provided in each direction at the Colorado Boulevard
intersection. Altadena Drive is posted for a speed limit of 30 miles per hour in the project vicinity.

Colorado Boulevard is an east-west roadway that is located north of the project site. Colorado
Boulevard is classified as a Principal Arterial in the City's General Plan Mobility Element
(November 2004). Colorado Boulevard is also designated as a multi-modal corridor in the City's
General Plan Mobility Element. Two through travel lanes are provided in each direction on Colorado
Boulevard in the project vicinity. Exclusive left-turn and right-turn lanes are provided in each
direction at both signalized intersections near the project site (i.e., at both Sierra Madre Boulevard
and Altadena Drive). Colorado Boulevard is posted for a speed limit of 30 miles per hour in the
project vicinity.

Oswego Street is a discontinuous east-west oriented roadway that borders the project site to the
north. One through travel lane is provided in each direction in the project study area. There is no
posted speed limit on Oswego Street near the project site, thus it is assumed to be a prima facie
speed limit of 25 miles per hour.

Del Mar Boulevard is an east-west oriented roadway that borders the project site to the south. Del
Mar Boulevard is classified as a Minor Arterial in the City's General Plan Mobility Element
(November 2004). Del Mar Boulevard is also designated as a multi-modal corridor in the City's
General Plan Mobility Element. Two through travel lanes are provided in each direction on Del Mar
Boulevard in the project vicinity. Exclusive left-turn lanes are provided in each direction at the
signalized intersections near the project site (i.e., at Sierra Madre Boulevard and Altadena Drive).
Del Mar Boulevard is posted for a speed limit of 35 miles per hour in the project vicinity.
Additionally, Del Mar Boulevard is posted as a bicycle route (Class III Enhanced Bike Route) along
both sides of Sierra Madre Boulevard near the project site.

4.5        Existing Public Bus Transit Service
Public bus transit service within the project study area is currently provided by Metro, Foothill
Transit Service, and Pasadena Area Rapid Transit Service. A summary of the existing transit
service, including the transit route, destinations and peak hour headways is presented in Table 4­1.
The existing public transit routes in the proposed project site vicinity are illustrated in Figure 4­2.

4.6        Light Rail Transit Services
The Metro Gold Line is a light rail transit line that runs east-west from East Pasadena to the
Pasadena Civic Center area and north-south from the Pasadena Civic Center area to Union Station in
Downtown Los Angeles. The Gold Line travels within the median of the Foothill (I-210) Freeway
and in Metro right-of-way between Raymond Avenue and Arroyo Parkway in the project vicinity.
The Gold Line Light Rail system provides six stations in the City of Pasadena: 1) Sierra Madre Villa
station, 2) Allen Avenue station, 3) Lake Avenue station, 4) Memorial Park station, 5) Del Mar
station, and 6) Fillmore Street station. The Allen Avenue and Sierra Madre stations are located
approximately one and one-half miles from the project site. The Sierra Madre station serves as a
transportation hub that connects travelers to local and regional transit services provided by Pasadena
ARTS, Foothill Transit, Metro, and others.

Planning is underway for the Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension project. 6 The Foothill Extension
currently is planned to traverse 24-miles through 11 cities located east of Pasadena. Each of the 11
cities along the corridor has station sites under study. Each light rail car can carry 215 people
(sitting and standing). The Metro Gold Line will be able to accommodate three-car trains. It is
projected that trains will stop at stations every 10 minutes during rush hour and every 20 minutes
during off-peak hours. Metro will integrate the Foothill Extension into existing Metro Rail service
and oversee operation of the line once construction is complete. A trip from Montclair to Downtown
Pasadena would take a little over 40 minutes; to Los Angeles would take approximately 75 minutes.
The Gold Line Foothill Extension will connect historic downtowns revitalizing the established
communities along the corridor; four historic depots are slated for renovation and incorporation into
future stations. The Foothill Extension has received the backing of all 11-corridor cities issuing City
Council resolutions of support.

5.0        TRAFFIC COUNTS
5.1        Manual Intersection Traffic Counts
New manual counts of vehicular turning movements were conducted at each of the six study
intersections during the weekday morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) commuter periods to determine
the peak hour traffic volumes. The manual counts were conducted by a traffic count subconsultant,
City Traffic Counters, at the six study intersections from 7:00 to 9:00 AM to determine the AM peak
commuter hour, and from 4:00 to 6:00 PM to determine the PM peak commuter hour. Traffic
volumes at the study intersections show the morning and afternoon peak periods typically associated
with peak commuter hours in the metropolitan area.

The existing weekday AM and PM peak commuter period manual counts of turning vehicles at the
study intersections are summarized in Table 5-1. The existing traffic volumes at the study
intersections during the weekday AM and PM peak commuter hours are shown in Figures 5-1 and
5-2, respectively. Summary data worksheets of the manual traffic counts of the study intersections
are contained in Appendix B.

5.2        Automatic 24-Hour Machine Traffic Counts
Automatic 24-hour machine traffic counts of the three study street segments were conducted by a
traffic subconsultant, The Traffic Solution. The existing 24-hour average daily traffic (ADT)
volumes at the study street segments are presented in Figure 5-3. Copies of the current 24-hour
machine traffic counts for the study street segment locations also are contained in Appendix B.

6.0        CUMULATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
The forecast of future pre-project conditions was prepared in accordance with procedures outlined in
Section 15130 of the CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, the CEQA Guidelines provides two options
for developing the future traffic volume forecast:

           "(A) A list of past, present, and probable future projects producing related or
           cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside the control of the
           [lead] agency, or

           (B) A summary of projections contained in an adopted general plan or related
           planning document, or in a prior environmental document which has been adopted or
           certified, which described or evaluated regional or areawide conditions contributing
           to the cumulative impact. Any such planning document shall be referenced and made
           available to the public at a location specified by the lead agency."

Accordingly, the traffic analysis provides a highly conservative estimate of future pre-project traffic
volumes as it incorporates both the "A" and "B" options outlined in the CEQA Guidelines for
purposes of developing the forecast.

6.1        Cumulative Growth
A forecast of on-street traffic conditions prior to occupancy of the proposed project was prepared by
incorporating the potential trips associated with other known development projects (related projects)
in the area. With this information, the potential impact of the proposed project can be evaluated
within the context of the cumulative impact of all ongoing developments. The list of related projects
was based on information on file at the City of Pasadena Departments of Planning and
Transportation, as well as recently accepted traffic impact analysis reports prepared for projects in
the vicinity of the proposed South Sierra Madre Townhomes project site. The list of related projects
in the project site area is presented in Table 6-1. The location of the related projects is shown in
Figure 6-1. The list of related projects was submitted to City of Pasadena Department of
Transportation staff for review and acceptance.

Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the related projects were calculated using rates
provided in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation manual 7, or obtained
from recent traffic studies prepared for development projects located in the vicinity of the proposed
project. The related projects respective traffic generation for the AM and PM peak hours, as well as
on a daily basis for a typical weekday, is summarized in Table 6-1. The anticipated distribution of
the related projects traffic volumes to the study intersections during the AM and PM peak hours is
displayed in Figures 6-2 and 6-3, respectively.

6.2        Ambient Traffic Growth
In order to account for area-wide regional growth not included in this analysis, the existing traffic
volumes were increased at an annual rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) to the year 2013 (i.e.,
the anticipated year of project build-out). The ambient growth factor was based on general traffic
growth factors provided in the 2004 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (the
"CMP manual") and determined in consultation with PasDOT staff. It is noted that based on review
of the general traffic growth factors provided in the CMP manual for the San Gabriel Valley area, it
is anticipated that the existing traffic volumes are expected to increase at an annual rate of less than
1.0% per year between the years 2005 and 2025. Thus, application of this annual growth factor
allows for a conservative, worst case forecast of future traffic volumes in the area. Further, it is
noted that the CMP manual's traffic growth rate is intended to anticipate future traffic generated by
development projects in the project vicinity. Thus, the inclusion in this traffic analysis of both a
forecast of traffic generated by known related projects plus the use of an ambient growth traffic
factor based on CMP traffic model data results in a conservative estimate of future traffic volumes at
the study intersections.

7.0        TRAFFIC FORECASTING METHODOLOGY
In order to estimate the traffic impact characteristics of the South Sierra Madre Townhomes project,
a multi-step process has been utilized. The first step is trip generation, which estimates the total
arriving and departing traffic volumes on a peak hour and daily basis. The traffic generation
potential is forecast by applying the appropriate vehicle trip generation equations or rates to the
project development tabulation.

The second step of the forecasting process is trip distribution, which identifies the origins and
destinations of inbound and outbound project traffic volumes. These origins and destinations are
typically based on demographics and existing/anticipated travel patterns in the study area.

The third step is traffic assignment, which involves the allocation of project traffic to study area
streets and intersections. Traffic assignment is typically based on minimization of travel time, which
may or may not involve the shortest route, depending on prevailing operating conditions and travel
speeds. Traffic distribution patterns are indicated by general percentage orientation, while traffic
assignment allocates specific volume forecasts to individual roadway links and intersection turning
movements throughout the study area.

With the forecasting process complete and project traffic assignments developed, the impact of the
proposed project is isolated by comparing operational (i.e., Levels of Service) conditions at the
selected key intersections using expected future traffic volumes with and without forecast project
traffic. The need for site-specific and/or cumulative local area traffic improvements can then be
evaluated and the significance of the project's impacts identified.

7.1        Project Traffic Generation
Traffic generation is expressed in vehicle trip ends, defined as one-way vehicular movements, either
entering or exiting the generating land use. Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the
proposed project were estimated using generation equations and/or rates provided in the ITE Trip
Generation, 8th Edition publication. Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the proposed
project were based upon rates per number of dwelling units for the multi-family residential land use
for each of the three separate project parcels.            ITE Land Use Code 230 (Residential
Condominium/Townhouse) trip generation average rates were used to forecast the traffic volumes
expected to be generated by the multi-family residential land use.

The trip generation rates and forecast of the vehicular trips anticipated to be generated by the
proposed project are presented in Table 7-1. The project trip generation forecast was submitted for
review and acceptance by PasDOT staff. As summarized in Table 7-1, the proposed project is
expected to generate a total of 27 vehicle trips (4 inbound trips and 23 outbound trips) during the
AM peak hour. During the PM peak hour, the proposed project is expected to generate a total of 32
vehicle trips (21 inbound trips and 11outbound trips). Over a 24-hour period, the proposed project is
forecast to generate a total of 349 daily trip ends during a typical weekday (approximately 175
inbound trips and 175 outbound trips).

7.2        Project Trip Distribution and Assignment
Project traffic volumes both entering and exiting the site have been distributed and assigned to the
adjacent street system based on the following considerations:

      ·    The site's proximity to major traffic corridors (i.e., Sierra Madre Boulevard, Altadena Drive,
           Colorado Boulevard, Del Mar Boulevard, etc.);

      ·    Expected localized traffic flow patterns based on adjacent roadway channelization and
           presence of traffic signals;

      ·    Existing intersection traffic volumes;

      ·    Existing site parcel access ingress/egress schemes;

      ·    Ingress/egress scheme planned for the proposed project; and

      ·    Input from PasDOT staff.

The general, directional traffic distribution patterns for the proposed project are presented in Figures
7-1, 7-2 and 7-3 for project Sites I, II and III, respectively. The forecast AM and PM peak hour
project traffic volumes at the study intersections associated with the proposed project are presented
in Figures 7-4 and 7-5, respectively. The traffic volume assignments presented in Figures 7-4 and
7-5 reflect the traffic distribution characteristics shown in Figures 7-1, 7-2 and 7-3 and the project
traffic generation forecast presented in Table 7-1.

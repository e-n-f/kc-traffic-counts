I.   INTRODUCTION

            This report documents the findings of a traffic study conducted by Austin,
     Tsutsumi & Associates, Inc. (ATA) to evaluate the potential traffic impacts resulting from
     the proposed development of Honuaula (formally known as Wailea 670) in Wailea.
     Honuaula will be comprised of mixed uses, residential areas, neighborhood commercial
     areas, parks, bikeways, walkways and with an 18-hole golf course.

     A.     Location

                     Honuaula is situated on approximately 670 acres of land southeast of the
            Wailea     Resort   on    Maui,   which   is   more   specifically   identified   as
            TMK: (2) 2-1-008:056 and 071.          Neighboring communities include Maui
            Meadows to the north, Makena Resort to the southwest, and Wailea Resort to
            the west. Access to Honuaula is provided via the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike
            Drive intersection to the north and via Kaukahi Drive to the west. Figure 1 shows
            the location of Honuaula.

     B.     Project Description

                     The original plan for Honuaula included more than 2,000 new single-
            family and multi-family residential units, two (2) 18-hole golf courses and a large
            commercial district.     Honuaula has since been scaled down and modified.
            Honuaula currently proposes 1,150 new single-family and multi-family residential
            units (including 450 workforce affordable homes in compliance with Chapter 2.96
     of the Maui County Code), an 18-hole private homeowner golf course and up to
     100,000 square feet of commercial and office space.

            For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that Honuaula will be
     constructed in three (3) phases as shown in Table 1. With Phase I of the Project,
     anticipated completion in Year 2016, the east leg of the Piilani Highway/Wailea
     Ike Drive intersection (forming a "tee"-intersection, with Piilani Highway being the
     stem of the tee) will be constructed and Kaukahi Street will be extended into the
     Project. Since Kaukahi Street is a private street, it is planned to be gated within
     the Project site to address the concerns of current owners along Kaukahi Street.
     With Phase II of the Project, anticipated completion in Year 2018, Piilani Highway
     will be extended beyond Kaukahi Street, forming the south leg of the Piilani
     Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection. Figure 2 shows the conceptual site plan
     for the Honuaula land uses.

C.   Study Methodology

     This study will address the following:

     1.     Existing traffic operating conditions at key intersections within the study
            area.

     2.     Traffic Projections for Base Year 2016, 2018, and 2022 (without the
            project) including traffic generated by an annual defacto growth rate,
            consistent with the Maui Travel Demand Forecasting Model, and other
            known developments in the vicinity of the Project. These other known
            developments in consideration are projects that are currently under
            construction as well as known new/future developments that are expected
            to affect traffic demand and operations within the study area.

     3.     Identification of potential traffic conditions for the Base Year 2016, 2018,
            and 2022.

     4.     Trip generation and traffic conditions for the proposed Project.

     5.     Determination of the impact of Project-generated traffic.

     6.     Recommendations for roadway improvements or other mitigative
            measures, as appropriate, to reduce or eliminate the adverse impacts
            resulting from traffic generated by the Project.

II.   EXISTING CONDITIONS

      A.   Roadway System

                   The following are brief descriptions of the existing roadway network in the
           vicinity of the Project:

           Piilani Highway - is generally a four-lane, undivided, north/south State arterial
           highway providing access to Kihei and Wailea from areas north of Kihei. Piilani
           Highway narrows to a two-lane highway at its intersection with Kilohana
           Drive/Mapu Place until its terminus at Wailea Ike Drive. Piilani Highway begins
           at its intersection with South/North Kihei Road and ends at its intersection with
           Wailea Ike Drive, with provisions to extend the highway further south. Left-turn
           storage lanes are generally provided at major intersections on Piilani Highway.
           The posted speed limit on Piilani Highway is generally 40 miles per hour (mph).
           The speed limit on Piilani Highway is 45 mph in the northbound direction from
           Wailea Ike Drive to Kilohana Drive; the southbound speed limit on this segment
           decreases from 45 mph to 25 mph as it approaches Wailea Ike Drive.

           South Kihei Road - is an undivided, north/south County collector roadway that is
           generally parallel to Piilani Highway. South Kihei Road is a two-lane roadway in
           the vicinity of the study area.       South Kihei Road provides local access to
           shopping centers and visitor accommodations along the Kihei coastline. The
           posted speed limit on South Kihei Road is generally 20 mph in the study area.

           Kilohana Drive - is a two-lane, undivided, east/west roadway that connects South
           Kihei Road with Piilani Highway, intersecting Piilani Highway across Mapu Place,
           which provides the north access to Maui Meadows residential subdivision. The
           posted speed limit on Kilohana Drive is 25 mph.

           Mapu Place ­ is a two-lane, undivided, east/west roadway that provides one (1)
           of two (2) access points from Piilani Highway, to Maui Meadows residential
           subdivision. The posted speed limit on Mapu Place is 25 mph.

           Wailea Alanui Drive - is a four-lane, divided, north/south collector roadway
           between Kaukahi Street to the south and Okolani Drive to the north. North of
           Okolani Drive, Wailea Alanui Drive narrows to a two-lane, undivided, north/south
           County collector road to its intersection with Kilohana Drive.       South of its



                                           -6-
intersection with Kaukahi Street, Wailea Alanui Drive becomes Makena Alanui
Road. The segment of Wailea Alanui Drive between Wailea Ike Drive and Kaukahi
Street has a rolling profile and a meandering alignment. The segment of Wailea
Alanui Drive north of Wailea Ike Drive has a less pronounced rolling profile and
meandering alignment. The posted speed limit on Wailea Alanui Drive is 30 mph.

Okolani Drive - is a four-lane, divided, east/west roadway between South Kihei
Road and Wailea Alanui Drive. Okolani Drive narrows to a two-lane undivided
roadway east of Wailea Alanui Drive to its intersection with Piilani Highway directly
across of Mikioi Place. The posted speed limit on Okolani Drive is 30 mph.

Mikioi Place ­ is a two-lane, undivided, east/west roadway that provides the
southern access point from Piilani Highway, across Okolani Drive, to the Maui
Meadows residential subdivision. The posted speed limit on Mikioi Place is 25 mph.

Wailea Ike Drive - is a four-lane, divided, east/west County collector roadway that
narrows to a two-lane roadway just before its connection to Piilani Highway. Wailea
Ike Drive is the main entrance to the Wailea Resort and connects Piilani Highway
with Wailea Alanui Drive. Its vertical alignment is a relatively steep grade with a
posted speed limit of 30 mph. Wailea Ike Drive, from its intersection with Wailea
Ekolu Place to Wailea Alanui Drive, has a major drainage channel in its median
area.

Kalai Waa Street - is a two-lane, undivided, north/south roadway between
Kaukahi Street and Wailea Ike Drive. Stop signs are provided at its terminus with
Wailea Ike Drive and at its terminus at Kaukauhi Street.

Kaukahi Street ­ is a two-lane, undivided, east/west roadway between Wailea
Alanui Drive/Makena Alanui Road and Kalai Waa Street.               Kaukahi Street
intersects Wailea Alanui Drive/Makena Alanui Road on the west end and
terminates at the Wailea Resort property line on the east end.          The Project
proposes to extend Kaukahi Street to intersect with the extended Piilani Highway.
However, because Kaukahi Street is a private road, the extension of Kaukahi
Street into the Project is planned to be a gated access to address the concerns
of current owners along Kaukahi Street.

        Figure 3 shows the existing roadway system and lane configuration at the
study intersections.

B.   Existing Traffic Volumes

            Based on the proximity to the project site, the following intersections are
     studied:

            x   Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place (Signalized)

            x   Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place (Unsignalized)

            x   Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street (Unsignalized)

            x   Wailea Alanui Drive/Wailea Ike Drive (Signalized)

            x   Wailea Alanui Drive/Okolani Drive/South Kihei Road (Unsignalized)

            x   South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive (Unsignalized)

            x   Wailea Alanui Drive/Grand Wailea Resort (Signalized)

            x   Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street (Unsignalized)

            The AM and PM Peak hour turning movement data utilized in this report
     were collected on Tuesday June 24, 2008 and Wednesday June 25, 2008.
     Based on traffic count data, the peak hours of traffic were determined to be from
     7:00 AM to 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the weekdays. The traffic count
     data is provided in Appendix A.

            Traffic count data was taken when public schools were in summer break
     session for the following reasons:

            x       Wailea is a resort community and caters to visitor traffic which is
                    highest during the summer months.

            x       The nearest school to Wailea is located more than a mile north of
                    the Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive intersection.

            x       Existing peak hour volumes entering and exiting the Maui
                    Meadows Subdivision (Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place
                    and Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place intersections)
                    during the AM peak hour of traffic were similar to the existing
                    volumes obtained from the Traffic Impact Analysis Report for
                    Wailea Resort 2005 Update (count data taken in October 2004).
                    This comparison shows that for Maui Meadows, a local residential


                                       -9-
                    subdivision with no recent expansion, traffic volumes are similar
                    during the summer break session than the school session. The
                    PM peak hour of traffic occurred after school hours.

C.   Existing Traffic Conditions Analysis and Observations

            Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to describe the
     conditions of traffic flow at intersections, with values ranging from free-flow
     conditions at LOS A to congested conditions at LOS F. The Highway Capacity
     Manual ­ Special Report 209 (HCM), dated 2000, methods for calculating
     volume to capacity ratios, delays and corresponding Levels of Service were
     utilized in this study. LOS definitions for signalized intersections are provided in
     Appendix B.

     Methodology

            Analysis for the study intersections were performed using the traffic
     analysis software Synchro, which is able to prepare Highway Capacity Manual
     (HCM) reports.    The reports contain quantitative delay results, as based on
     intersection lane geometry, signal timing, and hourly traffic volume. In addition,
     Synchro is able to estimate the queue lengths at the study intersections.

     Field Observations

            The general paths vehicles utilize when traveling between areas north of
     Wailea and south in Makena are Piilani Highway, Wailea Ike Drive, and Wailea
     Alanui Drive. Therefore, at the Wailea Alanui Drive/Wailea Ike Drive intersection,
     the turning movement volumes are the higher volumes.

            During the AM peak hour of traffic, queuing was observed on the
     northbound through movement at the Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place
     intersection, however, all vehicles were able to clear the intersection within
     one (1) signal cycle length. During the PM peak hour of traffic, the northbound
     and southbound through movement volumes were noticeably higher than the AM
     Peak hour of traffic at the Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place
     intersection. The through traffic at this intersection was higher, but experienced
     little delay, with vehicles clearing the intersection within one (1) signal cycle
     length. The eastbound and westbound volumes at the Piilani Highway/Okolani



                                     -10-
Drive/Mikioi Place intersection remained fairly low with no more than three (3)
vehicles queued at the stop sign.

           In its present configuration, the Wailea Alanui Drive/Wailea Ike Drive
intersection operates well. The westbound left-turn queue varied from three (3)
to eight (8) cars per cycle length, however all vehicles were able to clear the
intersection during one (1) cycle length.

           All other study intersections appeared to operate sufficiently during both
the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Results of Intersection Analysis

           The analysis and observations described below are based on prevailing
conditions during the time at which the data was collected.              Hereinafter,
observations that are expressed as ongoing and current shall represent the
conditions that prevailed at the time at which the data was collected.

Intersections along Piilani Highway

           At the signalized intersection of Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu
Place, all movements operate overall at LOS D or better during the AM and PM
peak hours of traffic.

           At the unsignalized intersection of Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi
Place, the eastbound left-turn movement operates at LOS F during the PM peak
hour of traffic due to minimal gaps in the northbound and southbound
approaches. However, as a condition of the Kai Malu Development, a traffic
signal is proposed at the Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place intersection
to alleviate the eastbound left-turn delay. All other movements operate at LOS D
or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street Intersection

           The unsignalized intersection of Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street
experience an overall LOS C or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.

South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive Intersection

           The signalized intersection of South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive
experience an overall LOS B or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.

Intersections Along Wailea Alanui Drive

           All intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive operate at an overall LOS C or
better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

III.   BASE YEAR TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WITHOUT THE PROJECT

              The Year 2016 was selected as the Base Year to reflect the completion year of
       Phase I of the Project. Year 2018 and 2022 will also be studied to reflect the completion
       years of Phase II and Phase III, respectively of the Project. Base Year 2016, 2018, and
       2022 projections were formulated by applying a defacto growth rate and trips generated
       by other known developments, as described in the following sections.

       A.     Defacto Growth Rate

                     The growth rate of an area is the percentage by which an area will grow
              over a period of time. The Maui Travel Demand Forecasting Model was utilized
              to determine a defacto growth rate in the vicinity of the Project. In addition to
              Honuaula, Wailea Resort and Makena Resort are the main projects proposed in
              the Wailea/Makena area.       Therefore, the data in the Maui Travel Demand
              Forecasting Model was adjusted to project growth excluding these three (3)
              projects.   The results from the Maui Travel Demand Forecasting Model ­
              consistent with the 2030 Maui County General Plan - show a defacto growth rate
              of approximately 0.5 percent per year. Therefore, a defacto growth rate of 4.0
              percent for Year 2016, 5.1 percent for Year 2018, and 7.2 percent for Year 2022
              were applied to existing traffic volumes.

       B.     Traffic Forecasts for Other Known Developments

                      Other known developments that are known to be constructed or
              completed by Years 2016, 2018, and 2022 are further described below. Peak
              hour vehicular trips were estimated by applying appropriate trip generation rates
              from the Trip Generation, 8th Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation
              Engineers (ITE) and the Resort Residential Trip Generation Rate Development
              prepared by Parsons Brinkerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc. dated October 2, 2006
              as accepted by the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation (SDOT),
              (herein after referred to as "PB resort rate"). Appendix F shows the PB resort
              rate report. Vehicular trips generated from the other known developments were
              distributed to the roadway network based on distribution obtained from the Maui
              Travel Demand Forecasting Model.

                      Wailea Resort is generally comprised of the area west of Piilani
              Highway, north of Makena Road, east of Makena Ala Nui Road and the Pacific


                                              -14-
Ocean, and south of Kilohana Drive. Currently, Wailea Resort has constructed
most of its parcels. Table 2 shows the proposed development on the remaining
parcels of Wailea Resort.

        Within the Wailea Resort, some individual parcels were under
construction at the time of data collection or existing developments that are
proposed to be renovated.

       x      Under construction were the Kai Malu (MF-8) and Wailea
              Gateway Projects. Since traffic studies for these Wailea Resort
              developments were completed, trip generation volumes and
              distribution were obtained from the Traffic Impact Analysis Report
              for Wailea MF-8, dated May 13, 2004 and the Traffic Impact
              Analysis Report for Wailea Gateway, dated March 6, 2006, both
              prepared by Phillip Rowell and Associates.       Since the data
              collection efforts, both projects have been completed. Kai Malu
              (MF-8) is located south of Okolani Drive, east of Wailea Alanui
              Drive, and west of Piilani Highway, with access from Okolani
              Drive. Kai Malu (MF-8) proposed to construct 153 multi-family
              units. Wailea Gateway is located on the northwest corner of the
              Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection with access from
              Wailea Ike Drive. Wailea Gateway proposed to construct 32,000
              square feet of commercial space to be utilized by businesses,
              restaurants, and retail shops.

       x      The existing Grand Wailea Resort proposes to renovate two (2)
              existing restaurants, construct 310 additional hotel rooms, an
              additional bar, a new cultural center and garden, and additional
              parking spaces by Year 2016.       The Grand Wailea Resort is
              located south of the Shops at Wailea, east of the Pacific Ocean
              and west of Wailea Ala Nui Drive. Trip generation volumes and
              distribution were obtained from the Traffic Impact Report for the
              Grand Wailea Resort Renovation, dated January 2009, prepared
              by Wilson Okamoto Corporation.




                              -15-
              x       The 1 Resort & Residences (formerly Renaissance Wailea Resort)
                      proposes to redevelop the existing 349 hotel units to provide 290
                      resort hotel units and 40 residential condominium/townhouse units
                      by Year 2016. The 1 Resort & Residences is located north of
                      Wailea Elua, east of the Pacific Ocean, south of Wailea Ekahi,
                      and west of Wailea Alanui Drive. At the time of data collection,
                      the former Renaissance Wailea Resort parcel remained vacant
                      and therefore, trip generation volumes for the proposed
                      redevelopment were obtained from the Traffic Impact Report 1
                      Resort & Residences, Wailea, dated March 2009, prepared by
                      Wilson Okamoto Corporation.       The existing Wailea Blue Golf
                      Course, currently located off of Kaukahi Street, proposes to
                      relocate the existing clubhouse, and provide approximately 8,000
                      square feet of commercial space, 10,000 square feet of office
                      space, and 5,000 square feet of restaurant space by Year 2016.
                      The   Wailea   Blue    Golf   Course   clubhouse   and   additional
                      commercial/office/restaurant space is proposed to be located at
                      the southeast corner of the Wailea Alanui Drive/Wailea Ike Drive
                      intersection, near the existing Matteo's Restaurant.

              Makena Resort is comprised of the area east of the Pacific Ocean and south
     of Makena Road. Table 3 shows the proposed development for the Makena Resort.

              Table 4 shows the Other Known Developments Land Uses and Trip
     Generation and Table 5 shows the Other Known Developments Trip Generation
     Rates.       For the other known developments which utilized The ITE Trip
     Generation, 8th Edition and PB report rates.

C.   Planned Roadway Projects

              As a condition for the development of the Kai Malu Project (MF-8), Piilani
     Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place intersection will be signalized and the
     eastbound approach will be restriped to provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a
     shared through/right-turn lane. At the time of the data collection effort, the Kai
     Malu Project was under construction.           Since then construction has been
     completed and some of the units have recently been occupied.

D.   Base Year 2016 WITHOUT Project Traffic and Analysis

            Since it is a condition of the Kai Malu Project (MF-8), it is assumed that
     the signalization and re-striping of the Pi'ilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place
     intersection will be completed by Year 2016. The following are conditions of the
     study intersections due to the defacto growth rate and other known
     developments.

     Intersections along Piilani Highway (WITHOUT Project)

            With a defacto growth rate of 0.5 percent per year along Piilani Highway
     and the other known developments in the vicinity of the Project, the Piilani
     Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place signalized intersection some individual
     movements will operate at LOS F and over capacity conditions during the AM
     and PM peak hours of traffic. Currently, Piilani Highway is a four-lane roadway
     and narrows to a two-lane roadway at the Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu
     Place intersection where it remains as a two-lane roadway to its terminus at
     Wailea Ike Drive.

            The Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place, as a signalized
     intersection, southbound through movement will operate at LOS F and over
     capacity conditions during the AM peak hour of traffic. During the PM peak hour
     of traffic, the northbound through and southbound left-turn movements will
     operate at LOS F and over capacity conditions.

            Therefore, with over capacity conditions at the Piilani Highway/Kilohana
     Drive/Mapu Place intersection and movements at the Piilani Highway/Okolani
     Drive/Mikioi Place intersection, it is recommended to widen Piilani Highway
     between its intersection with Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place and Wailea Ike Drive to
     a four-lane roadway. The following are the recommended lane configurations at
     each of the intersections:

            Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place (signalized)

            x        Northbound and Southbound Approaches: Provide an exclusive
                     left-turn lane (with a protected left-turn signal phase), two (2)
                     exclusive through lanes, and an exclusive right-turn lane.




                                     -21-
           x      Eastbound Approach: Remain as an exclusive left-turn lane and a
                  shared through/right-turn lane (with a permissive signal phase).

           x      Westbound Approach:         Provide an exclusive left-turn lane, an
                  exclusive through lane and an exclusive right-turn lane (with a
                  permissive signal phase).

           Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place (signalized)

           x      Northbound and Southbound Approaches: Provide an exclusive
                  left-turn lane (with a protected left-turn signal phase), an exclusive
                  through lane, and a shared through/right-turn lane.

           x      Eastbound Approach: Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a
                  shared through/right-turn lane (with a permissive signal phase).

           x      Westbound Approach: Remain as a shared left-turn/through/right-
                  turn lane (with a permissive signal phase).

           Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive (unsignalized)

           x      Southbound Approach:        Remain as an exclusive free right-turn
                  lane.

           x      Eastbound Approach: Remain as an exclusive free left-turn lane.

           x      Northbound and Westbound Approaches will only be constructed
                  with the Project.

           With the widening of Piilani Highway, the intersections of Piilani
Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place and Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi
Place will operate at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.

Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street Intersection (WITHOUT Project)

           It is not uncommon, however, for a low volume side street, such as Kalai
Waa Street, to experience long delays especially when trying to cross or execute
a left-turn onto a high volume roadway, such as Wailea Ike Drive. At the Wailea
Ike Drive/IKalai Waa Street intersection, it is projected that approximately 10 and
15 vehicles will utilize the northbound left-turn movement during the AM and PM



                                      -22-
peak hours of traffic, respectively. Due to low traffic volumes on Kalai Waa
Street, the projected traffic volumes at this intersection do not warrant the
installation of a traffic signal system as presented in the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM).

South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive Intersection (WITHOUT Project)

       The South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive intersection will continue to operate
at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive (WITHOUT Project)

       During the PM peak hour of traffic, at the Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi
Street intersection, the eastbound shared left-turn/through/right-turn movement
will operate at LOS F and the westbound left-turn/through movement will operate
at LOS E due to minimal gaps in the northbound and southbound approaches.
The eastbound left-turn movement is projected to generate approximately 90
vehicles, however, providing an eastbound left-turn lane will improve the
movement by approximately 15 seconds (operate at LOS F) and allow the
though and right-turn vehicles to proceed through the intersection (operate at
LOS C). Therefore, it is recommended that the eastbound approach be restriped
to provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane, and for
alignment purposes, it is recommended that the westbound approach be
restriped to also provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through/right-
turn lane. The westbound left-turn will operate at LOS E, however it is projected
to generate a relatively low volume (approximately 30 vehicles).           All other
movements operate at LOS C or better PM peak hour of traffic. During the AM
peak hours of traffic, all movements operate at LOS C or better.

       The projected traffic volumes at the Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street
intersection do not warrant the installation of a traffic signal system.

       All other intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive will continue to operate
at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

       Figure 5 shows the traffic volumes and LOS at the study intersections for
Base Year 2016. Appendix D shows the level-of-service summary table at all the
study intersections and Appendix E shows the recommended lane configuration.

E.   Base Year 2018 WITHOUT Project Traffic and Analysis

                It is assumed that mitigative measures recommended in Base Year 2016
     have been completed by Base Year 2018.

     Intersections along Piilani Highway (WITHOUT Project)

                With improvements as recommended for Base Year 2016 completed,
     intersections along Piilani Highway will operate at LOS D or better during the AM
     and PM peak hours of traffic.

     Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street Intersection (WITHOUT Project)

                The Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street intersection northbound left-turn
     movement will operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour of traffic and will
     continue to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour of traffic. With projected
     volumes at the intersection do not warrant a traffic signal system.        All other
     movements will operate at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
     traffic.

     South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive Intersection (WITHOUT Project)

                The South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive intersection will continue to operate
     at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

     Intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive (WITHOUT Project)

                The northbound left-turn movement at the all-way stop-controlled
     intersection of Wailea Alanui Drive/Okolani Drive will operate at LOS E during the
     PM peak hour of traffic. Much of the traffic traveling north on Wailea Alanui Drive
     headed toward Kihei utilize the northbound left-turn (220 and 485 vehicles during
     the AM and PM peak hours of traffic, respectively) at the Wailea Alanui
     Drive/Okolani Drive intersection to access South Kihei Road. In the opposing
     direction, much of the traffic utilizes the eastbound left-turn (485 and 435 vehicles
     during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic, respectively) at the Wailea Alanui
     Drive/Okolani Drive coming from South Kihei Road to access Wailea Alanui
     Drive. To mitigate the LOS E conditions on the northbound left-turn movement, a
     roundabout was studied since the projected volumes do not warrant a traffic
     signal system. However, in accordance with the Roundabouts: An Informational
     Guide, published by The U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway


                                       -25-
     Administration, dated June 2000, "It is generally not desirable to locate
     roundabouts in locations where grades through the intersection are greater than
     four percent." This is recommended due to the difficulty of vehicles entering the
     roundabout on the downslope to slow down or stop. In the opposing direction, on
     the upslope, there may be limited sight distance for vehicles entering the
     roundabout. Therefore, a roundabout is not recommended at the Wailea Alanui
     Drive/Okolani Drive intersection where the existing slopes along Okolani Drive
     appear to be greater than 4.0 percent. Projected volumes at the intersection do
     not warrant a traffic signal system.    During the AM peak hour of traffic, all
     movements will continue to operate at LOS B or better.

            The Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersection eastbound left-turn
     movement will continue to operate at LOS F and the westbound left-turn
     movement will continue to operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour of traffic.
     With projected volumes at the intersection do not warrant a traffic signal system.
     During the AM peak hour of traffic, all movements will continue to operate at
     LOS C or better.

            All other intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive will continue to operate
     at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

            Figure 6 shows the traffic volumes and LOS at the study intersections for
     Base Year 2018. Appendix D shows the level-of-service table summary at all the
     study intersections and Appendix E shows the recommended lane configuration.

F.   Base Year 2022 WITHOUT Project Traffic and Analysis

            It is assumed that mitigative measures recommended in Base Year 2016
     have been completed by Base Year 2022.

     Intersections along Piilani Highway (WITHOUT Project)

            With improvements as recommended for Base Year 2016 completed,
     intersections along Piilani Highway will continue to operate at LOS D or better
     during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street Intersection (WITHOUT Project)

           The Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street intersection northbound left-turn
movement will continue to operate at LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours
of traffic. Additionally, during the PM peak hour of traffic the northbound right-
turn movement will operate at LOS E.             With projected volumes at both
intersections most likely will not warrant a traffic signal. All other movements will
continue to operate at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.

South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive Intersection (WITHOUT Project)

           The South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive intersection will continue to operate
at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive (WITHOUT Project)

           The northbound left-turn movement at the intersection of Wailea Alanui
Drive/Okolani Drive will operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour of traffic.
However, as mentioned in Section III.E., a roundabout is not recommended at
this intersection due to the slope along Okolani Drive. Projected volumes at this
intersection most likely will not warrant a traffic signal system. During the AM
peak hour of traffic, all movements will continue to operate at LOS B or better.

           The Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersection eastbound left-turn
and the westbound left-turn movements will operate at LOS F during the PM
peak hour of traffic. Projected volumes at the intersection most likely will not
warrant a traffic signal. During the AM peak hour of traffic, all movements will
operate at LOS D or better.

           All other intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive will continue to operate
at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

IV.   FUTURE YEAR TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WITH THE PROJECT

      A.   Trip Generation

                  Trip generation estimates the total number of trips produced by a given
           land use. Trip rates contained in the nationally published ITE, Trip Generation,
           8th Edition were used to estimate the number of trips generated by the Project.
           Additionally, the Resort Residential Trip Generation Rate Development prepared
           by Parsons Brinkerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc. dated October 2, 2006 as
           accepted by the SDOT, is utilized to estimate the number of trips generated by
           resort residential units. Table 5, as shown in the previous section, shows these
           trip generation rates and Table 6 shows the number of peak hour trips that are
           expected to be generated by the Project.

                  An estimation of the percentage of internal trip capture was obtained from
           the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, Second Edition, which was determined to be
           approximately 15 percent. The internal trip capture was only applied to the PM
           peak hour of traffic since commercial areas are typically closed during the AM
           peak hour of traffic. The 15 percent internal trip capture rate was applied to the
           number of residential trips and the result was applied to the commercial trips, in
           order to match the number of internal trips between the residential areas and
           commercial areas. Internal trips are assumed within the Project.

      B.   Trip Distribution

                  The Project generated trips were distributed based on the distribution
           utilized by the Maui Travel Demand Forecasting Model; Figure 8 shows the
           general distribution. Phase I of the Project proposes to construct the east leg of
           the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection and Kaukahi Street will be
           extended into the Project. Since Kaukahi Street is a private street, it is planned
           to be gated within the Project site to address concerns of current owners along
           the street. Phase II of the Project proposes to extend Piilani Highway, forming
           the south leg of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection. Figures 9, 10,
           and 11 show the Project generated traffic volumes during Year 2016, 2018, and
           2022, respectively.

C.   Zoning Conditions for the Project

            In accordance with the Zoning Conditions for the Project, the following
     roadway improvements will be implemented prior to construction or occupancy of
     the Project:

            x       Piilani Highway will be widened to four (4) lanes as recommended
                    in Section III.D. of this report. The widening of Piilani Highway is
                    required without the Project.

            x       As stated in the Zoning Conditions for the Project, "Modify the
                    Wailea Alanui Drive/Wailea Ike Drive intersection to add a
                    signalized double right-turn movement from northbound to
                    eastbound turning traffic and provide two left-turn lanes for
                    southbound traffic from Wailea Ike Drive prior to occupancy of the
                    first unit in Kihei-Makena Project District 9."

            Additionally, when warranted, a traffic signal system will be constructed at
     the Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street and Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street
     intersections in conjunction with the Makena Resort. Therefore, traffic signal
     warrants at the Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street and Wailea Alanui
     Drive/Kaukahi Drive/Kaukahi Street intersections will be studied.

D.   Future Year 2016 WITH Project Traffic and Analysis

            Traffic generated by the Project was added to the Base Year 2016 traffic
     volumes to estimate traffic volumes for Future Year 2016 with the Project. The
     analysis of traffic conditions for Future Year 2016 assumed the mitigative
     measures recommended for Base Year 2016 and the Zoning Conditions for the
     Project to be implemented.

     Intersections along Piilani Highway (WITH Project)

            With completion of Phase I of the Project, the east leg of the Piilani
     Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection will be constructed forming a "tee"-
     intersection, with Piilani Highway being the stem of the tee.       Due to a high
     southbound right-turn (1210 and 880 during the AM and PM peak hour of traffic,
     respectively) and eastbound left-turn (525 and 1305 during the AM and PM peak




                                     -36-
hour of traffic, respectively) the following is recommended with Piilani
Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection reconstructed to a "tee"-intersection:

        x       With projected traffic volumes, the intersection will warrant a traffic
                signal.

        x       Southbound approach: Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and an
                exclusive right-turn lane. Allow the Piilani Highway southbound
                right-turn to be a free turning movement by providing an exclusive
                westbound receiving lane on Wailea Ike Drive.

        x       Eastbound approach:          Provide two (2) exclusive left-turn lanes
                (with a protected left-turn signal phase) and an exclusive through
                lane.

        x       Westbound Approach: Provide an exclusive through lane, and an
                exclusive right-turn lane.

        With    the     lane   configuration    recommended      above,   the   Piilani
Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection will operate at LOS D or better during the
AM and PM peak hours of traffic. All other intersections will continue to operate
at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street Intersection (WITH Project)

        The Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street intersection northbound left-turn
movement will operate at LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours traffic. With
projected volumes at both intersections most likely will not warrant a traffic signal.
All other movements will operate at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak
hours of traffic.

South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive Intersection (WITH Project)

        The South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive intersection will continue to operate
at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive (WITH Project)

        The Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersection eastbound left-turn
and the westbound left-turn movement will operate at LOS F during the PM peak
hour of traffic. With projected volumes at the intersections most likely will not


                                  -37-
     warrant a traffic signal. All other movements will operate at LOS D or better
     during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

            All other intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive will continue to operate
     at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

            Figure 12 shows the traffic volumes and LOS at the study intersections
     for Future Year 2016. Appendix D shows the level-of-service table summary at
     all the study intersections and Appendix E shows the recommended lane
     configuration.

E.   Future Year 2018 WITH Project Traffic and Analysis

            Traffic generated by the Project was added to the Base Year 2018 traffic
     volumes to estimate traffic volumes for Future Year 2018 with the Project. The
     analysis of traffic conditions for Future Year 2018 assumed the mitigative
     measures recommended for Base Year 2016 and Future Year 2016 to be
     implemented.

     Intersections along Piilani Highway (WITH Project)

            The eastbound left-turn and southbound left-turn movements at the Piilani
     Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place intersection will operate at LOS E during the
     PM peak hour of traffic.

            Providing additional capacity for the eastbound left-turn movement
     (double eastbound left-turn lanes) requires improvements to provide an exclusive
     westbound left-turn lane and a protected left-turn signal phase (8-phase signal
     cycle) for the eastbound and westbound left-turn movements. However, even if
     an additional signal phase is introduced, the eastbound approach will still
     continue to operate at LOS E conditions. If a split phase (6-signal phase) is
     provided for the eastbound and westbound approaches, the eastbound approach
     will still continue to operate at LOS E conditions.

       The Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place intersection serves as
the northern access point to the Maui Meadows subdivision which is comprised
of single-family homes. As mentioned above, during the PM peak hour of traffic,
the southbound left-turn movement will operate at LOS E conditions.             By
providing double southbound left-turn lanes, all movements will operate at LOS D
or better during the PM peak hour of traffic. However, the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) recommends that double left-turn lanes be provided where the
left-turn volume exceeds 300 vehicles during the peak hour, and at the Piilani
Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place intersection, only approximately 50 vehicles
and 160 vehicles will utilize the southbound left-turn movement during the AM
and PM peak hour of traffic, respectively. Additionally, some vehicles may opt to
utilize the southbound left-turn at Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place
intersection, rather than Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place, since it will
also be signalized. Therefore, additional improvements are not recommended at
the Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place intersection.

       With completion of Phase II of the Project, Piilani Highway will be
extended to intersect with an extension of Kaukahi Street, forming a cross
intersection at its intersection with Wailea Ike Drive. With Piilani Highway/Wailea
Ike Drive intersection reconstructed to a cross-intersection, the following are the
recommended lane configuration and is in accordance with the Zoning
Conditions for the Project:

       x       Northbound Approach: Provide an exclusive left-turn lane (with a
               protected left-turn signal phase), two (2) exclusive through lanes,
               and an exclusive right-turn lane.

       x       Southbound Approaches: Provide two (2) exclusive left-turn lanes
               (with a protected left-turn signal phase), an exclusive through
               lane, and an exclusive right-turn lane. Also, it is recommended
               that the Piilani Highway southbound right-turn to be a free turning
               movement by providing an exclusive westbound receiving lane on
               Wailea Ike Drive.      It is projected that a higher volume will be
               utilizing the southbound left-turn movement (175 vehicles and 290
               vehicles during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic, respectively)



                               -40-
                as opposed to the southbound through movement (70 vehicles
                and 130 vehicles during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic,
                respectively) during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic due to
                the layout of the Honuaula Project.         Additionally, the HCM
                recommends that double left-turn lanes be provided where the
                left-turn volume exceeds 300 vehicles during the peak hour

        x       Eastbound Approach: Provide two (2) exclusive left-turn lanes
                (with a protected left-turn signal phase) and a shared
                through/right-turn lane.

        x       Westbound Approach: Provide an exclusive left-turn lane (with a
                protected left-turn signal phase), an exclusive through lane, and
                an exclusive right-turn lane.

        The Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive intersection will continue to operate at
LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street Intersection

        The Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street intersection northbound left-turn
movement will continue to operate at LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours
of traffic. The northbound right-turn will operate at LOS E during the PM peak
hour of traffic. With projected volumes at the intersection most likely will not
warrant a traffic signal.

South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive Intersection

        The South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive intersection will continue to operate
at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive

        The northbound left-turn movement at the intersection of Wailea Alanui
Drive/Okolani Drive will continue to operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour of
traffic. Projected volumes at this intersection most likely will not warrant a traffic
signal system. During the AM peak hour of traffic, all movements will continue to
operate at LOS D or better.




                                 -41-
                The Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersection eastbound left-turn
     and the westbound left-turn movements will continue to operate at LOS F during
     the PM peak hour of traffic. With projected volumes at the intersection most
     likely will not warrant a traffic signal. During the AM peak hour of traffic, all other
     movements will continue to operate at LOS D or better.

                All other intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive will continue to operate
     at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

                Figure 13 shows the traffic volumes and LOS at the study intersections
     for Future Year 2018 with mitigative measures. Appendix D shows the level-of-
     service table summary at all the study intersections and Appendix E shows the
     recommended lane configuration.

F.   Future Year 2022 WITH Project Traffic and Analysis

                Traffic generated by the Project was added to the Base Year 2022 traffic
     volumes to estimate traffic volumes for Future Year 2022 with the Project. The
     analysis of traffic conditions for Future Year 2022 assumed the mitigative
     measures recommended for Base Year 2016 and Future Year 2016 and 2018 to
     be implemented.

     Intersections along Piilani Highway

                The eastbound left-turn and southbound left-turn movements at the Piilani
     Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place intersection will continue to operate at
     LOS E during the PM peak hour of traffic. However, all other movements will
     continue to operate at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
     traffic.

                All other intersections along Piilani Highway will continue to operate at
     LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street Intersection

       The Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street intersection northbound left-turn
movement will continue to operate at LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours
of traffic. The northbound right-turn will continue to operate at LOS F during the
PM peak hour of traffic. However, projected volumes at the intersection most
likely will not warrant a traffic signal.   All other movements will continue to
operate at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive Intersection

       The South Kihei Road/Kilohana Drive intersection will continue to operate
at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

Intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive

       The northbound left-turn movement at the intersection of Wailea Alanui
Drive/Okolani Drive will continue to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour of
traffic. Projected volumes at this intersection most likely will not warrant a traffic
signal system. During the AM peak hour of traffic, all movements will continue to
operate at LOS D or better.

       The Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersection westbound left-turn
and eastbound left-turn will continue to operate at LOS F and the eastbound
through/right-turn will operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour of traffic. The
eastbound left-turn movement will operate at LOS F during the AM peak hour of
traffic. With projected traffic volumes, a traffic signal system will most likely be
warranted.    However, due to the current condition of the Makena Resort
development it is unknown if the land use assumed in Section III.B. is accurate,
therefore, a traffic signal warrant should be evaluated in the future as projects
become developed. As a signalized intersection, the intersection will operate at
LOS C or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

       All other intersections along Wailea Alanui Drive will continue to operate
at LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

       Figure 14 shows the traffic volumes and LOS at the study intersections
for Future Year with mitigative measures. Appendix D shows the level-of-service

G.   Modern Roundabouts

            Due to zoning conditions and Special Management Area conditions, the
     Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place, Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi
     Place, Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersections are conditioned to be
     signalized intersections. Additionally, at the Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street
     and Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersections are conditioned to be
     signalized intersections when warranted.     Therefore, the option of modern
     roundabouts is not studied.

V.   PROPOSED PROJECT ACCESSES ALONG PIILANI HIGHWAY EXTENSION

     A.   Project Access Description

                 Phase II of the Project proposes to extend Piilani Highway further south.
          The Piilani Highway Extension will narrow to a two-lane roadway south of its
          intersection with Wailea Ike Drive and provide five (5) intersections to the Project.
          The following are the proposed intersections along the Piilani Highway
          Extension:

                 Piilani Highway Extension/North Access intersection is the first access
          south of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection. The Piilani Highway
          Extension/North Access forms a "tee"-intersection, with the North Access being
          the stem of the tee.     The North Access is proposed to provide access to
          approximately 80 multi-family units located on the west side of the Piilani
          Highway Extension.

                 Piilani Highway Extension/Fire Station Driveway Intersection is the
          second access south of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection. The
          Piilani Highway Extension/Fire Station Driveway forms a "tee"-intersection, with
          the Fire Station Driveway being the stem of the tee. The Fire Station Driveway is
          proposed to provide access to the Fire Station only which is proposed to be
          located on the east side of the Piilani Highway Extension.

                 Piilani Highway Extension/Mid Access Intersection is the third access
          south of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection. The Piilani Highway
          Extension/Mid Access forms a "tee"-intersection, with the Mid Access being the
          stem of the tee. The Mid Access is proposed to provide access to approximately
          68 multi-family units located on the west side of the Piilani Highway Extension.

                 Piilani Highway Extension/Kaukahi Drive Extension Intersection is the
          fourth access south of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection. The
          Piilani Highway Extension/Kaukahi Drive Extension forms a "tee"-intersection,
          with Kaukahi Drive Extension being the stem of the tee. The Kaukahi Street
          Extension will connect to the existing Kaukahi Street and provide access to the
          Project's residential units and golf clubhouse area.




                                          -47-
            Piilani Highway Extension/South Access Intersection is the fifth and last
     access south of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection. The Piilani
     Highway Extension/South Access forms a cross intersection. To the east, the
     South Access will provide a roadway connection, within the Project's
     development, to the east leg of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection.
     To the west, the South Access will provide access to the Project's multi-family
     housing, and golf clubhouse. To the south, the Piilani Highway Extension will
     provide a roadway connection within the Project's development along connecting
     to the east leg of the Piilani Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection.

B.   Traffic Volumes and Analyses

            The Project access intersections along the Piilani Highway Extension
     were studied as unsignalized intersections and as a roundabout. Table 7 shows
     the LOS at the Project access intersections as a single lane roundabout and with
     the following lane configuration as unsignalized intersections:

            Piilani Highway Extension/North Access Intersection:

            x   Northbound Approach:        Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and an
                exclusive through lane.

            x   Southbound Approach: Provide a shared through/right-turn lane.

            x   Eastbound Approach: Provide a shared left-turn/right-turn lane. The
                eastbound approach shall be the stop-controlled approach.

            Piilani Highway Extension/Fire Station Driveway Intersection:

            x   Northbound Approach: Provide a shared through/right-turn lane.

            x   Southbound Approach: Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and an
                exclusive through lane.

            x   Westbound Approach: Provide a shared left-turn/right-turn lane. The
                westbound approach shall be the stop-controlled approach.

            Piilani Highway Extension/Mid Access Intersection:

            x   Northbound Approach:        Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and an
                exclusive through lane.



                                     -48-
       x   Southbound Approach: Provide a shared through/right-turn lane.

       x   Eastbound Approach: Provide a shared left-turn/right-turn lane. The
           eastbound approach shall be the stop-controlled approach.

       Piilani Highway Extension/Kaukahi Drive Extension:

       x   Northbound Approach:         Provide an exclusive left-turn lane and an
           exclusive through lane.

       x   Southbound Approach: Provide a shared through/right-turn lane.

       x   Eastbound Approach: Provide a shared left-turn/right-turn lane. The
           eastbound approach shall be the stop-controlled approach.

       Piilani Highway Extension/South Access:

       x   Northbound and Southbound Approach: Provide an exclusive left-turn
           lane and a shared through/right-turn lane.

       x   Eastbound and Westbound Approach:              Provide a shared left-
           turn/through/right-turn lane. The westbound approach shall be the
           stop-controlled approach.

       Analyses show that the intersections along the Piilani Highway Extension
will operate at LOS A during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic as an
unsignalized intersection and a single lane roundabout.          Since the Piilani
Highway Extension is a long stretch of roadway - with no traffic signals warranted
at the proposed intersections - there is a possibility that speeding could occur.
Therefore, single lane roundabouts were studied which are traffic calming
devices, reducing the potential speeding of vehicles.

       Figure 15 shows the Future Year 2022 proposed Project intersection
traffic volumes and level of service.

VI.   SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

      A.   Summary

           Existing Conditions

                  The general paths vehicles utilize when traveling between areas north of
           Wailea and south in Makena are Piilani Highway, Wailea Ike Drive, and Wailea
           Alanui Drive.

                  The eastbound approach at the Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi
           Place intersections experience minimal gaps between vehicles traveling along
           Piilani Highway. However, as a condition for the development of the Kai Malu
           Project (MF-8) within the Wailea Resort, the Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi
           Place intersection will be signalized and the eastbound approach will be restriped
           to provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane.

           Base Years WITHOUT the Project

                  For the purpose of this study Phase I of the Project is anticipated to be
           completed by Year 2016, Phase II by Year 2018, and Phase III by Year 2022.
           Therefore, traffic volume projections were determined for these three years
           (without project) using an annual vehicular de facto growth rate of 0.5 percent
           and including other known developments such as the Wailea Resort and Makena
           Resort projects.    The improvements to Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi
           Place, as a result of the Kai Mahi Project (MF-8), are assumed to be completed
           by Year 2016.

                  Analysis of Base Year 2016 traffic conditions without the project indicates
           that some individual movements at the Piilani Highway/Kilohana Drive/Mapu
           Place intersection will operate at LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours of
           traffic. Widening of Piilani Highway to four-lanes between its intersection with
           Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place and Wailea Ike Drive is required, even without the
           Project.   With widening of Piilani Highway, the Piilani Highway/Kilohana
           Drive/Mapu Place and Piilani Highway/Okolani Drive/Mikioi Place intersection will
           operate at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
           Base Year 2018 and 2022 traffic conditions at intersections along Piilani Highway




                                           -52-
will continue to operate at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak
hours of traffic.

         With Base Year 2016, 2018, and 2022 projected traffic volumes, the stop-
controlled approaches at the unsignalized intersections of Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai
Waa Street and Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Drive will operate at LOS E or
LOS F.     However, in accordance with the HCM, projected volumes at both
intersections do not warrant a traffic signal system.       A roundabout was not
studied at these intersections since Zoning Conditions for the Project require a
traffic signal system when warranted.

         The northbound left-turn movement at the all-way stop-controlled
intersection of Wailea Alanui Drive/Okolani Drive will operate at LOS E with Base
Year 2018 projected traffic volumes and LOS F with Base Year 2022 projected
traffic volumes.    A roundabout was studied at this intersection, however, in
accordance with the U.S. Federal Highway Administration roundabout guidelines,
a roundabout is not desirable where grades are greater than 4 percent.              It
appears that Okolani Drive is greater than 4 percent near its intersection with
Wailea Alanui Drive.

Future Years WITH the Project

         Phase I (anticipated completion Year 2016) of the Project will include
approximately 26,000 square feet of Office Space, 74,000 square feet of
Commercial Space, 75 Multi-Family Affordable units, 158 Multi-Family Market
Rate Units, 40 Multi-Family Townhouse units, and 127 Single-Family units.
Additionally, Phase I will also include construction of the east leg of the Piilani
Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection, forming a "tee"-intersection and the
extension of Kaukahi Street to intersect with the Piilani Highway Extension. Since
Kaukahi Street is a private road, it is planned to be a gated access within the
Project to address the concerns of current owners along Kaukahi Street.

         Phase II (anticipated completion Year 2018) of the Project will include
approximately 200 Multi-Family Affordable units, 30 Multi-Family Market Rate
Units, 60 Multi-Family Townhouse units, and 110 Single-Family units.
Additionally, Phase II will also include the construction the south leg of the Piilani




                                 -53-
Highway/Wailea Ike Drive intersection, forming a cross intersection and extend
Piilani Highway to intersect with the Kaukahi Street Extension.

        Phase III of the Project will include approximately 175 Multi-Family
Affordable units, 12 Multi-Family Market Rate Units, and 163 Single-Family units.

        The following are Zoning Conditions for the Project and will be completed
prior to construction or occupancy of the Project:

        x       Widen Piilani Highway between Kilohana Drive/Mapu Place and
                Wailea Ike Drive to four (4) lanes; which is required for sufficient
                capacity without the Project.

        x       The Wailea Alanui Drive/Wailea Ike Drive intersection shall be
                modified to provide a second northbound right-turn lane (signalize
                the movement) and a second westbound left-turn lane.

        x       The Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street and Wailea Alanui
                Drive/Kaukahi Street intersections shall be signalized when
                warranted. Therefore, signal warrants are studied at the Wailea
                Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street and Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi
                Street intersections.

        With Future Year 2022 projected traffic volumes, the northbound left-turn
movement at the unsignalized intersection of Wailea Ike Drive/Kalai Waa Street
will continue to operate at LOS F. However, in accordance with the HCM, a
traffic signal at the intersection is not warranted.

        At the Wailea Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersection, with Future Year
2022 projected traffic volumes, a traffic signal system will most likely be
warranted.    However, due to the current condition of the Makena Resort
development it is unknown if the land use assumed in Section III.B. is accurate,
therefore, a traffic signal warrant should be evaluated in the future as projects
become developed. As a signalized intersection, the intersection will operate at
LOS C or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.




                                 -54-
     Proposed Project Accesses Along Piilani Highway Extension

              The five (5) proposed accesses along the Piilani Highway Extension were
     studied as single lanes roundabout and unsignalized intersection. During the AM
     and PM peak hours of traffic, both the single lane roundabout and unsignalized
     intersection will operate at LOS A at all proposed project intersections along
     Piilani Highway Extension. Due to the length of Piilani Highway Extension ­ as
     well as no traffic signals warranted ­ there is a possibility that speeding could
     occur.       Therefore, single lane roundabouts were studied which are traffic
     calming, reducing the potential speeding of vehicles.

            study as projects become developed and signalize the Wailea
            Alanui Drive/Kaukahi Street intersection, if warranted.

3.   Proposed Project Intersections

            It is recommended that the Piilani Highway Extension be a two (2)
     lane roadway south of its intersection with Wailea Ike Drive.         It is
     recommended that the proposed project intersections be single lane
     roundabouts or unsignalized intersections.        The following are the
     recommended lane configurations at the proposed Project accesses as
     unsignalized intersections:

LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA FOR UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS (HCM 2000)

The level of service criteria for unsignalized intersections is defined as the average total delay,
in seconds per vehicle. As used here, total delay is defined as the total elapsed time from when
a vehicle stops at the end of the queue until the vehicle departs from the stop line; this time
includes the time required for the vehicle to travel from the last-in-queue position to the first-in-
queue position. While the criteria for level of service for TWSC and AWSC intersections are the
same, procedures to calculate the average total delay may differ.

               Level of Service Criteria for Two-Way Stop-Controlled Intersections

                              Level of           Average Total Delay

                                 C                  >15 and 25
                                 D                  >25 and 35
                                 E                  >35 and 50

LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA FOR ALL-WAY STOP-CONTROLLED INTERSECTIONS
(HCM 2000)

The all-way stop-controlled intersection is a special type of unsignalized intersection, where
vehicles on all approaches are required to stop before entering the intersection. Generally, the
sequence of entry into the intersection is on a "first come, first serve basis", according to order
of arrival at the intersection. In theory, if vehicles arrive at two or more of the approaches at the
same time, then according the "rules of the road", the vehicle to the right is allowed to proceed
first. However, it has been observed that two-lane AWSC intersections often operate on a virtual
2-phase patterns, where North-South streams alternate right-of-way with East-West streams.
Multilane AWSC intersections generally operate in 4 phases, where each approach will take up
a single phase. The table, shown below, identifies the Level of Service and corresponding
average stopped delay for all-way stop-controlled intersections.

                                 C                  >15 and 25
                                 D                  >25 and 35
                                 E                  >35 and 50

LEVEL OF SERVICE FOR SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS (HCM 2000)

Level of service for signalized intersections is directly related to delay values and is assigned on
that basis. Level of Service is a measure of the acceptability of delay values to motorists at a
given intersection. The criteria are given in table below.

                       Level-of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections

                             Level of Service      Vehicle (sec./veh.)
                                    A                   < 10.0
                                    B               >10.0 and  20.0
                                    C               >20.0 and  35.0
                                    D               >35.0 and  55.0
                                    E               >55.0 and  80.0
                                    F                   > 80.0


Delay is a complex measure, and is dependent on a number of variables, including the quality of
progression, the cycle length, the green ratio, and the v/c ratio for the lane group or approach in
question.

RESORT RESIDENTIAL TRIP GENERATION RATE DEVELOPMENT
               Honua'ula-Wailea Resort-Makena Resort Development Traffic Study




    Resort Residential Trip Generation Rate Development

Background
At the request of the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT), data were
collected to determine if the resort residential trip generation rates documented in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers publication entitled, Trip Generation, 7th Edition, were
appropriate for the Wailea-Makena area on Maui.
Three major developers within the Wailea-Makena area agreed to participate in this effort
and directed their traffic consultants to develop a methodology to collected trip data and use
these data to determine alternative resort residential trip generation rates. The three traffic
consultants involved were Austin-Tsutsumi and Associates, Parsons Brinckerhoff, and
Phillip Rowell Associates.
This write-up summarizes the methodology used to develop alternative resort residential trip
generation rates based on observation of existing resort residential development located in
Wailea Resort.



Methodology
In developing a methodology to research resort residential trip generation rates for the
Wailea-Makena area, it was decided to collect data separately for single-family and for multi-
family resort residential development. All developments used for data collection were
located in the Wailea Resort area.
Effort was made to determine which multi-family resort residential developments allow units
to be rented out as opposed to units that only allow owners and selected guests to occupy
the units. Effort was also made through discussions with the Wailea Homeowners
Association and Wailea Resort to determine which resort residential developments were
primarily absentee owner units that are occupied only a few months out of the year and
resident owner units that area occupied all year long.
Based on these criteria, 24-hour traffic data were collected at the accesses to resort
residential between July 7, 2006 and July 17, 2006. Using the categories of resort
residential identified in the previous paragraph, data were collected at the developments
summarized in Table 1.

Note: Fairway Villas data were available because of technical difficulties and the sale of Makena Resort.


All of the multi-family developments were used to calculate trip generation rates for resort
multi-family development. This probably makes this rate conservatively high, since it
contains both developments that allow short-term rentals and those that do not.
For the single-family developments, only Wailea Golf Estates and Pualani Estates were
used to calculate trip generation rates. There were units in Wailea Golf Vistas and Wailea
Highlands that were still under construction and it was judged that construction traffic would
create an atypical trip generation rate. Wailea Kialoa was not used because it was
determined through discussions with Wailea Resort and the Wailea Homeowners
Association that Wailea Kialoa contained mostly residents that live in Wailea year round.
This is not the typical resort residential situation in which owners usually occupy the unit
only part time.
The resulting trip generation rates for resort single-family and resort multi-family are shown
in Table 2.

Table 3 compares the calculated resort residential rates with the ITE published rates. As
shown, the calculated resort residential rates for the single-family resort residential are
about twice as high as the ITE published rates, and the calculated resort residential rates for
the multi-family resort residential are slightly higher for than those published by ITE.

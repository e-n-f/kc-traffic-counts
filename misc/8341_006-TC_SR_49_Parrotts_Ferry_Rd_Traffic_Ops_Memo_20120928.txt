              Parrotts Ferry Road from SR 49 to Sawmill Flat Road - Precise Alignment Plan
RE:
              Traffic Forecasting & Operations Analysis


INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Parrotts Ferry Road (County Road E18) is a generally two-lane, north-south County roadway that
connects the unincorporated community of Columbia to the north with the State Route 49 (SR 49)
highway corridor and the City of Sonora to the south. The total length of this "gateway" corridor to
Columbia, is approximately 1.5 miles for the segment extending north from SR 49 to the Columbia
historic district.
In order to provide adequate capacities to accommodate future traffic demands as well as to alleviate
existing traffic operational/safety concerns, improvements to the Parrotts Ferry Road corridor are
necessary. As part of the process of identifying ultimate improvements needed for the study corridor,
as well as to identify the right-of-way needs for the ultimate facility, the preparation of a conceptual
plan line study referred to as the "Precise Alignment Plan" is required in order to obtain consensus
on, and approval of, the ultimate improvements to the study corridor from Tuolumne County Board
of Supervisors, Tuolumne County Transportation Council (TCTC), Tuolumne County Community
Resources agency (CRA) and other affected local agencies and private stakeholders. Once a precise
alignment plan is officially adopted, then future adjacent development may be conditioned for
one/more of the following - 1) dedicate right-of-way, 2) construct frontage improvements as
necessary, and 3) not infringe on the reserved right-of-way for the adopted ultimate plan line cross-
sections. The study segment for the proposed Parrotts Ferry Road Precise Alignment Plan study
extends approximately 1,200 feet north from SR 49 intersection and through the Sawmill Flat Road
intersection. Appendix Exhibit 1 illustrates the project boundaries/limits.
Furthermore, the SR 49/Parrotts Ferry Road intersection (the "Pedro Wye"), which falls within
Caltrans right of way, and the adjacent intersection influence area, is currently in need of operational
safety improvements. Although this intersection was recently signalized by Caltrans, the westbound
SR 49 to northbound Parrotts Ferry Road direct connector "merge" area continues to represent a
safety concern from a sight distance and geometric standpoint. There also appears to be lingering
safety concerns for local residents using the private driveway directly connecting to the one-way
connector from SR 49 to northbound Parrotts Ferry Road. Vehicular tire tracking evidence suggests
that the drivers to/from the Union Hill Inn (Bed & Breakfast operation) are navigating off road across
the triangular "island" piece as a means to shorten their travel route in heading either east or
westbound along SR 49. Interim operational improvements are necessary at this intersection
consistent with the ultimate plan line for Parrotts Ferry Road as well as SR 49 corridor route concept
improvements. Recognizing that Caltrans right-of-way extends from the SR 49/Parrotts Ferry Road
intersection north through the merge area, Caltrans review and approval of the planning concepts and
design process is necessary. Given that the improvements will likely involve a Caltrans

Encroachment Permit process, preparation of a Permit Engineering and Evaluation Report (PEER) is
foreseen subsequently necessary for the interim project. Also note that the Columbia Community
Plan includes design recommendations for development along Parrotts Ferry Road including the
consideration of designating Parrotts Ferry Road, Sawmill Flat Road and SR 49 in the vicinity as a
Heritage Corridor and designating SR 49 in the vicinity as a Scenic Route. The Community Plan
recommends the construction of pedestrian facilities along Parrotts Ferry Road from the Pedro Wye
to the Columbia State Historic Park with transit facilities provided in key locations, as appropriate.
Bicycle and pedestrian facilities also are addressed along Parrotts Ferry Road in the Regional
Transportation Plan (e.g., Columbia College to Sonora via Sawmill Flat Road, Parrotts Ferry Road
and SR 49; Columbia to Sonora via Parrotts Ferry Road and SR 49). Gateway corridor
improvements are planned as part of the Columbia Gateway project that include installation of a
Gateway "monument" at the SR 49/Parrotts Ferry Road intersection serving as invitation to visit
Colombia community. Upon finalization of a "preferred" interim improvement concept for the SR
49/Parrotts Ferry Road intersection and formal project description to support a Transportation
Enhancement (TE) funding application, funds for implementation of the interim project will be
secured. Subsequently the interim project will be carried forward through the Caltrans PEER
process, from Conceptual Geometric Drawing (CGD) approval to 100% PS&E and construction.
At this time, this traffic evaluation focuses on the following conceptual alternatives to address
existing/future operational/capacity deficiencies on the study corridor:
   1. "No Build" conditions (no improvements to existing facility)
   2. Interim Operational Improvements - existing facility with intersection safety/operational
      improvements and Columbia Gateway improvement features only.
   3. Ultimate (2040) Capacity Improvements - four-lane divided arterial, with two-way-left-turn
      median lane, auxiliary turn lanes, bus stop, bike lanes, walkways, landscaping and Columbia
      Gateway features consistent with the RTP and RTIF.
Specifically, this memorandum includes the following elements:
     A discussion of current and historical traffic/transportation conditions within the study area.
     Existing conditions' traffic operational analysis for study intersections and roadway/highway
     segments.
     A traffic safety (i.e. accident data) analysis for existing study facilities.
     "Year 2015 with Interim Improvements" traffic operational analysis.
     A discussion of Year 2040 traffic volume forecasts and year 2040 traffic operational analysis
     both with and without the proposed ultimate project improvements.

CURRENT SETTING
ROADWAY FACILITIES
Parrotts Ferry Road (County Road E18) is generally a two-lane north-south County roadway that
connects the unincorporated community of Columbia to the north with the State Route 49 (SR 49)
highway corridor and the City of Sonora to the south. Parrotts Ferry Road study segment extends
approximately 1,200 feet north from SR 49 intersection and through the Sawmill Flat Road
intersection. Appendix Figure 1 illustrates the project location and vicinity map.
The study segment runs on rolling terrain with steep side slopes. The corridor is a designated truck
route and a public transit route. The Union Hill Road and Sawmill Flat Road intersections are both
currently stop-sign controlled for the side-street approach, however, the Sawmill Flat Road
intersection either currently warrants or anticipated to warrant traffic signal installation in the near-
term future. These intersections currently represent potential safety concerns due to both horizontal
and vertical sight distance limitations and right-of-way conflicts. Although current traffic operations

                                                                    Parrotts Ferry Road Corridor Improvements
                                                                    Traffic Forecasting and Operations Analysis


at the study intersections are mostly acceptable from a level of service (LOS) standpoint, the non-
standard existing roadway features pose a significant constraint on the Parrotts Ferry Road corridor's
ability to accommodate future traffic demands in a safe and efficient manner. Agency-approved (or
pending approval) retail commercial and multi-family residential development projects proposed on
the northwest quadrant of the SR 49/Parrotts Ferry Road intersection with planned access via Union
Hill Road, are anticipated to add traffic to the Parrotts Ferry Road study corridor in the near-term
future.
The Parrotts Ferry Road study segment between SR 49 and Sawmill Flat Road currently carries an
annual average daily traffic (AADT) of approximately 11,100 vehicles. The Tuolumne County
Regional Transportation Plan (2007 Update) has designated the functional classification of Parrotts
Ferry Road as a "two-lane major collector" (34' to 36' feet wide). Long-range regional travel
demand model forecasts indicate year 2040 (and beyond) traffic demands of approximately 18,000
vehicles per day for the study corridor. The operational capacity of a two-lane rural arterial at LOS
"D" threshold is limited to approximately 13,500 vehicles per day. Thus, to provide adequate
capacities to accommodate future traffic demands as well as to alleviate existing traffic
operational/safety concerns, improvements to the Parrotts Ferry Road corridor are necessary.
State Route 49 (SR 49) is a general north-south State highway serving the foothill counties. SR 49
connects between Oakhurst in Mariposa County to the south, and extends in a general northerly
direction connecting through Tuolumne County and several other foothill counties to terminate at
Sierra County to the north. Through Tuolumne County, SR 49 is generally a two-lane rural highway.
Through the study area, SR 49 connects between Angels Camp in Calaveras County, and the City of
Sonora. Based on Caltrans' 2011 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) count data publication, SR
49 currently carries an AADT of approximately 13,300 vehicles and seasonal peak month ADT of
15,200 vehicles on the segment east of Parrotts Ferry Road intersection and carries AADT of
approximately 5,050 vehicles and seasonal peak month ADT of 5,700 vehicles west of Parrotts Ferry
Road intersection. Caltrans' 2010 Truck traffic count data shows a daily total truck percentage of 6%
for the SR 49 segment through the study area.
Sawmill Flat Road is a generally two-lane County roadway which provides access to/from
Columbia College. Sawmill Flat Road intersects with Parrotts Ferry Road at a side-street stop
controlled T-intersection located approximately 1,200 feet north of SR 49.
Union Hill Road is a local road providing access to/from adjacent commercial/business uses, and
intersecting with Parrotts Ferry Road approximately 300 feet north of the SR 49 intersection.

BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
Within the study corridor segment, there are currently no sidewalks or bike lanes.

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
Traffic operations have been quantified through the determination of "Level of Service" (LOS). LOS
is a qualitative measure of traffic operating conditions, whereby a letter grade "A" through "F" is
assigned to an intersection or roadway segment, representing progressively worsening traffic
operations.
In this analysis, LOS have been calculated for all intersection control types using methods
documented in the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Publication Highway Capacity
Manual 2010 (HCM-2010). For signalized and all-way-stop-controlled (AWSC) intersections, the
intersection delays and LOS reported are the average values for the whole intersection. For two-
way-stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections, the "worst-case" movement delays and LOS are reported.
The delay-based HCM-2010 LOS criteria for different types of intersection control are outlined in

   that the lead agency consult with Caltrans to determine the appropriate target LOS."
The Draft Tuolumne County GP Circulation Element Implementation Program 2.A.h states that:
   "The minimum LOS standard for Minor Collectors, Major Collectors, Rural Arterials and Urban Streets
   shall be LOS D, unless an exception is made by the County. The minimum LOS standard for local and
   residential roads shall be LOS C. The minimum peak hour LOS standard for all intersections shall be LOS
   D."
Based on the above agency policies, LOS "D" has been generally used as the mi nimum acceptable
LOS standard for all facilities within the study corridor that fall within either County or Caltrans
right-of-way.
In this study, a general suburban "Peak Hour Factor" (PHF) of 0.92 (as recommended by HCM-
2010) was used in the study intersection analyses under all future analysis scenarios. For existing
conditions, field-observed PHF values were used. Based on a review of Caltrans truck counts for
year 2010, a heavy-vehicle percentage of 6% in the peak hour periods was applied to SR 49 and
Parrotts Ferry Road approaches through the study intersection, and a 2% peak-hour heavy-vehicle
percentage was used for all other roadway approaches. Synchro/SimTraffic 8 operational analysis
software was used to implement the HCM-2010 analysis procedures.
In order to determine whether "significance" should be associated with unsignalize d intersection
operating conditions, a supplemental traffic signal warrant analysis was also completed. The term
"signal warrants" refers to the list of established criteria used by Caltrans and other public agencies
to quantitatively justify or ascertain the need for installation of a traffic signal at an unsignalized
intersection location. Per latest Caltrans requirements, this study generally employs signal warrant
criteria presented in the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2012 ("California
MUTCD", last updated January 2012). The MUTCD signal warrant criteria are based upon several
factors including volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, location of school areas, frequency of
accidents, etc. This study evaluated California MUTCD based Peak-Hour-Volume-based Warrant 3
(Rural Areas). California MUTCD indicates "the satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or warrants
shall not in itself require the installation of a traffic control signal."

SAFETY ANALYSIS
Wood Rodgers reviewed TSAR traffic accident data records provided by Caltrans District 10 for the
available most recent three-year data period extending from December 31, 2007 through December
31, 2010, as well as accident data summaries forwarded by TCTC staff for the Parrotts Ferry Road
study corridor segment for the available most-recent data period (2008 through 2012). The data is
summarized in Table 3.

There were no "fatal" accidents reported within the study segments, however, up to eight (8) injury
accidents were reported on Parrotts Ferry Road study segment during the data period(s). A majority
of the accidents (10 out of 12) on SR 49 through the study area involved multi-vehicle collisions.
Out of the 12 accidents reported on Caltrans facilities, "failure to yield" was most commonly (six
accidents, or 50%) reported as the "primary collision factor".

EXISTING TRAFFIC COUNTS
Wood Rodgers conducted new AM peak hour intersection traffic counts at the SR 49/ Parrotts Ferry Road
intersection, and AM and PM peak hour intersection traffic counts at Parrotts Ferry Road/Sawmill Flat
Road intersection on Tuesday, August 7, 2012. These newly collected traffic counts were supplemented
with prior available SR 49/Parrotts Ferry Road intersection PM peak hour counts collected by County
staff on Tuesday, March 6, 2012 (as part of the ongoing RTP/GP Update process). For the Parrotts Ferry
Road/Sawmill Flat Road intersection, weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic counts at Parrotts Ferry
Road/Sawmill Flat Road intersection were also collected on Tuesday, September 11, 2012, when
Columbia College was in Fall session. Note that the peak hour traffic volumes at Parrotts Ferry
Road/Union Hill Road were estimated using actual traffic counts from the immediately adjacent
intersections. The Summer/Fall counts (August/September 2012) as well as Spring (March 2012) traffic
counts were reviewed and compiled to create annual average weekday AM and PM peak hour traffic
volume counts for the study intersections, as shown in Appendix Figure 2.

EXISTING C ONDITIONS' TRAFFIC O PERATIONS
Intersection traffic operations were quantified for the existing study area facilities under current year

YEAR 2015 TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
Per the current project schedule and discussions with the TCTC, it is understood that the interim
improvement project (safety and operational improvements and Columbia Gateway features) will
likely complete construction and be operational by/before year 2015. This study generally regards
year 2015 traffic forecasts as the "project opening day" traffic volume condition.
In order to project year 2015 traffic volumes, the traffic generated from the approved/pending
vicinity land development projects (such as the proposed 91,500 square-foot Union Hill Medical and
Bus Transfer Center development project located on the north-west quadrant of SR 49/Parrotts Ferry
Road intersection, and the proposed 80 multi-family dwelling unit residential development project
located on the northwest quadrant of the Parrotts Ferry Road/Union Hill Road intersection) were
incrementally added on top of existing (year 2012) traffic counts to derive "Year 2015" traffic
volumes, which were then used for evaluation of Year 2015 traffic operations with interim project
improvements in place. The approved/pending development projects' land use summaries and trip
generation estimates are summarized in Appendix Table 1.
The proposed interim improvements are illustrated in Appendix Exhibit 2, and include the following
basic elements:
       Safety/Operational improvements at the SR 49/Parrotts Ferry Road intersection, which include
       elimination of the westbound free-right turn connector and construction of a controlled
       westbound right-turn lane under signal control.
       Construction of a northbound left-turn pocket at the Union Hills Road/Parrotts Ferry Road
       intersection, with potential realignment of the Bread & Breakfast Inn access driveway to align
       across from the Union Hill Road approach.
       Separate traffic signal improvements at Parrotts Ferry Road/Sawmill Flat Road intersection.

INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Intersection traffic operations were quantified under Year 2015 traffic volumes, as shown in
Appendix Figure 2, with interim improvements in place. The results are summarized in Table 6.

As shown in Table 6, all study intersections are projected to operate at year 2015 AM and PM peak
hour LOS "C" or better conditions with the proposed interim project improvements in place. Note
that California MUTCD based traffic signal Peak Hour Volume warrant (rural areas) is projected to
be met at Parrotts Ferry Road/Union Hill Road intersection under year 2015 PM peak hour volumes,
however peak hour LOS operations are projected to be acceptable.

YEAR 2040 TRAFFIC FORECASTS
The evaluation of traffic operations over a 20-year planning/design horizon is typically necessary for
major transportation capacity improvement projects. Consistent with the planning horizon year for
the long-range traffic forecasts developed as part of the ongoing Tuolumne County Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP) Update process, year 2040 is regarded as the design year for the proposed
ultimate project improvements. Appendix Figure 2 shows the projected year 2040 traffic forecasts.

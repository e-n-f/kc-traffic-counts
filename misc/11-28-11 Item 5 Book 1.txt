Summary Title: California Av Streetscape Updates

Title: Approval of Negative Declaration, Adoption of Resolution to Metropolitan
Transportation Commission Accepting Grant Funding, Approval of a Capital
Improvements Program, and Ratification of a Contract with RBF Consulting for
the California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape Project

From: City Manager

Lead Department: Planning and Community Environment

Recommendation
Staff recommends that Council consider and approve each of the following items related to the
California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project, in the following order:

   1. Approve the Negative Declaration (Attachment B) for the project;
   2. Adopt the attached resolution (Attachment A) to authorize the Santa Clara Valley
      Transportation Authority (VTA) to submit an application for the California Avenue ­
      Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project to the Metropolitan Transportation
      Commission (MTC) and to commit local-match funding for the project;
   3. Establish a new Capital Improvement Program (CIP) project entitled California Avenue ­
      Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape Project; and
   4. Reaffirm the agreement with RBF Consulting for the design of the California Avenue ­
      Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project with funding from the CIP project.

The Planning and Transportation Commission also reviewed and recommends to Council
approval of the Negative Declaration and the establishment of the CIP project.

Executive Summary
The proposed California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project provides for
improvements along California Avenue between El Camino Real and the Park Boulevard Park
Plaza located adjacent to the California Avenue Caltrain Station. The project provides place-
making elements throughout the project including streetscape furniture, landscape
improvements, and enhanced bicycle parking; traffic calming treatments, including a four-lane
to two-lane modification, enhanced pedestrian crosswalks, and intersection bulb-out
treatments; and improvements to the Park Boulevard Park Plaza.

A recent Superior Court action found that the City's prior action was not timely, in that
compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (adoption of the Negative
Declaration) on February 14, 2011 should have preceded the adoption of Resolution No. 9118
on December 6, 2010. In response to the ruling, the City Council, on November 21, 2011,
rescinded prior approval of the Negative Declaration, adoption of the resolution to the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and establishment of a Capital Improvements
Program project. The item before Council is an opportunity to reconsider those approvals, as
well as ratification of the subsequent contract with RBF Consulting to provide design services
for the project.

Staff believes these approvals remain appropriate and that the adoption after Council
consideration will allow the City to continue to proceed to final design for the project, pursuant
to the MTC grant.

Background
Development of the California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project concept plan
was completed in the Fall of 2010 and includes place-making, traffic calming, and streetscape
improvements that support retail vitality and other economic benefits. In furthering the vision
of the Comprehensive Plan, the purpose of the project is to develop a "complete" roadway that
best utilizes available right-of-way of the street to:

   ·   Provide safe space for pedestrians and bicyclists along and crossing the street;
   ·   Maintain efficient vehicle movements while slowing vehicle speeds for safety;
   ·   Enhance the overall appearance of the street and adjacent non-vehicular space with
       trees and landscape, public art, seating areas for outside dining, benches, kiosks,
       signage, and bicycle racks;
   ·   Accommodate parking needs; and
   ·   Provide improvements at the Park Boulevard Park Plaza adjacent to the California
       Avenue Caltrain Station.

California Avenue has historically been a four-lane street. It originally provided access to Alma
Street but is now disconnected from that street by the Caltrain tracks, and is not likely to ever
be reconnected. As a result, California Avenue experiences a very low level of vehicular traffic.
The plan proposes a lane reduction to improve the pedestrian/bicycle experience along the
street and the connection between the existing land uses and the enhanced streetscape
elements. The lane reduction also allows existing on-street parking to be upgraded to current
parking design standards while expanding the availability of parking on the street.

Prior Approvals
On December 6, 2010, the City Council approved Resolution No. 9118 (included in Attachment
E) confirming acceptance of a grant from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)
to implement and provide matching funds for the $1.7 million California Avenue ­ Transit Hub
Corridor Streetscape project. On February 14, 2011, following a recommendation from the
Planning and Transportation Commission, the Council approved a Negative Declaration,

pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and established a CIP project for
the improvements. On July 25, 2011, the Council approved a contract with RBF Consulting to
prepare design options and details for the project prior to construction.

Litigation
The City's actions were challenged in Superior Court by petitioners Joy Ogawa, Terry Shuchat,
Jack Morton and Antonio's Nuthouse, Inc. The petitioners argued that the environmental
review was untimely and inadequate, that the City's Comprehensive Plan was violated, and that
State Open Meetings provisions were not followed. On October 7, 2011, a hearing regarding
the matter was conducted by the Honorable Patricia M. Lucas. An Order from the court was
filed on November 9, 2011, and the City received Notice on November 14, 2011 (Attachment
D).

The Court found that the City's compliance with CEQA (adoption of the Negative Declaration)
on February 14, 2011 should have preceded the adoption of Resolution No. 9118 on December
6, 2010. The Court did not find the CEQA analysis deficient and denied the petitioners' claims
regarding the Comprehensive Plan and the Open Meetings provisions. The remedy specified by
the Court (page 9) was "that the City must declare void that Resolution, as well as its later
February 14, 2011 approval of the Negative Declaration and CIP funding for the project, and
must reconsider those decisions after appropriate CEQA review." On November 21, 2011, the
City Council rescinded its approval of the resolution, environmental review, and establishment
of the CIP project.

The City Council report for the December 6, 2011 meeting and minutes are included as
Attachments F and G. The City Council report for the February 14, 2011 meeting and the
Council minutes are included as Attachments H and I. The Council report for the July 25, 2011
meeting is included as Attachment J.

Discussion
Staff requests that the City Council consider approval of: a) the Negative Declaration for the
project, b) a Resolution to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission confirming acceptance
of the grant, and c) the establishment of a Capital Improvements Program (CIP) project for the
improvements. Because the design contract was subsequently awarded based on the other
approvals, staff also requests that the Council reaffirm that award to RBF Consulting.

Negative Declaration
The City Council is being asked to consider the adequacy of the Negative Declaration
(Attachment B) prepared for the California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project.
The draft Negative Declaration was circulated for public review from December 17, 2010 to
January 18, 2011, pursuant to the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA). A detailed design for the project is ongoing and will address project components
including streetscape elements and placement. Key issues raised relative to the project include
traffic, parking, and economic/business impacts.


November 28, 2011                                                                    Page 3 of 6

                                                                                                         5




Traffic
In order to evaluate whether the four-lane to two-lane reduction of California Avenue would
have any significant impacts on existing traffic conditions, a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) was
prepared (Attachment C) as part of the Initial Study for the project and focused on three
elements:

   ·   Intersection Level of Service (LOS),
   ·   Roadway Segment LOS by block segment, and
   ·   Independent roadway operations analysis of the City-prepared Plan Line Concept for
       California Avenue

These three components of the TIA were discussed as part of the January 12, 2011 Planning and
Transportation Commission (PTC) meeting, for which both the staff report and minutes are
included in the February 14, 2011 City Council report (Attachment H). The Initial Study
concluded that there are no significant impacts associated with the project, including the four-
lane to two-lane reconfiguration. The PTC report also noted that the traffic volumes on
California Avenue are considerably less than other "downtown" two-lane streets such as
University Avenue, Santa Cruz Avenue (Menlo Park), Castro Street (Mountain View), and Santa
Cruz Avenue (Los Gatos). Lastly, no shifting of traffic from California Avenue to adjacent
parallel streets such as Cambridge Avenue or Sherman Avenue is expected if California Avenue
is restriped to two lanes.

Parking
The City-prepared Plan Line Concept for California Avenue increases the number of on-street
parking spaces by a total of 17 spaces to 128. The final roadway configuration determined by
the community through the on-going design process will determine the final on-street parking
space count. A separate parking study currently underway is exploring parking management
strategies to better utilize and market the existing parking supply.

Economic/Business Impacts
The California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project is expected to generate
economic benefits to the City and area businesses. The on-going design process is expected to
include a Business Enhancement Plan that preserves and highlights access to California Avenue
businesses through construction, including preferred construction staging to minimize
disruption. Economic impacts are not required to be addressed in environmental review, except
in cases where substantial blight may be created. Staff and the Council have, however, pledged
to look at factors affecting business enhancement as part of the continuing design process.

MTC Resolution and Local Match Funding
The City Council is being asked to reconsider submittal of a resolution (Attachment A) to
authorize the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) to submit an application for the California
Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project to MTC and to commit local-match funding
for the project.


November 28, 2011                                                                        Page 4 of 6

                                                                                               Packet Pg. 379
                                                                                                         5




The VTA released a call for projects for the CDT Program on August 6, 2010. In response to the
call for projects staff scoped a Concept Plan Line for improvements along California Avenue
between El Camino Real and the Park Boulevard Park Plaza, including a community outreach
process in the late Summer/Fall 2010. The City's grant proposal (included in Attachment F) was
submitted on October 4, 2010. The proposal was accepted and scored well as part of the CDT
Program proposal review process. On December 6, the Council adopted Resolution No. 9118
confirming acceptance of the grant and committing local match funding. The project was
recommended for funding by the VTA Board of Directors to MTC at its December 9, 2010
meeting in the amount of $1,175,200. The City's share of the overall cost was estimated at
approximately $550,000. The release of funds is currently pending at MTC, awaiting the
outcome of the litigation. Staff believes that approval of the resolution and the Negative
Declaration will allow the City to satisfy the Court's direction and that MTC will subsequently
release the funding for the project.

Establishment of New CIP Project
The City Council is being asked to reconsider the establishment of a new CIP project for the
California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape in the amount of $1,725,200, including
consultant design fees of $350,000, based on the City's Concept Plan Line prepared for the
grant proposal process. The final design considerations may impact the overall project cost
depending on the preferred design treatments determined through community input and
review by the Planning and Transportation Commission and City Council.

The establishment of a new CIP project will allow the City to continue its ongoing design
process for the project and confirms the City's local-match funding for the project in the
amount of $550,000. The City's local match is being used to cover design consultant design
fees for the project ($350,000) and the construction local match in the amount of $200,000.

Reaffirm Agreement with RBF Consulting for Design Services
The City Council is being asked to reaffirm the consultant agreement with RBF Consulting for
the design phase of the California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project. The
design phase is on-going and is on scheduled to be completed in the Summer of 2012. While
the Court did not order such an action, staff believes it may help to avoid further claims in this
matter.

Resource Impact
The engineer's estimate for the cost of the California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape
project is $1,725,200, including consultant design fees of $350,000, based on the City's Concept
Plan Line prepared for the City's grant proposal. The final cost of the project will be determined
as part of the ongoing design process. The VTA CDT grant will provide $1,175,200 in
reimbursable funds for the construction phase of the project. The total cost of the project is
reflected in the proposed CIP project funding.

The City's Comprehensive Plan recommends that the City enhance the California Avenue
streetscape by upgrading the visual quality of the street to attract businesses and visitors to the
area. Consistent with the Comprehensive Plan goals, the proposed streetscape and place-
making improvements of the California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project
should encourage continued desirable growth and enhancement of the area.

Environmental Review
The Initial Study and Negative Declaration are attached (Attachment B), and conclude that no
significant environmental impacts would result from the project. The draft Negative Declaration
was circulated for public review from December 17, 2010 to January 18, 2011, pursuant to the
provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Approval of the Negative
Declaration for the California Avenue ­ Transit Hub Corridor Streetscape project is necessary
prior to the filing of grant-funding opportunities.

             SECTION 6. The City Council originally adopted this resolution on December 6,
2010, when there was no pending or threatened litigation that might in any way adversely affect
the proposed PROJECT, or the ability of CITY to deliver such PROJECT. MTC subsequently
awarded the grant and the City adopted a negative declaration for the PROJECT on February 14,
2011. Litigation over the City's approvals was then filed on or around April 8, 2011, and on or
around November 9, 2011, the Santa Clara County Superior Court issued a decision ordering the
City to rescind approval of the December 6, 2010 resolution and reconsider it after appropriate
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") review (the "Order"). City completed and




                                                                                                          Attachment: Attachment A: Draft Resolution_Cal Ave Grant (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
adopted a Negative Declaration in compliance with CEQA, and has now reconsidered this
resolution and hereby readopts it. City believes this readoption is consistent with the terms of
the Order, and will therefore resolve the pending litigation.

            SECTION 7. The CITY authorizes its City Manager or designee to execute and file
an application with MTC for STP/CMAQ funding for the PROJECT as referenced in this
resolution.

            SECTION 8. That a copy of this resolution will be transmitted to the MTC in
conjunction with the filing of the application.

             SECTION 9. MTC is requested to support the application for the PROJECT
described in the resolution and to include the PROJECT, if approved, in MTC's TIP.

           SECTION 10. The City has prepared an Initial Study and Council has adopted a
Negative Declaration in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act.

     II.      DETERMINATION

     In accordance with the City of Palo Alto's procedures for compliance with the California
     Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City has conducted an Initial Study to determine
     whether the proposed project could have a significant efred on the environment. On the
     basis of that study, the City makes the following determination:

          X        The proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the
                   environment, and a NEGATIVE DECLARATl ON is hereby adopted.




                                                                                                  Packet Pg. 388

              Although the project, as proposed, could have a significant effect on the
              environment, there will not be a significant effect on the environment in this
              case because mitigation measures for traffic Impacts have been added to the
              project and, therefore, a MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION is
              hereby adopted.

7.       GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION

         The project area is designated as Regional/Community Commercial in the Palo Alto 1998 ­
         2010 Comprehensive Plan. This land use designation includes larger shopping centers and
         districts that have wider variety goods and services than the neighborhood shopping areas.




                                                                                                                         Attachment: Attachment B: Negative Declaration and Initial Study (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
         They rely on larger trade areas and include such uses as department stores, bookstores,
         furniture stores, toy stores, apparel shops, restaurants, theaters, and non-retail services such as
         offices and banks. California Avenue is designated as a "collector" street in Palo Alto's
         roadway hierarchy. This type of roadway collects and distributes local traffic to and from
         arterial streets and provides access to adjacent properties.

8.       ZONING

         The project area is zoned CC(2)(R)(P), Community Commercial (2) with a Retail and
         Pedestrian shopping combining district overlay. The project area also falls within the
         boundaries of the Pedestrian and Transit Oriented Development (PTOD) overlay district. The
         project will not result in a change of use and does not conflict with the existing zoning.

         The CC Community Commercial district is intended to create and maintain major commercial
         centers accommodating a broad range of office, retail sales, and other commercial activities of
         community-wide or regional significance. The CC community commercial district is intended
         to be applied to regional/community commercial centers identified by the Palo Alto
         Comprehensive Plan. The community commercial (2) (CC(2)) subdistrict is intended to modify
         the site development regulations of the CC community commercial district, where applied in
         combination with such district, to allow site specific variations to the community commercial
         uses and development requirements in the CC district.

         The (R) Retail shopping combining district is intended to modify the uses allowed in a
         commercial district, where applied in combination with such district, to allow only retail,
         eating and service oriented commercial development on the ground floors.

         The (P) Pedestrian shopping combining district is intended to modify the regulations of the CC
         community commercial district in locations where it is deemed essential to foster the continuity
         of retail stores and display windows and to avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment in
         order to establish and maintain an economically healthy retail district.

         The California Avenue Pedestrian and Transit Oriented Development (PTOD) Combining
         District is intended to allow higher density residential dwellings on commercial, industrial and
         multi-family parcels within a walkable distance of the California Avenue Caltrain station,
         while protecting low density residential parcels and parcels with historical resources that may
         also be located in or adjacent to this area. The combining district is intended to foster densities
         and facilities that: (1) Support use of public transportation; (2) Encourage a variety of housing
         types, commercial retail and limited office uses; (3) Encourage project design that achieves an
         overall context-based development for the PTOD overlay area; (4) Require streetscape design
         elements that are attractive pedestrians and bicyclists; (5) Increase connectivity to surrounding
         existing and planned pedestrian and bicycle facilities; and (6) Implement the city's Housing

         Element and Comprehensive Plan. A PTOD combining district may be applied to a parcel
         through rezoning of the site that is within the specified boundaries of the district.

9.       PROJECT DESCRIPTION




                                                                                                                           Attachment: Attachment B: Negative Declaration and Initial Study (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
         The California Avenue Streetscape Improvements (Phase II) project includes the
         implementation of streetscape treatments along California Avenue between El Camino Real
         and the Caltrain ­ Park Blvd Plaza. Project elements include: community identity markers;
         traffic calming treatments such as speed tables at existing mid-block crosswalk locations, bulb-
         outs at intersections to reduce crosswalk lengths, and a 4-lane to 2-lane reduction; streetscape
         elements such as decorative pavement bands to divide parking lanes from parking lanes,
         outdoor seating areas, enhanced bicycle parking elements, information kiosks, and newspaper
         racks; landscape improvements; enhanced and additional on-street vehicle parking; and
         community-focused improvements at the Caltrain ­ Park Blvd Plaza.

         Palo Alto Review Requirements
         The proposed project requires Architectural Review by the City of Palo Alto. The project is
         required to conform to the designated zoning and related Comprehensive Plan polices.

10.      SURROUNDING LAND USES AND SETTING

         The project area is a commercial zone with a variety of restaurants, retail and grocery stores
         and is surrounded primarily with similar non-residential uses within a two block radius. Further
         to the north and south, residential uses become the dominant land use.

11.      OTHER PUBLIC AGENCY APPROVALS REQUIRED

         Not applicable.

ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST AND DISCUSSION OF IMPACTS


EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

1) A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are adequately supported by
   the information sources a lead agency cites in the parentheses following each question. [A "No Impact"
   answer is adequately supported if the referenced information sources show that the impact simply
   does not apply to projects like the one involved (e. g. the project falls outside a fault rupture zone). A
   "No Impact" answer should be explained where it is based on project-specific factors as well as
   general standards (e. g. the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on a
   project-specific screening analysis).]

2) All answers must take account of the whole action involved, including off-site as well as on-site,
   cumulative as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as well as operational
   impacts.

                                                                                                            Packet Pg. 396
                                                                                                                                5.b




3) Once the lead agency has determined that a particular physical impact may occur, then the checklist
   answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant, less than significant with mitigation, or
   less than significant. Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that an
   effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impact" entries when the
   determination is made, an EIR is required.




                                                                                                                                      Attachment: Attachment B: Negative Declaration and Initial Study (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
4) "(Mitigated) Negative Declaration: Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies where the
   incorporation of mitigation measures has reduced an effect from "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less
   than Significant Impact." The lead agency must describe the mitigation measures, and briefly explain how
   they reduce the effect to a less than significant level (mitigation measures from Section 17, "Earlier
   Analysis," may be cross-referenced).

5) Earlier analysis may be used where, pursuant to the tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA process, an effect
   has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration. Section 15063 (C)(3) (D). In this
   case, a brief discussion should identify the following:
   a) Earlier Analysis Used. Identify and state where they are available for review.
   b) Impacts Adequately Addressed. Identify which effects from the above checklist were within the scope
       of and adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and state
       whether such effects were addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis.
   c) Mitigation Measures. For effects that are "Less than Significant with Mitigation Measures
       Incorporated," describe the mitigation measures which were incorporated or refined from the earlier
       document and the extent to which they address site-specific conditions for the project.

6) Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information sources for
   potential impacts (e.g. general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a previously prepared or outside
   document should, where appropriate, include a reference to the page or pages where the statement is
   substantiated.

7) Supporting Information Sources: A source list should be attached, and other sources used or individuals
   contacted should be cited in the discussion.

8) The explanation of each issue should identify:
   a) the significance criteria or threshold, if any, used to evaluate each question; and
   b) the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the impact to less than significance.


DISCUSSION OF IMPACTS

The following Environmental Checklist was used to identify environmental impacts, which could occur if the
proposed project is implemented. The left-hand column in the checklist lists the source(s) for the answer to each
question. The sources cited are identified at the end of the checklist. Discussions of the basis for each answer

     DISCUSSION:

     The proposed project is required by the City of Palo Alto to undergo Architectural Review. The intent
     of this review is to (1) Promote orderly and harmonious development in the city; (2) Enhance the
     desirability of residence or investment in the city; (3) Encourage the attainment of the most desirable
     use of land and improvements; (4) Enhance the desirability of living conditions upon the immediate
     site or in adjacent areas; and (5) Promote visual environments which are of high aesthetic quality and
     variety and which, at the same time, are considerate of each other. The proposed improvements are
     anticipated to have a less than significant aesthetic impact due to the required conformance with the
     Architectural Review requirements.

  project would affect any regional air quality plan or standards, or result in a cumulatively considerable net
  increase of any criteria pollutant. The extent of the effects on air quality will be temporary only, during the
  period of site preparation and construction. The City of Palo Alto uses the BAAQMD's Basic Control Measures

     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project involves minor construction activities within the public right-of-way that is
     located within a fully developed and previously disturbed area. The proposed project will not create
     any cultural impacts to the affected area. For all projects, if during grading and construction activities,
     any archaeological or human remains are encountered, construction shall cease and a qualified
     archaeologist shall visit the site to address the find. The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner's
     office shall be notified to provide proper direction on how to proceed. If any Native American
     resources are encountered during construction, construction shall cease immediately until a Native
     American descendant, appointed by the Native American Heritage Commission of the State of
     California, is able to evaluate the site and make further recommendations and be involved in
     mitigation planning.

   geologic hazards that cannot be mitigated
   through the use of standard engineering
   design and seismic safety techniques?

 DISCUSSION:
 The proposed project includes improvements within the public right of way (sidewalk and road) of a
 fully developed commercial area. Although the project is located in an area with expansive soils and
 has a high potential for surface rupture along fault traces and potential for earthquake-induced
 landslides where sloped, the project scope is limited to improvements at or near the existing grade and
 is anticipated to not be significantly impacted by the existing geologic conditions. The proposed
 project would not create any new geology, soils and seismicity impacts.

 Generally, the City of Palo Alto would experience a range from weak to very violent shaking in the
 event of a major earthquake along the San Andreas or Hayward fault. Although hazards exist,
 development would not expose people or property to major geologic hazards that cannot be addressed
 through the use of standard engineering design and seismic safety techniques, as required by building
 codes. With proper engineering new development is not expected to result in any significant adverse
 short or long-term impacts related to geology, soils or seismicity.

     DISCUSSION:
     The San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin (SFBAAB) is currently designated as a nonattainment area for
     state and national ozone standards and national particulate matter ambient air quality standards.
     SFBAAB's nonattainment status is attributed to the region's development history. Past, present and
     future development projects contribute to the region's adverse air quality impacts on a cumulative
     basis. By its very nature, air pollution is largely a cumulative impact. No single project is sufficient in
     size to, by itself, result in nonattainment of ambient air quality standards. Instead, a project's
     individual emissions contribute to existing cumulatively significant adverse air quality impacts. If a
     project's contribution to the cumulative impact is considerable, then the project's impact on air quality
     would be considered significant.

     The Bay Area Air Quality Management District's (BAAQMD) approach to developing a Threshold of
     Significance for Green House Gas (GHG) emissions is to identify the emissions level for which a
     project would not be expected to substantially conflict with existing California legislation adopted to
     reduce statewide GHG emissions needed to move us towards climate stabilization. If a project would
     generate GHG emissions above the threshold level, it would be considered to contribute substantially
     to a cumulative impact, and would be considered significant.

     The Thresholds of Significance for operational-related GHG emissions are:
     · For land use development projects, the threshold is compliance with a qualified GHG reduction
     Strategy; or annual emissions less than 1,100 metric tons per year (MT/yr) of CO2e; or 4.6 MT
     CO2e/SP/yr (residents + employees). Land use development projects include residential, commercial,
     industrial, and public land uses and facilities.
     · For stationary-source projects, the threshold is 10,000 metric tons per year (MT/yr) of CO2e.
     Stationary-source projects include land uses that would accommodate processes and equipment that
     emit GHG emissions and would require an Air District permit to operate. If annual emissions of
     operational-related GHGs exceed these levels, the proposed project would result in a cumulatively
     considerable contribution of GHG emissions and a cumulatively significant impact to global climate
     change.

     The BAAQMD has established project level screening criteria to assist in the evaluation of impacts. If
     a project meets the screening criteria and is consistent with the methodology used to develop the
     screening criteria, then the project's air quality impacts may be considered less than significant. Below

     GHG emissions.

     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project includes improvements within the public right of way (sidewalk and road) of a
     fully developed commercial area and is not anticipated to create any new hydrology and water quality
     impacts.

     All development is required to comply with building codes that address flood safety issues.
     Development projects are required to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) for construction
     activities as specified by the California Storm Water Best Management Practices Handbook (CASQA,
     2003) and/or the Manual of Standards for Erosion and Sediment Control Measures (ABAG, 1995).
     The BMPs include measures guiding the management and operation of construction sites to control
     and minimize the potential contribution of pollutants to storm runoff from these areas. These measures
     address procedures for controlling erosion and sedimentation and managing all aspects of the
     construction process to ensure control of potential water pollution sources. All development projects
     must comply with all City, State and Federal standards pertaining to storm water run-off and water
     quality.

    by 10 dBA or more?

     DISCUSSION:
     All development, including construction activities, must comply with the City's Noise Ordinance
     (PAMC Chapter 9.10), which restricts the timing and overall noise levels associated with construction
     activity. Short-term temporary construction noise that complies with the Noise Ordinance would result
     in impacts that are expected to be less than significant. The project is located in busy commercial
     district with an active train station in the immediate vicinity; the existing noise conditions are not quiet
     and the temporary construction activities will not create any new significant noise impacts.

 DISCUSSION:
 The proposed project would reduce the number of travel lanes on California Avenue between El
 Camino Real and Park Boulevard from four travel lanes to two. In addition to a traffic analysis, an
 operations and queue analysis of key intersections along California Avenue was completed as part of
 the traffic analysis for the project and is attached to this Initial Study.

 The additional pavement space provided from the lane reduction would be used for streetscape
 improvements including decorative pavement bands, intersection bulb-outs, and to provide additional
 on-street parking supply. Most of the parking spaces would be 60-degree angled parking spaces,
 although some parallel parking will also be provided. At higher volume intersections such as El
 Camino Real & California Avenue and Birch Street & California Avenue, additional approach lanes
 are proposed to provide additional intersection capacity for traffic. All existing crosswalks for
 pedestrians would be maintained with three additional crosswalks provided at the intersections of Park
 Boulevard & California Avenue. Where bulb-out improvements are proposed, existing crosswalk
 lengths would be reduced to improve pedestrian operations. The project would also enhance the
 existing California Avenue Bike Route with the addition of Sharrows stenciled onto the pavement.

 The proposed lane reduction was reviewed in accordance with City of Palo Alto and Valley
 Transportation Authority (VTA) ­ Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines. According to
 the City of Palo Alto, there are no pending projects or planned projects in the foreseeable future.
 Therefore, traffic volumes on California Avenue between El Camino Real and Park Boulevard will
 remain unchanged with the current land uses. An analysis of intersection Level of Service (LOS),

                                                                                                                      Attachment: Attachment B: Negative Declaration and Initial Study (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
proposed lane reduction along California Avenue. The queue length and overall operations analysis
though did yield several optional improvements to the City's proposed conceptual plan line to help
improve operations under the proposed two-lane condition including:

    At California Avenue the existing two-lane to three-lane westbound approach to the El Camino
    Real intersection may be maintained to help provide adequate storage capacity for at least 200 feet
    from the intersection. This would result in the loss of the 5 new on-street parking spaces along the
    north side of California Avenue but still allows for the maintenance of the existing 12 on-street
    parking spaces in the segment providing for no overall parking loss.

    The proposed crosswalk additions at the intersections of California Avenue & Park Boulevard
    should be reviewed to ensure that wheelchair ramps can be installed in accordance with American
    Disabilities Act requirements.

    The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept proposes to maintain the existing two-
    lane westbound approach at Birch Street. Two lanes are also proposed for maintenance
    immediately west of Birch Street approaching the midblock crosswalk west of the Birch Street
    intersection. To eliminate the need for lane merging along California Avenue, the westbound curb
    lane may be converted to a dedicated right turn only lane to northbound Birch Street.

    The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept also proposed to maintain the existing
    two receiving lanes for eastbound California Avenue at El Camino Real. Only one receiving lane
    is required because at any given time only one lane from either the west side of El Camino Real,
    the southbound left turn approach of El Camino Real, or the northbound right turn approach of El
    Camino Real feed traffic onto California Avenue. The existing curb lane approaching the first
    midblock crosswalk of the project area may be removed to eliminate the need for lane merging.
    The curb lane can be converted to a bus duckout for the existing Stanford Marguerite shuttle stop
    at the intersection. This design would eliminate a stopped bus from blocking through traffic and
    help to avoid operations impacts to the El Camino Real & California Avenue intersection.

    Three proposed on-street parking segments on California Avenue do not meet the City's existing
    parking standards. Their adjacent lane widths are too narrow for vehicles to back out of angled
    parking spaces. To comply with the City's parking standards, these segments could be
    reconfigured to 45-degree parking stalls. The three parking segments are as follows:

    o    The proposed four angled parking spaces in the same location of the proposed Optional
         Outside Seating/Community Stage area on the south side of California Avenue between Ash
         Street and the mid-block crosswalk immediately west of Ash Street. Changing these parking
         spaces from 60-degrees to 45-degrees does not result in a loss of proposed on-street parking
         spaces within this street segment.

          o   The proposed six angled parking spaces along the north side of California Avenue between
              Park Boulevard and the driveway entrance to the Molly Stone market. Changing these parking
              spaces from 60-degrees to 45-degrees results in the loss of one new parking space providing
              five spaces instead. This is still one space more than the existing four parking spaces under
              existing conditions.




                                                                                                                                             Attachment: Attachment B: Negative Declaration and Initial Study (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
          o   The proposed eight angled parking spaces along the south side of California Avenue between
              Park Boulevard (East) and Park Boulevard (West). Changing these parking spaces from 60-
              degrees to 45-degrees results in the loss of two new parking spaces providing six spaces
              instead. This is still one space more than the existing five parking spaces under existing
              conditions.

     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project does not encourage growth and development and therefore no increase in the
     demand on existing utilities and service systems or impacts to these services are expected.




                                                                                                                                                Attachment: Attachment B: Negative Declaration and Initial Study (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)

   which will cause substantial adverse effects
   on human beings, either directly or
   indirectly?


     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed improvements are anticipated to transform California Avenue between El Camino Real and
     California Avenue Caltrain station into a community corridor with transit, bicycle and pedestrian focused
     transportation treatments; renovate the California Avenue Caltrain Plaza into a vibrant hub for bicycle
     commuters and visitors; and provide best practice pedestrian-scaled improvements throughout the corridor
     to spur on going economic development activity and growth. As discussed in the Biological Resources
     section, this project does not impact sensitive wildlife or plant habitats. The goal of the project is intended
     to enhance the visitor's experience and create an inviting and welcoming commercial district.

     The project's cumulative impacts are limited to the GHG emissions. A project of this minor scope is not
     anticipated to create cumulatively considerable impacts of any other nature. See the Greenhouse Gas
     Emissions section for further discussion.

DETERMINATION

On the basis of this initial evaluation:




                                                                                                                       Attachment: Attachment B: Negative Declaration and Initial Study (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the                       X
environment, and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.


I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
environment, there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the
project have been made by or agreed to by the project proponent. A MITIGATED
NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.


I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.


I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or
"potentially significant unless mitigated" impact on the environment, but at least one
effect: 1) has been adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal
standards, and 2) has been addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis
as described on attached sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required,
but it must analyze only the effects that remain to be addressed.

I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the
environment, because all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately
in an earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards, and
(b) have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or NEGATIVE
DECLARATION, including revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed upon the
proposed project, nothing further is required.

Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis conducted for the
proposed California Avenue lane reduction in Palo Alto, California. The proposed project
would reduce the number of travel lanes on California Avenue between El Camino Real
and Park Boulevard from four travel lanes to two. An operations and queue analysis of key
intersections along California Avenue is also provided.
The additional pavement space provided from the lane reduction would be used for
streetscape improvements including decorative pavement bands, intersection bulb-outs,
and to provide additional on-street parking supply. Most of the parking spaces would be
60-degree angled parking spaces, although some parallel parking will also be provided. At
higher volume intersections such as El Camino Real & California Avenue and Birch Street
& California Avenue, additional approach lanes are proposed to provide additional
intersection capacity for traffic. All existing crosswalks for pedestrians would be maintained
with three additional crosswalks provided at the intersections of Park Boulevard &
California Avenue. Where bulb-out improvements are proposed, existing crosswalk
lengths would be reduced to improve pedestrian operations. The project would also
enhance the existing California Avenue Bike Route with the addition of Sharrows stenciled
onto the pavement.
The proposed lane reduction was reviewed in accordance with City of Palo Alto and Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) ­ Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines.
According to the City of Palo Alto, there are no pending projects or planned projects in the
foreseeable future. Therefore, traffic volumes on California Avenue between El Camino
Real and Park Boulevard will remain unchanged with the current land uses. An analysis of
intersection Level of Service (LOS), street segment LOS, and intersection queuing was
conducted to determine whether the project would result in any significant adverse impacts
under project conditions with the lane reduction.
The intersection LOS analyses show no significant impact from the proposed lane
reduction along California Avenue. The roadway segment LOS analyses also show no
significant impact from the proposed lane reduction along California Avenue. The queue
length and overall operations analysis though did yield several optional improvements to
the City's proposed conceptual plan line to help improve operations under the proposed
two-lane condition including:
    ·   At California Avenue the existing two-lane to three-lane westbound approach to the
        El Camino Real intersection may be maintained to help provide adequate storage

        capacity for at least 200 feet from the intersection. This would result in the loss of
        the 5 new on-street parking spaces along the north side of California Avenue but
        still allows for the maintenance of the existing 12 on-street parking spaces in the
        segment providing for no overall parking loss.




                                                                                                          Attachment: Attachment C: Cal. Av. Transportation Impact Analysis (2339 : California Av Streetscape Updates)
    ·   The proposed crosswalk additions at the intersections of California Avenue & Park
        Boulevard should be reviewed to ensure that wheelchair ramps can be installed in
        accordance with American Disabilities Act requirements.

    ·   The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept proposes to maintain the
        existing two-lane westbound approach at Birch Street. Two lanes are also
        proposed for maintenance immediately west of Birch Street approaching the mid-
        block crosswalk west of the Birch Street intersection. To eliminate the need for lane
        merging along California Avenue, the westbound curb lane may be converted to a
        dedicated right turn only lane to northbound Birch Street.

    ·   The City's proposed California Avenue plan line concept also proposed to maintain
        the existing two receiving lanes for eastbound California Avenue at El Camino
        Real. Only one receiving lane is required because at any given time only one lane
        from either the west side of El Camino Real, the southbound left turn approach of
        El Camino Real, or the northbound right turn approach of El Camino Real feed
        traffic onto California Avenue. The existing curb lane approaching the first mid-
        block crosswalk of the project area may be removed to eliminate the need for lane
        merging. The curb lane can be converted to a bus duckout for the existing Stanford
        Marguerite shuttle stop at the intersection. This design would eliminate a stopped
        bus from blocking through traffic and help to avoid operations impacts to the El
        Camino Real & California Avenue intersection.

    ·   Three proposed on-street parking segments on California Avenue do not meet the
        City's existing parking standards providing adjacent lane widths that are too narrow
        for vehicles to back out of angled parking spaces. To comply with the City's parking
        standards these segments could be reconfigured to 45-degree parking stalls. The
        three parking segments are as follows:

            o   The proposed four angled parking spaces in the same location of the
                proposed Optional Outside Seating/Community Stage area on the south
                side of California Avenue between Ash Street and the mid-block crosswalk
                immediately west of Ash Street. Changing these parking spaces from 60-
                degrees to 45-degrees does not result in a loss of proposed on-street
                parking spaces within this street segment.

            o   The proposed six angled parking spaces along the north side of California
                Avenue between Park Boulevard and the driveway entrance to the Molly
                Stone market. Changing these parking spaces from 60-degrees to 45-

Introduction
This report presents the results of the transportation impact analysis conducted for the
proposed California Avenue lane reduction in Palo Alto, California. The proposed project
would reduce the number of travel lanes on California Avenue between El Camino Real
and Park Boulevard from four travel lanes to two. An operations and queue analysis of key
intersections along California Avenue is also provided.
The additional pavement space provided from the lane reduction would be used for
streetscape improvements including decorative pavement bands, intersection bulb-outs,
and to provide additional on-street parking supply. Most of the parking spaces would be
60-degree angled parking spaces, although some parallel parking will also be provided. At
higher volume intersections such as El Camino Real & California Avenue and Birch Street
& California Avenue, additional approach lanes are proposed to provide additional
intersection capacity for traffic. All existing crosswalks for pedestrians would be maintained
with three additional crosswalks provided at the intersections of Park Boulevard &
California Avenue. Where bulb-out improvements are proposed, existing crosswalk
lengths would be reduced to improve pedestrian operations. The project would also
enhance the existing California Avenue Bike Route with the addition of Sharrows stenciled
onto the pavement. The project study area and study intersections are shown on Figures 1
& 2.

Scope of Study
The proposed lane reduction was reviewed in accordance with City of Palo Alto and Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) ­ Congestion Management Program (CMP) guidelines.
The study included an analysis of traffic conditions for one signalized intersection, six
unsignalized intersections, and the California Avenue corridor from El Camino Real to the
Caltrain Station past Park Boulevard. The study intersections are identified below.

    ·   California Avenue between Ash Street and Birch Street
    ·   California Avenue between Birch Street and Park Boulevard (W)
    ·   California Avenue between Park Boulevard (W) and Park Boulevard (E)

Traffic conditions were analyzed for three weekday time periods: AM peak-hour (one hour
between 7 AM ­ 9 AM), Mid-day peak-hour (one hour between 11:30 AM ­ 1:30 PM), and
PM peak hour (one hour between 4 PM ­ 6 PM). Traffic conditions were evaluated for the
following scenarios:
Scenario 1: Existing Conditions. Existing traffic volumes were obtained from tube count
            and manual turning movement count data obtained in November 2010.

Scenario 2: Project Conditions. The intersections and street segments were evaluated
            with the proposed lane reductions. Project conditions were evaluated
            relative to existing conditions in order to determine potential project impacts.

Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each
scenario described above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis
methodologies, and the applicable level of service standards.
Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from the City of Palo Alto and field
observations. The following data were collected from these sources:
·   existing traffic volumes
·   lane configurations
·   signal timing and phasing (for signalized intersections)
·   existing and future bicycle facilities
·   existing transit service
·   travel time runs

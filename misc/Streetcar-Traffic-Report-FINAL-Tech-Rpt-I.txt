KEY POINTS
This traffic analysis report reports findings of traffic operations analyses for existing conditions and the
streetcar "build" alternative. Potential signal, intersection and roadway improvements to mitigate possible
impacts of the proposed streetcar are also identified and described. Given the similarities of the streetcar and
bus alternatives (i.e. both vehicles operate in mixed traffic and would have similar frequencies of service), the
findings are also generally representative of the likely traffic impacts of the bus-based alternative.

A detailed capacity/level-of-service analysis was performed at twelve high priority analysis locations in the
study area. These intersections were identified as important to understand the impacts associated with the
implementation of a streetcar and to adequately analyze and compare the traffic conditions along the
potential streetcar route.

The results indicate that the implementation of the streetcar does not adversely impact traffic operations at
the study area intersections. The streetcar adds a small volume of traffic to the intersections, six vehicles per
hour in each direction, and causes momentary delays at stop locations, where it blocks traffic. However, the
expected frequency of the streetcar is six streetcars per hour and the added delay will only occur during those
six times an hour. These delays averaged over the course of an hour are inconsequential to the study area
traffic operations.

At some locations, traffic operations actually improve over the No Build condition. This is the case at
intersections where signalization is required or an existing signal will be modified as part of the
implementation of the streetcar. The locations with proposed signal installation are as follows:

    ·   Eddy Street at Richmond Street;
    ·   Richmond Street at Elm Street;
    ·   Thayer Street at East Side Trolley Tunnel;
    ·   Point Street at Hospital Street; and
    ·   Point Street at Chestnut Street.

With the implementation of traffic signals at these locations, there is an opportunity to improve traffic
operations along the corridor.

Signal modifications, including signal phasing and timing changes, are required at certain intersections in
order to accommodate any special movements to be made by the streetcar. Signal modifications would be
required at the following locations:

    ·   Eddy Street at Globe Street/Allens Avenue (streetcar crossing of intersection);
    ·   Chestnut Street at Pine Street (to enter northbound streetcar-only lane);
    ·   Chestnut Street at Broad Street / Weybosset Street (to exit northbound streetcar-only lane);
    ·   Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard (to enter/exit dedicated streetcar lane); and
    ·   Washington Street at North Main Street (to enter/exit dedicated streetcar lane).

1 INTRODUCTION
In December 2009, RIPTA and the City of Providence completed the Metropolitan Providence Transit
Enhancement Study, setting forth ten recommendations for improving the network of transit services within the
metropolitan area and providing the opportunity to realize a range of mobility, livability, development and
health benefits. RIPTA and the City have partnered again to evaluate one of these proposals in more detail,
initiating the Providence Core Connector Study to study the feasibility, cost and benefits of constructing an
"urban circulator" (i.e. streetcar or enhanced bus service) to connect key locations within a two-mile corridor
between Rhode Island Hospital, Downtown, and College Hill.

The intent of the Providence Core Connector Study is to conduct more detailed planning and environmental
analyses for a potential urban circulator project to connect the state's most significant educational, medical,
employment and cultural destinations. Additionally, the Study produces the documentation that would be
required if RIPTA and the City decide to pursue future federal funding to support the design and
construction costs of an urban circulator project. These federally-required documents include an Alternatives
Analysis (AA) and Environmental Assessment (EA).

A streetcar is being considered as the "build" alternative. Streetcars are rail vehicles that operate on local
streets, typically in mixed traffic with automobiles. Due to the narrow roadway network that exists in
Providence, fitting the rail alignment into the existing right-of-way is a challenge in certain locations. A
number of on-street parking spaces will need to be eliminated to accommodate the lane width needed for a
streetcar and to locate station stops. Where on-street parking is available, streetcar stops are typically
accommodated at a curb extension; this is an extension of the sidewalk through the parking lane to the edge
of the travel lane. The On-Street Parking Impacts technical report provides additional information regarding
parking impacts.

This traffic analysis report reports findings of traffic operations analyses for existing conditions and the
streetcar "build" alternative. Potential signal, intersection and roadway improvements to mitigate possible
impacts of the proposed streetcar are also identified and described. Given the similarities of the streetcar and
bus alternatives (i.e. both vehicles operate in mixed traffic and would have similar frequencies of service), the
findings are also generally representative of the likely traffic impacts of the bus-based alternative.


2 EXISTING CONDITIONS
2.1 Study Area
The study area, shown in Figure 1, was identified based on the various streetcar route alternatives that were
considered. The alternatives analysis process evaluated a number of routing options. Field observations and
traffic analyses were conducted at locations along the proposed streetcar alternative routes in order to
determine a preferred corridor alternative. The study area intersections, discussed later in the report, were
selected as high priority locations, where new signals will be installed or existing signals will be modified as
part of the proposed streetcar routes.

The selected study area intersections are primarily located in the Jewelry District, Capital Center and College
Hill areas of Downtown Providence. A traffic circulation study is currently being conducted by VHB in
Downcity to document the conversion of one-way roadways to two-way roadways. The intersections within
the VHB study area that overlap with the proposed streetcar corridor are not discussed as part of this report
and analysis.

2.2 Field Evaluations
Field work was conducted as part of the alternatives analysis in order to evaluate the feasibility of
implementing a streetcar route through Providence. These street evaluations were conducted along the
roadways of the various streetcar route alternatives on November 15 and November 16, 2010 and on March
1, 2011. The following information was collected during the field evaluations:

    ·   Roadway and intersection geometry;
    ·   Type of traffic control;
    ·   Traffic operation observations;
    ·   Pedestrian/bicycle facilities;
    ·   Parking regulations;
    ·   Bus stop and bus route locations;
    ·   Loading zones; and
    ·   Construction activities.

Many of the observations noted above were reviewed when considering route alternatives through the initial
screening process. A summary of the streetcar route advantages and disadvantages determined from the field
evaluations can be found in Appendix A of this report. After reviewing the pros and cons for each of the
potential routes, a primary streetcar route (between College Hill and Upper South Providence) was selected.

2.3 Streetcar Route Options Analyzed
From the south, the streetcar route options that were analyzed begin on Dudley Street in the Hospital
District. The route then turns north on Eddy Street. Once on Eddy Street, one track alignment continues on
Eddy Street bearing left onto Richmond Street. With this alignment the northbound track veers off
Richmond Street at Ship Street to connect to Chestnut Street, while the southbound track continues on
Chestnut Street and breaks off at Elm Street before re-entering Richmond Street.

The alternative track alignment through the Jewelry District travels north on Eddy Street to Globe Street,
travels west on Globe Street where it turns into Hospital Street. After heading north on Hospital Street, the
tracks travel east along Point Street. While the northbound track continues east to Richmond Street, the
southbound track continues south on Chestnut Street back to Point Street.

The track alignment continues north on Chestnut Street straight onto Empire Street. The proposed
alignment continues traveling north to Washington Street and then turns east. The track alignment travels
along Washington Street to Exchange Street. An option for a potential spur along Exchange Street to
Providence Station was considered. The Washington Street tracks would continue east to Main Street. At
this point the route will continue into the East Side Trolley Tunnel, currently used by RIPTA buses. Finally,
the streetcar route terminates at Thayer Street where the streetcar would reverse direction for southbound
service. Figure 2 illustrates the various alternative alignments that were analyzed in detail.

Three earlier route options ("west", "middle", and "east") were also considered as part of the initial screening
process. Graphics illustrating these initial alternatives are presented in Appendix A.

2.4 Roadway Characteristics
The following section describes the segments of roadway within the study area, including number of travel
lanes, parking provision, abutting land uses, sidewalks and bicycle lanes. Many of the roadways within the
study area operate with just one travel lane in each direction, with and without parking. It is worth noting
that some of the sidewalks are less than eight feet wide and therefore do not meet ADA requirements for an
eight foot deep landing area at bus stops (sidewalks would need to be widened at these locations). The
roadway characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Dudley Street is a local road which runs in a
general east-west direction. Dudley Street
primarily consists of a single travel lane in each
direction and no parking on either side.
Rhode Island Hospital and off-street parking
lots dominate the street between Eddy Street
and Prairie Avenue. Intermixed are two
residential and one commercial property.
Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the
street.

Eddy Street is classified as an urban minor and
principal arterial and a local road under                            Figure 3: Dudley Street
RIDOT jurisdiction, which runs in a general
north-south direction from its intersection with Dudley Street to its intersection with Richmond Street.
Travel is allowed in two directions, separated by a median between Point Street and Marengo Street, and it
runs under Interstate 95. Eddy Street is signalized at its intersection with Dudley Street and Globe Street.
One to two travel lanes are provided per direction and there is no parking on Eddy Street along the proposed

streetcar alignment. It primarily serves industrial land uses and off-street parking lots for Rhode Island
Hospital. Four bus stops (two in each direction) are located in this segment (at Rhode Island Hospital and at
Globe Street) and are served by RIPTA bus routes (Routes 1, 3, 60 and 66). Sidewalks are located on both
sides of the street.




                                              Figure 4: Eddy Street

Richmond Street is a local road which travels in
a general north-south direction. From Eddy
Street in the south to Ship Street in the
north, within the study area, travel is allowed
in two directions with one travel lane per
direction and on-street parking is permitted
on the east side of the roadway. Commercial
and educational land uses alongside several
parking lots line the street. Three bus stops
are served by bus routes 1 and 3. Narrow
sidewalks (5-6' wide) are located on both
sides of the street and it is designated as a
bicycle route.

Globe Street is a local road, running in a
general east-west direction from its
                                                                Figure 5: Richmond Street
intersection with Eddy Street to its
connection with Hospital Street. Globe Street consists of a single travel lane in each direction, and serves
commercial land uses. The street intersects with Eddy Street at a signalized intersection where through
movements on Globe Street are not possible. There is no parking on Globe Street. The street was recently
reconstructed with sidewalks on both sides.

Hospital Street is a local road which runs in a general north-south direction with one travel lane per direction
from Globe Street in the south to Bassett Street in the north. Travel is allowed in two directions, and there is
no parking along the proposed streetcar alignment. Hospital Street is primarily vacant, with some abutting

commercial land uses. Similar to Globe Street, Hospital Street was recently reconstructed with sidewalks
now provided on both sides.

Point Street is classified as an urban minor and principal arterial which runs in a general east-west direction
from Richmond Street in the east to Hospital Street in the west, within the study area. Travel is allowed in
two directions with one travel lane per direction, and the street serves commercial, retail and medical land
uses. Point Street and Richmond Street is a signalized intersection. Bus routes 1 and 3 operate along Point
Street, with inbound stops at Hospital and Richmond Streets. On-street meter parking and sidewalks are
located on both sides of the street.

Elm Street is a local road which runs in a general east-west direction from Richmond Street in the east to
Chestnut Street in the west. Travel is allowed in both directions with one travel lane per direction and it
serves commercial uses. On-street parking is allowed on the north side of the street and sidewalks are located
on both sides of the roadway.

Chestnut Street is a local road that travels in a southeasterly direction from its intersection with Broad
Street/Weybosset Street to its intersection with Point Street. Between Broad Street/Weybosset Street and
Clifford Street the roadway allows one-way travel southbound, while south of Clifford Street, it allows travel
in both directions. Commercial and retail uses are located on both sides, and sidewalk exists on both sides of
the roadway. On-street parking is allowed on the west side of the roadway on the one-way segment and there
is some on-street parking on the two-way segment. The roadway is designated as a bicycle route and bicycle
parking is provided along the sidewalk.

                  Figure 12: Thayer Street


East Side Trolley Tunnel is an underground tunnel between Main
Street at Washington Street and Thayer Street at Fones Alley.
It has one lane in each direction and is dedicated to RIPTA
buses only. Bus Routes 35, 40, 42, 49, 78, and 92 currently
operate through this tunnel that is approximately 2,000ft long.
The tunnel enables buses to quickly pass through the city and
is at a lesser grade than the streets of College Hill.

2.5 Signalized Intersections
The selected study area intersections are primarily located in the Jewelry District, Capital Center, and College
Hill. Signalized roadway intersections within the study area are described in greater detail below.

Washington Street/North Main Street/East Side Trolley Tunnel is essentially a five-leg signalized intersection with
three approaches that facilitates general traffic movements, in addition to entry and exit to the tunnel. There
are three eastbound approach lanes ­ an exclusive left turn lane, a shared left-through lane, and an exclusive
through lane. In addition, an exclusive bus only through lane approximately 150' long is provided for access
to the tunnel. This is separated from the main approach by a 16' wide landscaped median. There is a one
lane approach on the west side for buses exiting the tunnel. A 7' wide sidewalk, in addition to the
topography, separates this approach from the Washington Street departure lanes. Only right turn movements
out of the tunnel are possible on this approach because of the intersection configuration. On the
northbound approach there are two lanes ­ an exclusive through, and a through-right turn lane. The stop
line is set back south of the tunnel entry, so vehicles approaching Washington Street do not block bus access.
A bus stop is also located nearside of this approach at the end of the parking lane. The intersection is
controlled by a three-phase actuated/uncoordinated traffic signal with concurrent pedestrian phases. For the
purposes of traffic modeling this intersection has been analyzed as two intersections in order to accurately
represent the bus turning movements to/from the tunnel. A crosswalk and pedestrian signal heads are
provided across the east and west sides of the intersection. The Main Street crosswalk is located mid-
intersection between the median separating the bus only lane from general traffic on the Washington Street
eastbound approach, and the sidewalk between the tunnel access and Washington Street.

Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard is a signalized intersection with three lanes on the east and south-bound
approaches, and two lanes on the northbound approach. The eastbound approach on Washington Street and
the northbound approach on Memorial Boulevard have three and two general purpose lanes respectively.
The southbound approach has two through lanes and an exclusive left turn lane 100ft long. The signal is
actuated-uncoordinated with three phases and concurrent pedestrian phases. Crosswalks are provided on
three legs, excluding the east side on the bridge.

Francis Street at Finance Way is a signalized three-way intersection at the northwest corner of the study area.
Although this intersection is not located along the proposed streetcar alignment, it was considered for analysis
as part of the initial alternatives analysis. There are two lanes on the north and south-bound approaches, and
one lane on the westbound approach. The intersection is controlled by a two-phase actuated/uncoordinated
traffic signal with concurrent pedestrian phases. Crosswalks are provided on all three legs.

Francis Street at Memorial Boulevard is another signalized intersection not located along the proposed streetcar
alignment. This intersection was also considered as part of the initial analysis to develop preferred
alternatives. This four-way intersection has three lanes on all approaches except the eastbound approach,
which has five lanes. The northbound approach on Francis Street has left turn only, through-left and
through-right lanes. This approach also has a bus stop sharing the right lane. The southbound approach has
a right turn lane, a through-right turn lane and a through-left turn lane. The westbound approach has two
through, and one through-right turn lanes. The eastbound approach has five dedicated turn lanes, exclusive
left and right turn lanes, and three through lanes. The signal is actuated and uncoordinated operating with
three phases and concurrent pedestrian phases. Crosswalks are located on the southbound and westbound
approaches only.

Point Street at Richmond Street is a four-way signalized intersection. There is one all-purpose lane on each
approach, except for the Point Street eastbound approach which has two lanes, including a right turn only
lane. The storage length of the right turn lane is approximately 65'. The intersection is controlled by a two-
phase pretimed traffic signal. Unsignalized crosswalks are provided on all approaches.

Eddy Street at Allens Avenue/Globe Street is a signalized four-legged three-way intersection. The Eddy
Street/Globe Street intersection west of the median (which facilitates free flow southbound through
movements and right turns on Eddy Street and eastbound right turns from Globe Street), is not considered
part of this intersection analysis. There are two lanes on each approach, excluding the westbound approach
which only has one lane for all movements. The eastbound approach from Eddy Street has an exclusive left
turn only lane extending from the overpass, and the other lane is all-purpose. The northbound approach is
combined of through, and through-right turn lanes, and the southbound approach has a through and a
through-left turn lanes. The signal is an actuated-uncoordinated traffic signal with two phases and
concurrent pedestrian phases. There are crosswalks on all but the southbound approach.

Eddy Street at Dudley Street is a signalized three-way intersection at the southeast corner of the study area.
There are two lanes on each approach, each for a dedicated movement. The signal is actuated-uncoordinated
with an exclusive push-button activated pedestrian phase. Crosswalks are provided on all legs of the
intersection.

2.6 Unsignalized Intersections
Unsignalized roadway intersections within the study area with unique intersection geometry are described in
greater detail below.

Thayer Street at East Side Trolley Tunnel is an unsignalized intersection stop controlled on the minor approach,
exiting the tunnel. There are two one lane approaches due to the one-way southbound set up on Thayer
Street. There is a crosswalk across the tunnel entry/exit only.

Point Street at Hospital Street is an unsignalized four-way stop controlled intersection. There is one lane for all
movements on each approach. A bus stop is located on the nearside of the westbound approach.
Crosswalks are provided on all legs of the intersection.

Point Street at Chestnut Street is a three-way unsignalized intersection with one lane for all movements on each
approach. The Chestnut Street approach is stop controlled. A bus stop is located on the nearside of the
westbound approach. There are no crosswalks at the intersection.

Eddy Street at Richmond Street is a three leg unsignalized intersection; stop controlled on the Richmond Street
approach. There are three lanes on the northbound approaching, including a left turn only lane,
approximately 150' long. The southbound approach has two lanes. A small median enables free flow right
turns onto Richmond Street, although traffic count data at this location show that this movement is rare.
Left turns out of Richmond Street are not prohibited but the median along Eddy Street generally deters this
movement. As vehicles were observed making this left turn it was included in the traffic analysis. Crosswalks
are provided across the Richmond Street approach only.

Richmond Street at Elm Street is a four-way unsignalized intersection, stop controlled on all legs. There is one
lane for all movements on each approach. Crosswalks are provided on the Richmond Street southbound and
Elm Street eastbound approaches only.

3 TRAFFIC VOLUMES
3.1 Base Year Traffic Volumes
Traffic data collection and analysis was conducted at twelve high priority analysis locations in the study area.
These intersections were identified as important to understand the impacts associated with the
implementation of a streetcar and to adequately analyze and compare the traffic conditions along the
potential streetcar route:

    ·   Eddy Street at Dudley Street*
    ·   Eddy Street at Globe Street/Allens Avenue
    ·   Eddy Street at Richmond Street
    ·   Point Street at Richmond Street
    ·   Point Street at Chestnut Street*
    ·   Point Street at Hospital Street*
    ·   Richmond Street at Elm Street*
    ·   Francis Street at Memorial Boulevard
    ·   Francis Street at Finance Way*
    ·   Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard*
    ·   Washington Street at North Main Street*
    ·   Thayer Street at Fones Alley

Traffic volume data was compiled for the locations listed above for the weekday afternoon peak period (4:00
PM to 6:00 PM), since this period generally has the highest traffic volumes during a weekday. Traffic volume
data was obtained for each intersection from a variety of sources between 2008 and 2011 and supplemented
with additional counts taken in April 2011 (marked with an asterisk (*) above). In addition, an Automatic
Traffic Recorder (ATR) count was undertaken on Eddy Street, south of Allens Avenue, from April 5 through
7, 2011. This showed that the average volume on Eddy Street is approximately 12,100 vehicles per day. The
ATR data can be found in Appendix B.

In order to create a network of 2011 existing conditions using the mix of current and older data, a number of
adjustments were applied. Traffic counts from 2011 were used to adjust traffic volumes at surrounding
intersections where counts were completed in 2008-2010. These adjustments were necessary due to the
potential change in traffic flows within the area due to the I-way project. Eastbound and westbound through
volumes on Point Street were adjusted to match the 2011 counts conducted at Chestnut Street and Hospital
Street. Northbound and southbound volumes on Richmond Street were adjusted using the 2011 counts at
Elm Street and the 2009 counts at Eddy Street and Allens Avenue/Globe Street. Traffic volumes between
Eddy Street at Allens Avenue/Globe Street and Eddy Street at Dudley Street were not balanced due to the
presence of the Rhode Island Hospital.

These balanced volumes were used to create and analyze a 2011 existing condition. The existing traffic flow
networks are presented in Figure 13 for the weekday evening peak hour. The complete set of manual turning
movement count data can be found in Appendix C of this report.

3.2 Future Year Traffic Volumes
For planning purposes, the horizon year for the Core Connector Study is 2015. The No Build condition was
generated by growing the existing volumes by 2% over the four year projection period, to the build year of
2015. This growth rate was established based on average growth between 2010 and 2015, as developed by
the Rhode Island State Planning Program (RISPP), at various study area locations. For certain corridor

intersections, which overlap with the downtown recirculation project, future volumes were obtained from
volume projections supplied by VHB. These intersections include the following:

    ·   Washington Street / North Main Street;
    ·   Washington Street / Memorial Boulevard; and
    ·   Francis Street / Memorial Boulevard.

The remaining study area locations are not expected to be altered with the change in downtown circulation.
At these locations, the 2011 existing traffic volumes were grown to the future year 2015 and are listed below:

    ·   Thayer Street/Bus Tunnel;
    ·   Francis Street/Finance Way;
    ·   Point Street/Richmond Street;
    ·   Point Street/Hospital Street;
    ·   Point Street/Chestnut Street;
    ·   Richmond Street/Elm Street;
    ·   Eddy Street/Richmond Street;
    ·   Eddy Street/Globe Street/Allens Avenue; and
    ·   Eddy Street/Dudley Street.

The No Build traffic flow networks are presented in Figure 14 for the weekday evening peak hour.

Two Build scenarios were assessed to analyze the impacts of the two alternative streetcar routes:
   · Build Alternative 1 assumes the routing option through the Jewelry District via Eddy Street,
       Richmond Street, Ship Street, Chestnut Street and Elm Street.
   · Build Alternative 2 assumes the routing option through the Jewelry District via Globe Street,
       Hospital Street and Point Street.

The Build condition traffic volumes are the same as the No Build condition with the exception of the added
streetcar volumes. For each alternative, six streetcars per hour (10-minute service frequency) are assumed to

4 TRAFFIC OPERATION
In previous sections of this report, the quantity of traffic on the study area roadways was described. This
section describes the quality of traffic flow at the study area intersections for the given travel demands. As a
basis for this assessment, intersection capacity analyses were conducted using Synchro capacity analysis
software for the study area intersections under the 2011 Existing, 2015 No Build and both 2015 Build
weekday PM peak hour traffic conditions. This analysis is based on procedures contained in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) which is summarized below. A discussion of the evaluation criteria and a
summary of the results of the capacity analyses are also presented below.

4.1 Level-of-Service Criteria
Based on standard methodologies contained in the HCM, a detailed capacity/level-of-service analysis was
performed for the existing evening peak hour traffic volumes for the study area intersections. Operating
levels of service (LOS) are reported on a scale of A to F with A representing the best conditions (with little or
no delay) and F representing the worst operating conditions (long delays). Typically in an urban environment,
vehicle LOS D is acceptable.
At unsignalized intersections, a methodology for evaluating the relative functioning of intersections
controlled by stop or yield signs have been developed, and are based on several assumptions, including:

    ·   Major street flows are not affected by the minor (stop-sign controlled) street movements.
    ·   Left turns from the major street to the minor street are influenced only by opposing major street
        through flow.
    ·   Minor street left turns are impeded by all major street traffic plus opposing minor street traffic.
    ·   Minor street through traffic is impeded by all major street traffic.
    ·   Minor street right turns are impeded only by the major street traffic coming from the left.

The concept of stop-controlled or yield-controlled intersection analysis is based on the estimate of average
total delay on minor streets. The methodology of analysis relies on three elements: the size and distribution of
gaps in the major traffic stream, the usefulness of these gaps to the minor stream drivers, and the relative
priority of the various traffic streams at the intersection. The results of the analysis provide an estimate of
average total delay for the various critical movements at the unsignalized intersections. Correlation between
average total delay and the respective levels of service are provided for unsignalized intersections as shown in
Table 2.

                     Table 2: Level of Service Criteria for Unsignalized Intersections

                       Level of Service        Control Delay Per Vehicle (seconds)
                              A                              < 10.0
                              B                            10.1 to 15.0
                              C                            15.1 to 25.0
                              D                            25.1 to 35.0
                              E                            35.1 to 50.0
                              F                              > 50.0

At signalized intersections, an additional element must be considered: time allocation. Level of service is
based primarily on the average control delay per vehicle for various movements within the intersection.
Volume/capacity relationships also affect level of service. Thus, both volume/capacity and delay must be
considered to evaluate the overall operation of a signalized intersection. Correlation between average delay
per vehicle and the respective levels of service are provided for signalized intersections as shown in Table 3.

4.2 Capacity Analysis Results
A detailed capacity/level-of-service analysis was performed for all study area intersections based on the
weekday evening peak hour traffic volumes using standard methodologies contained in the HCM, as
described in the previous section. In summary, the results show that the streetcar volumes are very low (just
six vehicles per hour in each direction), and therefore the added traffic volumes to the network are low. The
added delay at any given intersection is thereby also minimal. It is worthy of note that some intersection LOS
actually improve at some intersections in the study area, and this is because of signal modifications or
installations at these locations (see Section 4.6 for recommendations regarding signal installation /
modification).

The capacity/level-of-service analysis results for the 2011 Existing, 2015 No Build and 2015 Build weekday
afternoon peak hours are summarized below in Table 4 and detailed results are presented in Appendices D,
E, F and G. Capacity and queue analysis summary results are provided in Appendix H.

A description of the capacity analysis results for each condition ­ Existing, No Build, Build Alternatives 1 (via
Richmond / Eddy Streets through Jewelry District) and Build Alternative 2 (via Coro Center) follows. The
results indicate that the implementation of the streetcar does not adversely impact traffic operations at the
study area intersections. The streetcar adds a small volume of traffic to the intersections, six vehicles per
hour in each direction, and causes momentary delays at stop locations, where it blocks traffic. These delays
averaged over the course of an hour are inconsequential to the study area traffic operations.

As described above, the streetcar is proposed to operate in mixed traffic. Therefore, the most significant
impact on traffic operations is expected to be at streetcar stops. When a streetcar is servicing a stop,
vehicular traffic will incur some additional delay due to the stopped streetcar. The HCM cites an average
dwell time of 60 seconds for a stop within a central business district; however, a shorter 15-20 seconds dwell
time is anticipated by the Project Team for the streetcar. To be conservative, a 60 second delay was assumed
for this analysis. Vehicles traveling behind a streetcar that is stopped at a station will also incur this delay.
However, the expected frequency of the streetcar is six streetcars per hour and the added delay will only
occur during those six times an hour. Therefore, the increase in delay each intersection over the whole peak
hour is expected to be minimal.

4.3 Existing Conditions
The capacity/level-of-service analysis results for the 2011 Base Year weekday afternoon peak hours are
presented in Appendix D and summarized in Table 4. 2011 Base Year capacity and queue analysis summary
results are also provided in Appendix H.

Based on the Existing Conditions capacity analysis summarized in Table 4, about half the number of
intersections within the study area currently operate at acceptable overall levels-of-service (LOS) of C or
better. The intersections of Francis St at Memorial Boulevard, and Point Street at Richmond Street, have the
lowest LOS ­ E, while Eddy Street at its intersections with Globe and Richmond Streets, and Point Street at
its intersections with Hospital Street and Chestnut Street operate at LOS D. Richmond Street at Elm Street,
and Francis Street at Finance Way, both operate at LOS A and experience a minimal average delay of less
than 10 seconds. Detailed analysis results are provided below on an intersection basis.

Signalized Intersections
Washington Street/North Main Street/East Side Trolley Tunnel operates well overall at LOS C and an average
intersection delay of 23 seconds. The intersection operates very well for bus movements. These movements
run concurrently with the Washington Street approach, and therefore operate very well. The northbound
through movement experiences the worst delay of 29 seconds, although the Washington Street through
movements is not far behind at 25 seconds. These delays are attributed to significantly high volumes on these
movements. Note that for analysis purposes only the intersections of Washington Street/North Main Street
and North Main Street/East Side Trolley Tunnel have been modeled separately.

Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard has a good LOS C overall, however the southbound left turn from
Memorial Boulevard onto Washington Street, over the bridge, experiences almost 70 seconds delay. This is
caused by the high volume of left turns, in a short left turn only lane that is already at its maximum length due
to the proximity of this intersection with Exchange Terrace.

Francis Street at Finance Way operates very well at LOS A. The worst movements are on the southbound
approach and they operate fine at LOS B with an average delay of 11 seconds.

Francis Street at Memorial Boulevard is the most complicated, busiest intersection of all the intersections in the
study area. It currently operates with a capacity of 93%. The overall LOS is E with an average delay of 70
seconds, but two left turn movements on the eastbound and northbound approaches, in addition to the
southbound left-through movement, operate at LOS F, with delays of 90-101 seconds. In significant contrast

                                                                                        Traffic Operations Impacts


the eastbound right turn movement operates with only 5 seconds delay. The eastbound approach, which
receives the greatest amount of signal time, experiences the least queuing but the other approaches experience
queues in excess of 300'.

Point Street at Richmond Street has poor operations because of the westbound approach. This approach has 500
through movements and an approach delay of 107 seconds, which brings the overall intersection LOS down
to E. The signal operates as pretimed. If the signal operated as actuated, the intersection would operate at an
overall LOS C with LOS D on the westbound approach. This modification may require new signal
equipment at this location.

Eddy Street at Dudley Street operates well with an overall LOS B. All movements operate fairly well, with the
exception of left turns from Dudley Street onto Eddy Street which incurs average delays of 38 seconds.

Eddy Street at Allens Avenue/Globe Street has a low LOS D for the intersection overall, which is primarily driven
by the delays on the eastbound approach on Eddy Street. Both the left and through-right turn lanes
experience 77 seconds delay operating at LOS E. Other approaches operate at LOS B.

Unsignalized Intersections
Thayer Street at East Side Trolley Tunnel operates well. The bus movements incur the greatest delay of 10
seconds, albeit minimal, because of the high volume of free flow movements on Thayer Street for which the
bus must wait for a gap in traffic to make the turn.

Point Street at Hospital Street is currently operating at LOS B, but the westbound approach is at LOS D, with an
average delay of 31 seconds.

Point Street at Chestnut Street has a LOS D with an average delay of 28 seconds on the southbound approach to
this T intersection. The primary east-west volumes move well since there is minimal delay to the free-flow
approaches.

Eddy Street at Richmond Street has a LOS D with an average delay of 33 seconds on the Richmond Street stop
controlled approach, and LOS C, average delay of 21 seconds on the Eddy Street left turn movement onto
Richmond Street. Both the northbound through and southbound through-right turns operate with no delay.

Richmond Street at Elm Street has relatively low traffic volume on all approaches, therefore the intersection
operates very well at LOS A and minimal delay on all approaches (maximum 9 seconds).

4.4 Future No Build
The capacity/level-of-service analysis results for the 2015 No Build Year weekday afternoon peak hours are
presented in Appendix E and summarized above in Table 4. 2015 No Build Year capacity and queue analysis
summary results are provided in Appendix H.

Based on the No Build Conditions capacity analysis summarized in Table 4, the overall intersection LOS
declines at only one intersection from Existing to Future; this occurs at Eddy Street/Richmond Street where
it drops from LOS D to E. Overall intersection delay increases or decreases slightly or remains the same,
depending on the intersection. At Eddy Street and Richmond Street, although the LOS worsens, the delay
only increases by 5 seconds. The greatest increase in delay is approximately 8 seconds and occurs at
Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard. Detailed analysis results are provided below on an intersection-
specific basis.

                                                                                        Traffic Operations Impacts


Signalized Intersections
Washington Street/North Main Street/East Side Trolley Tunnel retains the same LOS C and in fact has a slightly
reduced overall delay (by 2 seconds) in the No Build results generated by VHB. VHB's analysis assumes
lower volumes on all approaches, most significantly a reduction in eastbound lefts from 425 to 270. This is
attributed to the proposed new circulation pattern around the City.

Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard also maintains the same LOS C, but it incurs a slightly higher average
delay for the overall intersection, an increase of 8 seconds. The worst existing movement at this intersection
­ southbound left increases from 69 to 142 seconds. Other delay changes are negligible. These analysis
results, also generated by VHB, assume higher volumes on the southbound approach and slightly lower
volumes on the northbound approach. The proposed new circulation pattern around the City is the rationale
for these changes in the approach volumes.

Francis Street at Finance Way has no change in LOS A and a negligible change in delay (less than 1 second on
any approach) in this scenario.

Francis Street at Memorial Boulevard continues to have an overall LOS E, with mostly minor changes in LOS and
delay. The westbound approach improves from LOS E to D (as the delay reduces from 80 to 44 seconds),
but the northbound through-right movement declines from E to F, as the delay almost doubles from 60 to
105 seconds. The northbound left approach is also worthy of note since it continues to fail and the delay
increases by 32 seconds. The analysis at this intersection, by VHB, assumes lower volumes at the intersection
than in the existing conditions.

Point Street at Richmond Street has no change in LOS E, and there is only a slight increase in delay (by 7 seconds)
on the westbound approach because of the 2% growth factor applied to the traffic volumes.

Eddy Street at Dudley Street remains at the same LOS B, with less than one second changes in delay in the No
Build condition, also attributable to the 2% growth factor.

Eddy Street at Allens Avenue/Globe Street results in just a three second higher delay overall with no change in
LOS D, however the eastbound approach delay increases by 10 seconds to 88 seconds for both lanes. These
increases are caused by the 2% growth in overall traffic volumes.

Unsignalized Intersections
The following unsignalized intersections have little or no change from the existing to the No Build scenario.
Any minor change can be explained by the 2% growth in traffic in the study area.

Thayer Street at East Side Trolley Tunnel does not change in any way from the existing conditions.

Point Street at Hospital Street has an increase in delay of just three seconds on the westbound approach. All
other approaches remain the same within 1 second or less.

Point Street at Chestnut Street experiences minimal change in delay ­ two seconds increase on the southbound
approach, and no change on the other approaches.

Eddy Street at Richmond Street continues to maintain a LOS E with an increased delay of five seconds on the
Richmond Street approach.

Richmond Street at Elm Street does not change from the existing conditions LOS A or the delay on any
approach.

4.5 Future Build
The capacity/level-of-service analysis results for the 2015 Build Year weekday afternoon peak hours are
presented in Appendices F and G and summarized above in Table 4. 2015 No Build Year capacity and queue
analysis summary results are provided in Appendix H.

In the Future Build conditions, signal installations and modifications necessary for the implementation of a
streetcar along the corridor (as identified in the conceptual track alignment as of May 2011) were accounted
for. In addition, the number of times the streetcar would block a travel lane while serving a stop, were also
added to the traffic analysis. This was assumed to be six times per hour per direction and the dwell time was
conservatively assumed to be 60 seconds, although the project team estimates only 15-20 seconds delay for
the streetcar. The analysis of these two Build alternatives represents how each of the study area intersections
is expected to operate on average over the course of the afternoon peak hour. Detailed analysis results are
provided below on an intersection-specific basis.

Analysis results show that the streetcar does not adversely affect traffic operations due to the low added
streetcar volumes and the limited number of times the streetcar would block traffic at the intersection;
maximum six times per hour. Traffic operations at some intersections improve due to signal timing
modifications.

The capacity analysis results at the following intersections do not vary between the Future Build Alternatives
1 (via Richmond / Eddy Streets through the Jewelry District) and 2 (via Coro Center).

Signalized Intersections ­ No Variation between Future Build Alternatives
Washington Street/North Main Street/East Side Trolley Tunnel changes ever so slightly from the No Build to the
Build condition because of the added streetcars to the East Side Trolley Tunnel. The impact is less than a
one second delay increase for buses/streetcars entering and exiting the tunnel.

Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard requires modification to the signal timing and phasing in order to
accommodate the proposed contra flow streetcar lane on the westbound approach on Washington Street.
With the additional phase for this movement and retiming of the signal operations the same LOS C is
maintained from the No Build, but the delay is reduced to closer to existing conditions, and the average delay
for each approach is more evenly distributed (ranging from 13 to 49 seconds) when compared to the Existing
condition (11 to 69 seconds) and No Build condition (13 to 142 seconds). This additional phase will only
activate when the streetcar is detected on this approach.

Francis Street at Finance Way remains unchanged at LOS A in the Existing, No Build and Build conditions.
Average delay does not change from the No Build to the Build scenario.

Francis Street at Memorial Boulevard also remains unchanged at LOS E in the Existing, No Build and Build
conditions. Average delay does not change from the No Build to the Build scenario.

Eddy Street at Dudley Street retains the same signal timing and phasing in the Build scenario. A LOS B is
retained through each scenario, and the average delay increases by no more than six seconds on any
approach, with the addition of the streetcar eastbound left and southbound right turn movements.

Eddy Street at Allens Avenue/Globe Street does not change from LOS D in the Existing, No Build and Build
conditions. The average delay increases by less than two seconds on the eastbound and northbound
approaches from the No Build to the Build scenario with the projected number of streetcar movements
added to the eastbound left turn on Eddy Street.

Thayer Street at East Side Trolley Tunnel becomes signalized with the addition of the streetcar. A LOS B for the
buses/streetcars exiting the tunnel is retained and the additional delay at this intersection is less than one
second; therefore there is no impact on this intersection. Note that the traffic impacts should be reevaluated
as preliminary engineering proceeds on this end-of-line location, so that the traffic impacts of the end-of-line
design treatment can be fully determined.

Signalized Intersections ­ Variation between Future Build Alternatives
Capacity analysis results at the following intersections differ in the Future Build scenarios, depending on the
Alternative. Alternative 1 uses Richmond and Eddy Streets through the Jewelry District, while Alternative 2
uses Globe, Hospital, and Point Streets to access the Coro Center.

Point Street at Richmond Street remains relatively unchanged from the No Build to the Build scenarios, and both
retain the same overall LOS E. With Alternative 1 the delay on the north and south bound approaches
increases by less than 2 seconds with the added streetcar movement. With Alternative 2 (i.e. via Coro
Center)) the slightly higher delay is mostly on the eastbound left-through lane which is the only movement
undertaken by the streetcar in this scenario.

Eddy Street at Richmond Street becomes signalized in the Build scenario, and analysis results vary depending on
the Alternative. The same two phases are proposed in both scenarios but with a variation in signal timing.
The average delay for each approach is more equally distributed with the signalization of this intersection. In
Alternative 1 a 90 second cycle is proposed to accommodate the streetcar movements. An overall LOS B
would result in the maximum delay being 39 seconds (LOS D) on the northbound left. In Alternative 2,
where there are no streetcar movements, an 80 second cycle time is proposed that would result in an overall
LOS B. The LOS and delay on the northbound left in this scenario would be LOS D and 35 seconds.
Therefore there is minimal difference between the alternatives.

Richmond Street at Elm Street also becomes signalized in both Build scenarios, thus maintaining the same LOS A
from Existing through to the Build scenarios. In Alternative 1 the eastbound right and northbound through
movements are performed by the streetcar. A 40 second cycle time with two equal phases is proposed to
provide a LOS A at the intersection. The worst delay would be only 7 seconds on the westbound approach.
In Alternative 2 a 90 second cycle time is proposed with two phases that would also yield a LOS A, with a
maximum delay of 8 seconds on the westbound approach. Similar to Richmond's intersection with Eddy
Street there is minimal difference between the alternatives.

Unsignalized Intersections
Point Street at Hospital Street remains unsignalized with a four-way stop control with the same operational
results between the No Build and the Build Alternative 1, since there are no streetcar movements. For Build
Alternative 2 signalization of the intersection is recommended to facilitate the northbound right and
westbound left turns of the streetcar. A 90 second cycle, two phase control, is proposed that would yield an
overall LOS A. The maximum delay at the intersection would be 11 seconds on the northbound approach.
Overall at the intersection the LOS improves and delay is reduced on all approaches with the signalization.
There are minimal differences between the alternatives with the addition of a signal, in conjunction with
Alternative 2.

Point Street at Chestnut Street would also remain unsignalized and there is no impact in Alternative 1, without
any streetcar movements. For Build Alternative 2 signalization of the intersection is recommended to enable
the streetcar to make its southbound right turn movements. A 90 second cycle with two phases is proposed.
With the proposed signal timing and phasing an overall LOS B should be maintained. Although this means
there is an increase in delay on the eastbound (from one to seven seconds) and westbound (from 0 to 11
seconds) approaches, the delay on the southbound approach is halved from 30 to 13 seconds.

4.6 Recommended Mitigation
As seen in Table 4 above, the analysis shows that the streetcar has little impact on traffic operations over the
peak hour at the study intersections. At some locations, traffic operations actually improve over the No Build
condition. This is the case at intersections where signalization is required or an existing signal will be
modified as part of the implementation of the streetcar. The locations with proposed signal installation
include:

    ·   Eddy Street at Richmond Street (Alt 1 & 2);
    ·   Richmond Street at Elm Street (Alt 1 & 2);
    ·   Thayer Street at East Side Trolley Tunnel (Alt 1 & 2);
    ·   Point Street at Hospital Street (Alt 2 only); and
    ·   Point Street at Chestnut Street (Alt 2 only).

With the implementation of traffic signals at these locations, there is an opportunity to improve traffic
operations along the corridor.

Signal modifications, including signal phasing and timing changes, are required at certain intersections in
order to accommodate any special movements to be made by the streetcar. Signal modifications would be
required at the following locations:

    ·   Eddy Street at Globe Street/Allens Avenue (streetcar crossing of intersection);
    ·   Chestnut Street at Pine Street (to enter northbound streetcar-only lane);
    ·   Chestnut Street at Broad Street / Weybosset Street (to exit northbound streetcar-only lane);
    ·   Washington Street at Memorial Boulevard (to enter/exit dedicated streetcar lane); and
    ·   Washington Street at North Main Street (to enter/exit dedicated streetcar lane).

Traffic signal installation or modifications were the only changes applied to the corridor. If existing roadways
are converted into one-way couplets, further analysis will be necessary.


5 CONCLUSIONS
As described above, the streetcar is proposed to operate in mixed traffic. Therefore, the most significant
impact on traffic operations is expected to be at streetcar stops. When a streetcar is servicing a stop,
vehicular traffic will incur some additional delay due to the stopped streetcar. The Highway Capacity Manual
2000 cites an average dwell time of 60 seconds for a stop within a central business district. The Providence
Streetcar is expected to have dwell times of 15-20 seconds; however, a 60 second delay was assumed in this
analysis to be conservative. Vehicles traveling behind a streetcar that is stopped at a station will also incur this
delay. However, the expected frequency of the streetcar is six streetcars per hour and the added delay will
only occur during those six times an hour. The increase in delay at each intersection, when averaged over the
whole peak hour, is expected to be minimal.

To accommodate some of the traffic flow changes to enable streetcar operations, modifications would be
needed at identified unsignalized intersections. General traffic is anticipated to benefit from these changes.

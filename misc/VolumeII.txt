INTRODUCTION


Initial Study

Pursuant to Section 15063 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines (Title 14,
California Code of Regulations, Sections 15000 et seq.), an Initial Study is a preliminary environmental
analysis that is used by the lead agency as a basis for determining whether an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR), a Mitigated Negative Declaration, or a Negative Declaration is required for a project. The
State CEQA Guidelines require that an Initial Study contain a project description, description of
environmental setting, identification of environmental effects by checklist or other similar form,
explanation of environmental effects, discussion of mitigation for significant environmental effects,
evaluation of the project's consistency with existing, applicable land use controls, and the names of
persons who prepared the study.

The purpose of this Initial Study is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed San
José City College (SJCC) 2025 Facilities Master Plan (FMP) and to determine what level of additional
environmental review, if any, is appropriate. As shown in the Determination in Section IV of this
document and based on the analysis contained in this Initial Study, it has been determined that the
proposed SJCC 2025 FMP could result in potentially significant impacts; therefore, preparation of an EIR
is appropriate.

Anticipated Project Approvals

The San José/Evergreen Community College District (SJECCD) will prepare an EIR that fully evaluates
the environmental effects associated with the implementation of the proposed 2025 FMP. Necessary
project approvals are anticipated to include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following by the
SJECCD Board of Trustees (anticipated in spring/summer 2011/2012):

      Certification of the SJCC 2025 FMP EIR and

      Approval of the proposed SJCC 2025 FMP.


Public and Agency Review

The Notice of Preparation (NOP) and this Initial Study will be circulated for public and agency review
from August 7, 2012 through September 7, 2012. Copies of the Initial Study are available during normal
operating hours at the District office at the address below and online at http://www.sjcc.edu. Comments
on the NOP/Initial Study must be received by 5:00 PM on September 7, 2012. They may be e-mailed to

II.         PROJECT LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION

1.      Description of project:

        Location: San José City College is located at 2100 Moorpark Avenue in central San José in Santa
        Clara County. The location of the campus within the City of San José is shown in Figure 1,
        Regional and Site Location. The campus is immediately south of Interstate 280 (I-280) and is
        bounded by Moorpark Avenue to the north, Rexford Way, Kingman Avenue and Fruitdale
        Avenue to the south, Laswell Avenue and South Bascom Avenue to the west, and Leigh Avenue to
        the east. Overall the campus encompasses about 54.5 acres.

        Project Need: The 2025 FMP translates the program space needs established in the SJCC 2025
        Educational Master Plan into physical facilities on campus. According to the 2025 Educational
        Master Plan for the SJCC campus, total enrollment on campus is expected to reach approximately
        14,500 students by 2025, which equates to 9,400 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) students (FTES). Based
        on these projections, future program needs on campus total approximately 353,500 square feet of
        space. The amount of space required on campus takes into account of all facility needs of the
        campus ­ academic space as well as space for support services. The 2025 FMP determined that
        SJCC has more space than it needs to house the 2025 program of instruction and related support
        services. However, SJCC does show modest space needs in a few categories. These will be best met
        through the remodel or replacement of existing space on campus.

        Project Characteristics: The 2025 FMP involves the reorganization of campus facilities and the
        reconfiguration of campus access and circulation. The proposed 2025 FMP for the SJCC campus is
        depicted in Figure 2, San Jose City College 2025 Facilities Master Plan.1 The recommendations
        contained in the 2025 FMP address the current and projected needs of the campus through 2025.

        Facility recommendations contained in the 2025 FMP include demolition/removal of existing
        buildings on campus; construction of new buildings; and renovation of existing buildings on
        campus to meet the future programs needs as outlined in 2025 Educational Master Plan.
        A description of each of these elements is provided below.

        Recommended Demolition/Removal
        The 2025 FMP identifies several buildings for demolition/removal to eliminate non-functioning
        space and replace outdated facilities with new facilities. Facilities identified for
        demolition/removal include Drama/Theater, 100 Wing, 200 Wing, 300 Wing, Boiler Plant, Pool,
        General Education Building (partial), Auxiliary Gym, Field House, Handball Courts, Portable
        Restroom Building, and Locker Rooms. The location of each of these facilities is shown in Figure 3,
        Recommended Demolition/Removal Plan.

        New Construction Projects
        Descriptions of the new construction projects planned on the SJCC campus are organized below


1     The Multidisciplinary Classrooms & Arts Complex is listed by the 2025 FMP as currently being under
      construction. The project has under gone separate California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review, and is
      not included under the CEQA review for the 2025 FMP.

0461.003                                                                                                           August 2012
        into groups based on campus location. The order of the projects does not reflect priority order or a
        recommended sequence of development. Preliminary phasing plans will be developed following
        the completion of the 2025 FMP and will be tied to availability of funding.

        Physical Education Complex - The proposed Physical Education (PE) Complex would support a
        number of athletic and physical education needs at SJCC, including disabled and adaptive PE
        program needs. The PE Complex would include three primary elements ­ a main gymnasium, a
        fitness center, and an aquatics facility. The complex replaces space that would be removed with the
        demolition of the Locker Rooms, Auxiliary Gym, Field House, Handball Courts, and Swimming
        Pool. Preliminary plans include locker rooms; team rooms; an athletic weight room; educational
        spaces; faculty offices; cardio and weight rooms for fitness; concessions; and potentially a
        25-meter, 10- to 12-lane swimming pool.

        Vocational Technology Building - The proposed Vocational Technology Building and yard would
        replace the existing 100, 200, and 300 Wing buildings, consolidate all the Vocational Technology
        programs together, and provide instructional space. This building would include, but is not
        limited to, the Applied Science and Technology Division, which includes the programs for Air
        Conditioning/Refrigeration Technology, Electrician Apprenticeship, Facilities Maintenance, Laser
        Technology, Machine Technology, Solar, and Transit.

        Performing Arts Center ­ The proposed Performing Arts Center would replace the existing
        Theatre, Drama, and Speech Buildings with a new facility in a central location on campus. The new
        facility would provide state-of-the-art instructional space to support program needs. A new
        theater would include the support spaces required to support a variety of performances and
        community activities. The proposed location would be accessed from the proposed new drop-off
        along Moorpark Avenue and tie into the newly developed main campus quad. This link to the
        campus core would include a new Performing Arts Plaza that could be used for receptions before
        and after events.

        General Education Building ­ The proposed General Education Building would replace the
        portions of the existing General Education Building that are recommended for removal as part of
        the 2025 FMP. The new facility would provide instructional space to support the program needs.
        The proposed location for this new building would create easy access to interdisciplinary
        instructional spaces along the campus promenade and adjacent to other instructional buildings on
        the west side of the campus. The proposed placement of the building would create an edge to the
        newly developed Vo Tech Plaza and provide outdoor activity and gathering spaces for the campus
        community.

        Renovation Projects
        The 2025 FMP recommends two types of renovations ­ change of use and renovation of existing
        buildings. A description of renovation projects planned on the SJCC campus is provided below.
        The order of the projects does not reflect priority order or a recommended sequence of
        development. The 2025 FMP recommends that these renovations be addressed on an as-needed
        basis and aligned with ongoing deferred maintenance projects.

        Change of Use ­ The 2025 FMP recommends that the vacated floors of the existing High
        Technology Center be repurposed to support the instructional program needs identified in the
        2025 Educational Master Plan. In addition, Building K is recommended to be renovated to support

        the Maintenance and Operations function of the college.

        Existing Buildings ­ SJCC has some buildings on campus that date back to the 1950s and 1960s.
        Many of these are in need of extensive renovation in order to support the programs that are
        housed there. The 2025 FMP identifies one of the buildings in the General Education Building
        Complex and the Business Building as facilities in need of renovation. In addition, the Jaguar
        Gymnasium (currently Main Gym) has been identified as an important building to preserve.

        Site Improvements
        In addition to the recommendations for facilities, a series of site improvement recommendations
        are identified in the 2025 FMP consisting of a recommended vehicular circulation plan, a
        recommended pedestrian circulation plan, and recommended landscape improvements. These are
        shown in Figure 4, Recommended Vehicular Circulation Plan; Figure 5, Recommended
        Pedestrian Circulation Plan; and Figure 6, Recommended Landscape Improvements.


2.      Project objectives:
        The primary objective of the 2025 FMP is to provide the necessary facilities to accommodate the
            planned 2025 student population for the SJCC campus. Detailed objectives will be developed
            in the Draft EIR.

3.      Surrounding land uses and environmental setting:

        The SJCC campus is in an urban setting and is surrounded by a variety of land uses. They include
        commercial uses and Valley Medical Center to the west, single-family and multi-family residential
        uses to the east and south, and I-280 to the north, with single-family residential uses across the
        freeway. Homes to the north of the campus are in unincorporated Santa Clara County. Figure 7,
        Surrounding Land Uses depicts the location of these land uses in relation to the SJCC campus.


4.      Discretionary approval authority and other public agencies whose approval is required:

        As the public entity principally responsible for approving or carrying out the proposed project, the
        SJECCD is the Lead Agency under CEQA and is responsible for reviewing and certifying the
        adequacy of the environmental document and approving the proposed project. The SJECCD Board
        of Trustees would make the decision on project approval.

        The project may also require approval by the following public agencies:
         Division of the State Architect (DSA) for buildings, handicap accessibility, fire and life safety;
              City of San Jose Public Works and Traffic;
              City of San Jose Fire Department for site access and fire hydrants/water pressure;
              Santa Clara County Water District;
              San Jose Municipal Water District; and
              California Department of Transportation for work in proximity to I-280.

IV.         DETERMINATION:

On the basis of the initial evaluation that follows:

           I find that the proposed project WOULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and a
   
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

           I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there
           will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been made that will
   
           avoid or reduce any potential significant effects to a less than significant level. A MITIGATED
           NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.

           I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment. An
           ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT will be prepared.

V.          EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

During the completion of the environmental evaluation, the SJECCD relied on the following categories of
impacts, noted as column headings in the IS checklist.

A)         "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that the project's
           effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impacts" for which
           effective mitigation may not be possible, an EIR will be prepared.

B)         "Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies where the incorporation of
           project-specific mitigation would reduce an effect from "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less
           Than Significant Impact."

C)         "Less Than Significant Impact" applies where the project would not result in a significant effect
           (i.e., the project impact would be less than significant without the need to incorporate mitigation).

D)         "No Impact" applies where the project would not result in any impact in the category or the
           category does not apply. This may be because the impact category does not apply to the proposed
           project (for instance, the project site is not within a surface fault rupture hazard zone), or because
           of other project-specific factors.

 1. AESTHETICS ­ Would the project:

 a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?                                                            
 b) Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but
 not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic                                                             
 buildings within a state scenic highway?

 c) Substantially degrade the existing visual character or                                                          
 quality of the site and its surroundings?

 d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare
 which would adversely affect day or nighttime views in                                                             
 the area?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
topography of the campus is relatively flat, and the campus is completely developed. Based on a review
of the San José 2020 General Plan, there are no scenic vistas that include the campus as a major part of the
view. I-280, which is located adjacent to Moorpark Avenue to the north of campus, is designated as a
Landscaped Throughway by the City of San José 2020 General Plan (San José 1994).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) A scenic vista is generally defined as an expansive view of highly valued landscape as observable from
a publicly accessible vantage point. There are no scenic vistas that include the campus as a major part of
the view. In addition, the campus and surrounding area are characterized by flat topography and do not
contain any ridgelines or other topographic forms that would be affected by development or that provide
views of the campus and its surroundings (SJECCD 2008). Ground-level views into the campus from
surrounding areas are limited by buildings and trees on campus, and views of the surrounding areas are
also limited by flat topography and extensive urban development. There are thus no scenic vistas in the
campus area. Based on these factors, the proposed project would have no impact with regard to this
criterion.

b) There are no state-designated scenic highways in the vicinity of the campus (CSHP 2011). I-280, which
is located adjacent to Moorpark Avenue to the north of the campus, is designated as a Landscaped
Throughway in the City's General Plan. However, the I-280 roadway is up to 15 feet below the
surrounding ground level in the area of the campus, and the only parts of campus visible to drivers are
the top of the Theatre building (which is about 65 feet tall) and tops of some trees. Implementation of the
2025 FMP would result in the demolition of the Theatre building; however, the removal of the Theatre
building would not substantially affect views along this portion of I-280 as the area would still be highly

0461.003                                                                                                        August 2012
urbanized. Therefore, changes in the site's visual character as a result of the 2025 FMP would not affect
visual resources associated with any state-designated or local scenic highway. There would be no impact
with regard to this criterion.

c) Facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would be similar in type and scale to existing facilities on the
campus, and new facilities would be constructed entirely within the campus. However, there is still the
potential that implementation of the 2025 FMP could alter the existing visual character and quality of the
campus as viewed from the surrounding neighborhoods. In addition, the construction of facilities
identified in the 2025 FMP could result in the loss of mature trees, which would further alter the existing
visual character of the campus. This represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of the 2025
FMP on the existing visual character or quality of the campus and its surroundings will be analyzed in
the EIR.

d) Existing buildings on the campus are a source of light and glare, and cars on campus may also be a
source of glare. Other sources of existing light and glare on campus include sports facilities and lighting
in parking lots and along pathways. New buildings proposed under the 2025 FMP would shift some light
and glare sources within the campus, and could increase light and glare in parts of the campus. This
represents a potentially significant impact. The effects of light and glare associated with the 2025 FMP on
the campus and its surroundings will be analyzed in the EIR.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The proposed project combined with other current projects and probable future projects and projected
regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to visual character. This issue
will be addressed in the EIR.

 2. AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY RESOURCES ­
 Would the project:

 a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
 Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland), as
 shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland                                                                    
 Mapping and Monitoring Program of the California
 Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?

 b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a                                                            
 Williamson Act contract?

 c) Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of,
 forest land (as defined in Public Resources Code section
 12220(g)), timberland (as defined in Public Resources                                                                  
 Code Section 4526), or Timberland zoned Timberland
 Production (as defined by Government Code section
 51104(g))?

 d) Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest                                                           
 land to non-forest use?

 e) Involve other changes in the existing environment,
 which, due to their location or nature, could result in                                                                
 conversion of Farmland, to non-agricultural use or
 conversion of forest land to non-forest use?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
campus is designated as Urban and Built-Up Land on maps prepared by the California State Department
of Conservation pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) (FMMP 2011).

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The entire campus is developed and located in a densely developed area of the City of San José. The
campus is not used for agriculture, and is not designated as Farmland on maps prepared pursuant to the
FMMP. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

b-c) The campus is zoned for urban use by the City of San José. No portion of the campus is zoned for
agricultural use, forest land, or timberland. In addition, there is no Williamson Act contract applicable to
the campus. Therefore, future development on the campus would not conflict with existing zoning for
agricultural or forest land or timberland use or with a Williamson Act contract. There would be no
impact with regard to this criterion.

d) The campus and surrounding area does not include any forest land or timberland. There would be no
impact with regard to this criterion.

e) No Farmland or other agricultural land is present in the vicinity of the campus. Therefore,
implementation of the 2025 FMP would not involve any changes that could indirectly cause conversion of
Farmland to non-agricultural use. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The City of San José is urban in nature, and is not designated as Farmland on maps prepared pursuant to
the FMMP. As a result, anticipated future development in San José, including the future development on
the campus under the 2025 FMP, would not result in the loss of important farmland. In addition, land in
the City is zoned for urban uses. Therefore, anticipated future development in San José would not
displace land zoned for agricultural use or forest land or timberland, and would not conflict with land
under a Williamson Act contact. The impact of cumulative development on agricultural and forest
resources would be less than significant.

 3. AIR QUALITY ­ Where available, the significance
 criteria established by the applicable air quality
 management or air pollution control district may be
 relied upon to make the following determinations.
 Would the project:

 a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the                                                                   
 applicable air quality plan?

 b) Violate any air quality standard or contribute
 substantially to an existing or projected air quality                                                                
 violation?

 c) Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of
 any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-
 attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient                                                              
 air quality standard (including releasing emissions
 which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
 precursors)?

 d) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant                                                               
 concentrations?

 e) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial
 number of people?                                                                                                    

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
nearest sensitive receptors to the campus include single-family and multifamily residential uses adjacent
to the east and south, and single-family residential uses to the north across I-280. Other sensitive
receptors in the vicinity of the campus include the Valley Medical Center to the west.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a-c) The campus is located in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin, which is currently designated a non-
attainment area for PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter), PM2.5 (particulate matter
less than 2.5 microns in diameter), and ozone. Construction and operation of facilities identified in the
2025 FMP would be likely to add incrementally to regional ambient air pollutant emissions including
short- and long-term emissions of criteria air pollutants from mobile and stationary sources. This
represents a potentially significant impact. The EIR will estimate the total emissions from construction
and operation of future buildings identified in the 2025 FMP and evaluate whether the emissions would

0461.003                                                                                                           August 2012
exceed the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) recommended thresholds for
evaluating impacts from criteria pollutant emissions.

d) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would result in on-site emissions of diesel
particulate matter, which the California Air Resources Board has identified as a toxic air contaminant. In
addition, operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP could impact nearby sensitive receptors by
creating the potential for localized carbon monoxide (CO) hotspots. This represents a potentially
significant impact. The EIR will evaluate concentrations of CO, toxic air contaminants, and other
pollutants associated with the 2025 FMP to determine whether they would result in a significant effect on
sensitive receptors.

e) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would require the use of diesel-fueled equipment
and architectural coatings, both of which have an associated odor. However, these odors would be short-
term and temporary and would not be pervasive enough to affect a substantial number of people or to be
objectionable. Routine operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would not involve activities that
typically produce odors such as wastewater treatment, manufacturing, agriculture, etc. Occasional use of
maintenance products on the campus could produce localized odors, but they would be temporary and
limited in area. Consequently, odors associated with short-term construction and long-term operation of
facilities under the 2025 FMP would not cause or be affected by odors, and the impact would be less than
significant.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP combined with other current
projects and probable future projects and projected regional growth could result in significant cumulative
impacts with regard to air quality. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The entire
campus is developed and located in a densely developed area of the City of San José. There are no natural
habitats present on the campus, with the campus consisting entirely of buildings, paved parking lots and
walking areas, athletic fields, and landscaped areas.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) The most recent version of the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) was reviewed for the
campus and surrounding area. No special-status species have been documented on the campus, but
several special-status wildlife species have been documented in nearby urban areas, including Cooper's
hawk (Accipiter cooperii), American peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum), and hoary bat (Lasiurus
cinereus). American peregrine falcon is a state Fully Protected species and a federal Bird of Conservation
Concern. Cooper's hawk and hoary bat are included on the California Department of Fish and Game
(CDFG) Special Animals List, but do not have any formal state or federal protection status.2

According to the CNDDB, due to the presence of suitable habitat attributes, there is a potential for
Cooper's hawk to nest in the clusters of trees on the campus. American peregrine falcon is known to nest
nearby at San José City Hall. As this species nests on tall buildings in urbanized locations, it could nest on
the large buildings on the campus. While hoary bat has been documented in the area, the potential for
this or other bat species to roost on the campus is considered low. The campus is located in a heavily
developed area and there is no favorable foraging habitat on the campus. Therefore, this species is
presumed absent from the campus. Similarly, given the developed condition of the campus, suitable
habitat for other special-status wildlife species known from the project region (e.g., burrowing owl,
California tiger salamander), and for special-status plant species, is absent.

In the event that Cooper's hawk and/or American peregrine falcon were to nest on the campus,
development under the 2025 FMP could result in the direct loss or noise-related disturbance of an active
nest of these species. This is considered a potentially significant impact. However, with implementation
of Mitigation Measure BIO-1, which requires a preconstruction survey and avoidance of active nests, the
impact would be reduced to a less than significant level. It should also be noted that numerous common
bird species could nest on the campus and that the active nests of all raptor species and most common
bird species are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the California Fish and Game Code.

            Mitigation Measure BIO-1: When outdoor construction activities within 100 feet of landscape
            plantings would commence during the nesting/breeding season of native bird species potentially
            nesting on the site (typically February through August in the project region), a pre-construction
            survey for nesting birds shall be conducted by a qualified biologist not more than four weeks
            before commencement of construction activities. The surveys shall continue on a weekly basis
            with the last survey being conducted no more than three days before the start of
            clearance/construction work.

            If active nests are found in areas that could be directly affected or are within 100 feet (300 feet if
            adjacent to natural vegetation) of construction and would be subject to prolonged construction-
            related noise, no-disturbance buffer zones of 100 feet (300 feet adjacent to natural areas) shall be

      of their legal or protection status.

            created around active nests during the breeding season or until a qualified biologist determines
            that all young have fledged. The size of the buffer zones and types of construction activities
            restricted within them shall be determined through consultation with the CDFG, taking into
            account factors such as the following:

                           Noise and human disturbance levels at the construction site at the time of the survey
                           and the noise and disturbance expected during the construction activity;
                           Distance and amount of vegetation or other screening between the construction site
                           and the nest; and
                           Sensitivity of individual nesting species and behaviors of the nesting birds.

b) The campus is completely developed, and no riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community is
present on the campus. Therefore, the project would not affect riparian habitat or other sensitive natural
communities. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

c) The campus is completely developed, and no wetlands, as defined by the federal Clean Water Act or
the California Fish and Game Code, are present on campus. There would be no impact with respect to
this criterion.

d) The entire campus is developed and located in a densely developed area. As the campus is bordered
on all sides by dense development, it does not provide habitat connectivity between undeveloped lands
and is not part of a regional wildlife movement corridor. Therefore, there would be no impact to wildlife
movement as a result of 2025 FMP implementation. As previously discussed, various bird species could
nest on the campus, but the implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-1 (see above) would address
potential impacts to nesting birds and the campus' potential function as a "wildlife nursery site" for birds.

e) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP may require the removal of some trees, regardless
of health, to facilitate development or to mitigate potentially hazardous circumstances related to their
proximity to existing facilities. The City of San José has a tree ordinance that requires a permit for
removal of any trees on private property that have a trunk circumference of 56 inches or more, measured
2 feet above grade. As a state entity, the SJECCD is exempted by the state constitution from compliance
with local land use regulations and ordinances. There would be no impact with respect to this criterion.

f) No adopted habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan applies to the campus.
There would be no impact with respect to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in some portions of San José has the potential to adversely affect
biological resources in the City. However, with mitigation, future development under the 2025 FMP
would have no project-level impacts on biological resources. Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP
would not make a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact on biological resources
that could result from other development in the City.

 significance of a historical resource as defined in

 feature?

 d) Disturb any human remains, including those                                                                       
 interred outside of formal cemeteries?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The ages
of buildings on the campus range from the 1950s through the 1980s. According to the Northwest
Information Center (NWIC), while there is a moderately low potential for identifying unrecorded Native
American resources on or near the SJCC campus, there is a moderate potential for identifying unrecorded
historic-period archaeological resources on or near the SJCC campus (NWIC 2011). Construction of
individual buildings and facilities would include site grading and excavation, and thus could uncover
unknown resources.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Under CEQA, "historic resources" means historic buildings or features or historic or prehistoric
archaeological deposits that qualify for inclusion on the California Register of Historic Resources based
on their historical or prehistoric significance. Several building on campus are identified in the 2025 FMP
for demolition. These include the Drama/Theater, 100 Wing, 200 Wing, 300 Wing, Boiler Plant, Pool,
General Education Building (partial), Auxiliary Gym, Field House, Handball Courts, Portable Restroom
Building, and Locker Rooms. The ages of these buildings range from the 1950s through the 1980s.
Historical surveys to determine eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, or the
California Register of Historic Resources were conducted for the 100 Wing, 200 Wing, 300 Wing, Boiler
Plant, Pool, Auxiliary Gym, Field House, Handball Courts, and Locker Rooms. The surveys indicated that
these structures do not qualify for listing on either of these registers (ARM, 2009a; ARM, 2009b). While
the Drama/Theater building was built in the 1950s, it does not appear to be eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places, or the California Register of Historic Resources as it was built in a
mid-century utilitarian style and does not possess distinctive architectural features, In addition, no
historical events or persons associated with them are associated with the Drama/Theater building.
Finally, the General Education Building was built during the 1980s and Portable Restroom Building was

0461.003                                                                                                            August 2012
built during the 2000s. As a result, these structures do not qualify for inclusion on any federal or state
register. Thus, the implementation of the 2025 FMP will have no impact on significant historic resources.
There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

b) The NWIC was contacted to conduct an archaeological records search for the campus and surrounding
area. The NWIC indicated that while there is a moderately low potential of identifying unrecorded
Native American archaeological resources on or near the SJCC campus, there is a moderate potential of
identifying unrecorded historic-period archaeological resources on or near the SJCC campus given that a
review of older maps (1942 San José 15-minute topographic quadrangle and 1899 map) depict buildings
within the project site that were associated with a County hospital (NWIC 2011). Any inadvertent
damage to significant historic-period archaeological resources represents a potentially significant impact.
However, implementation of Mitigation Measures CUL-1 and CUL-2 would reduce the impact to a less
than significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure CUL-1: Prior to ground disturbance, the Campus shall conduct archival
                   research to determine the appropriate locations for archaeological monitoring during
                   removal of asphalt or concrete fill, vegetation, or structures. Following the exposure of the
                   original soils, a field inspection shall be conducted and a report containing "next step"
                   recommendations be provided. Field study may include, but is not limited to, pedestrian
                   survey, hand auger sampling, shovel test units, or geoarchaeological analyses as well as other
                   common methods used to identify the presence of archaeological resources.

                   Mitigation Measure CUL-2: If archaeological resources are encountered during construction,
                   work shall be temporarily halted in the vicinity of the discovered materials and workers shall
                   avoid altering the materials and their context until a qualified professional archaeologist has
                   evaluated the find and provided appropriate recommendations. Project personnel shall not
                   collect cultural resources. Native American resources include chert or obsidian flakes,
                   projectile points, mortars, and pestles; and dark friable soil containing shell and bone dietary
                   debris, heat-affected rock, or human burials. Historic-period resources include stone or adobe
                   foundations or walls; structures and remains with square nails; and refuse deposits or bottle
                   dumps, often located in old wells or privies.

c) The City of San José 2020 General Plan does not mention paleontological resources as an area of concern
for the City (San José 1994). The campus is developed and flat, and thus has no unique geologic features.
Subsurface soils are classified as Yolo series soils, which are well-drained medium and moderately fine
textured soils underlain by alluvium (SJECCD 2008). Such materials are considered to have a very low
likelihood of containing significant geologic or paleontological features. In addition, potential building
sites on the campus have likely been disturbed by past grading activities. Consequently, excavations on
campus are unlikely to disturb or damage fossil resources. This impact is considered less than significant.

d) See the responses to Items 5(a) and (b), above. As the campus is not located in an area with identified
archaeological resources, human remains are not expected to be present on the campus, but the potential
for their presence cannot be completely ruled out. Any disturbance of human remains would represent a
potentially significant impact. However, with implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-3, which
outlines procedures to be followed in the event that previously unknown human remains are discovered,
any impacts would be reduced to a less than significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure CUL-3: In the event of a discovery of human bone, potential human
                   bone, or a known or potential human burial, all ground-disturbing work in the vicinity of the
                   find will halt immediately and the area of the find will be protected until a qualified
                   archaeologist determines whether the bone is human. If the qualified archaeologist
                   determines the bone is human, the Campus will notify the County Coroner of the find.
                   Consistent with California Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5(b), which prohibits
                   disturbance of human remains uncovered by excavation until the Coroner has made a
                   finding relative to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 5097, the Campus will
                   ensure that the remains and vicinity of the find are protected against further disturbance.

                   If it is determined that the find is of Native American origin, the Campus will comply with
                   the provisions of Public Resources Code Section 5097.98 regarding identification and
                   involvement of the Most Likely Descendant (MLD).

                   If the human remains cannot be protected in place following the Coroner's determination, the
                   Campus shall ensure that the qualified archaeologist and the MLD are provided the
                   opportunity to confer on repatriation and/or archaeological treatment of human remains, and
                   that any appropriate studies, as identified through this consultation, are carried out prior to
                   reinterment. The Campus shall provide results of all such studies to the Native American
                   community, and shall provide an opportunity for Native American involvement in any
                   interpretative reporting. As stipulated by the provisions of the California Native American
                   Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Campus shall ensure that human remains and
                   associated artifacts recovered from campus projects on state lands are repatriated to the
                   appropriate local tribal group if requested.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in some portions of San José has the potential to adversely affect cultural
resources in the City. However, with mitigation, future development on the campus under the 2025 FMP
would have no project-level impacts on cultural resources. Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP
would not make a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact on cultural resources
that could result from other development in the City.

 a) Expose people or structures to potential
 substantial adverse effects, including the risk of
 loss, injury, or death involving:

       i) Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as
       delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo
       Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the
       State Geologist for the area or based on other

 for the disposal of waste water?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
topography of the campus is relatively flat, and the campus is completely developed. Thus, no unique
geologic features are located on the campus.

0461.003                                                                                                             August 2012
Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a)(i) The campus is not located within an established Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone for surface
fault rupture hazards (CGS 2011). The closest Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone is located
approximately 7.5 miles to the east along the Hayward fault (ABAG 2001). Based on the available
geologic data, active or potentially active faults with the potential for surface fault rupture are not known
to be located directly beneath the campus. As a result, future development under the 2025 FMP would
not expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects associated with the rupture of a
known earthquake fault. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

a)(ii) The campus could be subject to strong ground shaking in the event of an earthquake originating
along one of the faults listed as active or potentially active in the Bay area. This hazard exists throughout
the Bay Area and could pose a risk to public safety and property by exposing people, property, or
infrastructure to potentially adverse effects including strong seismic ground shaking. However, any
future development on the campus under the 2025 FMP would be designed and constructed in
accordance with the current California Building Code (CBC), and thus would be consistent with the
current prevailing standard of care for structural and civil engineering and seismic safety. Impacts
associated with exposure to seismic groundshaking are thus expected to be less than significant.

a)(iii) The campus is not located in a liquefaction hazard zone designated by the State of California
pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (CGS 2002). As a result, future development on the
campus would not expose structures and people to hazards associated with liquefaction, including the
potential for structural damage or failure and associated safety risks. There would be no impact with
regard to this criterion.

a)(iv) The campus and the surrounding area are characterized by flat topography and are located at a
substantial distance from the closest hilly or sloping areas that could generate landslides. The campus is
therefore not subject to hazards related to landslides or landslide runout; this includes seismically
induced and non-seismic landslides. No impact is anticipated with regard to this criterion.

b) Construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would require activities such as vegetation
removal and grading that would expose soil to erosion. For projects that would disturb more than 1 acre,
coverage under the state's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for
Discharges of Storm Water Associated with Construction Activity would be required prior to
construction and the construction contractor would be required to file a notice of intent (NOI) with the
State Water Resources Control Board and develop and implement a site-specific Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The SWPPP would include Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control on-
site erosion and off-site sedimentation, and to keep construction pollutants from coming into contact with
storm water. The campus would have oversight responsibility and would have the authority to shut
down construction in the event the SWPPP is improperly implemented. For projects that would disturb
less than 1 acre, the campus would develop an erosion control plan which would include sediment and
erosion controls to limit on-site erosion and off-site sedimentation, and to keep construction pollutants
from coming into contact with storm water. With these measures in place, impacts related to accelerated
erosion and sedimentation are expected to be less than significant.

c) Issues related to seismically induced and non-seismic landslide hazards are discussed in response to
Item (a)(iv), above. Issues related to liquefaction and related hazards are discussed in response to Item
(a)(iii), above. Issues related to soil properties are discussed in response to Item (d), below. Construction
of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP may require the creation of cut or fill slopes, which could be

unstable if they are improperly designed or constructed. However, as identified above, development
would be designed and constructed in accordance with the current CBC, which includes provisions that
specifically address good grading practices and cut and fill slope stability. Impacts related to unstable cut
or fill slopes are therefore expected to be less than significant.

d) The potential for expansive soils exists on the campus (SJECCD 2008). The properties of any native
materials that may underlie individual development sites on the campus at depth are not known at this
time, but will be evaluated during the development of the site-specific geotechnical investigations that
the campus will prepare for the project design of each new facility identified by the 2025 FMP. As
discussed above, all facilities identified in the 2025 FMP will adhere to the current CBC, which includes
detailed provisions to ensure that the design of new facilities is appropriate to site soil conditions,
including requirements to address expansive and otherwise problematic soils. With adherence to the
CBC, impacts related to site soil conditions--including but not limited to expansive soils, if any are
present--would be less than significant.

e) Future development on the campus would not involve the installation of septic tanks or alternative
wastewater disposal systems. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Most of the geologic impacts such as those related to risk from faults, liquefaction potential, slope
stability, landslide potential, expansive and compressible soils are site specific and do not cumulate.
Therefore, future development on the campus and other development in the vicinity of the campus
would not result in a significant cumulative impact related to geologic risks. The one area where the
impacts of concurrent construction projects have the potential to cumulate is related to soil erosion and
discharge of sediment into receiving waters during construction. This represents a significant cumulative
impact. However, all construction on campus would comply with NPDES requirements to minimize
erosion and sedimentation. Therefore, the contribution of future development on campus under the 2025
FMP to this impact would not be cumulatively considerable.

a) Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either directly or
indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the

reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a-b) Construction and operation of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections
on the campus would generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This represents a potentially significant
impact. The EIR will estimate the direct and indirect GHG emissions from the operation of facilities
identified in the 2025 FMP and discuss whether the emissions would exceed the BAAQMD's
recommended threshold for GHGs emitted by land use development projects. The EIR will also estimate
and report GHG emissions that would be generated during construction of facilities identified in the 2025
FMP.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The contribution of the 2025 FMP to the global cumulative impact will be addressed in the EIR.

 8. HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
 ­ Would the project:

 a) Create a significant hazard to the public or the
 environment through the routine transport, use, or                                                                   
 disposal of hazardous materials?

 b) Create a significant hazard to the public or the
 environment through reasonably foreseeable
 upset and accident conditions involving the                                                                          
 release of hazardous materials into the
 environment?

 c) Emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous
 or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or                                                                       
 waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or
 proposed school?

 d) Be located on a site which is included on a list
 of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to
 Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result,                                                                    
 would it create a significant hazard to the public
 or the environment?

 e) For a project located within an airport land use
 plan or, where such a plan has not been adopted,
 within 2 miles of a public airport or public use                                                                     
 airport, would the project result in a safety hazard
 for people residing or working in the project area?

 f) For a project within the vicinity of a private
 airstrip, would the project result in a safety hazard                                                                
 for people residing or working in the project area?

 g) Impair implementation of or physically
 interfere with an adopted emergency response

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. The
campus contains several older buildings that are identified for demolition in the 2005 FMP. The closest
school is the Neighborhood Christian Preschool, located approximately 300 feet east of the campus. The
nearest airport is San José International Airport, located approximately 2.5 miles north of the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Although the construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would use small quantities of
hazardous materials on each construction site, compliance with local, state, and federal regulations would
minimize risks associated with the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials during
construction activities. Any hazardous materials used during the operation of facilities identified in the
2025 FMP would be limited to those typically used in academic support and standard maintenance
activities (e.g., laboratory chemicals, photo processing chemicals, solvents, paints, cleaning agents). The
use of all hazardous materials during operation would be required to comply with stringent local, state,
and federal regulations on hazardous materials use. Given the types and quantities of hazardous
materials that would be used as well as stringent regulations, the impacts related to the routine transport,
use, and disposal of hazardous materials would be less than significant.

b) See response to Item (a), above. Buildings to be demolished as part of the 2025 FMP could contain
asbestos, lead, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). State law requires that contractors and workers be
notified of the presence of asbestos in buildings constructed before 1979. The California Department of
Public Health requires certification of employees and supervisors performing lead-related construction
activities in residential and public buildings. Standard specifications included in all campus construction
contracts specify that contractors who disturb or potentially disturb asbestos or lead must comply with all
federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding these materials. Contractors are also required to
stop work and inform the Campus if they encounter material believed to be asbestos, PCBs, lead, or other
hazardous materials. Compliance with federal, state, and local regulations would minimize possible
exposure to staff and students. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

c) The campus is located within 0.25 mile of a school. Risks associated with the use of hazardous
materials on the campus would be addressed through compliance with applicable regulations as
discussed in Item (a), above, and the campus does not and would not handle large quantities of such
materials that could create a substantial release affecting off-campus areas. Therefore, the impacts with
respect to this criterion are considered less than significant overall.

d) The SJCC campus is included on a list of hazardous materials sites subject to corrective action
compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 (Cortese List). This listing stems from reported
cases of leaking underground storage tanks (LUST) on campus. The LUST contamination is related to fuel
tanks that have since been removed and have a "case closed" status. In addition, the campus is also
included on a number of federal, state, and local databases. These findings are based on an EDR report
that was prepared for the campus.

The generation of hazardous waste at the SJCC campus is related to academic uses and may include
inorganic and organic chemicals, chemical reagents and reaction products, solvents, mercury,
radioisotopes, biohazards, fuels, oils, paints, cleansers, and pesticides that are currently used in
laboratory research, building and grounds maintenance, vehicle maintenance, and fine arts. In addition,

0461.003                                                                                                      August 2012
hazardous materials associated with electrical transmission are also located on campus. There is currently
no known contamination on the campus (Dias 2011).

The EDR report indicated that several other sites with known or potential contamination, hazardous
materials use, hazardous waste generation, or other hazardous-materials-related conditions are within 1
mile of the campus (EDR 2011). LUST (including one located at 840 Bascom Avenue, near the
southwestern corner of the campus) also appear to be the main source of local soil and groundwater
contamination. Because of the site status and orientation relative to groundwater flow direction for the
identified sites, it is unlikely that groundwater contamination from these sites may have migrated to the
campus (EDR 2011). However, given the uncertainty of contamination on the project site from sources off
site, this assessment conservatively assumes that contamination could be present and, if encountered
during construction, could result in the exposure of the public or construction workers to hazardous
materials. This is considered a potentially significant impact. However, with the implementation of
Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, which requires an assessment and cleanup of potential contamination that
may be encountered during construction, this impact would be reduced to a less than significant level.

                   Mitigation Measure HAZ-1: If evidence of contaminated soil and/or groundwater, such as
                   discolored soil, odors or oil sheen, is encountered during the removal of on-site debris or
                   during excavation and/or grading both on and off site, the construction contractors shall stop
                   work and immediately inform the Campus. An environmental hazardous materials
                   professional shall be contracted to conduct an on-site assessment. If the materials are
                   determined to pose a risk to the public or construction workers, the construction contractor
                   shall prepare and submit a remediation plan to the appropriate agency and comply with all
                   federal, state, and local laws. Soil remediation methods could include excavation and on-site
                   treatment, excavation and off-site treatment or disposal, and/or treatment without
                   excavation. Remediation alternatives for cleanup of contaminated groundwater could
                   include in-situ treatment, extraction and on-site treatment, or extraction and off-site
                   treatment and/or disposal. Construction plans shall be modified or postponed to ensure
                   construction will not inhibit remediation activities and will not expose the public or
                   construction workers to hazardous conditions.

e) The campus is not located within the immediate vicinity of the San José International Airport. Given
the distance of the campus from the airport, future development under the 2025 FMP would not place
persons within an airport hazard zone. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

f) The campus is not located in the vicinity of a private airstrip, and there would be no impact with regard
to this criterion.

g) The City of San Jose Emergency Operations Plan does not list Moorpark Avenue, Leigh Avenue,
Fruitdale Avenue, or South Bascom Avenue as emergency evacuation routes (City of San Jose 2004). In
addition, construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would occur within the boundaries of the
campus, and thus would not impede traffic on roadways surrounding campus. There would be no
impact with regard to this criterion.

h) The project site is located in an urban area. It is not located in or adjacent to a wildland area, and there
would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José has the potential to expose the public and the environment to
risks associated with hazards from on-site contamination and routine use of hazardous materials.
However, with mitigation, future development under the 2025 FMP would not expose the public or the
environment to potential on-site contamination during construction. In addition, while implementation of
the 2025 FMP would involve the continued routine use of hazardous materials during operation, the use
of these materials on campus would comply with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
Therefore, it would not contribute to a cumulative impact during operation.

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus.
Construction of individual buildings and facilities would include site grading and excavation. All runoff
from pavements, roofs, and other impervious surfaces that are developed on the campus would be
routed to the City of San José's storm drain system. The campus is underlain by the Santa Clara
groundwater basin (DWR 2003). The campus is not located within a 100-year flood plain or a flood
inundation zone (FEMA 2009). The nearest body of water is the Vasona Reservoir, located 5 miles south
of the campus. The San Francisco Bay is located about 12 miles north of the campus.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) During construction of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP, there is a potential for increased erosion,
sedimentation, and discharge of polluted runoff from the site. However, as identified in Geology and
Soils Item 6(b), the construction contractor would be required to implement a SWPPP, including erosion
and pollution control measures, or an erosion control plan to control increases in off-site sediment
delivery. The impact to water quality from construction activities would be less than significant.

The development of facilities identified in the 2025 FMP would increase the amount of impervious
surfaces on the campus that would increase the amount of runoff generated on the campus. During
operation, all site drainage would be routed to the City's storm drain system. This drainage is subject to
the conditions of the Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit No. CAS612008 for the San
Francisco Bay Region. This permit requires permittees to comply with the discharge prohibitions and
receiving water limitations through the timely implementation of control measures and other actions as
specified in the permit (San Francisco Bay RWQCB, 2009). Future development on the campus would be
required by law to comply with applicable NPDES requirements for stormwater quality. Therefore,
implementation of the 2025 FMP would not result in any direct or indirect discharges that would violate
water quality standards or waste discharge requirements. The impact to water quality would be less than
significant during operation.

b) The campus is underlain by the Santa Clara groundwater basin and a majority of the potable water on
campus is obtained from the basin through the local water retailer. Implementation of the 2025 FMP
would increase the amount of potable water used on campus. However, as the increase in potable water
on campus would be small, there would be no substantial impact to groundwater supplies. Natural
recharge in the basin occurs principally as infiltration from streambeds that flow from the upland areas
within the drainage basin and from direct percolation of precipitation that falls on the basin floor (DWR
2003). Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase the amount of impervious surface on campus.


Impact Sciences, Inc.                                   38                         San Jose City College 2025 Facilities Master Plan
0461.003                                                                                                              August 2012
However, as this increase in impervious surface would be small, there would be no substantial impact to
groundwater recharge. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

c) Storm water generated by future development under the 2025 FMP would be directed toward existing
storm drainage facilities serving the campus. As discussed in Item 6(b) above, each project on campus
would be required to control for soil erosion or siltation during construction through either the
preparation of a SWPPP if the project is large than 1 acre in size or the preparation of an erosion control
plan if the project is less than 1 acre in size. Implementation of the SWPPP would reduce the potential for
erosion on the construction sites and minimize the discharge of sediment into the storm drain system.
Once the new or replacement facilities are constructed, the project sites would be either under impervious
surfaces (buildings, pavement, etc.) or would be landscaped. This would minimize the potential for
erosion and sedimentation in the long term. In addition, while the implementation of the 2025 FMP
would increase the amount of impervious surface on campus, this increase in impervious surface would
be small. As a result, the amount of additional runoff entering the City's storm drain system would not be
substantial enough to result in off-site erosion or siltation in downstream locations. Therefore, this impact
is considered less than significant.

d) As discussed in the previous response above, storm water generated by future development under the
2025 FMP would be directed toward existing storm drainage facilities serving the campus. There are no
existing flooding problems on campus, and each project built on campus would be designed to control
for on-site flooding. In addition, while the implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase the amount of
impervious surface on campus, this increase in impervious surface would be small. As a result, the
amount of additional runoff entering the City's storm drain system would not be substantial enough to
result in off-site flooding in downstream locations. Therefore, this impact is considered less than
significant.

e) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would increase impervious surfaces on campus, which could increase
the volume of stormwater runoff in the City's storm drain system. However, this increase in runoff
would be small and would not substantially exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater
drainage systems. See response to Item 9(a), above, with regard to water quality. Each project would be
required to implement a SWPPP, including erosion and pollution control measures, or an erosion control
plan to control increases in off-site sediment delivery during construction. During operation all runoff
generated on campus would be subject to the Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit. As a result,
implementation of the 2025 FMP would not provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff.
Therefore, this impact is considered less than significant.

f) See responses to Items 9(a) through (d), above, and related discussions in the Hazards and Hazardous
Materials section of this checklist. No other potential project impacts to water quality were identified.

g-h) The campus is not located within a 100-year flood zone. The campus is located within Flood Zone D,
which is defined as an area with undetermined flooding, but where flooding is considered possible
(FEMA 2009). There are no existing residential uses on campus and no residential uses are included in the
2025 FMP. As a result, implementation of the 2005 FMP would not place housing or structures within an
area at risk of flood flows. There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

i) The campus is located within the inundation area for the Lexington Dam, located in the foothills of the
Santa Cruz Mountains approximately 9 miles to the southwest (ABAG 1995). The dam is owned and
operated by the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD). The SCVWD routinely monitors the

Impact Sciences, Inc.                               39                      San Jose City College 2025 Facilities Master Plan
0461.003                                                                                                       August 2012
conditions of the dam to ensure its safety. Actions taken by the SCVWD include dam maintenance,
period studies, and annual inspections. For this reason, the risk of the campus being inundated due to a
failure of the Lexington Dam is low. Therefore, implementation of the 2025 FMP would not expose
people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including flooding as
a result of the failure of a levee or dam. This impact would be less than significant.

j) The campus is located well inland from the San Francisco Bay and no bodies of water are located in the
vicinity of the campus. As a result, the campus is not at risk of seiche or tsunami inundation. Because of
the location of the campus in flat topography at a substantial distance from the Santa Cruz Mountains
range front, there is no substantial risk of debris flow or mudflow. There would be no impact with regard
to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
Anticipated future development in San José could result in the violation of water quality or waste
discharge requirements during construction. However, construction projects in the City involving more
than 1 acre of land disturbance are required to prepare and implement a SWPPP that includes erosion
and pollution control measures and measures to control increases in off-site sediment delivery.
Furthermore, future development on the campus would be required to adhere to requirements in the
Regional NPDES permit. As a result, the cumulative impact with regard to water quality would be less
than significant.

Anticipated future development in San José would result in some alteration of drainage patterns on each
of the cumulative development project sites. However, all site drainage from these sites would be
designed and constructed in accordance with the current NPDES and applicable City requirements and
as discussed above and be routed to the City's storm drain system. As a result, the cumulative impact
with regard to site drainage would be less than significant.

Anticipated future development in San José could place housing or structures within a 100-year flood
zone or within a dam inundation area. In addition, anticipated future development could place future
development within a tsunami inundation area. However, as the campus is not located within either a
100-year flood zone or within a tsunami inundation area, future development anticipated under the 2025
FMP would not contribute to this impact.

 10. LAND USE AND PLANNING ­ Would the project:

 a) Physically divide an established community?                                                                      
 b) Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or
 regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project
 (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific                                                           
 plan, local coastal program, or zoning ordinance)
 adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
 environmental effect?

 c) Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan                                                           
 or natural community conservation plan?

Relevant Elements of the Project and its Setting
The proposed project consists of the demolition of existing campus buildings and construction of
replacement facilities identified in the 2025 FMP to meet future growth projections on campus. Land use
plans applicable to the area surrounding the campus include the City of San José 2020 General Plan and
the County of Santa Clara General Plan.

Discussion of Potential Project Impacts
a) Implementation of the 2025 FMP would not physically divide an established community since the
campus already exists and future development on the campus would occur with campus boundaries.
There would be no impact with regard to this criterion.

b) The SJECCD is not subject to local plans, policies, or regulations. However, SJECCD is required by
Section 15125(d) of the State CEQA Guidelines to address inconsistencies between its proposed project and
applicable general plans, specific plans, and regional plans. It is generally the policy of the SJECCD to be
consistent with local and regional plans, policies, or regulations to the maximum extent possible. Any
conflict between the 2025 FMP and applicable local and regional plans could result in a potentially
significant impact As a result, the EIR will discuss the consistency of the 2025 FMP with applicable
regional plans such as the Bay Area 2010 Clean Air Plan, State Water Quality Control Board NPDES
Permit, Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program, and Santa Clara County
Congestion Management Program.

c) There is no habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan applicable to the
campus. There would be no impact related to this criterion.

Discussion of Potential Cumulative Impacts
The proposed project combined with other current projects and probable future projects and projected
regional growth could result in significant cumulative impacts with regard to consistency with regional
plans. This issue will be addressed in the EIR.

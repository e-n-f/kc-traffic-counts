Background
The Federal Highway Administration defines a Road Safety Audit (RSA) as the formal safety
examination of an existing or future road or intersection by an independent, multidisciplinary team. The
purpose of an RSA is to identify potential safety issues and possible opportunities for safety
improvements considering all roadway users. A Road Safety Audit was scheduled for the intersection of
Foundry Street (Route 106) and Turnpike Street (Route 138) because it was identified as a high crash
location, making the construction eligible for Federal safety funding, and as a priority location for safety
improvements. Regardless of the funding source, the purpose of the RSA is to identify both short term
and long term safety improvements that can be made at the subject intersection.


Project Description
The intersection of Foundry Street and Turnpike Street, shown in Figure 1, is located in the southeastern
portion of Easton. Turnpike Street (Route 138) is a state-owned roadway functionally classified as an
Urban Minor Arterial. Foundry Street is a town-owned roadway functionally classified as an Urban
Principal Arterial. Foundry Street is an important regional roadway, connecting Easton with Mansfield to
the west and West Bridgewater to the east. Route 106 runs essentially parallel to I-495, has an
interchange with Route 24 approximately 1.2 miles east of Route 138 and is known to serve as a cut-
through for vehicles bound for Route 24 and points north. Route 138 is also a significant regional
roadway, connecting Easton with neighboring communities Stoughton and Raynham. Route 138
provides access to I-495 to the south and runs parallel to Route 24. As such, Route 138 becomes a
preferred alternative route when delays exist on Route 24.

Foundry Street and Turnpike Street form a 4-way intersection under traffic signal control. The signal
operates under basic two phase operation and has no pedestrian signal indications. There are sidewalks
on the north side of Foundry Street and along both sides of Turnpike Street in the vicinity of the
intersection, but no continuous sidewalks on either roadway. There are no crosswalks at the intersection.

Turnpike Street is primarily one lane in each direction in the project vicinity, but widens to provide two
lanes for both the southbound and northbound approaches. A wide departure lane on each side of the
intersection allows traffic to merge back into one lane. Foundry Street also widens to provide two lanes
for the eastbound approach and has a wide departure lane on the opposite side to allow vehicles to merge
back into one lane. The Foundry Street westbound approach operates as two lanes although there is no
lane line delineating the two lanes. There are no arrow markings to identify lane assignments for any of
the four approaches.

The land use of the surrounding area is a mix between commercial and residential. There is a 7 Eleven
convenience store with gas station on the northeast corner and office buildings on the southeast and
southwest corners. There is a vacant lot on the northwest corner which an audit participant noted was
formerly the site of a gas station. There are single family homes along Foundry Street west of the
intersection and along Turnpike Street south of the intersection, and several apartment and condominium
complexes along Turnpike Street and along Foundry Street east of the intersection.

                           Foundry Street westbound at Turnpike Street


Speed regulations maintained by MassDOT Highway Division establish a 25 MPH speed limit for
Foundry Street in the vicinity of the intersection, which is not posted. The speed limit for Foundry Street
increases to 40 MPH beyond the intersection in both directions. Speed data for the intersection were
provided by Old Colony Planning Council (OCPC). Speed data for Foundry Street westbound
approaching the intersection were recorded outside the 25 MPH speed zone and showed an average speed
of 37 MPH and an 85th percentile speed of 45 MPH. The 85th percentile speed is defined as the speed at
which 85 percent of the traffic is traveling at or below. The posted speed limit on Turnpike Street is 40
MPH in the vicinity of the intersection. Speed data for Turnpike Street southbound showed an average
speed of 40 MPH and an 85th percentile speed of 48 MPH. Complete speed data and speed regulations
are included in the Appendix.

Crash data were collected and summarized by MassDOT for three years and are included in the
Appendix. There were a total of 31 crashes at the intersection within the period from January 2006 to
October 2008. 28 of these crashes are mapped on the collision diagram included in the Appendix. 18 of
the 28 mapped crashes were angle type crashes, with five of those 18 occurring between a westbound
vehicle turning left and an eastbound through vehicle. These crashes may be the result of drivers taking
chances on insufficient gaps.




                                                                                                  Page 4

The intersection ranked 136th on MassDOT's statewide list of the Top Crash Intersections from 2005 to
2007. This ranking is based on the number of crashes in MassDOT's database which can be
georeferenced to a cluster area around the intersection. This cluster area experienced 50 crashes in the
three year period. The ranking is then determined using a weighted system which calculates the
Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO) rating of the intersection. Fatal crashes are weighted 10 times
and injury crashes are weighted 5 times. Nineteen of the 50 crashes involved an injury. There were no
fatal crashes in the three year study period.

Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) counts and Manual Turning Movement (MTM) counts were provided
by OCPC. ATR data were recorded in 2005. Foundry Street carries 17,700 vehicles per day (vpd) east of
Turnpike Street. No data were available for Foundry Street west of Turnpike Street. Turnpike Street
carries 15,900 vpd north of Foundry Street and 18,000 vpd south of Foundry Street. MTM data were
recorded in 2006 for both the morning and afternoon peak periods. The morning peak hour occurred from
7:15 to 8:15 AM. Of note were 171 left turns from Foundry Street westbound to Turnpike Street
southbound, and 391 right turns in the opposite direction from Turnpike Street northbound to Foundry
Street eastbound during the AM peak hour.

The afternoon peak hour occurred from 4:30 to 5:30 PM. During the afternoon peak hour, there were 363
left turns from Foundry Street westbound to Turnpike Street southbound, and 257 right turns in the
opposite direction from Turnpike Street northbound to Foundry Street eastbound. Complete ATR and
MTM count data are included in the Appendix.

Audit Observations
Following a brief introduction to the RSA process and a summary of traffic volumes and crash
information, the audit participants were asked to discuss safety issues at the intersection of Foundry Street
(Route 106) and Turnpike Street (Route 138). Audit participants then conducted a site visit as a group, at
which time they offered observations on safety concerns and deficiencies. A summary of those major
safety considerations is as follows:

·   Pavement Markings ­ The existing markings are faded, and there are no arrows to indicate lane
    assignments. The westbound Foundry Street approach has no lane line to indicate a two lane
    configuration, although it does operate as two lanes and sufficient width exists to accommodate two
    lanes.

·   Signal Phasing & Timing ­ The existing signal operates under simple two-phase operation, which
    allows no protected phase for left-turning vehicles on any of the approaches. There was some
    concern amongst audit participants that the all red clearance time is not sufficient.

·   Signal Visibility ­ The existing incandescent bulbs and lack of backplates were cited as a safety
    concern. Upgrades to these features would increase visibility of the signal indications for
    approaching vehicles.

·   Signal Alignment ­ The location of signal heads was cited as a safety concern, specifically for the
    westbound Foundry Street approach where there is a far left side and right side ground mounted
    signal post and only one overhead signal head. In addition, signals have rotated slightly and are not
    directly facing traffic flow due to the lack of a tether wire.

·   Lighting ­ It was suggested that although roadway lighting exists in the area, it is insufficient and
    should be upgraded.

·   Pedestrian Accommodations ­ The intersection has sidewalks on some approaches, but no existing
    crosswalks or pedestrian pushbuttons to provide protection to pedestrians wishing to cross the street.
    Audit participants suggested that the number of apartment and condominium complexes in the area
    has generated increased pedestrian traffic.

·   Downgrade on Foundry Street eastbound ­ The Foundry Street eastbound approach has a downhill
    grade. This was raised as a safety concern because the downhill grade reduces visibility of the
    approaching signal for eastbound traffic. It should be noted that there is an advance warning sign for
    the traffic signal approximately 600 feet in advance of the intersection.




                                                                                                    Page 6

·   Lane geometry ­ All four
    approaches at the intersection have
    two general purpose lanes that
    merge into one travel lane on the
    departure side of the intersection.
    Some audit participants suggested
    that the left lane is not well aligned
    for through movements, specifically
    on the Foundry Street approaches.

·   Speed ­ Speed was mentioned as a
    safety concern at the intersection. It
    should be noted that recorded
    speeds are consistent with posted or
    established speed limits at the                Foundry Street eastbound at Turnpike Street
    intersection.                                          (Photo courtesy of OCPC)

·   Future development ­ Future development was discussed as a concern that should be addressed as
    part of any planned improvements. Raynham Park, the former greyhound race track, is
    approximately two miles south of the study intersection on Route 138 and could be the site of
    significant future redevelopment. Another site discussed as a point of concern is the vacant lot on the
    northwest corner of the intersection. It was noted during the audit that while any planned future
    development of these parcels should be considered in the design of proposed improvements, there are
    no definitive plans at this time for either site. MassDOT and the Town of Easton should insure that
    any planned development in the area is considered as part of any future improvements at this location.


Potential Safety Enhancements
After the site visit, audit participants returned to the meeting location to discuss the safety issues and
consider improvements. Audit participants were encouraged to consider both short and long term
improvements for each issue. Each improvement considered has been categorized as short-term, mid-
term, or long-term based on the definitions shown in Table 2. Additionally, a cost category has been
assigned to each improvement based on the parameters set forth in Table 2.

                         Time Frame                                     Costs
              Short-term           <1 year             Low                   <$10,000
              Mid-term            1­3 years            Medium             $10,001­$50,000
              Long-term           >3 years             High                  >$50,000



The following improvements were suggested by audit participants to improve safety issues associated
with the intersection of Foundry Street and Turnpike Street.



                                                                                                    Page 7

·   Upgrade traffic signal. A number of potential solutions were discussed related to the upgrade or
    replacement of the existing traffic signal. Recommendations are as follows:

            o   Replace signal. The most extensive solution involves a complete replacement of all
                signal equipment. Some audit participants suggested that additional signal heads be
                added to increase visibility for approaching vehicles. It was noted by MassDOT
                Highway Division District personnel that adding equipment such as new signal heads or a
                tether wire to the existing span wire assembly would increase the loading on the existing
                strain poles, which would require checking the original design calculations to insure that
                the poles and foundations could accommodate additional loading. MassDOT District
                personnel noted that the original design calculations are likely not available. A complete
                replacement of all signal equipment should incorporate phasing improvements and be
                done in conjunction with geometric improvements, which would address safety concerns
                related to lane geometry, lane assignments and pedestrian accommodation. This is a
                long-term, high cost improvement.

            o   Replace incandescent bulbs with LEDs. It was noted during the audit that the existing
                traffic signal heads have incandescent bulbs, which are no longer accepted by MassDOT
                in new signal installations. Bulbs should be replaced with LEDs for all signal heads.
                LEDs are brighter, which will make them more visible to approaching traffic, and use just
                10% of the energy used by incandescent bulbs. This is a short-term, low cost
                improvement.

            o   Install backplates. It was noted by audit participants that there are no backplates on some
                overhead signal heads, specifically for the single overhead signal head for the westbound
                Foundry Street approach. Backplates should be installed on all overhead signal heads.
                This is a short-term, low cost improvement.

·   Reapply pavement markings. Pavement markings in the area of the intersection are faded and may
    lead to driver confusion regarding the two lane configuration on all four approaches. New markings
    should be applied 400 feet in each direction. This is a short-term, medium cost improvement.

·   Define lane configurations and apply arrow/ONLY markings. The lack of existing lane assignment
    markings causes confusion amongst approaching vehicles. Drivers may assume that they need to be
    in the right lane to make a through movement, and then be surprised by a vehicle in the left lane also
    making a through movement and maneuvering to merge into one lane on the departure side of the
    intersection. Lane configurations should be defined and appropriate pavement markings and signs
    installed, such as arrow and ONLY markings. Lane configurations should be determined based on
    new traffic count data and a capacity analysis study of the data to determine whether the left or the
    right turn movement should be given an exclusive lane. This is a short-term, medium cost
    improvement, including the cost of the traffic count and capacity analysis study.

·   Study clearance times. The existing yellow and all red clearance times should be determined from the
    existing traffic signal controller and compared to minimum requirements calculated based on the
    Insititute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) methodology. If existing clearance times are insufficient,



                                                                                                  Page 8
Road Safety Audit--Foundry Street (Route 106) at Turnpike Street (Route 138)--Easton, MA
Prepared by BETA Group, Inc.




    clearance times should be increased accordingly. Audit participants suggested this improvement
    because vehicles have been observed clearing the intersection after the all red phase, but this may also
    be due to drivers intentionally running the yellow or red light due to the level of delay at the
    intersection. This is a short-term, low cost improvement.

·   Upgrade lighting at the intersection. It was suggested that roadway lighting should be improved in
    the area. This improvement would involve installing overhead lights on existing utility poles. This is
    a mid-term, medium cost improvement.

·   Replace signal ahead sign. The W3-3 Signal Ahead warning sign on the
    Foundry Street eastbound approach does not appear to meet current
    retroreflectivity standards and should be replaced. This is a short-term, low
    cost improvement. The existing supplemental "Signal Ahead" word plaque
    should be removed and not replaced.

·   Install "Speed Limit" signs. The speed limit along Foundry Street is 25 MPH
    in the area of the intersection, which is not posted. Speed limit signs should be added on both
    Foundry Street approaches alerting drivers to this reduced limit. It was suggested by audit
    participants that a speed zone should be established along Turnpike Street in the area of the
    intersection, but it was noted by MassDOT personnel that MassDOT no longer employs the practice
    of establishing reduced speed zones at intersections. This is a short-term, low cost improvement.

·   Consider future development. This recommendation is not a specific improvement that can be
    implemented, but more an overall consideration that should be applied to any future planned
    improvements at the audit intersection.

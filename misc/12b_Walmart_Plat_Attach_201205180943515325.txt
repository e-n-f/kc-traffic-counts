RE:            City of Roseville re: Wal-Mart Project
               Our File No: 1011-00196-7


As you know, at the City Council meeting on Monday night, an application for preliminary and
final plats together with a proposed development agreement will be before the Council for
approval or denial. As you also know, this matter has been the subject of significant public
concern and comment. This morning I noticed a quarter-page advertisement in a local
newspaper urging resident attendance at the meeting. Much of this advertisement discussed
concerns with the potential future use of the subject property. As this office has continuously
counseled the City throughout this process, State law expressly prohibits contemplation of a
proposed lawful use of property in a Council's consideration of a preliminary and final plat
application. Within the context of such anticipated public comment, therefore, I again highlight
the proper focus of the Council's action on this matter: whether or not the plat application
conforms to City subdivision regulations.

Further, the advertisement suggested that the potential future use of the site would not conform
to applicable portions of the City's comprehensive plan. Again, this issue is not a proper focus
on the plat approval or denial process. Matters of conformity to the comprehensive plan or
zoning code only come before the Council in their quasi-judicial capacity as the board of zoning
appeals. To that end, it is a best practice for the Council to avoid offering any public statements
that might be construed to reveal an advocacy position or predisposition on such applicability.
As we have seen in news reports from Minneapolis in recent months, offering such advocacy
positions or predispositions on proposed property uses is to be avoided by elected officials.

1    December 6, 2011 ­ excerpt of approved minutes
2    Preliminary information on park dedication for the 17.8 acres at Cleveland and County Road C
3    were presented to the Commission by Brokke. A proposal to develop the property into a Walmart
4    Shopping Center has begun to be reviewed by City staff. The role of the commission is to make
5    recommendation to the Council whether to accept land, cash or a combination of to satisfy the
6    park dedication requirement.
7    A recent potential proposal from the Walmart Representatives was to provide land dedication in
8    another area of Langton Lake. There is a possibility of a combination of land and cash as well as
9    the traditional all land dedication or all cash payment. The park dedication fees could contribute
10   to possible Master Plan projects. Commissioner Ristow suggested the commission consider
11   recommending the cash in lieu of land based on past needs and recent financial discussions.

12   January 3, 2012 ­ excerpt of draft minutes
13   Etten continued the discussion of park dedication considerations for the proposed Walmart
14   development in Twin Lakes. Earlier considerations included a parcel of land in an area away
15   from the development that might have served as a nice addition to Langton Lake Park. This land
16   dedication is no longer an option to fulfill the park dedication requirements. Etten also clarified
17   that the actual size of the parcel is 13.94 acres, rather than the 17.8 acres reported earlier. This
18   change in size is due to 3.86 acres being sold earlier to the City for the Twin Lakes Parkway. The
19   updated land equivalency for park dedication is .68 acres and the updated cash payment would
20   be $411,115, based on 5% of the FMV.
21   Commission Recommendation:
22   Motion by Doneen, second by Ristow to recommend the Roseville City Council accept cash in
23   lieu of land for park dedication in the proposed Walmart development. Commission questions
24   followed.
25       · D. Holt inquired into what the land options were/are for the site. Brokke explained that
26            there were no appropriate park development options for this site.
27       · Azer asked for a clarification of how the park dedication funds can be used. Brokke
28            clarified that the funds cannot be used for maintenance or ongoing costs but can be used
29            for land acquisitions, park development, and facility enhancement. The park dedication
30            funds could be used to further expand the projects identified by the Parks and Recreation
31            Renewal Program.
32   Motion passed unanimously.
33   Note: Greg Simbeck favored the cash in lieu of land option through his email to notify staff of
34   his absence from tonight's meeting.

14        minutes of November 2, 2011 as presented.
15        Ayes: 6
16        Nays: 0
17        Motion carried.

18   4.   Communications and Recognitions:
19        a.      From the Public (Public Comment on items not on the agenda)
20                None.
21        b.      From the Commission or Staff
22                None.

23   5.   Public Hearings
24        Chair Boerigter reviewed the purpose and process for public hearings held before the Planning
25        Commission.
26        a.      PLANNING FILE 12-001
27                Request by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. for approval of a PRELIMINARY PLAT of the land
28                area bounded by County Road C, Cleveland Avenue, Twin Lakes Parkway, and
29                Prior Avenue
30                Chair Boerigter opened the Public Hearing at 6:35 p.m.
31                Associate Planner Bryan Lloyd summarized the request of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in
32                conjunction with Roseville Properties, owner of the subject property, seeking approval of
33                a PRELIMINARY PLAT of the land area as identified and detailed in the staff report, and
34                creating three (3) lots.
35                Mr. Lloyd advised that the request also included the transfer of ownership of a small
36                portion of City-owned land adjacent to the Mount Ridge Road roundabout. Mr. Lloyd
37                clarified that this request for a disposal of land by the City, was NOT a Vacation request,
38                per se; but in lieu of a public hearing, and in accordance with State Statute, the Planning
39                Commission must review the proposed disposal of land and determine whether it would
40                be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
41                Staff recommended approval of the proposed PRELIMINARY PLAT of the land area
42                bounded by County Road C, Cleveland Avenue, Twin Lakes Parkway, and Prior Avenue;
43                along with the recommendation that the Commission determine that the proposed
44                transfer of ownership of land area specified in the Preliminary Plat is in compliance with
     Regular Planning Commission Meeting
     Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012

45                 the 2030 Comprehensive Plan; based on the comments and findings of Section 4-7, and
46                 the recommendation of Section 8 of the staff report dated February 1, 2012.
47                 Chair Boerigter sought clarification on the original intent in the City acquiring the property
48                 for creation of Twin Lakes Parkway, and now the City's determination that it was no
49                 longer needed and could be disposed of.
50                 Mr. Lloyd advised that the property had been originally acquired from the property owner
51                 for its potential use in connection with the roundabout as access to the redevelopment
52                 property, but had not been intended to create a public street south of the roundabout.
53                 Chair Boerigter requested more detailed information from the City's Engineer.
54                 City Engineer Debra Bloom
55                 Ms. Bloom concurred with Mr. Lloyd's analysis of the City's original intent in using the
56                 property as the fourth leg of the roundabout for landscaping treatments. However, Ms.
57                 Bloom noted that this was prior to the City knowing final roadway design, the type or size
58                 of the development that may occur in this area, and that acquisition was for the most part
59                 precautionary in planning ahead; however, the City's need ended at the crosswalk and
60                 this property was no longer needed.
61                 At the request of Member Boguszewski, Mr. Lloyd advised that the overall acreage of the
62                 Walmart/Roseville Properties property was approximately fourteen (14) acres.
63                 Member Strohmeier asked how staff responded to his interpretation of various areas in
64                 city-wide plans versus Planning District 10 of the 2030 Comprehensive Plan (Chapters 4
65                 and 7) and development of a big box retailer in the Twin Lakes area.
66                 Mr. Lloyd noted staff comments that it was odd for a given development proposal to be
67                 reviewed by the Planning Commission against the Comprehensive Plan, since it was not
68                 intended for that purpose, and provided a misapplication of individual goals and policies
69                 of the Comprehensive Plan if it were used as a lens for this or any development. Mr.
70                 Lloyd noted that the purpose of the Comprehensive Plan was to serve as a guide for
71                 creating specific requirements attempting to meet its policies, for instance the zoning
72                 code update now addressing goals like walkable communities that were not addressed in
73                 previous code. Mr. Lloyd opined that no one business was going to achieve entirely the
74                 goal of walkable streets; however, walkable communities remained an overarching goal.
75                 Member Strohmeier stated that he still had issues of apparent conflict, when focusing on
76                 District 10, Future Land Use Section, and the portion about Twin Lakes and shopping as
77                 a primary focus of land use.
78                 Mr. Lloyd advised that the Twin Lakes area was generally described from Cleveland
79                 Avenue west to almost Snelling Avenue, and north to County Road C-2 and even beyond
80                 excluding Langton Lake Park. Mr. Lloyd noted that this was a large area with many
81                 existing developments that are relatively new (e.g. medical office) that were not retail;
82                 however, he also noted that there were a significant number of parcels that remained
83                 vacant and were ready for development. The fact that this is the first proposal for
84                 redevelopment in the area, Mr. Lloyd noted, just happened to be a retail use. Mr. Lloyd
85                 responded from staff's perspective, that there remained a lot of room for other uses as
86                 the area develops; and if it became apparent that retail was becoming the main focus for
87                 development in the Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area, it would then no longer be
88                 consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
89                 City Planner Thomas Paschke referenced the AUAR for Subarea 1, bounded by
90                 Cleveland Avenue, County Road C, and Fairview Avenue, which document gauges
91                 maximum thresholds in place governing the types of uses; noting that the AUAR
92                 identified retail for the subject area and noted that further development may create a
93                 threshold for too much retail in a given area. Mr. Paschke noted that, obviously, that
94                 would only become apparent as the area expanded further, and that the AUAR document
95                 would be used in judging any and all development or redevelopment, and tied to the
96                 recently-adopted overlay district requirements.
                                                        Regular Planning Commission Meeting
                                                        Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
                                                                                      Page 3
 97   Based on his personal review, Member Strohmeier opined that the staff report's
 98   contention that this proposal was consistent with the Twin Lakes Master Plan (page 11)
 99   suggests that the area should not be recommended for large scale, big box retail, and
100   sought staff's response.
101   Mr. Lloyd advised that the simplest response would be that it was also not prohibited; and
102   that it was not a goal of the Master Redevelopment Plan to prohibit big box retail as it
103   prohibited some industrial uses. As with any review, Mr. Lloyd noted that this
104   development proposal may not fully achieve every goal and aspiration of the document,
105   but this proposal was more or less consistent, and this specific retail use provides for
106   some of the same things recommended in the Plan.
107   Member Wozniak questioned if this was the only Public Hearing on this development;
108   with Mr. Lloyd responding that it was the only legally required hearing. Mr. Lloyd advised
109   that the only reason for the Public Hearing requirement was due to the applicant's
110   request for the disposal of the property and the Plat itself, and the need for discussion in
111   this venue and format. Mr. Lloyd noted that the Preliminary Plat would not live or die with
112   the analysis of the land proposed for disposal by the City; with nothing else in the
113   proposed development triggering a Public Hearing, unless Wal-Mart found the need for a
114   variance or other site issue in the future as the project developed.
115   Chair Boerigter sought clarification of the interaction of Preliminary Plat approval with the
116   Comprehensive Plan, AUAR and Twin Lakes Plan. Chair Boerigter questioned if
117   additional traffic control measures were part of the Preliminary Plat approval.
118   Mr. Lloyd advised that, as for the Plat itself, there was really no correlation with any of
119   those documents, other than superficially, since the Comprehensive Plan addressed
120   transportation, but the AUAR addressed transportation more specifically. Mr. Lloyd noted
121   that when Twin Lakes Parkway was constructed as part of the City of Roseville's
122   proactive infrastructure investment to facilitate redevelopment in the Twin Lakes area, it
123   was not related to this specific development but the overall Twin Lakes Redevelopment
124   Area, with each project, including this proposed Wal-Mart development, reliant on
125   roadway connections. Mr. Lloyd advised that the traffic analysis for this particular
126   development, as a requirement for all proposals, was still under preparation, to determine
127   if additional traffic amenities were indicated (e.g. signals or additional turn lanes), staff did
128   not anticipate that this particular project would trigger those additional amenities, but that
129   they would realistically be triggered as additional developments came forward. Mr. Lloyd
130   advised that roadway and traffic control considerations would be considerations for any
131   development as they related to the Comprehensive Plan and AUAR, but had no bearing
132   to other documents.
133   Chair Boerigter referenced Section 6.1 of the staff report, the last sentence, related to the
134   Planning Commission's review of the requested City property disposal to make a
135   determination about whether the proposed development facilitated by the disposal was in
136   compliance with the City's Comprehensive Plan, and asked that staff explain it more
137   clearly.
138   Mr. Lloyd explained that the staff report talked about the proposed use in general, not the
139   specific site plan design under consideration, but whether the proposed retail use was
140   consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
141   Chair Boerigter confirmed the language of that sentence again, clarifying the applicable
142   standard for which the Commission needed to make its determination.
143   Member Gisselquist questioned how intertwined the two recommended actions are, and
144   whether the development could be platted without the disposal of City property.
145   Mr. Lloyd opined that the Plat could probably be designed without the additional property.
146   Mr. Paschke advised that the request for disposal of the land was not so much a platting
147   issue as a site plan design issue; and opined that the developer could engineer the site if
      Regular Planning Commission Meeting
      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
      Page 4
148                 it was the City's determination not to sell back that piece of land, and that it was not
149                 necessarily needed to make the proposed development work.
150                 Chair Boerigter asked if the land would then remain available for City right-of-way; to
151                 which Mr. Paschke clarified that the property was not City right-of-way, nor was it needed
152                 as such.
153                 Mr. Lloyd concurred, noting that this was the reason a formal vacation was not being
154                 requested, since the property had originally been intended to be used in conjunction with
155                 the roadway, but not strictly for right-of-way purposes.
156                 Member Gisselquist noted his understanding of the decision currently before the
157                 Commission based strictly on land use, with parcels being brought together by private
158                 owners, with the land disposal considered in light of the Twin Lakes Master Plan and
159                 Comprehensive Plan. Member Gisselquist advised that the disposal of City land was of
160                 concern to him, understanding that plat itself allowed little decision-making by the
161                 Commission. However, Member Gisselquist noted that, with the land disposal, it brought
162                 to the forefront the documents worked on over several years by citizens (e.g. Zoning
163                 Code, Comprehensive Plan, etc.).
164                 Mr. Lloyd indicated that the most fundamental way staff reviewed the proposal was
165                 seeing it as Comprehensive Plan amenable, noting that it was the purpose of the revised
166                 Zoning Code, and bringing it into consistency with the goals and policies of the 2030
167                 Comprehensive Plan, not just for the entire City but specifically for the Twin Lakes
168                 Redevelopment Area as well. While the Zoning Code revisions are still fresh, Mr. Lloyd
169                 noted that staff made their recommendation after a thorough review and confidence that
170                 the development met zoning requirements, and fell under the guidance of the
171                 Comprehensive Plan.
172                 Member Strohmeier expressed concern with the public notice issue after hearing from
173                 various neighbors who had also expressed their concerns about the public notice for this
174                 proposed development. Member Strohmeier questioned the trigger for requiring a
175                 community open house; opining that this was a pretty substantial planning decision, and
176                 questioned why it hadn't mandated an open house.
177                 Mr. Lloyd advised that open houses are mandated for would-be applicants or applications
178                 that deviated from City Code, or those things not in the usual realm of a particular Zoning
179                 District. Mr. Lloyd noted that this plat had more to do with the Subdivision Code and
180                 realignment of parcels, and provided several examples of developments requiring open
181                 houses.
182                 Member Strohmeier opined that the community, as well as he, had been caught off guard
183                 by this proposal.
184                 Member Lester questioned what other land uses were proposed for this parcel in the
185                 future.
186                 Mr. Lloyd advised that the overall Site Plan indicated several smaller restaurant uses on
187                 the smaller lots, but the Plan also facilitated ownership of parcels for other allowable
188                 uses. Mr. Lloyd opined that restaurant uses would typically follow a Wal-Mart
189                 development, but the buildings illustrated on the Site Plan presented were simply
190                 included to address potential zoning requirements as an example, but may not be their
191                 exact use as the parcel develops in the future.
192                 At the request of Member Wozniak as to what other uses may occur, Mr. Lloyd advised
193                 that whatever was allowed as a use in a Community Mixed Use District.
194                 Applicant Representatives:
195                 Will Matzek, Engineer of Record for Wal-Mart development team
196                 Mr. Matzeck thanked the Planning Commission for their time and consideration of the two
197                 requested actions, and concurred with staff's review of the proposal details. Mr. Matzeck
198                 advised that of the overall Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area of approximately 179 acres,
                                                       Regular Planning Commission Meeting

                                                                                     Page 5
199   this portion was approximately fourteen (14) acres. Mr. Matzeck noted that the zoning
200   designation and AUAR both looked at the possibility of a retail site in the Redevelopment
201   Area, anticipating 175,000 square feet of retail at this location; noting that the actual area
202   of the proposed Wal-Mart was somewhat less than that square footage. Mr. Matzeck
203   advised that Wal-Mart intended to comply with all Zoning requirements and conditions as
204   proscribed by staff in their report.
205   Member Boguszewski questioned if, for whatever reason, the Commission did not concur
206   with disposing the City parcel of land, how that would affect Wal-Mart's plans or whether
207   they could work around that.
208   Mr. Matzeck advised that, generally speaking, the rationale for their request was that the
209   additional parcel would allow the site to function better and operate in a better and more
210   efficient manner for the City of Roseville as well as Wal-Mart. Mr. Matzeck opined that the
211   roundabout and City infrastructure in place will work well whether the City-owned
212   property was purchased or not, and Wal-Mart engineers could modify the Site Plan
213   accordingly, while that would not be their preference. Mr. Matzeck clarified that he didn't
214   anticipate that failure to transfer the property would not halt the project.
215                                        Public Comment
216   Chair Boerigter opened the meeting to public comment at this time.
217   Written comments received by staff to-date via various sources were included in the staff
218   report dated February 1, 2012, and included as Attachment F. Written comments via
219   various sources received after distribution of the agenda packet, are also included for the
220   record, will be attached hereto and made a part hereof, from the following residents:
221   ·   Wendy Thompson, no address given (in opposition to Wal-Mart as the choice
222       retailer);
223   ·   Cary and Shannon Cunningham, 2920 Fairview Avenue N (in opposition to the
224       development of a big box retailer);
225   ·   Doug Nonemaker, 2179 Dellwood Avenue (in opposition to the development of a big
226       box retailer); and
227   ·   Gary Grefenberg, 91 Mid Oaks Lane (requesting delay of action at this time for
228       further review of the proposed development with the 2030 Comprehensive Plan).
229   Gary Grefenberg, 91 Mid Oaks Lane
230   As noted in Mr. Grefenberg's written comments, and for full disclosure purposes, Mr.
231   Grefenberg serves on the City's Human Resources Commission, and as Chair of that
232   Commission's Civic Engagement Task Force as a subcommittee.
233   Mr. Grefenberg's written comments and excerpt of the City's Comprehensive Plan
234   (Economic Development and Redevelopment Sections 7.2, 7.3 and page 7.5) were
235   provided by and included in the agenda packet attachments to the staff report. Mr.
236   Grefenberg verbalized his written comments, and displayed the excerpted portion of the
237   2030 Comprehensive Plan during his comments; and referenced portions of the staff
238   report that he opined were not sufficiently vetted by staff and allegedly inconsistent with
239   the intent and goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. Mr. Grefenberg asked that
240   a decision on this request be deferred until that additional vetting was done, and various
241   areas specifically evaluated and addressed by staff and Wal-Mart representatives.
242   Mr. Grefenberg noted the specific concerns in his neighborhood, and asked that staff
243   address how this development would not destroy his quality of life or provide rationale as
244   to why specific questions were not addressed by staff. Opining that Wal-Mart represented
245   one of the richest companies in the country, Mr. Grefenberg questioned why this
246   development should be allowed to negatively impact Roseville residents; and opined that
247   the community deserved more than a shallow and superficial statement by staff that the
248   proposal was consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

249                 Steve Gjerdingen, 2211 N Albert Street, Apt. #102
250                 For full disclosure purposes, Mr. Gjerdingen serves as a member of the City's Public
251                 Works, Environment and Transportation Citizen Advisory Commission.
252                 Speaking as a resident, Mr. Gjerdingen noted design standards for Mixed Use Zoning
253                 Districts for placement of buildings on corner lots and their alignment to the property line;
254                 and questioned how this development appeared to deviate from that standard, as well as
255                 questioning what the actual front of the building was. Mr. Gjerdingen also questioned how
256                 this project would enhance or promote the primary statement of purpose to increase
257                 pedestrian and multi-modal travel opportunities rather than relying on vehicular
258                 transportation. Mr. Gjerdingen concurred with the comments of Mr. Grefenberg that
259                 action on this proposal be deferred until all questions had been answered.
260                 Chair Boerigter interrupted public comment to reiterate that the purpose of tonight's
261                 meeting was not to react to a specific Site Plan, only to consider the Preliminary Plat and
262                 disposal of city-owned land. Chair Boerigter advised that, if the development itself was
263                 eventually approved, it would be required to meet all conditions of the City's Zoning
264                 Code.
265                 At the request of Chair Boerigter, Mr. Lloyd responded to some of the items raised during
266                 public comment to-date. Mr. Lloyd concurred with Chair Boerigter that the location of
267                 access doors, frontage of the structure, and all other zoning requirements of the City
268                 would have to be met in order for the City to issue building permits; with no development
269                 allowed short of meeting those codes or application for a variance to deviate from any of
270                 them. Mr. Lloyd advised that the building front would be determined by whatever street
271                 address it was given by the City, once design of structures had been completed; and he
272                 anticipated that the primary street seeing the most traffic would indicate Mount Ridge
273                 Road as the front, on the northwest corner of the site, or possibly Twin Lakes Parkway
274                 itself.
275                 Whatever the final designation was, Mr. Lloyd noted that the Twin Lakes Regulating Plan
276                 had been adopted late last year, and since codification of City Code only happened semi-
277                 annually, after which the website was updated, he suggested that the documents on the
278                 City's website pertaining to Community Mixed Use may not reflect that most recent
279                 adoption of the Twin Lakes Regulating Plan and its requirements that replaced previous
280                 code. Mr. Lloyd suggested that residents, when searching the website for the most up-to-
281                 date zoning requirements, rely on HTML texts rather the PDF version, since the revised
282                 text and the Overlay District may not yet be on the website in their entirety.
283                 Member Strohmeier referenced the Statement of Purpose in Section 1005.07 of Zoning
284                 Code, Community Mixed Use District, for complimentary uses organized in cohesive
285                 uses, and connecting to trails, etc. to create pedestrian-oriented development. Member
286                 Strohmeier questioned how this Wal-Mart proposal was pedestrian-centered, since he
287                 saw it as more vehicle-centered; and asked for staff's response.
288                 Mr. Lloyd advised that staff did not address that specifically for this Preliminary Plat, as
289                 Wal-Mart would become part of a larger redevelopment area of mixed uses, including
290                 offices, stand-along businesses, residences, and other allowed uses under the
291                 Regulating Plan, and pedestrian corridors would most likely be along the perimeters and
292                 would be cohesive for the overall redevelopment area. Mr. Lloyd opined that Wal-Mart, as
293                 the first and as an individual project would not achieve that pedestrian-friendly goal all at
294                 once or in a vacuum, but would be plugged into the pieces under that overarching
295                 Regulating Plan.
296                 Mr. Paschke added that we (Roseville) an auto-oriented community like most all uses,
297                 but advised that the whole purpose of Mixed Use and Twin Lakes Regulating Plan was to
298                 promote other modes of transportation in the future. Mr. Paschke noted that sidewalks
299                 and trails were already in place throughout the Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area as part
300                 of the public infrastructure investment built to-date. Mr. Paschke advised that, within the
301                 Site Plan and as part of the Regulating Plan, the developer would be required to perform
                                                      Regular Planning Commission Meeting
                                                      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
                                                                                    Page 7
302   additional work to achieve those requirements, as would other development projects as
303   they came forward.
304   Tim Kotecki, 3078 Mount Ridge Road
305   In addition to questioning if this development fit with the Comprehensive Plan, Mr.
306   Kotecki further questioned whether this development would be part of a Tax Increment
307   Financing (TIF) District.
308   Mr. Paschke advised that the entire Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area was currently
309   within a TIF District; however, he clarified that the developer had not requested any TIF
310   financing for their project.
311   Mr. Kotecki further questioned how much retail was currently within a two (2) mile radius
312   of the Rosedale Mall and including this area. Mr. Kotecki further questioned the ratio of
313   shoppers anticipated from within the confines of Roseville, and those anticipated from
314   outside Roseville. Mr. Kotecki questioned how many Wal-Marts had been built to-date in
315   the Twin Cities area, and how many had closed in that same area since 2001.
316   Sue Steinwall, Land Use Attorney for Wal-Mart in Minnesota, with the firm of
317   Frederickson, Byron, et al
318   In response to Mr. Kotecki's questions, and with recognition by Chair Boerigter, Ms.
319   Steinwall advised that her client anticipated this Roseville Wal-Mart would serve primarily
320   Roseville residents within a two-mile radius of the store. In the Twin Cities area, Ms.
321   Steinwall estimated twenty (20) existing Wal-Mart stores; with five (5) of those within a
322   ten (10) mile radius of this proposed store, with the closest locations being on University
323   Avenue in St. Paul and in St. Anthony Village.
324   To her knowledge, Ms. Steinwall was unaware of any Wal-Mart closings in the
325   metropolitan area; and was unable to respond to the amount of retail currently within two
326   (2) miles of the Rosedale Mall area.
327   Mr. Kotecki questioned how Wal-Mart determined where to place a new store; and how
328   much retail space per capita was already in Roseville, opining that it was very high.
329   Chair Boerigter suggested that public comment refocus on the land use issues before the
330   Commission, not proprietary questions of Wal-Mart that they may choose not to respond
331   to.
332   Jonathan Osborne, 1072 Shryer Avenue
333   Ms. Osborne questioned the process or next steps for this proposal, if the Planning
334   Commission chose to approve the Preliminary Plat; and if there would be other forums for
335   citizens to express themselves on the specific Plan for this site and for this specific
336   retailer.
337   Mr. Paschke invited public comment, at any time, by passing them through staff or
338   directly to City Councilmembers; however, he noted that there would be no further formal
339   Public Hearings for approval of the Site Plan for this proposed use.
340   Mr. Osborne opined that this proposal had moved through various channels rather
341   quickly; and wondered if more people had been aware of it, if more people would have
342   been at tonight's meeting to speak on the proposal. Mr. Osborne reiterated that it seemed
343   to have happened too quickly.
344   Vivian Ramalingam, 2182 Acorn Road
345   Ms. Ramalingam expressed similar concerns to those brought forward by the previous
346   speaker. Generally speaking, Ms. Ramalingam opined that once the Planning
347   Commission approved a Plan, it was rubber stamped at the City Council level and
348   became action.
349   Ms. Ramalingam expressed a number of concerns with this particular proposal, opining
350   that new business in Roseville should be locally-based to reach a regional consumer
351   base. Ms. Ramalingam further noted that there had been no discussion on additional
352   costs generated by this retailer (e.g. additional police, fire personnel, employee services
      Regular Planning Commission Meeting
      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
      Page 8
353                 borne by the City; education for employee children; or food subsidies to feed those
354                 children required as a result of parents working in this particular low-wage situation). Ms.
355                 Ramalingam noted that those considerations were not included in the Government
356                 Decision triangle included in the staff report; and questioned whether there was any
357                 venue to address these concerns.
358                 Mr. Paschke reiterated that the decision before the Commission tonight was not whether
359                 to support the Site Plan or the size of the proposed retail use on that site per se; but for
360                 their consideration of and potential recommendation to the City Council supporting this
361                 land division to create or reassemble lots in place into three (3) lots. From a process
362                 standpoint, Mr. Paschke advised that staff based the Planning Division recommendation
363                 to the Planning Commission for approval based on the lot lines, easements, and
364                 additional right-of-way meeting requirements of subdivision and zoning ordinances of the
365                 City.
366                 Related to disposal of the 4,300 square feet of property currently owned by the City, Mr.
367                 Paschke advised that this action required a slightly different analysis for determination;
368                 but reiterated that those two items were not tied directly to a specific project or a given lot
369                 in Roseville; and therefore, no forum was available for vetting them, or any Public
370                 Hearing process to review and approve them based on those concerns raised, other than
371                 those provided to staff and forwarded to the City Council or received directly by the City
372                 Council.
373                 Ms. Ramalingam thanked Mr. Paschke for the thoroughness of his response; however,
374                 she opined that it clearly showed a gap in the process itself.
375                 Mr. Paschke recognized Ms. Ramalingam's opinion; however, he noted that staff's
376                 charge and instructions were based on the City's Zoning Ordinance and Codes in place
377                 that were used by the Planning Division to enforce, as well as the Regulating Plan
378                 designed and governing the Twin Lakes Redevelopment area, that didn't instruct staff
379                 differently than the process currently used and as recently adopted. Mr. Paschke advised
380                 that the Planning Division was unable to fundamentally change the process; and was
381                 required to use the same process throughout the City of Roseville for any project or
382                 application coming forward, in order to avoid preferential treatment. Mr. Paschke
383                 reiterated that it was staff's charge to enforce and implement the requirements within the
384                 Zoning Ordinance.
385                 Ms. Ramalingam suggested that staff provide the City Council with the public comments
386                 and concerns received related to this proposal; with Mr. Paschke assured her that the
387                 City Council would receive minutes of tonight's meeting so they would be aware of public
388                 sentiment.
389                 In response to repeated cell phone interruptions during tonight's meeting, Ms.
390                 Ramalingam asked that the Planning Commission or the City Council itself make a policy
391                 statement or accommodation to address such interruptions during public speaking, noting
392                 the difficulty in following procedures and in hearing discussions due to those distractions.
393                 For the benefit of the public and listening audience, Member Gisselquist provided
394                 examples of issues that were heard by the Planning Commission (e.g. pawn shop
395                 request near Snelling Avenue as a Conditional Use based on zoning considerations) and
396                 other uses that are on the list of allowed uses (e.g. Source Comic Books at the same
397                 location) that do not come before the Commission since they are allowed uses. Member
398                 Gisselquist noted that, as long as the use met zoning requirements at a specific
399                 development site, there was less public involvement that occurred.
400                 Member Strohmeier opined that City Code language related to Preliminary Plat approval
401                 (Chapter 1102.03) seemed to be broad. However, the health, welfare and general safety
402                 of citizens would appear to be applicable in one or more of those categories with some of
403                 the concerns being raised by citizens. Member Strohmeier suggested that, considering
404                 that broad language, perhaps the Commission's hands were not as tied as indicated.
                                                     Regular Planning Commission Meeting
                                                     Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
                                                                                   Page 9
405   Mr. Paschke responded that the language would only affect how the Subdivision
406   Ordinance regulated or applied to this particular property, stating that the City's
407   ordinances foster those things, and that the Subdivision Ordinance was created to look
408   out for those things and how land divisions were required in Roseville through
409   easements, lot sizes, etc. and meeting certain requirements within the Zoning Ordinance
410   such as for residential lots with specific sizes in certain zoning classifications. Mr.
411   Paschke advised that those topics would be germane to analyze Subdivision Zoning
412   specific to land divisions, not uses on the land, since other regulations govern the
413   requirements of those specific uses.
414   Mr. Paschke noted that City Attorney Mark Gaughan was present and could expand on
415   that interpretation if he found it incorrect.
416   Rick Poeschl, 2220 Midland Grove Road
417   As a Roseville resident since 1968, Mr. Poeschl agreed with the comments heard during
418   public comment as well as those expressed by Member Strohmeier that if more residents
419   had known about the Wal-Mart plans, there would have been a much larger crowd in
420   attendance tonight. Mr. Poeschl advised that he had only heard about the Public Hearing
421   from a neighbor and fellow resident at Midland Condominiums; who had also mentioned
422   that Roseville currently had more retail per capita that Bloomington, MN with their much
423   larger population.
424   Mr. Poeschl noted that Mr. Grefenberg had highlighted and displayed on the overhead,
425   several sections of the Comprehensive Plan's goals and policies that seemed
426   inconsistent; and reiterated that if more people had known about tonight's meeting, they
427   would have provided more feedback. While not clearly understanding staff's responsibility
428   to follow the language of the Comprehensive Plan, Mr. Poeschl opined that more
429   neighbors should get involved.
430   Mr. Poeschl stated that he was opposed to the proposed Wal-Mart, and didn't want a big
431   box store in Roseville, including a Wal-Mart.
432   Megan Dushin, 2249 St. Stephen Street
433   As noted in her written comments and for full disclosure, Ms. Dushin serves on the City's
434   Parks and Recreation Implementation Committee for Natural Resources.
435   Ms. Dushin verbalized her prepared, written comments, and for the record, provided a
436   bench handout of those comments, attached hereto and made a part hereof. Ms.
437   Dushin opined that she found it odd that this was the only public hearing to discuss this
438   proposal, however opined that it was not surprising as this had happened before. Ms.
439   Dushin further opined that staff seemed to be facilitating this request as quickly as
440   possible, without taking the Comprehensive Plan into consideration. Ms. Dushin
441   encouraged Commissioners to take her comments and questions into consideration
442   when voting tonight. Ms. Dushin also questioned how the proposed bike trails off Fairview
443   Avenue currently being proposed by the Parks and Recreation Commission would be
444   impacted by this development.
445   Shirley Friberg, 2130 Fairways Lane
446   As a resident of Roseville since 1960, Ms. Friberg questioned if the Comprehensive Plan
447   would be addressed if the Planning Commission recommended approval.
448   Mr. Paschke referenced tonight's proposed actions, as two (2) steps, as detailed in the
449   staff report; emphasizing that neither action was related to the proposed use of the site.
450   Mr. Paschke suggested that citizen input focus on whether the plat met the requirements
451   of City Code as it related the Preliminary Plat and boundaries, and consistency of the
452   requested city-owned land disposition with the Comprehensive Plan.
453   Ms. Friberg stated that she had just heard about this proposal, and questioned if the
454   proposed Wal-Mart site was the same one considered by Costco several years ago;
455   noting that she frequented both Costco and Sam's Club; and questioned whether there
456   would be additional thefts to be concerned with if one of those stores were located there,
      Regular Planning Commission Meeting
      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
      Page 10
457                 opining that they had many internal controls to monitor shoppers. However, Ms. Friberg
458                 noted the number of police reports at Rosedale Mall that she observed in the media,
459                 recognizing the size of that center and the number of stores; as well as youth in the area
460                 and bus stops. Ms. Friberg opined that one of the problems with a Wal-Mart store would
461                 be people coming from outside Roseville beyond two (2) miles, since Rosedale had
462                 people coming from Wisconsin, and even bypassing Maplewood Mall for Rosedale as a
463                 more preferred shopping destination. Ms. Friberg opined that there would be the need for
464                 increased police based on shoplifting, car vandalism, and other issues; and questioned
465                 the negative impacts to the senior residence in that area; and if they would be safe
466                 walking to Wal-Mart from their residence, given that potential negative impact.
467                 Mr. Paschke advised that there was currently no sidewalk or trail on the east side that
468                 would facilitate pedestrians from the senior residence to the proposed Wal-Mart location.
469                 Ms. Friberg referenced other communities, such as St. Louis Park and Excelsior
470                 Boulevard improvements and Edina at 50th and France; and questioned what we wanted
471                 Roseville to look like; or whether we preferred that it end up like the Richfield, Golden
472                 Valley, Brooklyn Center or Robbinsdale.
473                 Chair Boerigter asked that Ms. Friberg refocus her comments on the issue before the
474                 Commission; and suggested that the public refrain from possible misperceptions that
475                 people coming to Wal-Mart were going to be of the criminal element and elevate crime
476                 levels in Roseville. Chair Boerigter noted that there was a Target store not too far from
477                 this area that didn't support that perception.
478                 Ms. Friberg defended her position by noting that more youth would be coming into that
479                 area and when that happened, there were more crimes. Ms. Friberg opined that Target
480                 handled their store security quite well; however, she did have a concern with a Wal-Mart
481                 located in Roseville, given the types of problems their stores frequently had, and
482                 questioned if that was what type of community we wanted.
483                 Member Wozniak questioned if it was reasonable for staff to address potential costs the
484                 City may incur for emergency services with such a development.
485                 Mr. Paschke advised that he was unable to foresee the future to make a determination or
486                 estimate a potential cost for additional police, fire and/or rescue needs as the City
487                 developed. However, Mr. Paschke opined that this proposed business was no different
488                 than any other business coming into Roseville that the City's Codes would encompass for
489                 regulation and enforcement, whether parks, residential homes or complexes, or
490                 commercial/industrial businesses.
491                 At the request of Member Wozniak as to how the City would recover those costs, Mr.
492                 Paschke responded that the City's main mechanism to support those services was
493                 through property taxes.
494                 Member Gisselquist referenced Section 5.2 of the staff report, noting that part of the
495                 review process involved the Roseville Development Review Committee (DRC) composed
496                 of staff from various City Departments, and their representatives participating in reviews
497                 of such land use proposals, at which time the public safety issues most certainly would
498                 have been considered and discussed prior to staff's recommendation.
499                 Mr. Paschke advised that the focus of those meetings, specific to this proposal, would
500                 have been the land divisions, and not necessarily the proposed use itself. However, Mr.
501                 Paschke noted that had been anticipated that a large retail use could come in, and staff
502                 had been prepared for that possibility and related comments coming forward. Mr.
503                 Paschke referenced that the Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area, through the AUAR and all
504                 Zoning, Comprehensive, Master and Regulating Plans had contemplated retail in this
505                 area, and noted that this use was consistent with those plans and potential uses;
506                 evidenced by the relevance of the proposed use and its fit with the City's Zoning
507                 Ordinance.

                                                      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
                                                                                   Page 11
508   Member Strohmeier, based on his interest and background in public safety, and during
509   his review of this proposal, referenced and quoted recent written comments provided by
510   City of Roseville Police Chief Rick Mathwig in preparing for strategic planning discussions
511   with the City Council for a long-term goal to "...Add tow (2) commercial patrol officers to
512   enhance the Police Department's ongoing efforts with the retail community. Retail and
513   commercial development, especially a big box store, in the Twin Lakes area will increase
514   theft-related incidents. One big box store is anticipated to bring 700 ­ 900 extra calls for
515   police services each year. The Police Department's resources will be taxed by the
516   development, and the resources currently in place at Rosedale will be stretched." From a
517   common sense standpoint, Member Strohmeier opined that a big box retailer would have
518   considerable fiscal impacts to the City's Police Department.
519   Member Wozniak, from a historical standpoint, asked staff how long this property had
520   been vacant or under-utilized; with Mr. Paschke advising that he had been with the City
521   for thirteen (13) years with the property remaining vacant; and he was aware that the City
522   had been attempting to develop the Twin Lakes Area since the 1980's.
523   Member Wozniak questioned how many, if any, developments had previously come
524   forward for this specific parcel; with Mr. Paschke advising that, to his knowledge, there
525   had been one other proposal, which was ultimately unsuccessful.
526   Member Wozniak asked Mr. Paschke what impacts he would see for this development on
527   other parcels and further development in the Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area.
528   Mr. Paschke responded by opining that any development in the Twin Lakes area will spur
529   other development, a historically proven occurrence. Mr. Paschke noted the enticement
530   for that development based on the funds invested by the City to-date for infrastructure
531   development in the area. However, how long that development would take Mr. Paschke
532   refused to predict due to market conditions; however, he noted that many parcels in the
533   Twin Lakes area were considered currently "development ready." Mr. Paschke noted
534   further development would be based on clean up costs and the willingness of potential
535   developers' willingness to build consistent with the City's Zoning Ordinance and Twin
536   Lakes Regulating Plan, and couldn't predict if it would take this one proposed
537   development or more to spur associated uses.
538   Member Boguszewski, from his career in health services and strategy in determining
539   additional potential growth areas in which to place facilities, advised that they often
540   looked for such developments as an indicator of a strong population and strong economic
541   growth; opining that this supported Mr. Paschke comments.
542   Chair Boerigter closed the Public Hearing at 8:08 p.m., with no one appearing for or
543   against.
544   Member Wozniak asked Mr. Paschke to comment on the proposed park dedication fee
545   associated with this parcel and its use; and asked how that fee would be allocated.
546   While recognizing that it was not related to land use considerations under discussion at
547   this venue, Mr. Paschke advised that park dedication fees paid to the City of Roseville
548   were based on 5% of the property's fair market value as determined by the Ramsey
549   County Assessor; and based on that calculation, he estimated that if the development
550   proceeded they would pay the City in excess of $400,000 for this land division. Mr.
551   Paschke advised that the fees were specifically designated for park enhancements and
552   improvements in and around the City; but was unsure of the exact language as per State
553   Statute.
554   Member Wozniak duly noted that, if this parcel was to be developed, the developer would
555   be contributing a significant amount in fees toward the City's park system.
556   Planning Commission Discussion/Position Statements
557   Member Boguszewski noted the many layers in tonight's discussion; even though the
558   Commission's decision-making was focused on the Preliminary Plat itself and parcel
559   transfer. While other areas of discussion as to use or development of the parcel and how
      Regular Planning Commission Meeting
      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
      Page 12
560                 the site was ultimately designed were not necessarily germane to the question at hand, at
561                 the same time, Member Boguszewski recognized the concerns of the audience that they
562                 may have no other opportunity to discuss the merits of the proposed use. Member
563                 Boguszewski noted that there would always be merits and demerits for any project or
564                 use, and at the risk of making his life less easy, he offered his thoughts and rationale for
565                 his position.
566                 Member Boguszewski offered his personal assessment and analysis of the merits and
567                 demerits for this parcel; recognizing that it was a passionate issue for citizens, and that
568                 the passion often made it difficult for people to understand other points of view. Member
569                 Boguszewski noted that the comments heard tonight were not in favor of this particular
570                 use; however, he advised that he had personally received and seen support for a Wal-
571                 Mart in Roseville, and while not unanimous, it obviously remained a divided issue.
572                 Member Boguszewski asked that residents keep several things in mind:
573                 1) The City of Roseville does not own this land and has no ability to force any particular
574                    development or option such as an IKEA, Trader Joe's or other option. If the proposal
575                    meets City Code requirements, it is not the City's job to fetter that development.
576                    Member Boguszewski stated that he believed in the free market, and in comparing a
577                    Wal-Mart to the vacant parcel currently there, allowing all the negatives to rise to the
578                    forefront, when considered in isolation, there was nothing to compare it with.
579                 2) Addressing another category of comments heard that Wal-Mart would be a blight or
580                    detriment to a beautiful spot, Member Boguszewski opined that this perception was in
581                    the eye of the beholder. When reviewing the location, Member Boguszewski noted
582                    that its location on the west side of the City, bounded on the south by a County road
583                    and railroad tracks, on the east by light industrial uses, and on the west by the
584                    Interstate; while further beyond that the area included a mass of car dealerships and
585                    similar uses, if Wal-Mart chose to locate in Roseville, he could think of no better spot.
586                    Member Boguszewski suggested that Roseville citizens could choose whether or not
587                    to shop at Wal-Mart, but if they were concerned that Wal-Mart was going to bring
588                    detritus to Roseville, this proposed location was at the most extreme edge of the
589                    community as possible.
590                 3) Based on his personal bias, Member Boguszewski stated that he did not consider
591                    and remained unconvinced that Wal-Mart was similar to a nuclear waste plant.
592                 Member Boguszewski advised that he took his role as a Planning Commissioner very
593                 seriously, and therefore had sought the advice of a market professor friend and was
594                 made aware of a number of articles on both sides of the issue, with as many saying that
595                 Wal-Mart was a positive for a community as those saying it was a negative. Member
596                 Boguszewski advised that his research of those articles and various opinions indicated
597                 that the impact to a community was based on a number of issues including, but not
598                 limited to, the area itself, existing retail, highway access, and existing "Mom and Pop"
599                 stores. Member Boguszewski advised that it would depend on Wal-Mart's business plan
600                 and their market research as to whether this store was a success or a failure; and was
601                 ultimately not the business of Roseville citizens anyway, since they had a right to develop
602                 in Roseville in compliance with City Codes.
603                 While not believing that it was necessary to address the merits and/or demerits of a Wal-
604                 Mart in Roseville, since the Planning Commission's task was based on technical issues,
605                 Member Boguszewski advised that he had done so for the benefit of Roseville citizens,
606                 recognizing the importance to them. Member Boguszewski advised that he would be
607                 voting in support of the requested actions.
608                 Member Wozniak thanked the audience for their public comment, noting that he had
609                 observed them through various forums before tonight's meeting as well. Member
610                 Wozniak expressed his disappointment in some of the comments he'd seen and heard,
611                 however he did support the public's right and appreciated their efforts to come out tonight
612                 to share them with the Planning Commission.
                                                      Regular Planning Commission Meeting
                                                      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
                                                                                   Page 13
613   Member Wozniak concurred with the observations of Member Boguszewski in the narrow
614   focus for Commission deliberations in approving property boundaries and transfer of City-
615   owned property to a developer to facilitate a development. Member Wozniak stated that it
616   was his belief that what was being proposed for this parcel was consistent with the
617   Comprehensive Plan and retail use; and advised that he would support the property
618   transfer and Preliminary Plat as proposed.
619   Member Wozniak noted the comments he'd heard about the City "railroading" this
620   development; and stated that he strongly disagreed with that comments. If the proposal
621   seemed to be moving fast, Member Wozniak reminded the public of the Statutory
622   requirements for land use considerations and the time available for a City to act on a
623   given proposal.
624   Member Wozniak clarified that the use itself as proposed was outside the scope of
625   tonight's discussion, and was a permitted use not requiring discussion. However,
626   Member Wozniak suggested that, while outside the scope of tonight's discussion, it was
627   apparent that talking about the proposal may be a need for the community and
628   encouraged Wal-Mart and their development staff to open dialogue with residents about
629   their presence in the Roseville community, since it the proposal was successful, Wal-Mart
630   would need to positively interact with the residents it sought to serve. Member Wozniak
631   encouraged Wal-Mart representatives to look for opportunities to interact with the
632   community on the positives they bring to the community, and not just allow the negatives
633   or perceived negatives to remain in the forefront.
634   Member Lester advised that Members Boguszewski and Wozniak had effectively
635   covered most of his comments. Member Lester advised that his analysis attempted to
636   look at the end result, and after almost thirty (30) years of the City attempting to develop
637   the Twin Lakes area, bringing in a potential use was a good thing, no matter who it was
638   as long as it was meeting City Code requirements. Member Lester clarified again that
639   tonight's request was focused on the Preliminary Plat, not the use; and discussions were
640   based on a vacant piece of land on which a viable company was being proposed.
641   Member Lester opined that Wal-Mart was a stable company; and further opined that the
642   Comprehensive Plan supported such a retail use; and the need was evident for bringing
643   in an initial development to further future development of the area. Member Lester
644   advised that he supported the proposal and would support it.
645   Member Gisselquist thanked the public for their comments. Member Gisselquist advised
646   that the Preliminary Plat portion of the request was an easy decision; basically
647   assembling parcels of land for a proposed use, and it made sense to approve that
648   request.
649   However, Member Gisselquist advised that he struggled with disposal of the land when
650   applying it to the Comprehensive Plan until he reviewed the Twin Lakes Master Plan on
651   line and reviewed that language. In referring back to previous discussions about a
652   proposed Costco, Member Gisselquist opined that it appeared they had been chased out
653   as the big box "bogey man."
654   Member Gisselquist advised that he would support the Preliminary Plat and land
655   disposal.
656   In recognizing that the big box use served as the elephant in the room and remained
657   present, Member Gisselquist opined that it had nothing to do with the request before the
658   Commission; but assured that the Commission had heard the concerns expressed by
659   those speaking tonight; and noted that Member Boguszewski had shared considerations
660   on the other side of the issue as well.
661   Member Gisselquist stated that one part of being a Planning Commissioner was that he
662   didn't like hearing criticisms of those seeking to come into the community. As a former
663   "Richfield guy," Member Gisselquist advised that he took comments personally when they
664   dished his former neighborhood. After thirty (30) years, Member Gisselquist opined that it
665   was time to do something in the Twin Lakes area, referencing his personal observations
      Regular Planning Commission Meeting
      Minutes ­ Wednesday, February 1, 2012
      Page 14
666                 when last biking in the area of four foot (4') grass growing through broken asphalt, vacant
667                 spaces, and graffiti abounding. Member Gisselquist assured residents that there was
668                 already a good police presence in the area based on his experience he shared as an
669                 example. Member Gisselquist opined that the area was currently a wasteland and he
670                 supported someone developing it; and while it will continue to be controversial, it was the
671                 right thing to do.
672                 Member Strohmeier thanked the public for their comments; and respectfully disagreed
673                 with other commissioners that the Commission's hands were tied regarding the Plat,
674                 opining that this was a major planning decision and a big deal. Member Strohmeier
675                 referenced various guiding documents showing that big box retail is not something that
676                 will benefit a community, including the Twin Lakes Master Plan, as well as sections of the
677                 Comprehensive Plan as displayed by Mr. Grefenberg and his comments, some of which
678                 he may disagree with. However, Member Strohmeier did recognize the numerous
679                 inconsistencies pointed out by Mr. Grefenberg. Member Strohmeier opined that he would
680                 agree with the Statement of Purpose for Commercial Mixed Use Districts, and the lack of
681                 a pedestrian, rather than vehicle-centered use. Member Strohmeier opined that this was
682                 simply one more way to add to the community's frustration in their apparent lack of a role
683                 in a role in local government, and expressed his disappointment in the current public
684                 process. Member Strohmeier advised that he would be voting in opposition to both
685                 requested actions.
686                 Chair Boerigter thanked the public for their comments, and noted his rationale in
687                 allowing for some flexibility with the broad-based comments even when outside the
688                 specific scope being considered tonight; recognizing that this was a Public Hearing
689                 needing to allow a forum for those public comments. However, Chair Boerigter
690                 emphasized that the Commission's decision-making needed to focus on the limited scope
691                 of the Preliminary Plat and city-owned property disposal.
692                 Chair Boerigter opined that he didn't personally think this was outside the Comprehensive
693                 Plan, but that it actually fit with the Comprehensive Plan and work done by the City over
694                 the last 5-6 years as a Planning Commission and City Council to guide Twin Lakes
695                 development.
696                 Chair Boerigter further opined that to have a perception that Roseville residents didn't
697                 have a voice in this was quite ludicrous since the Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area had
698                 been a topic of discussion for years; and as late as last fall, the Planning Commission
699                 and City Council held numerous and substantive discussions on the Zoning Code, the
700                 Twin Lakes Regulating Map, and other issues, and the allowed uses in Twin Lakes, all of
701                 which were consistent with this proposal. Chair Boerigter suggested that, to think that a
702                 big box retailer may not develop in the Twin Lakes area was hard to imagine, when all
703                 that was required was to listen to discussions to understand that retail was a permitted
704                 use and it may include a large scale retailer.
705                 Chair Boerigter stated that a review of the current Zoning Code would serve to dictate
706                 what was consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and as pointed out by staff, the
707                 Zoning Code was amended to make it consistent with the 2030 Comprehensive Plan,
708                 along with development of the Regulating Map as the governing document to control
709                 development in the Twin Lakes area consistent with that Comprehensive Plan. Chair
710                 Boerigter opined that it was important to take the overall picture into consideration and
711                 what goes into the development area as a whole, and what the overarching guidance of
712                 the Comprehensive Plan indicated, rather than picking out bits and pieces. Chair
713                 Boerigter expressed his confidence that the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Code were
714                 both very specific on the governance of what could or could not occur in developing
715                 and/or redeveloping the Twin Lakes Redevelopment Area.
716                 Based on his review of these documents, Chair Boerigter opined that the Preliminary Plat
717                 and request for land disposition both met City Code requirements, and advised that he
718                 would support both.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: I cannot believe the City of Roseville is considering approving the 
building of a Walmart in Roseville.  The city, a few years ago, denied Cosco approval, which would bring a whole 
different clientele to our area.  What's wrong with asking Cosco to reconsider building again.  We do not need another 
Walmart!!

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: According to the New York Times, the Justice Department is 
investigating a decadeslong bribery operation by WalMart management and a subsequent coverup in Mexico. If true, 
there are multiple violations of both U.S. and Mexican laws. Are they bribing people in the U.S.? And, is this the kind of 
company we want in Roseville?

idea of a walmart in roseville?    I understand the temptation to go along with walmarts agenda, but we have a nice 
community, with a great mall, why ruin it?

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: I am writing to express my strong opposition of building a WalMart 
store in Roseville. Sometime ago Costco attempted to build a store in Roseville and was not allowed to come into 
Roseville. Why give WalMart preferential treatment over Costco? 
 
 WalMart has a terible labor relations record and has had so many lawsuits filed against them by employees. Histroy 
tells us that WalMart is not a good employer. Also, history establishes that when WalMart comes into a community the 
crime rate increases dramatically in the area. More so than any of their competitors. For those reasons I urge the City 
Council to reject WalMarts bid to build in Roseville. If you are going to bring new businesses into Roseville, why not 
recruit an employer with a solid Labor Relations reputation with their employes's? 
I urge you to share my comments with the Mayor and the elected City Concil members. 
 
Thank you for your consideration.

         To the members of the Roseville City Council: 
          
         I'm expressing my support on behalf of all those citizens in Roseville who are opposed to the construction of a 
new WalMart store at County Road C and Cleveland Avenue. I have lived here for nineteen years and have been a 
Roseville property owner for eighteen of those years. Roseville has all the retail shopping it needs. This store is 
unnecessary and unwanted.  
          
         Full disclosure: I live at County Road B and Cleveland. But I would still be opposed to this store if it were being 
built somewhere on Dale or Victoria or Snelling. I patronize local establishments as much as possible. I don't want to see 
more local businesses suffocated by another big box store.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Hate group formation associated with bigbox stores 
Wednesday, April 11, 2012 
The presence of bigbox retailers, such as WalMart, KMart and Target, may alter a community's social and economic 
fabric enough to promote the creation of hate groups, according to economists. 
The number of WalMart stores in a county is significantly correlated with the number of hate groups in the area, said 
Stephan Goetz, professor of agricultural economics and regional economics, Penn State, and director of the Northeast 
Regional Center for Rural Development. 
 
"WalMart has clearly done good things in these communities, especially in terms of lowering prices," said Goetz. "But 
there may be indirect costs that are not as obvious as other effects." 
The number of WalMart stores was second only to the designation of a county as a Metropolitan Statistical Area in 
statistical significance for predicting the number of hate groups in a county, according to the study. 
The researchers, who reported their findings in the online version of Social Science Quarterly, said that the number of 
WalMart stores in a county was more significant statistically than factors commonly regarded as important to hate 
group participation, such as the unemployment rate, high crime rates and low education. 
The researchers suggested several theories for the correlation between the number of large retail stores and hate 
groups in an area. 
                                                            1
Goetz, who worked with Anil Rupasingha, adjunct professor of agricultural economics and agricultural business, New 
Mexico State University, and Scott Loveridge, professor and director of the Northcentral Regional Center for Rural 
Development, Michigan State University, said that local merchants may find it difficult to compete against large retailers 
and be forced out of business. 
Local business owners are typically members of community and civic groups, such as the Kiwanis and Rotary clubs. 
Losing members of these groups, which help establish programs that promote civic engagement and foster community 
values, may cause a drop in community cohesion, according to Goetz. 
"While we like to think of American society as being largely classless, merchants and bankers are part of what we could 
call a leadership class in a community," Goetz said. 
The large, anonymous nature of bigbox retailers may also play a role in fraying social bonds, which are strongest when 
individuals feel that their actions are being more closely watched. For example, people may be less likely to shoplift at a 
local hardware store if they know the owner personally, Goetz said. 
Religious priming  using certain words or phrases to promote a range of attitudes and behaviors  may also play a role, 
according to the researchers. In one study of religious priming, after participants reviewed a list of Christian words, such 
as Bible, gospel and Messiah, they also tended to support racist attitudes against blacks. 
The researchers said that because WalMart promotes typical Protestant values, such as savings and thrift, the cues may 
lead customers to adopt other beliefs, including intolerant attitudes, according to the researchers. 
The researchers used data collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that monitors the activities of hate 
groups, on hate groups in each U.S. county in 2007. They used the number and location of WalMart stores from 1998. 
Goetz said the lag time between the data sets provided time for the possible influence of a store to affect a community.
Goetz said that the researchers chose WalMart for the study because of the availability of data on the stores. He added 
that the presence of WalMart in an area generally indicates the establishment of other types of bigbox retailers, such 
as Home Depot and Target. 
"We're not trying to pick on WalMart," said Goetz. "In this study, WalMart is really serving as a proxy for any type of 
large retailer." 
The store chain could use this study to find ways to play a role in supporting local groups that can foster stronger social 
and economic ties in a community. 
"We doubt strongly that WalMart intends to create such effects or that it specifically seeks to locate in places where 
hate groups form," the researchers said.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: I sincerely believe that allowing this outfit to build a store anywhere 
in Roseville will sincerely downgrade the tone of our city.  Obviously the opinion of a single citizen means nothing to 
those interested only in development for development's sake. but I can assure you that any councilperson voting for this 
project will certainly not received any further support from this person.  That's not a threat, its a promise.

I feel we donot need a Walmart there as it will bring lower class shoppers.; 
 
Plus we have a Walmart  about 4 miles away in St Anthony.  I think a Costco 
 
or Sams Club would be much better.  Most people I talk to would perfer it. 
 
What happened to Costco and why was it shot down before?  Think of all 
 
the business that would buy big from it.  I am sure you council people 
 
would shop there to.  So vote NO on Walmart and rethink it over.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: I would like to convey my opposition to the WalMart proposal 
currently under consideration by the Roseville City Council. I learned of it through the Feb. 27, 2012 StarTribune article. 
Following are my reasons: 
 
1.       The neighbors in the Twin Lake area have always expressed opposition to Big Box. This should be strongly 
considered when making this decision. 
2.       This is a big enough issue that the whole community should have been sent information about this proposal ­ 
not just the required notices.  
3.       WalMart is not the type of company we want in our community. Over the years they have been underfire for 
their abuse of the federallyfunded medical assistance system, their treatment of employees in general and more 
specifically their treatment of female employees, their low wages and benefits, the experience level of their employees, 
their strongarming of suppliers both big and small, etc.  
4.       Legitimate media sources have speculated that WalMart is too big and has too large of an effect on global 
commerce. 
5.       Communities are taking a stand against WalMart for their negative effect on them.  
 
There are many sources to read about WalMart, including many articles in the country's major newspapers, an article 
from the American Prospect ­ The WalMart Economy ­ May 2011, the website makingchangeatwalmart.org, etc. 
 
We have wonderful retail centers in Roseville. Rosedale has gone through a successful upgrade with its theater, 
restaurants and stores. It is a prime destination for not only shopping, but entertainment. Target's remodeling has 
created a pleasant shopping experience with quality items. HarMar Mall gives people the option to shop in a smaller 
setting.  
 
There is little need or benefit to our community to allow the WalMart proposal to go through. 
 
Sincerely, Janet M. Olson, 418 Glenwood Ave, Roseville, MN 55113

We have lived in the same house in Roseville since 1967. I love the thought of having Walmart in Roseville. The first
Walmart I ever shopped in was a newly built one in Grand Rapids, MN. The greeter that met us at the door and shook our
hands was THE Sam Walton.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Please, please do NOT agree to put a Walmart in Roseville.  It would 
severely damage the already struggling retail in Roseville.  Just walk through Har Mar to see all the empty spaces, and 
then imagine how it would look if there is a Walmart in town.  Walmart provides only low paying jobs, we need 
businesses that will help our community grow and prosper.  There is a Walmart just a few miles away, it seems that they 
are trying to take over the entire world. Surely there are other options for that site that would enhance our great city 
rather than making it more tacky.

          Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: WalMart's motive for entering Roseville reflects, at least in 
part, their hope to hurt their main rival Target by taking out the nearby Super Target store at B & Snelling.  That was 
Target's very first store, part of our local history, and more importantly, a major contributor to Roseville area schools 
and community causes.  Let's rally to the defense of our neighborhood Target and keep WalMart out of Roseville.  I am 
not affiliated in anyway with Target Corp.

Walmart on that corner.  I don't object to the city developing that space, but does the world 
really need another Walmart?  Preferably not in my town!

I am a resident of st anthony village and live about a mile from the walmart in silver lake 
village. I would like to suggest that the roseville council take a close look at the 
increased activity of the st anthony police since the walmart was built here. This should be 
a concern since a week does not go by when there is not an incident or more that needs police 
attention. Also...the criminal activity such as purse snatching, use of stolen credit 
cards,shop lifting car breakins to 
name a few,is not confined to just the big box store but to the surrounding residential area 
as well.  Thank you for your consideration.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Hello Mr. Paschke, 
 
I would like it known that I am against having a Walmart come to the Twin Lakes site. Three 
reasons: 
 
1) Walmart does not provide sustainable compensation to its employees, as opposed to perhaps 
a Costco, Trader Joe's, or Whole Foods. 
2) Walmart is having difficulty with profitability at its present stores. Unless trends 
change, Walmart will need scale back their sites within the next few years to better match 
their potential sales. 
3) We have many Walmarts in the area already. In light of the second problem above, it would 
stand to reason that a Walmart at the new Twin Lakes area would have a likelihood of shutting 
its doors within a few years. Then we have a big, vacant retail box. Not a great situation. 
 
Inlieu of a Walmart, I would very much like to see perhaps a Whole Foods or a Trader Joes. 
Either of these has much less saturation, and would better server a larger (and perhaps more 
desirable) segment of Roseville's demographic. 
 
Please let me know what further steps I can take to help refocus a project for Twin Lakes 
away from a Walmart, and toward a more sustainable, betterserving retail or grocery project. 
Whole Foods or Trader Joe's being near the Lunds/Byerly's would have the effect of drawing a 
higherend demographic to shop in that area, in much the same way as fastfood chains tend to 
locate near each other to create a given location that people associate with a given type of 
product. Rather than be strict competition for Byerly's, such a presence would tend to draw 
more customers into that area to shop for higherend groceries. 
 
Thank you much for your consideration and response. 
 
Best Regards, 
 
Carl Berger

would hope that there are other local businesses that could be considered other than a big 
box store.  Thanks for your consideration!

The planning commision was poorly attended since it was poorly advertised so that residents

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Please look closely at the approval the 
Planning Commission has given to the preliminary plot and disposal of land for the Twin Lakes 
property. 
On reviewing the cable broadcast of the Commission meeting, it was brought out that any 
approval needed to be consistant with the cities' Comprehensive Plan. 
They ignored the fact that the Comprehensive Plan states that new development should not be 
"big box" retail. It was stated that this development would only entail 14 acres of 179 
acres.  Where are the 179 acres located?  Most of the land surrounding Cleveland and County 
Rd. C contains active businesses. 
It was stated at the meeting that a "big box" retail business would add 700900 police calls.
We need to keep Roseville's development compliant with the Comprehensive Plan.  A Plan that 
was just developed and reflects the current status of the City.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Greetings all, 
    It has come to my attention that WalMart is hoping to nest here in Roseville.  I 
understand that they are looking at the exact same area that CostCo looked at a few years 
ago.  As the locals made it pretty clear that we didn't want a "big box store" here very 
recently, I am surprised that this is even being considered at all.  The last thing we need 
is more retail and vastly increased traffic in this town, not to mention the financial pain 
that WalMart would inflict on local retailers.  Please knock this request down firmly & 
completely and then everybody can get on to more important matters. 
Thanks for your time, 
Rod Olson (mgr)

Please add my name to those who are in favor of the WalMart development at County Road C and 
Cleveland. 
 
This land has sat vacant for too many years in hopes of finding an "ideal" development 
situation.  It is time to be pragmatic. 
 
Thanks to all of you for the time and work you devote to making the tough decisions in

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: I would like to express my opinion about the 
proposed Walmart store in the Twin Lakes area.  Perhaps I am not remembering correctly, but I 
thought this type of development for Twin Lakes had been discussed and rejected a few years 
back.  There was a letter in the Review this week from Willard Shapira.  I do not know Mr. 
Shapira, but agree with his points. Roseville has always been able to attract high end 
development. I do not think Walmart will add anything positive to our City.  I realize it is 
tempting to get something going over there, especially in this slow economy, but as a life 
long citizen and 25 year Roseville homeowner, I would like you to reject this project and 
hold out for something better.  At some point this economy will pick up again so please don't 
hastilly accept this Walmart project. Thank you for your consideration, Linda Fearing

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: We don't need a Walmart in Roseville. The one 
in  St Anthony is about 3 miles away. The one on Co Rd E is about the same. We've two Target 
stores within a couple of miles of each other and we've got Rosedale Mall close by. I'm not 
sure why you want to saturate the area with low cost businesses like Walmart. I suspect maybe 
your having a hard time finding a developer for the area but I think to create a city of low 
cost outlets drags the city down economically and image wise.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Dear Roseville Planning Commission, 
 
What you are trying to accomplish by bringing walmart to roseville is both very sad, 
angering, and downright low.  Where on earth does it say in the master plan guidelines that 
bigbox retail is ok?  Really...show me where it says that.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  I may 
be a citizen of roseville (don't deserve a capital r), but I'm not that stupid...I've read 
front to back that master plan, and nowhere in there does it say bigbox is ok.  In fact, the 
report actually goes out of its way to say bigbox will NOT be allowed.  walmart is the 
definition of a bigbox, and don't try to use loopholes in the report guidelines to convince 
the public otherwise.  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for even letting this come up 
for a vote.  I hope Friends of Twin Lakes brings you to court over this, and I will be happy 
to be the voice of the opposition.  You lost last time, you'll lose this time too.  Maybe you 
should open up the books on the historical fights over what to do with that land, you might 
actually learn something on what the citizens of roseville have been shouting for years...NO 
BIG BOX ON THAT LAND!  If you contact me, don't do it before reading up on your own 
guidelines for the Imagine Roseville 2025 Master Plan. 
 
In closing, 
Ryan S. 
Disgruntled Citizen of roseville

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Though I am now officially a resident of 
Illinois, I grew up in Roseville, still spend several months each year there, and have strong 
ties to the city. My mother lives in Roseville, my brother and his family live in Lauderdale, 
I have many friends in the area, and I still feel strongly about my hometown. I have just 
read in the Star Tribune that Roseville is considering allowing Walmart to build a store 
within the city limits. I cannot express strongly enough how against this I am. 
 
Walmart has reprehensible business and labor practices, paying their employees as little as 
possible, firing anyone who expresses any interest in unionization, and has recently been 
subject to a gender discrimination classaction lawsuit that went all the way to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. Virtually every product they sell is made overseas by companies with even more 
horrific business practices. This is not the kind of company that we want within our city 
limits. I have always proudly boasted that my hometown community does not have a Walmart 
anywhere nearby. 
 

                                                   1
Roseville is lucky to have an extraordinary commercial tax base that supports our excellent 
schools (and I have recently read that RAHS was ranked among the top 500 public high schools 
in the nation) and community. With Target, Cub, and Rainbow already there, in addition to all 
the malls and strip malls, I cannot possibly imagine what Walmart would offer the community 
that it does not already have. I appreciate that the corporation has expressed interest in a 
space that has been vacant for years. However, I do not believe that it is worth allowing 
this corporation that is the poster child for irresponsible and unsustainable business 
practices into our community merely to achieve the goal of filling the space. Surely we can 
be more creative about what to do with the space. Perhaps it would be suited to a community 
garden space? Perhaps there is something that can be done to attract small local 
entrepreneurs from our own community into the space. Please consider what allowing a Walmart 
into Roseville would do for our cityI cannot think of anything positive that it has to 
offer us.

The Twin Lakes area has been discussed over and over for too many years.  I would prefer a 
company like Cosco going in at County Road C and Cleveland, and not a company like Walmart.  
After all the years of talking, let's do it right.  Cities like St. Louis Park have figured 
out how to develop with beautiful results.  We can do the same.

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Dear Mayor Roe and City Council Members: I 
join many members of the Roseville community in feeling frustrated and dismayed that 
Walmart's plan to develop a store in the Twins Lakes area was not disclosed publicly until 
just prior to the City's Planning Commission's meeting on the subject last week. While I am 
aware that this area has been designated for retail development and I definitely agree the 
blighted lots need attention, I feel strongly that Walmart is not the corporate neighbor we 
seek to invite into our city. The original intent for small businesses and retail sites is 
much more sound and cannot be equated to the Walmart megastore concept despite the 
Commission's assertion. More importantly, I hope you would all take under careful 
consideration the fact that Walmart has been one of the worse violators of employment laws, 
standards and practices. Please vote no to the Walmart plan and encourage further exploration 
of alternative retail options. Thank you for your consideration, Suzanne Sancilio

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: I was reading today in the Star Tribune 
(Sunday, Feb 5) about the proposed Walmart.  My wife and I do not believe that this would be 
the right location for this store.  On Rice Street serving both Roseville and Little Canada 
would be a much better location in terms of serving more customers who are further from 
Walmart.  The one in Saint Anthony is very close, only a few miles away. 
 
Original plans called for a local hospital.  Currently we need to go out to St John's in 
Maplewood, down to St Paul or Minneapolis or to Fridley.  It would great to have a local 
hospital, especially given the number of seniors in Roseville and the senior housing, nursing 
homes, and so on.  We do not have a Junior/Community college in the immediate area (St Paul, 
Minneapolis, or Century College).  It would be great to have a community college in the are, 
or at least local branch of Century College in Roseville.  If we must have a big box, why not 
Lowe's as was proposed a few years ago.  We have Target, Kohl's, soon Gordmans, and other 
stores very similar to Walmart in many ways.  We do not have a large hardware/garden center 
like Lowe's. 
 
Also, housing such as additional for seniors, owneroccupied  townhomes/condos, etc. would be 
a wonderful addition.

if the city does decide to sell cityowned land to walmart or roseville properties, i hope 
you base the price on the fact that you have a very eager buyer that has deep pockets, and do 
not base the price on the wasteland that it currently is. 
 
so, charge them at least $1,000,000 for the land that they seek  either one can easily 
afford the price! 
 
have a great weekend,

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: To all Council Members, 
 
I was surprised to learn that the Roseville City Council was once again entertaining the 
possibility of inviting a "big box" retailer to build in the Twin Lakes area. 
All the opposition arguments against such a move have been voiced by the citizens of 
Roseville several years ago when the retailer was to be Costco. 
 Traffic congestion, need for expensive infrastructure, and too much existing retail were all 
mentioned at that time.  Now we have a retailer (Walmart) that consistently pays low wages, 
has been named in several class action law suits brought by former employees for work place 
violations and is in direct competition with our existing retail community wanting to build 
here and all the previous objections are still valid. Why do you think this is a good move 
for Roseville now? 
 
Sincerely, 
Sue Gilbertson

February 1, 2012

Members of the Roseville Planning Commission,

I am writing to ask that you to turn down Wal-Mart's request to build a store at the corner
of Cleveland Avenue and County Road C. I understand the desire to develop the land in
the Twin Lakes area but the last thing that is needed in this area is more retail ­ especially
duplicate retail. All you have to do is drive around to see multiple empty buildings and
businesses that are just holding on. The huge World Market and Stone & Tile buildings
are good examples of what happens in this current climate. If you allow Wal-Mart to
come in ­ you will drive some of the smaller businesses out, along with cutting into the
business that Byerly's and Target has. How much additional lost business can they
absorb? If the residents of Roseville can support the retail we already have ­ why are
there multiple empty sites/buildings and so much more turnover of businesses?

I also do not understand the push to add retail to this area when this type of retail is
already available close by. There is a Wal-Mart six miles away on Silver Lake Road in
New Brighton and a Target less than 10 minutes away on Snelling Avenue. There is no
need to add either a Target or a Wal-Mart in between those two stores. Traffic
congestion, additional police and fire needs, noise, lights, pollution run-off into
Langton Lakes from the thousands of cars using the parking lot ­ just not a good
trade-off for the residents in this area or for the city.
If you allow a huge store such as Wal-Mart to build at this corner ­ the amount of traffic
added to an already overloaded street/freeway system will be a disaster. In addition, the
traffic won't stop at 5P ­ it will continue until the store closes at 10-11P. Have you
driven on Snelling, Fairview and Cleveland during rush hour or on the weekends? If so,
imagine at least a doubling, if not a tripling of the traffic.

Please consider the quality of life of longtime residents in this area. Many moved in
before this area was developed and most accept that development is inevitable, but please
move slow on this. Take time to really look at who wants to move in and try to bring in
businesses that are new or unique. If you are adamant that retail is going in this area
regardless of the effect on the traffic levels, please consider businesses that are not
currently in the area. Don't duplicate that which we already have close by! Maybe a
small ACE hardware, a Trader's Joe (love the store, but traffic will be an issue), a dry
cleaner, a small bakery, a New Horizon daycare (because of nearby park). Maybe more
small medical firms or clinics. Businesses that aren't open until 11P at night and
generate thousands of car trips a day.
If you will only consider a big box ­ what about an IKEA. While this store would have
the same issues as a Wal-Mart ­ it is unique and nothing like it exists in Roseville. IKEA
tends to attract a unique audience that probably would not shop at the HOM or other
furniture shops in the area ­ so hopefully it would not take much of their business. Please
work with the residents to develop this property at a pace that allows smart decisions ­ a
good fit of businesses to what is already there, does not duplicate retail and takes into
consideration the quality of life of the residents that live close by.

Thank you for your consideration,
Wendy Thompson

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Dear Members of Roseville Planning 
Commission, 
 
       It is with great horror and trepidation that we read the recent article in the 
Roseville Patch http://roseville.patch.com/articles/walmartproposingstoreforroseville
stwinlakesarea ­ that stated the Planning Commission is considering allowing Walmart to 
purchase land and build a huge facility at the corner of Cleveland Ave and County Road C. 
      My wife and I purchased our home on Fairview Ave (north of County Road C) in November 
2008 with the intent of making this our long term home.   We have and continue to pour love, 
money, and time into our home to make it a great place to live and a raise a family.  Over 
our 3+ years of living in Roseville we have come to love the close proximity to parks, 
shopping and all the other great amenities close to us.  During this time we have also 
learned to deal with the increased traffic that many of the local area stores bring into the 
area, after all we chose to live here.  However, during this time we have also noticed that 
with the increase of traffic overall safety on the roads has been compromised. Traffic on 
Fairview Ave alone has already claimed the life of one of our dogs who got too near the 
street, and we have almost been hit several times by cars driving on the shoulder to speed 
their way along.   
      What does this have to do with Walmart wanting to build a store ½ a mile away? 
EVERYTHING!  When you allow this behemoth of a retailer to cram a 160,000 square foot store 
into a ½ acre area this will not only inflict damage on the surrounding landscape but also 
increase traffic in the areas of County Road C and Cleveland Avenues as well as Fairview Ave 
as residents and shoppers alike look to speed up their commute around the congested area.  
This will pose traffic and safety issues for all citizens traveling or living along these 
routes.  Are you really willing to sacrifice the safety and security of residents and 
citizens to allow another big box retailer plop down in the middle of a beautiful area?  And 
in particular, a Walmart, which already has 5 other stores within 10 miles of the 55113 area 
code!?!     
                                                  1
       Furthermore, the fact that Walmart pays low wages to its workers is another big 
concern of ours.  Consider that people who would work at the Roseville Walmart would either 
be residents of Roseville or would quickly move to Roseville and seek out low income housing 
as they cannot afford to commute to work based on their low Walmart wages.  The low wages 
paid by Walmart would perpetuate vicious cycles of poverty for many people.  Do we really 
want to lower the standard of living and push more residents of Roseville into or near 
poverty with the meek wages they would receive from Walmart? We say NO! 
Please consider the future of Roseville if you allow this to happen.  More importantly think 
of the ramifications that this will have on you and your families as you travel these roads 
and deal with the increased traffic issues caused by this one store.   
We urge you to vote NO to this application and look for other retailers that can offer a 
better use of the space or more viable alternatives that will help sustain Roseville as a 
great place to live.  While traffic may still be increased by other smaller retail 
establishments at the location, they should not cause the continual crush of traffic that 
Walmart would cause.  In addition, mixed retail space would offer more jobs in unique 
industries that attract different skills sets and offer higher wages than Walmart does.  
       As you consider Walmart's extravagant plans for expansion, please also consider the 
needs of the citizens and community of Roseville. We have survived and thrived in this great 
community for a long time without a Walmart, help us continue this trend!!!    
 
Thank you for your time,

Please Share Your Comment, Question or Concern: Hi  I am wrting today to express my 
opposition to the proposed placement of a Walmart in the vicinity of Cleveland Ave and Cty. 
Road C.  In my opinion, Roseville does not need a Walmart to further shut down retail 
competition with small businesses.  Rather than another big box retailer of questionable 
integrity, why not support small business development in that area and start to grow another 
neighborhood.  I am also concerned that traffic in that area will increase with the 
associate4d costs and negative impacts on the overall quality of life here in Roseville. 
 
I rarely take a stand on these types of actions, but feel strongly that this particular 
action is not in the best interest of the citizens of Roseville.  Thank you for listening!

Dan Boeritger: 
 
  
 
If I can get permission to attend your Planning Commission meeting I'd like to express my 
concern that the Walmart Project has not been adequately vetted by staff.  I need permission 
because I've been gone every other night this past week and all day Sunday on the People's 
Business.  So for the purposes of achieving domestic tranquility I may not be able to attend 
what looks like a very interesting Planning Commission hearing. 
 
  
 
I've already transmitted many of these comments to my local neighbor, columnist, and 
community activist John Gisselquist, but since you are the titular chair I might as well 
share my words of wisdom with you. (LOL.) 
 
  
 
As I read the staff recommendation the Planning Commission must review the proposed disposal 
of land and determine whether it would be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan (Section 
1.2). 
 
  
 
Section 6.2 of the same staff report states in part: Planning Division staff believes that 
the proposed development is consistent with many of the Comprehensive Plan's other citywide, 
nontransportationspecific goals and policies, and that the proposed development does not 
appear to be in conflict with any of them. 
 
  
 
As a resident member of the Comprehensive Plan Steering Committee which drafted the new 
Comprehensive Plan I take exception to that sweeping and excathedra statement. It presents 
no rationale or explanation of why this is true; it doesn't even bother to state the goals 
and policies with which the proposed project is consistent.  I wouldn't describe the staff 
report as faulty or superficial analysis, because simplystated there is no analysis.   
 
  
 
I have attached an excerpt from the Comprehensive Plan's Economic and Redevelopment Chapter 
which illustrate some of those goals and policies which we are to take on faith as being 
consistent with the Walmart Project.   
 
  
 
I would suggest that you delay taking action tomorrow and send the report back to staff for 
further analysis and explanation of how the attached Comp Plan goals and policies are 
consistent with this project.  Otherwise the Comp Plan is just words and windowdressing 
which can be manipulated to prove any point staff wants to make.  The Comp Plan, developed 
with some considerable citizen involvement, needs to be taken more seriously than this. 
 
  
 
In advance I appreciate your time and attention devoted to this matter.

Bryan, 
Thank you for such a prompt reply. In reviewing my actions on the Planning File 12001 so I 
could tell you about the missing pages, I discovered they ARE there. I missed them because I 
didn't scroll sideways, only down the page. I appreciate your attention to my dilemma, and I 
apologize for my oversight.  
 
Enjoy your day off.

      Thanks for letting me know about the problem with downloading the report, Ms. Reitz. I 
tried the download myself just now, and it worked just fine for me, so I don't know what to 
tell you about why you're only getting half of the pages. I'll be out of the office on 
Friday; if you can wait until Monday, I'll email you a copy to ensure that you have the whole 
report. If you'd like the report before the weekend, perhaps you could email City Planner, 
Thomas Paschke (thomas.paschke@ci.roseville.mn.us) and he can send it to you. 
       
      Thanks again for the information about difficulties with the website.

      Hello, Bryan, 
       
      In reading the staff report on the WalMart application, I notice that pages 2 of 4 and 
4 of 4 are missing. Are those available for inclusion to read before the February 1st

Subject:                   Proposed Walmart


Roseville Planning Commission Members:

I understand you soon will be holding a hearing on a proposed big box retail located at Cleveland and County
Rd. C.
I have lived in Roseville for 55 years and observed it growing from a sleepy little village to the vibrant city it is
today. We already have 3 big box stores with the attendant traffic and police problems. That is more than
enough.

Huge national chains destroy Mom & Pop retail establishments and squeeze regional businesses. State law
requires us to share any tax revenue with outstate communities, but we can't share the fire and police and traffic
costs which are nearly half of our city costs. Besides, big box retail does not generate much of a tax revenue.
 We need higher quality business development, not retail.

For these and other disadvantages, please turn down this proposal.

Introduction
Walmart Stores, Inc. is proposing the construction of a new store, number 3404-05, in the
northeast quadrant of the intersection of County Road C W, also known as County State
Aid Highway (CSAH) 23, and Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) in Roseville, Minnesota
(see Figure 1). The project is anticipated to be completed by the year 2013, and will
include retail and grocery land uses on undeveloped property. In the longer term, two
restaurants are proposed for the outlots in the northwest and southwest corners of the site,
respectively. The proposed development site plan is shown in Figure 2. The purpose of
this report is to document the anticipated traffic impacts that the change in land use at the
proposed Walmart site will have on the surrounding roadway network intersections.

This traffic impact analysis (TIA) represents a review of traffic impacts of the project,
based on land use and site plan information, and is intended to identify the key traffic
issues associated with the project. This TIA documents the existing traffic conditions in
the vicinity of the site, estimates the traffic anticipated to be generated by the project,
distributes and assigns these trips to the adjacent roadway system, and evaluates the
traffic operations of key intersections near the site and those providing access to and from
the site. In order to have a basis of comparison, a "no-build" analysis was completed for
each future scenario that includes the general background growth on the adjacent
roadways as well as traffic generated by other possible development adjacent to the
project.

Based on the analysis, the TIA evaluates roadway and/or traffic control mitigation
measures to accommodate future traffic levels in the system and whether these mitigation
measures are triggered by background growth or the proposed project.

Study Area
The project site is bounded by Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) on the west, County
Road C W (CSAH 23) on the south, Prior Avenue on the east, and Twin Lakes Parkway
on the north. The proposed development will include an up to 160,000 square foot
Walmart store, with the addition of two restaurants with bars in the future. The 6,995
square foot and 6,221 square foot restaurants will occupy the northwest and southwest
corners of the site, respectively. The site is currently undeveloped and is zoned as
Community Mixed Use. The site is in the southwest corner of the Twin Lakes
redevelopment area, which consists of mostly industrial or vacant parcels that the City of
Roseville has identified to be redeveloped with a mix of multi-family residential, office,
and retail. The development of a Walmart Supercenter is permitted with the current
zoning. Current nearby land uses are a mix of industrial, residential, retail, and office.

Three access points are proposed for the site, two on Twin Lakes Parkway and one on
County Road C W (CSAH 23). As part of the Twin Lakes area redevelopment, Twin
Lakes Parkway is planned to be extended to the east to Fairview Avenue N (CSAH 48).
An eastbound right-in/right-out access is proposed approximately 300 feet east of
Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) on Twin Lakes Parkway. The existing median opening
on County Road C W (CSAH 23) between Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and Prior
Avenue is proposed to be moved approximately 150 feet to the east, to provide a ¾
access allowing eastbound left turns into the site, while prohibiting southbound left turns
out of the site. The south leg of the roundabout at Twin Lakes Parkway and Mount Ridge
Road is the only proposed full access serving the site.

Data Collection
Intersection turning movement counts (TMCs) were collected at the following four
locations:

            Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & I-35W NB Ramps/Twin Lakes Parkway
            Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23)
            County Road C W (CSAH 23) & Prior Avenue
            Twin Lakes Parkway & Mount Ridge Road

Intersection TMCs were conducted on January 18, 2011 between the hours of 4:00 p.m.
and 6:00 p.m. for all four intersections. At the time the traffic counts were conducted, the
intersection of Twin Lakes Parkway and Prior Avenue was under construction and not
yet open to traffic. The south and east legs of the Twin Lakes Parkway and Mount Ridge
Road roundabout were also closed to traffic since they did not provide access to anything.

Figure 3 displays the existing lane geometry and traffic control for the intersections in
the study area. Figure 4 summarizes the existing turning movement volumes for the p.m.
peak hour, with volumes balanced along Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and County
Road C W (CSAH 23). See Appendix A for the raw turning movement count data.

Trip Generation
The Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation, 8th Edition, was used to
calculate the anticipated net new external project trips for the proposed development. A
160,000 square foot free-standing discount superstore (land use code 813) was used to
determine the number of trips generated by the site. The pass-by trip reduction was
determined to be 28 percent and was taken from existing traffic on Cleveland Avenue N
(CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23).

Existing non-vehicular travel was examined in the TMCs and determined to be
negligible; therefore, no reductions were made for transit use or pedestrian travel. The
trip generation for the proposed project with adjustments for pass-by trips is shown in
Table 1. The proposed site is anticipated to generate 531 trips (261 entering, 270 exiting)
in the p.m. peak hour.

In the longer term, the two restaurants on the outparcels on the west side of the site were
also assumed to be in operation. Land use code 932, representing high-turnover (sit-
down) restaurants, was used for both outparcels. An internal capture rate of 20 percent
between the two restaurants and Walmart was assumed based on the Institute of
Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation Handbook, 2nd Edition. As the smaller
trip generator, the restaurants were the limiting factor in determination of total internal
trips, with a total of 29. Pass-by was then applied to the remaining external trips, at a rate
of 28 percent for the Walmart and 43 percent for the restaurants. In total, the three parcels
are expected to generate 577 external trips (292 entering, 285 exiting) in the p.m. peak
hour. Trip generation for the Walmart store and two outparcels for 2030 analysis is
shown in Table 2.

Future Traffic Projections
The Walmart store is expected to open in 2013. Linear growth of 0.5 percent per year was
applied to the TMCs to obtain background traffic volumes for the year 2013. This growth
is based on historical annual average daily traffic (AADT) in the area which actually
showed a decline over the last decade, so a minimum rate of 0.5 percent was used. The
2013 no build peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5.

A long term future analysis was also completed for the year 2030. Traffic volumes for
2030 were calculated from the volume data available in the Twin Lakes AUAR Update
Technical Memorandum ­ Traffic, Air and Noise Analysis and the Infrastructure
Improvements for the Twin Lakes AUAR Area Final Report. Trips generated by the site,
as calculated in those documents, were subtracted from the 2030 turning movement
volume forecasts from the study. The results were used as the 2030 no build peak hour
traffic volumes, shown in Figure 6.

Project Trip Distribution
The project trip distribution is based on a selected zone analysis from the Metropolitan
Council travel demand model and existing traffic patterns. As the Twin Lakes area is
redeveloped, Twin Lakes Parkway is expected to be extended to the east to provide an
additional east-west connection between Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and Fairview
Avenue N (CSAH 48). Slight differences in the project trip distribution for 2013 and
2030 are due to this network change, and are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.

Estimated project trips, shown in Figures 9 and 10, were added to 2013 and 2030 no
build traffic conditions, along with corrections for pass-by trips, as shown in Figures 11
and 12. The final traffic estimates for the build condition are shown in Figures 13 and 14
for 2013 and 2030, respectively. To reflect the uncertainty in longer range estimates and
forecasts, the 2030 volumes are rounded to the nearest 10.

Level of Service Analyses
Intersection level of service (LOS) analyses were performed for each of the intersections
within the study area using the signalized analysis methodology found in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) and Trafficware's Synchro/SimTraffic version 7. Each
intersection was analyzed for p.m. peak hours for the following scenarios:

                                   2011 existing traffic conditions
                                   2013 no build (without project trips) conditions
                                   2013 build (with project trips added) conditions
                                   2030 no build (without project trips) conditions

operations, as defined in the HCM, is level of service (LOS)--a qualitative letter grade
(A through F) based on seconds of vehicle delay due to the traffic control device at an
intersection. By definition, LOS A conditions represent high-quality operations (i.e.,
motorists experience very little delay or interference) and LOS F conditions represent
very poor operations (i.e., extreme delay or severe congestion). This study used the LOS
D/E boundary as an indicator of satisfactory traffic operations. Figure 15 displays the
LOS thresholds for signalized and unsignalized intersections.

It was assumed that for the future scenarios an intersection with unsatisfactory operations
should be addressed through signal timing modifications, or if that was not possible,
through implementation of an intersection or roadway improvement.

In order to determine the impacts of the project on the transportation network, a traffic
operations analysis was performed on the internal and surrounding roadway network. The
analysis process included determining level of service and queue lengths at each of the
study intersections for existing, no build, and build conditions. Supporting SimTraffic
reports are included in Appendix B. For each scenario, five one-hour simulations were
conducted in SimTraffic.

In each of the following sections, a description of potentially unsatisfactory operational
characteristics is summarized for each scenario modeled. For each scenario, a table is
included where the intersection level of service and delay is summarized. The SimTraffic
reports were reviewed to identify individual movements that experience unsatisfactory
level of service and delay or queues that are anticipated to block the adjacent lane. Only
in instances where an individual movement experiences an unsatisfactory measure of
effectiveness will the movement information be summarized.

2011 Existing Operations

Tables 3 and 4 provide 2011 LOS and queuing results, respectively. All intersections
operate at LOS C or better during the p.m. peak period. A total of three movements
operate at LOS E or F:
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway eastbound through:
        average delay 99 seconds of per vehicle, LOS F. There are only 3 vehicles
        making this movement in the peak hour. This is a result of the long cycle length
        (120 seconds) and random arrivals, and does not represent an operational
        deficiency.
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) southbound
        left: average delay of 75 seconds per vehicle, LOS E. This is a very heavy
        movement in the p.m. peak hour, with 325 vehicles making this left turn, many of
        which come from the I-35W northbound exit ramp 550 feet to the north. The 95th
        percentile queue is 364 feet, compared to a turn lane length of 200 feet. The
        southbound left turn queue often spills out of the turn lane and blocks traffic in
        the adjacent through lane.
        County Road C W (CSAH 23) & Prior Avenue southbound left: average delay of
        56 seconds per vehicle, LOS E. This movement has only 3 vehicles making this
        turn and the delay does not represent an operational deficiency.

Aside from the southbound left turn queue at Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and
County Road C W (CSAH 23), no other queues spill out of the turn lane. However,
several turn lanes do get blocked by the queues in the adjacent through lanes:
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway southbound left
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway eastbound right
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) northbound
         left
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) southbound
         left
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) eastbound left

2013 No Build Operations

Tables 5 and 6 provide 2013 no build LOS and queuing results, respectively. Signal
timings were optimized for 2013 no build operations. Because of the high volumes at the
signalized intersections, operations can be very sensitive to changes in volume. In the
p.m. peak hour, with signal timings optimized, all intersections are expected to operate at
LOS C or better, and all individual movements are expected to operate at LOS D or
better. The 95th percentile queue (339 feet) for the southbound left turn at Cleveland
Avenue N (CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23) extends beyond the length of
the turn lane (200 feet) and is expected to block the adjacent through lane, as does the
northbound left turn queue at Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and Twin Lakes Parkway
(240-foot 95th percentile queue compared to a 175-foot turn lane). As in the existing
conditions, the following turn lanes are blocked by the 95th percentile queues in the
adjacent through lanes:
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway southbound left
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway eastbound right
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) northbound

2013 Build Operations

Table 7 provides 2013 build LOS results. Signal timings were optimized for 2013 build
operations. In the p.m. peak hour, the 2013 build condition analysis showed that all
intersections are expected to operate at LOS C or better, and all individual movements
are expected to operate at LOS D or better. All movements at the proposed right-in/right-
out access on Twin Lakes Parkway and the ¾ access on County Road C W (CSAH 23)
operate at LOS A with no queuing issues.

Table 8 provides 2013 build queuing results. Queues spilled out of and blocked turn
lanes at the two intersections on Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46). Ninety-fifth percentile
queues are expected to block the adjacent through lanes for the following movements:
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway northbound left: 306-
         foot queue, 175-foot turn lane
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway eastbound right: 264-
         foot queue, 200-foot turn lane
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) southbound
         left: 368-foot queue, 200-foot turn lane

Turn lanes were blocked by the 95th percentile queues of the adjacent through lanes for
the following movements:
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway northbound left
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway southbound left

2030 No Build Operations

Tables 9 and 10 provide 2030 no build LOS and queuing results, respectively. Signal
timings were optimized for 2030 no build operations. The 2030 no build analysis showed
that the two intersections on Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) are expected to be over
capacity in the p.m. peak hour given existing geometry and 2030 volumes, with the Twin
Lakes redevelopment area built out with the exception of the Walmart site. Both
intersections operate at LOS F with excessive queuing, in particular, west onto
northbound I-35W and north along Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46). The other
intersections appear to operate at LOS A; however, they are not serving the actual hourly
demand due to the bottleneck on Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46).

2030 Build Operations

Table 11 provides 2030 build LOS results. Signal timings were optimized for 2030 build
operations. Similar to the 2030 no build scenario, the 2030 build analysis showed that the
two intersections on Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) are expected to be over capacity
given existing geometry, 2030 volumes, and the Twin Lakes redevelopment area built
out. Both intersections operate at LOS F with excessive queuing, in particular, west onto
northbound I-35W and north along Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46). The other
intersections appear to operate at LOS C or better, but the bottleneck at Cleveland
Avenue N (CSAH 46), prevents the actual hourly demand from reaching the surrounding
intersections.

In addition to the multiple movements on Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46), the
southbound right turn movement from the proposed Walmart site onto County Road C W
(CSAH 23) is expected to operate at LOS F. This delay, representing exiting demand
from the site, is due to the long westbound queue on County Road C W (CSAH 23) at
Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46), which can extend almost to Prior Avenue. The
westbound queue prevents vehicles from exiting the site and also causes some free
movements on eastbound and westbound County Road C W (CSAH 23) to operate at
LOS C at the site access. No queuing issues are anticipated at the right-in/right-out access
on Twin Lakes Parkway. Table 12 provides 2030 build queuing results.

2030 Build Operations with Twin Lakes AUAR improvements

Table 13 provides LOS results for the 2030 build scenario with the implementation of the
Twin Lakes AUAR recommended improvements. Signal timings were optimized.
Changes to the roadway network consisted of the following improvements at Cleveland
Avenue N (CSAH 46) and Twin Lakes Parkway:
       Addition of a northbound left turn lane (dual lefts)
       Addition of a northbound right turn lane
       Addition of 2 eastbound through lanes and conversion of shared left/through lane
       to dedicated left turn lane
       Conversion of westbound shared left/through lane to dedicated left turn lane
       Addition of a westbound through lane and conversion of right-turn lane to shared
       through/right lane
       Extension of the existing southbound left turn lane

In addition, a westbound right-turn lane with turn lane storage was recommended at
Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23). Turn lane lengths

were not specified in the AUAR and were modeled at lengths to mirror existing turn
lanes or at 300 feet.

The 2030 build analysis with improvements showed that all intersections are expected to
operate at LOS D or better during the p.m. peak hour, with the exception of the Cleveland
Avenue N (CSAH 46) and I-35W NB Ramps/Twin Lakes Parkway intersection, which is
projected to operate at LOS E. The following movements operate at LOS E or F:
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway southbound left:
        average delay of 113 seconds per vehicle, LOS F.
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway southbound through:
        average delay of 128 seconds per vehicle, LOS F.
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway southbound right:
        average delay of 76 seconds per vehicle, LOS E.
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) northbound
        through: average delay of 57 seconds per vehicle, LOS E.
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) southbound
        left: average delay of 110 seconds per vehicle, LOS F.
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) eastbound
        left: average delay of 122 seconds per vehicle, LOS F.
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) westbound
        left: average delay of 207 seconds per vehicle, LOS F.

These delays are primarily due to the heavy southbound left turn volume at Cleveland
Avenue N (CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23). With 400 vehicles making this
movement, a second left-turn lane is necessary, but is presumably not recommended in
the AUAR due to limited right-of-way. As a result the southbound left turn queue at
Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23) spills out of the turn
lane into the adjacent through lane, and back through the upstream intersection. In
addition, the long split needed to serve this phase reduces time available for other
movements at the intersection.

Queues are reduced with the improvements on Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46), but turn
lane spillback is expected for several movements. Ninety-fifth percentile queues
exceeded turn lane storage lengths for the following movements:
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway eastbound right: 320-
         foot queue, 200-foot turn lane
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) southbound
         left: 391-foot queue, 200-foot turn lane
         Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) eastbound
         left: 334-foot queue, 150-foot turn lane

                                                                           Traffic Impact Analysis
                                                                             Roseville, Minnesota



            Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) westbound
            left: 358-foot queue, 275-foot turn lane
            Twin Lakes Parkway & Mount Ridge Road southbound right: 165-foot queue,
            75-foot turn lane

In some cases, such as the long southbound queue at Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46)
and Twin Lakes Parkway resulting from downstream delay, the queuing and blocking
issues are not reported as the AUAR does not provide recommendations for storage lane
length. According to the SimTraffic results, turn lanes were blocked by the 95th percentile
queues of the adjacent through lanes for the following movements:
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & Twin Lakes Parkway eastbound right
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) northbound
        left
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) southbound
        left
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) eastbound left
        Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) & County Road C W (CSAH 23) westbound
        left
        County Road C W (CSAH 23) & Prior Avenue eastbound left
        County Road C W (CSAH 23) & Prior Avenue westbound left
        Twin Lakes Parkway & Mount Ridge Road southbound right

Most of these queuing and blocking issues are due to the aforementioned heavy
southbound left at Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23).
At County Road C W (CSAH 23) and Prior Avenue, the 95th percentile queues indicate
that the eastbound and westbound turn lanes are anticipated to be blocked by a couple
vehicles during the p.m. peak hour.

Queues for the southbound right turn at Twin Lakes Parkway and Prior Avenue were
never observed to spill out of the storage lane during simulation. According to the
Synchro Studio 7 User Guide (page 23-12), "SimTraffic tries to determine whether the
stopping is due to queuing or lane changes. In some cases stopping for lane changes will
be counted as queuing." Since no queues were observed to fill the turn lane and the free
right­turn movement has few conflicts, it is likely that vehicles stopped in the through
lane waiting for access to the right-turn lane were sometimes considered to be part of the
turn lane queue. The reported maximum queues are likely due to the limitations of the
modeling software and do not represent an operational deficiency. The queue lengths and
available storage lengths are summarized in Table 14.

Access Alternatives
Alternative access options were considered to investigate whether fewer accesses would
be sufficient to serve the site. Options considered included removing the right-in/right-out
on Twin Lakes Parkway, reducing the ¾ access on County Road C W (CSAH 23) to a
right-in/right out, and combinations thereof.

Removing the right-in/right-out on Twin Lakes Parkway reduces access to the two outlots
on the west end of the site. It would require all outlot vehicles to circulate through the
Walmart parking lot. The right-in/right-out has been moved further east based on
discussions with City of Roseville staff.

Left turns from eastbound County Road C W (CSAH 23) into the site experience little
delay and do not affect the through traffic. Reducing the access to a right-in/right-out
would increase the number of vehicles that would use Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) to

                                                                              Roseville, Minnesota



access the site, leading to additional congestion at the two intersections with County
Road C W (CSAH 23) and Twin Lakes Parkway.

Recommendations
With the construction of Walmart store #3404-05 in the northeast quadrant of the
Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23) intersection, no off-
site mitigation measures are recommended. Some limited lane blocking and turn lane
spillback are expected at project buildout (2013), but average delays are projected to be
acceptable. With small signal timing adjustments, the network is expected to operate as
well as it does in existing conditions.

In the long term, growth in the area should continue to be monitored. If the area develops
as anticipated in the AUAR, consideration should be given to the intersections on
Cleveland Avenue N (CSAH 46). Even with improvements as defined in the Twin Lakes
AUAR, several movements are expected to operate at LOS F and the Cleveland Avenue
N (CSAH 46) and Twin Lakes Parkway intersection is expected to operate at LOS E. It
appears that one of the primary problems is the southbound left turn at Cleveland Avenue
N (CSAH 46) and County Road C W (CSAH 23). Some of the traffic making that
movement may be diverted to the new east-west connection on Twin Lakes Parkway, but
that may not eliminate the issue. Many of the projected problems could be resolved with
the reconfiguration of the I-35W interchange at County Road C W (CSAH 23).

SUBJECT:      REVIEW OF TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS FOR WALMART (STORE #3404-05)
              ROSEVILLE, MN


As requested, we have completed a review of the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) that
was completed in July 2011 by Kimley-Horn and Associates. This review document is
broken up into three sections in order to guide you through our findings, conclusions and
recommendations (General Review of the Walmart TIA, Recommended TIA Modifications
and Additional Information Required, and Recommended Roadway Improvements).


GENERAL REVIEW OF THE WALMART TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
Traffic Volume Comparison
   The existing year 2011 turning movement counts collected as part of the TIA (shown in
   Figure 4 of the study) were compared to historical year 2006 turning movement counts
   previously collected at the same study intersections. The differences between the
   historical and updated traffic counts are summarized below:
   o Northbound I-35W off-ramp to Cleveland Avenue
      Approximate 20 percent reduction in volume from the year 2006 counts
           A review of other historical ramp volume data attained from MnDOT indicates
           that ramp volumes appear to fluctuate daily and by time of year at this location
   o Southbound Cleveland Avenue (between Twin Lakes Parkway and County Road C)
      Approximate 10 percent reduction in volume from the year 2006 counts
   o Southbound Cleveland Avenue (south of County Road C)
      Approximate 10-15 percent reduction in volume from the year 2006 counts
Deb Bloom, P.E.                                                             November 30, 2011
City of Roseville                                                                      Page 2


    o Westbound County Road C
       Approximate 10-20 percent increase in volume from the year 2006 counts
    o Eastbound County Road C (west of Cleveland Avenue)
       Approximate five percent increase from the year 2006 counts

    In general, the turning movement counts reflect current market conditions and account for
    recent area transportation improvements (Twin Lakes Parkway).

Trip Generation and Forecasts
    Page 8 of the TIA documents the pass-by trip and internal capture reduction factors used
    for each of the development scenarios (Short-term: Walmart only; Long-term: Walmart
    with restaurants). The pass-by reduction for the Walmart is 28 percent while the pass-by
    reduction for the outparcel restaurants is 43 percent. The internal capture rate between the
    Walmart and the two restaurants is 20 percent. Based on data in the ITE Trip Generation
    Handbook, these pass-by trip and internal capture reduction factors are appropriate. It
    should be noted that the pass-by reduction factor does not reduce the trip generation of the
    subject development but rather draws the trip(s) to the site from the already existing pool
    of background traffic on the adjacent street system.
    Tables 1 and 2 (Trip Generation for P.M. Peak Hour and Trip Generation with Outlots for
    P.M. Peak Hour) in the TIA document the trip generation estimates used for the analysis.
    The trip generation estimates presented are correct.
    A one-half percent (0.5%) yearly growth rate was used to account for background growth
    in the area for year 2013 conditions (year of opening), which is reasonable based on
    historical area growth patterns.
    The TIA states that the long-term forecasts (year 2030) were developed based on the Twin
    Lakes AUAR Update Technical Memorandum - Traffic, Air and Noise Analysis and the
    Infrastructure Improvements for the Twin Lakes AUAR Area Final Report. However,
    there is not a clear explanation of what volume set was used as the base prior to reduction,
    what the reduction amount was or how it was distributed through the network to arrive at
    the final answer presented in Figure 6 ­ 2030 No Build Turning Movement Volumes.
    o It should be noted that based on our review of the information provided in Figure 6
        and our own deduction of what may have been done, it appears that a marginal
        increase or decrease in these volumes would not significantly alter the conclusions
        presented herein.
    o The applicant should clarify and explain what volume set was used as the base prior to
        reduction, what the reduction amount was or how it was distributed through the
        network to arrive at the final answer presented in Figure 6 ­ 2030 No Build Turning
        Movement Volumes.
Deb Bloom, P.E.                                                             November 30, 2011
City of Roseville                                                                      Page 3


Directional Distribution
    There are two directional distributions proposed for the site based on the existing and year
    2030 transportation networks. The main transportation network difference between
    existing and year 2030 conditions is the completion of Twin Lakes Parkway from Prior
    Avenue to Fairview Avenue.
    o Review of the directional distribution percentages presented in the TIA compared to
      the directional distribution developed as part of the Twin Lakes AUAR Update
      indicates discrepancies between the two. While these discrepancies may not impact
      the overall operation of the adjacent roadway network and/or the need for specific
      improvements, they do impact the broader understanding of the how the adjacent
      roadway system will operate under future conditions (year 2030).
            Under year 2030 conditions the amount of traffic distributed to Twin Lakes
            Parkway east of Prior Avenue is not in accordance with the Twin Lakes AUAR
            distribution for this parcel. The TIA states nine percent and the Twin Lakes
            AUAR generalized distribution percentages indicate upwards of 18 percent. The
            TIA distribution should be modified to be consistent.
            Another anomaly is at the County Road C and Cleveland Avenue intersection.
            There appears to be an even distribution between the southbound right-turn
            (15 percent) and the westbound through (15 percent) movements. However,
            further review indicates these percentages should be more consistent with other
            movements at this intersection accessing the adjacent transportation network
            (i.e. approximately 10 percent to the southbound right-turn and approximately 20
            percent to the westbound through movement). Making this change may have an
            impact on the westbound through queue at this location. The TIA distribution
            should be modified to be consistent.


Operations/Capacity
General Comments on Synchro/SimTraffic Models
    The Synchro models do not include the I-35W southbound on-ramp from westbound
    County Road C.
    o This ramp has a significant impact to the upstream traffic flow at the County Road C
       and Cleveland Avenue intersection as vehicles begin to align themselves east of
       Cleveland Avenue.
        With the addition of this ramp in the Synchro model, the westbound through lane
          utilization tends to shift more towards the shared through/right-turn lane
        Adding this intersection to the model will increase the potential for queues to
          extend back to the proposed 3/4 site access along County Road C (approximately
          715-800 feet east of Cleveland Avenue).
        The applicant should include this intersection in their analysis and review. Traffic
          volumes for this intersection can be used from the AUAR documentation and
          adjusted to fit with the year 2011 turning movement volumes collected.
Deb Bloom, P.E.                                                             November 30, 2011
City of Roseville                                                                      Page 4


    The applicant should show the maximum westbound queue at the County Road C and
    Cleveland Avenue intersection for each scenario to explicitly clarify any impacts to the
    proposed access along County Road C. Specifically the westbound through/right-turn
    lane queue information.
    Consider applying the link-OD function for the southbound right-turn movement at the
    County Road C and Cleveland intersection. Currently, there is a proportion of the volume
    for this movement that comes from the northbound I-35W off-ramp. In theory, no
    vehicles make this move because of the loop ramp to westbound County Road C.
    o Please note however that this modification would have minimal affect on how this
        movement operates and is not critical to correct.


Year 2011 Existing Operations
    The "2011 Existing Operations" section of the TIA (page 23, first bullet) indicates an
    eastbound through delay of approximately 99 seconds at the intersection of Cleveland
    Avenue and Twin Lakes Parkway. Independent analysis of this condition resulted in an
    eastbound through delay of approximately 55 seconds. This variation demonstrates that
    this movement fluctuates with variability in vehicle arrivals and should be considered a
    LOS E.
    All other existing condition operations analysis results appear reasonable given the current
    conditions.

Year 2013 No Build Operations
    All analysis and observations are reasonable.

Year 2013 Build Operations
    As noted in the general comments preceding this section, if the ramp to southbound I-35W
    from westbound County Road C were included in the traffic model the queuing results for
    the westbound approach to Cleveland Avenue along County Road C would be different.
    Independent analysis of this condition resulted in an average and 95th percentile
    westbound through queue of approximately 250 feet and 465 feet, respectively. The
    submitted TIA indicates queues of approximately 160 feet and 290 feet, respectively.
    o The existing access along County Road C is approximately 550 feet east of Cleveland
        Avenue. However, the proposed Walmart 3/4 site access is approximately 175 feet
        further east of the existing opening (total of approximately 725 feet from Cleveland
        Avenue), which based on the independent queue results above would not be impacted
        at this stage of the development.
    The proposed Walmart right-in/right-out access along Twin Lakes Parkway is located
    approximately 300 feet east of Cleveland Avenue and includes a dedicated right-turn lane.
    This location reduces concern over its proximity to Cleveland Avenue and would not be
    considered a deficient design from a traffic operations perspective. In addition,
    independent analysis confirms acceptable operations at this location.
Deb Bloom, P.E.                                                              November 30, 2011
City of Roseville                                                                       Page 5


    The optimized signal timing included as part of the year 2013 no build condition and
    again under year 2013 build conditions is necessary to help mitigate and manage queuing
    issues.

Year 2030 No Build Operations
    The year 2030 no build condition (without the Walmart site developed) results as
    presented in the TIA do not provide any useable information to compare this condition to
    the year 2030 build condition (with the Walmart site developed). The TIA conducted the
    year 2030 no build condition analysis without any of the AUAR recommended
    improvements in place, which results in poor levels of service and significant queuing
    throughout the network.
    The applicant should run the year 2030 no build operations analysis with the identified
    improvements from the Infrastructure Improvements for the Twin Lakes AUAR Area
    Final Report prior to adding on the Walmart development traffic.

Year 2030 Build Operations
    Again, the order of the operations analysis presented in the TIA makes determining the
    impact of the Walmart under build conditions difficult.

Year 2030 Build Operations with Twin Lakes AUAR Improvements
    The improvements identified in this report are consistent with the Twin Lakes AUAR.
    The northbound left-turn movement at the intersection of Cleveland Avenue and Twin
    Lakes Parkway was modeled with protective-permissive left-turn phasing as part of the
    TIA. This left-turn phasing is not typically recommended with a dual left-turn lane
    configuration for safety reasons; nor was this type of phasing recommended as part of the
    Twin Lakes AUAR documentation.
    o Operating this movement with protected only phasing should not result in an
       unacceptable condition.
    An independent analysis of the year 2030 build condition with improvements in place was
    conducted to determine how the westbound approach would operate at the Cleveland
    Avenue and County Road C intersection. This independent review included the ramp to
    southbound I-35W from westbound County Road C in order to understand how vehicles
    may align themselves east of Cleveland Avenue. Results of this analysis indicate an
    average and 95th percentile westbound through queue of approximately 300 feet and 600
    feet, respectively.
    o It must be noted that this condition takes into account a new westbound right-turn lane
        at the intersection of Cleveland Avenue and County Road C, with 300 feet of storage
        space. While the queues in the through lane average the right-turn lane storage
        capacity and exceed it based on the 95th percentile, without the right-turn lane in place
        operation of this approach would be drastically different and significantly deficient.
    o The proposed Walmart 3/4 site access along County Road C is expected to operate
      acceptably with no queuing issues.
Deb Bloom, P.E.                                                             November 30, 2011
City of Roseville                                                                      Page 6


    The proposed Walmart right-in/right-out access along Twin Lakes Parkway is expected to
    operate acceptably with no queuing issues under this condition.

Access Alternatives
SRF completed a review of alternative access scenarios to determine if fewer access locations
would be sufficient, negatively impact, or provide improved network operations. Based on an
operations analysis of varying access scenarios, the following conclusions are offered:
    The proposed right-in/right-out access along Twin Lakes Parkway, east of Cleveland
    Avenue is expected to operate acceptably with no queuing issues.
    o Based on discussions with City staff, this intersection was moved further east than
      previously proposed. This shift provides sufficient distance from Cleveland Avenue
      and will have minimal impact to the Cleveland Avenue and Twin Lakes Parkway
      intersection.
    o A review of the operations analysis without the right-in/right-out access was
      completed to determine how the roundabout at the Twin Lakes Parkway and Mount
      Ridge Road intersection would operate.
            Based on this analysis, removal of the right-in/right-out access would not have a
            significant impact to the operations of the adjacent roundabout under either year
            2013 or 2030 conditions.
            As noted in the TIA, removal of the right-in/right-out access would increase on-
            site circulation with development of the two outlots located on the western edge of
            the parcel. The northern most parking area abutting Twin Lakes Parkway could be
            removed to develop an exclusive circulation aisle to accommodate this increased
            on-site circulation if the right-in/right-out were not constructed.
    The proposed Walmart 3/4 site access along County Road C, east of Cleveland Avenue, is
    expected to operate acceptably with no queuing issues (located approximately 725 feet
    from Cleveland Avenue).
    o Based on review of the 3/4 access operations analysis, there is no negative impact to
       providing it from a network operations perspective.
    o Since there will be modification along County Road C to provide this access, consider
      extending the westbound left-turn lane at the County Road C and Cleveland Avenue
      intersection to approximately 375 feet to minimize future queuing issues.


RECOMMENDED TIA MODIFICATIONS AND
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM APPLICANT
Trip Generation and Forecasts
    The applicant should clarify and explain what volume set was used as the base prior to
    reduction, what the reduction amount was or how it was distributed through the network
    under year 2030 conditions. The TIA states that the long-term forecasts for year 2030
    were developed based on the Twin Lakes AUAR Update Technical Memorandum - Traffic,
    Air and Noise Analysis and the Infrastructure Improvements for the Twin Lakes AUAR

    Modify directional distribution as noted in the following:
    o Under year 2030 conditions the amount of traffic distributed to Twin Lakes Parkway
      east of Prior Avenue is not in accordance with the Twin Lakes AUAR distribution for
      this parcel. The TIA states nine percent and the Twin Lakes AUAR generalized
      distribution percentages indicate upwards of 18 percent. The TIA distribution should
      be modified to be consistent.
    o Another anomaly is at the County Road C and Cleveland Avenue intersection. There
      appears to be an even distribution between the southbound right-turn (15 percent) and
      the westbound through (15 percent) movements. However, further review indicates
      these percentages should be more consistent with other movements at this intersection
      accessing the adjacent transportation network (i.e. approximately 10 percent to the
      southbound right-turn and approximately 20 percent to the westbound through
      movement). Making this change may have an impact on the westbound through queue
      at this location. The TIA distribution should be modified to be consistent.


Operations/Capacity
General Comments on Synchro/SimTraffic Models
    The applicant should include the I-35W southbound on-ramp from westbound County
    Road C in their analysis and review. Traffic volumes for this intersection can be used
    from the AUAR documentation and adjusted to fit with the year 2011 turning movement
    volumes collected.
    The applicant should show the maximum westbound queue at the County Road C and
    Cleveland Avenue intersection for each scenario to explicitly clarify any impacts to the
    proposed access along County Road C. Specifically the westbound through/right-turn
    lane queue information.
    Apply the link-OD function for the southbound right-turn movement at the County Road
    C and Cleveland intersection.

Year 2030 No Build Operations
    The applicant should run the year 2030 no build operations analysis with the identified
    improvements from the Infrastructure Improvements for the Twin Lakes AUAR Area
    Final Report prior to adding on the Walmart development traffic. This would provide a
    comparable year 2030 condition with and without the Walmart site developed.

Year 2030 Build Operations with Twin Lakes AUAR Improvements
    If the applicant intends for the northbound left-turn movement at the intersection of
    Cleveland Avenue and Twin Lakes Parkway to operate with protective-permissive left-
    turn phasing as a dual left-turn lane, approval and coordination with Ramsey County and
    MnDOT is needed. Otherwise this should be operated and modeled as a protected only
    phase.


RECOMMENDED ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
    The proposed Walmart right-in/right-out access along Twin Lakes Parkway is located
    approximately 300 feet east of Cleveland Avenue and includes a dedicated right-turn lane.
    This location reduces concern over its proximity to Cleveland Avenue and would not be
    considered a deficient design from a traffic operations perspective.
    The proposed Walmart 3/4 site access along County Road C operates acceptably and
    provides benefit to the adjacent roadway network.
    The westbound left-turn lane at the County Road C and Cleveland Avenue intersection
    should be extended to approximately 375 feet to minimize future queuing issues. This can
    be done as part of the modification along County Road C to provide the 3/4 access.
    The westbound right-turn lane at the Cleveland Avenue and County Road C intersection
    should be constructed at the time the Walmart site is initially developed. While the results
    indicate the queues do not extend back to the proposed Walmart 3/4 site access they are
    relatively significant and would be mitigated with the inclusion of the westbound right-
    turn lane.
    A northbound right-turn lane at the intersection of Cleveland Avenue and Twin Lakes
    Parkway should be constructed at the time the Walmart site is initially developed. This
    turn lane is not needed due to deficient operations, but will improve the safety and
    efficiency of this intersection.

SUBJECT:       ADDENDUM - TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS FOR WALMART (STORE #3404-05)


As requested, we have completed a supplemental traffic operations analysis in conjunction
with the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) that was completed in July 2011 by Kimley-Horn and
Associates for the proposed Walmart (Store #3404-05). The purpose of this addendum is to
review the proposed Walmart (Store #3404-05) under future conditions independent of any
other additional development that may occur adjacent to the parcel being developed. The
parcel proposed for development does include two out parcels in addition to the Walmart
Store. This current review includes the previous analysis completed by Kimley-Horn with
respect to potential queuing impacts to the I-35W mainline and year 2018 build conditions,
including the restaurant outlots. The following sections summarize the results of this analysis.


TRAFFIC OPERATIONS
The previous analysis, completed by Kimley-Horn and Associates, included an analysis of
year 2013 and year 2030 no build and build conditions. Descriptions of these scenarios and
results of the traffic operations analysis are described in the following sections and
summarized in Table 1.

It should be noted that the review included herein focuses on the intersections of Cleveland
Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W and Cleveland Avenue/County Road C. It has already
been determined that impacts to other adjacent intersections are minimal, relative to the
proposed development (impacts outlined in the Review of Traffic Impact Analysis for Walmart
(Store #3404-05) technical memorandum prepared by SRF Consulting Group, November 11,
2011). Furthermore, the key intersections are all expected to operate with acceptable level of
service grades (LOS D or better). Therefore, the 95th percentile queues are provided and
discussed to assess issues and needs.

City of Roseville                                                                         Page 2


Year 2013 Analysis
·   The Kimley-Horn traffic analysis of year 2013 conditions included a no build scenario
    that reviewed how the adjacent roadway system would operate with background traffic
    growth only (0.5 percent growth per year) and no Walmart or outlots development.
·   Kimley-Horn's analysis results of the year 2013 no build conditions show the queuing
    issues that can be expected under this condition. The 95th percentile queues were
    observed to extend beyond the turn lane storage or block access to adjacent lanes at the
    following locations:
    o Cleveland Avenue/County Road C southbound left
    o Cleveland Avenue/County Road C northbound left
    o Cleveland Avenue/County Road C eastbound left
    o Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W northbound left
    o Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W southbound left
    o Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W eastbound right *
        * The queues associated with this intersection, and specifically this approach, are
             critical due to their interaction with the I-35W mainline and collector-distributor
             roadway. The critical distance is measured back from the intersection to the
             painted ramp gore split for westbound County Road C and access to Cleveland
             Avenue. This distance is approximately 450 feet.
         The year 2013 no build condition eastbound queue was reported to be 306 feet
             (approximately 310 feet). This queue is lower than the critical queue distance.
·   Kimley-Horn's analysis results of the year 2013 build conditions, which includes only
    trips associated with the Walmart and not the two proposed outlots, indicate that the
    queuing issues reported under no build conditions will grow as additional development
    traffic is added to the system.
    o The eastbound queue at the Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W
        intersection is expected to be 507 feet (approximately 510 feet). This queue is
        greater than the critical queue distance.
         This queue will extend beyond the painted ramp gore split by approximately 60
             feet (two to three vehicles).
         Although the roadway width along the northbound I-35W off-ramp is
             approximately 24 feet in this area, freeway operations are such that vehicles should
             not be allowed or encouraged to pass one another on an off-ramp. MnDOT and
             FHWA would prefer to mitigate any queuing beyond the painted ramp gore
             split location.
         It should be noted that based on SRF's analysis of the same location, the 95th
             percentile queue is expected to be approximately 485 feet.
    o The northbound queues at the Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W
        intersection will increase as well. Although these queues already extend beyond the
        available existing storage, the proposed development will exacerbate this condition.

    o It was noted as part of the Review of Traffic Impact Analysis for Walmart (Store
      #3404-05) technical memorandum prepared by SRF Consulting Group, November 11,
      2011 that the Kimley-Horn traffic analysis did not include the I-35W southbound on-
      ramp from westbound County Road C. This ramp has a significant impact on the
      upstream traffic flow at the Cleveland Avenue/County Road C intersection as vehicles
      begin to align themselves east of Cleveland Avenue.
    o SRF conducted an independent year 2013 build condition analysis, which includes
      only trips associated with the Walmart and not the two proposed outlots. The results
      of this analysis confirmed the Kimley-Horn analysis results, with the exception of the
      westbound approach at the Cleveland Avenue/County Road C intersection. The
      queues for this approach increase significantly with the I-35W southbound on-ramp
      from westbound County Road C taken into account (see Table 1). It should also be
      noted the SRF analysis results track slightly lower than the Kimley-Horn results, yet
      are comparable (i.e., eastbound queue at Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/
      I-35W intersection of 507 feet versus 485 feet ­ similar).

Year 2018 Analysis
Based on discussions with City, MnDOT and FHWA staff, there are concerns the queuing
issue identified on the northbound I-35W off-ramp will worsen as adjacent development
occurs and area traffic volumes increase. Therefore, year 2018 analyses were completed to
determine how the area intersections can be expected to operate. All signal timing was
optimized as necessary to accommodate the additional volume from year 2013 conditions to
year 2018 conditions.
Year 2018 no build conditions
(no Walmart site development, only 0.5 percent background traffic growth)
· Results of the year 2018 no build condition analysis indicate that the eastbound queue
    at the Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W intersection is expected to be 390
    feet, which is less than the 450 foot critical queue distance.
Year 2018 build conditions (1)
(Walmart development, outlots not included, 0.5 percent background traffic growth)
· Results of the year 2018 build condition (1) analysis indicate that the eastbound queue
    at the Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W intersection is expected to be 545
    feet, which is greater than the 450 foot critical queue distance.
Year 2018 build conditions (2)
(Walmart development, outlots included, 0.5 percent background traffic growth)
· Results of the year 2018 build condition (2) analysis indicate that the eastbound queue
    at the Cleveland Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W intersection is expected to be 465
    feet, which is greater than the 450 foot critical queue distance. The modeling results
    for this scenario indicate a reduction in the eastbound queues. This appears to be model
    fluctuation and not a distinct improvement under this condition.
·   All other queues discussed to this point, besides the eastbound queue at the Cleveland
    Avenue/Twin Lakes Parkway/I-35W intersection, will increase with the additional traffic
    taken into consideration and no additional mitigation beyond signal timing improvements
    under each condition.

                Control Section 6284

Dear Mr. Paschke:

Thank you for the opportunity to review the Plat Review for the Twin Lakes 2nd Addition. Please
address the following comments before any further development:

Water Resources: The proposed development will need to maintain existing drainage rates to
existing storm structure, which ultimately drains to the MnDOT pond. The applicant will need to
submit plans as they develop and hydraulic computations for 10 and 100-yr storms at pre and post
development stages. Please submit to Hailu Shekur, MnDOT Metro District's Water Resources
Section (651-234-7521 or Hailu.Shekur@state.mn.us ).

Traffic: This Walmart will likely generate 8,000-10,000 trips per day to an area that is currently
vacant. The traffic study submitted is from the 2007 Twin Lakes Business Park AUAR. It appears
that the AUAR was based on a lower volume traffic generator than a Walmart.

Figure 12 in the AUAR shows the 2030 P.M. Peak Hour Build forecasted volumes. MnDOT is
particularly interested in the operation of the existing wood pole traffic signal at the
Cleveland/Twin Lakes/35W ramp intersection, which shows a year 2030 level of service D at this
location.

However, Figure 12 shows a lane configuration at this intersection that is not the present
condition. For instance, the diagram shows four eastbound approach lanes (exiting traffic from
northbound 35W) at the Cleveland/Twin Lakes signal, but in the present condition there are only
two EB approach lanes.

The present lane configuration could result in a LOS F when Walmart opens. If traffic backs up
onto northbound 35W from this inplace signal, that would be unacceptable to both MnDOT and
the FHWA. Metro Traffic would like to request that the Synchro files from the 2007 AUAR be
submitted for our review. Updated traffic volumes should be utilized in the submittal. Immediate
consideration should be given to adding capacity at this intersection before further Twin Lakes
Business Park developments are approved.
Review Submittal Options:
Mn/DOT's goal is to complete the review of plans within 30 days. Submittals sent in
electronically can usually be turned around faster. There are four submittal options. Please
submit either:

        1. One (1) electronic pdf. version of the plans. Mn/DOT can accept the plans via e-mail
           at metrodevreviews.dot@state.mn.us provided that each separate e-mail is under 20
           megabytes.
        2. Three (3) sets of full size plans. Although submitting seven sets of full size plans
           will expedite the review process. Plans can be sent to:

                        Mn/DOT ­ Metro District Planning Section
                        Development Reviews Coordinator

                        Roseville, MN 55113

        3. One (1) compact disc.
        4. Plans can also be submitted to Mn/DOT's External FTP Site. Please send files to:
           ftp://ftp2.dot.state.mn.us/pub/incoming/MetroWatersEdge/Planning Internet Explorer
           doesn't work using ftp so please use an FTP Client or your Windows Explorer (My
           Computer). Also, please send a note to metrodevreviews.dot@state.mn.us indicating
           that the plans have been submitted on the FTP site.

If you have any questions concerning this review please feel free to contact me at (651) 234-

 82      and the recording of the Plat and this Agreement in the office of the Ramsey County
 83      Recorder, ii) delivery by Wal-Mart and approval by the City of the plans necessary to
 84      construct the City Improvements pursuant to Article III G below, and iii) issuance of
 85      the building permit for the Wal-Mart Store and the Wal-Mart Improvements, the City
 86      shall construct the following improvements (which improvements are referred to
 87      herein as the "City Improvements"):
 88
 89          (a)    Right turn lane on County Road C into the Wal-Mart Parcel;
 90
 91          (b)    Eastbound left turn lane and median improvements into the Wal-Mart
 92                 Parcel and westbound left turn lane on County Road C to southbound
 93                 Cleveland Avenue;
 94
 95          (c)    Right turn lane on Twin Lakes Parkway into the Wal-Mart Parcel;
 96
 97          (d)    Right turn lane from westbound County Road C to northbound Cleveland;
 98                 and
 99
100          (e)    Twin Lakes Parkway Roundabout Improvements;
101
102      which City Improvements are more fully described in Exhibit D-1 attached hereto.
103
104      Wal-Mart shall be responsible for the costs of constructing the City Improvements.
105      The costs of constructing the City Improvements shall include the actual construction
106      costs, the actual engineering, administration and any legal costs related thereto, and
107      all other costs relating to the construction of the City Improvements. The
108      engineering, administration and legal costs shall include the actual outside
109      construction engineering assistance costs, the actual City staff time costs and the legal
110      costs. The City staff time costs shall be determined by multiplying the City
111      employee's hourly rate times 1.9, times the number of hours expended for all
112      employees (including administrative employees) involved in the work and all
113      communications, coordination and inspections related thereto. The costs will be
114      drawn from the Security Deposit described in Article III I below in the manner set
115      forth in Article III I below. An estimate of the costs to construct the City
116      Improvements is set forth in Exhibit D-2 attached hereto. The City shall endeavor to
117      complete the City Improvements before the construction of the Wal-Mart Store has
118      been completed, but shall not be liable or otherwise responsible to Wal-Mart or any
119      other person or entity in the event the improvements are not completed before such
120      time. The City agrees that it shall neither withhold a certificate of occupancy for the
121      Wal-Mart building nor prohibit Wal-Mart from opening its retail store to the public so
122      long as an access acceptable to the City is available to the Wal-Mart Parcel.

123
124        4. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason the City shall have no obligation to
125           construct the City Improvements.

126        5. The Wal-Mart Improvements and the City Improvements are collectively referred to
127           herein as the "Project Improvements."
128
129   E.   GRADING AND EROSION CONTROL. The following provisions apply to the
130        development of the Property and the Wal-Mart Improvements.

131        1. Site Grading and Turf Restoration.

132               (a)   Wal-Mart shall grade the Property in accordance with the City approved
133               Grading, Drainage and Erosion Control Plan.

134               (b)     Wal-Mart shall submit to the City a site grading and drainage plan for all
135               of the Property acceptable to the City showing the grades and drainage for each
136               lot prior to installation of any Wal-Mart Improvements.

137               (c)     Wal-Mart shall furnish the City Engineer satisfactory proof of payment for
138               the site grading work and shall submit a certificate of survey (as constructed
139               survey) of the Property after site grading is complete. Final lot grades shall be
140               shown on the as-constructed survey.

141               (d)    Final grading shall substantially comply with the approved grading plan.

142        2. Erosion Control. Prior to commencing any grading or utility construction, Wal-Mart
143           shall implement an erosion control plan, which plan shall be reviewed by and is
144           subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Wal-Mart shall meet all requirements of
145           Section 803.04 of the Roseville City Code regarding Erosion and Sedimentation
146           Control, including, but not limited to, the following:

147               (a)     No construction activity shall commence, no building permit shall be
148               issued, and no earth disturbing activity shall commence until the City Engineer
149               has approved an erosion and sediment control plan for the development of the
150               Property.

151               (b) Erosion control measures shall be installed in compliance with applicable
152               MPCA's NPDES permit requirements for construction activities.

153               (c)    The City may inspect the site periodically and determine whether it is
154               necessary to take additional measures to address erosion.

155               (d)    Dirt and debris on streets that results from construction work by Wal-
156               Mart, or its contractors and subcontractors, shall be removed by Wal-Mart.
157               During grading of the Property and construction of the Wal-Mart Improvements,
158               Wal-Mart shall sweep Twin Lakes Parkway, Prior Avenue and County Road C on
159               a weekly basis or more frequently as directed by the City Engineer until the

                                               4
160               Property is stabilized. Wal-Mart must sweep roadways with a water-discharge
161               broom apparatus. Kick-off brooms shall not be utilized for street sweeping. This
162               requirement shall end when an unconditional certificate of occupancy is given to
163               Wal-Mart by the City for the Wal-Mart Store.

164               (e)     If the development on the Property does not comply with the approved
165               erosion control plan or supplementary instructions given by the City, the City
166               may, after first giving Wal-Mart 48-hour prior written notice (or in the event of an
167               emergency immediately) take such action as it deems reasonably appropriate to
168               control erosion, the cost of which action shall be paid by Wal-Mart to the City
169               upon demand. If City employees are used the cost for the action taken shall be
170               determined by multiplying the employee's hourly rate times 1.9, times the number
171               of hours expended for all employees (including administrative employees)
172               involved in such action and all communications coordination, inspections and
173               reinspections related thereto. For all others the cost shall be the actual cost
174               charged for the action taken plus 25% for administrative fees. This requirement
175               shall end when an unconditional certificate of occupancy is given to Wal-Mart by
176               the City for the Wal-Mart Store.

177   F.   COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. The Property shall be developed in
178        compliance with all applicable City, County, Metropolitan Council, State and Federal
179        laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, subdivision ordinances,
180        zoning ordinances and environmental regulations. Wal-Mart represents to the City that to
181        the best of its knowledge the Plat complies with all City, County, Metropolitan, State and
182        Federal laws and regulations including, but not limited to: subdivision ordinances, zoning
183        ordinances and environmental regulations.

204
205               and such other plans and specifications as are reasonably required by the City.
206
207        The foregoing plans and specifications shall be prepared by a competent registered
208        professional engineer engaged by Wal-Mart and shall be subject to the City's review and
209        approval. The Wal-Mart Improvements shall be installed in accordance with the City
210        approved plans for such improvements and the policies, rules, regulations, standards and
211        ordinances of the City. No work shall commence on the Project or the Wal-Mart
212        Improvements until Wal-Mart obtains a building permit for the Project and the Wal-Mart
213        Improvements and pays all costs and fees required in connection with the procurement of
214        the building permit.
215
216        The following shall apply to the Wal-Mart Improvements and City Improvements:
217
218        1. Wal-Mart shall obtain all necessary and required permits for the Project, the Wal-
219           Mart Improvements and the City Improvements from the Minnesota Pollution Control
220           Agency (MPCA), Minnesota Department of Health (MDOH), and all other agencies
221           and governmental authorities with jurisdiction over the Project, the Wal-Mart
222           Improvements and the City Improvements before proceeding with construction of the
223           Project and the Wal-Mart Improvements. Copies of these permits shall be provided
224           to the City Engineer.

225        2. Wal-Mart or its engineer shall schedule a pre-construction meeting for the Wal-Mart
226           Improvements with all the parties concerned, including City staff, to review the
227           program for the construction work.

228   H.   35W INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS. Wal-Mart shall pay to the City the
229        amount of $400,000.00 ("35W Improvement Amount") upon or prior to the release by
230        the City of the Plat for recording for the future construction of the 35W Intersection and
231        Ramp Modifications shown in Exhibit E attached hereto ("35W Improvements"). The
232        35W Improvement Amount has been agreed to as a negotiated settlement amount of the
233        Wal-Mart Parcel's proportionate share of the costs attributable to the proposed
234        development on the Wal-Mart Parcel necessary for the City to construct the 35W
235        Improvements. The parties agree that no further payment by the owners of the Wal-Mart
236        Parcel and no refund by the City of the 35W Improvement Amount, in whole or in part,
237        shall be required resulting from the development of the Wal-Mart Parcel described in
238        Exhibit F attached hereto, irrespective of the actual costs to construct the 35W
239        Improvements, the proportionate share of such cost attributable to the Wal-Mart Parcel,
240        or other reasons. The owners of the Wal-Mart Parcel shall, upon payment of the 35W
241        Improvement Amount, be released from the payment of any assessments levied under
242        Minnesota Statutes Chapter 429 for all costs related to the construction of the 35W
243        Improvements. The provisions of this Article III H shall apply only to the 35W
244        Improvements specifically shown in Exhibit ____ and not to any other 35W or other
245        public improvements that may be constructed in the future.



                                               6
246   I.   SECURITY. To guarantee compliance with the terms of this Agreement and payment of
247        the costs of the City Improvements, Wal-Mart shall furnish security to the City in the
248        form of a cash deposit ("Security Deposit") in the amount of $__________________.
249        The amount of the Security Deposit is calculated as set forth in the attached Exhibit G.
250        The Security Deposit shall be delivered to the City by Wal-Mart upon or before release
251        by the City of the Plat for recording. The Security Deposit shall be held and used as
252        follows:

253        1. The City shall have the right to draw on the Security Deposit to pay for the costs of
254           the City Improvements and to remedy any default by Wal-Mart under this
255           Agreement, as such costs are incurred.

256        2. In the event the amount of the Security Deposit exceeds the actual costs of the City
257           Improvements, any excess shall be refunded to Wal-Mart, without interest, within
258           thirty (30) days after the City Improvements have been completed and accepted by
259           the governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the City Improvements. In the
260           event that the Security Deposit is less than 125% of the costs necessary to complete
261           the unfinished City Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City, at any time
262           before the City Improvements have been completed, the City shall notify Wal-Mart of
263           such deficiency. Wal-Mart shall within thirty (30) days of such notice furnish to the
264           City the amount necessary to increase the Security Deposit to 125% of the costs
265           necessary to complete the City Improvements, which amount shall become part of the
266           Security Deposit to be used as specified herein.

267        3. No interest shall accrue, or be payable by the City, on the Security Deposit.
268
269        4. The City shall provide Wal-Mart a monthly accounting of the balance remaining and
270           amounts drawn from the Security Deposit.
271
272   J.   OWNERSHIP OF IMPROVEMENTS AND RISK OF LOSS. All Wal-Mart
273        Improvements on public land or lying within public rights-of-way and public easements
274        shall become City property without further notice or action upon completion and City
275        acceptance thereof, except for the streetscape items (i.e. benches, trash cans, retaining
276        wall, etc.) at the corner of Twin Lakes Parkway and Prior Avenue and County Road C
277        and Prior Avenue and the landscaping (i.e. trees, shrubs, perennials and associated plots
278        and beds), which streetscape and landscaping improvements shall be maintained by the
279        fee simple owner(s) of the Property and shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the
280        City, Ramsey County and State of Minnesota pertaining to the use of public right-of-
281        ways and easements. All of the City Improvements shall be owned by the City during
282        and after completion of construction.

283   K.   UTILITY COMPANY IMPROVEMENTS. Wal-Mart shall install or cause to be
284        installed and pay for all utility improvements necessary to serve the Property, including
285        gas, electric, and telephone service, which shall be installed by the appropriate utility
286        company at the direction of Wal-Mart. All utilities shall be installed underground. Wal-
287        Mart shall arrange for the installation of underground gas, electric, telephone and cable
288        television before the final lift of payment is started on the City Improvements.

289   L.   PARK DEDICATION FEE. The park dedication fee for this Plat shall be $411,115.00
290        and shall be paid by Wal-Mart to the City of Roseville upon or prior to the release by the
291        City of the Plat for recording. Payment of this fee fulfills the park dedication requirement
292        for the entire Property.

293   M.   LICENSE. Wal-Mart hereby grants the City, and its agents, employees, officers and
294        contractors, a license to enter the Property to perform all work and inspections deemed
295        appropriate by the City. The license shall expire upon the acceptance by the City of the
296        Project Improvements. The City shall thereafter have the right to enter the Property to
297        perform inspections as authorized by City Ordinances.

320           the City may complete or contract to complete the site maintenance work at Wal-
321           Mart's expense.

356        the acts of Wal-Mart, and its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors, in
357        relationship thereto. The fee simple owners of Lots 2 and 3 shall be responsible for the
358        subsequent development costs on said Lots 2 and 3 once all of the Project Improvements
359        and grading work have been completed and accepted by the governmental entities having
360        jurisdiction over said improvements and grading work and an unconditional certificate of
361        occupancy has been issued for the Wal-Mart Store.

362        1. Wal-Mart shall defend, indemnify, and hold the City and its mayor, council members
363           and employees harmless from claims made by itself and third parties for damages
364           sustained or costs incurred resulting from Plat approval, this Agreement, construction
365           of the Project Improvements (except for the negligence or intentional misconduct of
366           the City with respect to the construction of the City Improvements), and/or the
367           development of the Property referenced in this Agreement. Wal-Mart shall defend,
368           indemnify, and hold the City and its mayor, council members and employees
369           harmless for all costs, damages or expenses which the City may pay or incur in
370           consequence of such claims, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

371        2. Wal-Mart shall pay, or cause to be paid when due, and in any event before any
372           penalty is attached, all charges, costs, fees and other amounts referred to in this

                                               9
373           Agreement. The foregoing shall be a personal obligation of Wal-Mart and shall
374           continue in full force and effect even if Wal-Mart sells one or more lots, all of the
375           Property, or any part of it.

376        3. Wal-Mart shall pay in full all bills submitted to it by the City for obligations incurred
377           under this Agreement not otherwise paid for by a draw on the Security Deposit within
378           thirty (30) days after receipt. If the bills are not paid on time, the City may, in
379           addition to all other rights and remedies the City may have, halt construction of the
380           Project Improvements, the Project and plat development work including, but not
381           limited to, the issuance of building permits for lots which Wal-Mart may or may not
382           have sold, until the bills are paid in full. Bills not paid within thirty (30) days shall
383           accrue interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum or the maximum amount
384           allowed by law, whichever is less.

385        4. Wal-Mart shall reimburse the City for all costs incurred in the enforcement of this
386           Agreement against Wal-Mart, including all reasonable attorney and engineering fees,
387           which are incurred after the date of this Agreement.

388        5. In addition to the charges referred to herein, other charges may be imposed such as,
389           but not limited to, sewer availability charges ("SAC"), City water connection charges,
390           City sewer connection charges, City storm water connection charges, building permit
391           fees and plat review fees, which shall be paid by Wal-Mart. A list of other items for
392           which charges may be imposed is set forth in Exhibit H attached hereto. The list is
393           intended to notify Wal-Mart of the additional items for which costs may be imposed.
394           However, the City does not represent or guarantee that all other items for which
395           charges may be imposed are contained in Exhibit H.

396   Q.   DEFAULT AND REMEDIES.

397        1. Wal-Mart Default. Upon the occurrence of a default by Wal-Mart of any of its
398           obligations under this Agreement, the City, in addition to any other remedy which
399           may be available to it, shall be permitted to do the following after first providing Wal-
400           Mart with not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice and the opportunity to
401           cure such default within said 30 day period:

402               (a).    The City may make advances or take other steps to cure the default, and
403               where necessary, enter the Property for that purpose. Wal-Mart shall pay all sums
404               so advanced or expenses incurred by the City upon written demand, with interest
405               commencing thereon thirty (30) days after delivery of such written demand at the
406               rate of six percent (6%) per annum or the maximum amount allowed by law,
407               whichever is less. No action taken by the City pursuant to this section shall be
408               deemed to relieve Wal-Mart from curing any such default to the extent that it is
409               not cured by the City or from any other default hereunder. The City shall not be
410               obligated, by virtue of the existence or the exercise of this right, to perform any
411               such act or cure any such default.



                                                10
412               (b).    Obtain an order from a court of competent jurisdiction requiring Wal-Mart
413               to perform its obligations pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

414               (c).   Obtain an order from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the
415               continuation of an event of default.

416               (d).    Halt all development work and construction of improvements until such
417               time as the event of default is cured.

418               (e).   Withhold the issuance of a building permit or permits and/or prohibit the
419               occupancy of any structure(s) for which permits have been issued until the event
420               of default has been cured.

421               (f).    Draw upon and utilize Wal-Mart's Security Deposit to cover the City's
422               costs to correct the default, the costs to complete any unfinished Project
423               Improvements and/or the costs to enforce this Agreement. This Agreement is a
424               license for the City to act, and it shall not be necessary for the City to seek a court
425               order for permission to enter the Property.

426               (g).    Exercise any other remedies which may be available to it at law or in
427               equity.

428               In addition to the remedies and amounts payable set forth or permitted above,
429               upon the occurrence of an event of default by Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart shall pay to
430               the City all fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the City as a
431               result of the event of default, whether or not a lawsuit or other action is formally
432               taken.

433        2. City Default. Upon the occurrence of a default by the City of any of its obligations
434           under this Agreement, Wal-Mart may exercise any remedy which may be available to
435           it, after first providing the City with not less than thirty (30) days prior notice and the
436           opportunity to cure such default within said 30 day period; provided, however, if the
437           nature of City obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for
438           performance then the City shall not be in default if the City commences performance
439           within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to
440           completion. The foregoing shall not be construed as a waiver on the part of the City
441           of any of the immunities, limitations and/or defenses available to the City and its
442           mayor, council members, employees, agents and contractors under federal, state and
443           local laws and ordinances.

444   R.   ASSIGNMENT. Wal-Mart may not assign this Contract without the written permission
445        of the Roseville City Council.

446   S.   TERMINATION; CONDITIONS PRECEDENT.

455               (b)     The obligations of Wal-Mart under Article III P shall survive such
456               termination and continue with respect to unpaid costs, fees and expenses incurred
457               prior to such termination;

458               (c)    The indemnifications of Wal-Mart under Article III P shall survive and

461               this Agreement not specified above.

462        2. The City shall have no obligation to construct the City Improvements and Wal-Mart
463           shall have no obligation to construct the Wal-Mart Improvements or construct a Wal-
464           Mart Store on the Property unless Wal-Mart acquires fee simple title to the Property
465           and records this Agreement and the Plat in the office of the Ramsey County Recorder
466           as required in Article III W 6 below within one (1) year after approval of the final plat
467           by the Roseville City Council.

468        3. No building permits shall be issued, no work shall be performed on the Property and
469           the construction of the Project Improvements shall not be commenced, unless and

471           Development Agreement have been duly recorded with the Ramsey County Recorder
472           and that it has acquired fee simple title to the Property.

473        4. In the event of the termination of this Agreement, the parties agree, if requested by

509   V.   REMOVAL OF EXISTING STRUCTURES AND UTILITY SERVICES. Wal-Mart
510        shall, at Wal-Mart's cost, demolish the Toll Gas Building currently located on the
511        Property, remove all resulting demolition debris from the Property, and shall disconnect
512        and cap all known and unused utilities at the main serving the Toll Gas Building, on or
513        before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the Wal-Mart Store. Any hole or
514        other depression resulting from the removal of the building shall be filled in, compacted
515        and graded to elevations shown on the City approved grading plan for the Property, and
516        the area restored as described in the Grading, Drainage Erosion Control Plan. In addition
517        to the foregoing, Wal-Mart shall disconnect and cap at the main all known and unused
518        utility services serving the Property, on or before the issuance of a certificate of
519        occupancy for the Wal-mart Store. The demolition of the Toll Gas building, removal of
520        debris and disconnecting, capping and removal of unused utility services shall be done in
521        conformity with City ordinances and all other laws and regulations pertaining thereto.

522   W.   MISCELLANEOUS.

523        1. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties, their successors or assigns, as the
524           case may be.

525        2. If any portion, section, subsection, sentence, clause, paragraph or phrase of this
526           Agreement is for any reason held invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
527           the remaining portion of this Agreement.

528        3. The action or inaction of the City shall not constitute a waiver or amendment to the
529           provisions of this Agreement. To be binding, amendments or waivers must be in
530           writing, signed by the parties and approved by the Roseville City Council. The City's

                                               13
531      failure to promptly take legal action to enforce a default under this Agreement shall
532      not be a waiver or release of such default.

533   4. This Agreement shall run with the land and shall be binding upon Wal-Mart and its
534      successors and assigns. Wal-Mart shall, at its expense, record this Agreement
535      immediately before the recording of the Plat with the Ramsey County Recorder if the
536      Property is abstract property and/or with the Ramsey County Registrar of Titles if the
537      Property is Torrens property.

538   5. Wal-Mart will comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and with any
539      and all City, County, State, Federal, and other laws, regulations and ordinances
540      including, but not limited to: subdivision ordinances, zoning ordinances and
541      environmental regulations, that may apply to the Plat and the development of the
542      Property.

543   6. Wal-Mart shall be responsible for recording the Plat, and the cost thereof, following
544      the approval of the Plat by the Roseville City Council. Wal-Mart shall, prior to the
545      time this Agreement and the Plat are recorded, furnish the City with a title insurance
546      commitment and make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the City that
547      immediately following the time that the Plat and this Agreement are recorded and
548      Wal-Mart has completed the acquisition of the Property, Wal-Mart will be the sole
549      fee simple owner of the Property and that there are no other parties having an interest
550      in, or a lien or encumbrance against the Property. Arrangements for recording this
551      Agreement and the Plat shall be made by Wal-Mart and the City to assure that title to
552      the Property immediately following the recording of the Plat will be as set forth
553      herein. The parties agree to coordinate the release and recording of the Plat and this
554      Agreement and the acquisition by Wal-Mart of all of the Property including the
555      Excess Parcel by means of a closing in escrow. The City shall not be obligated to
556      release the Plat for recording until such arrangements have been made.

557   7. At the time the Plat is recorded, the City agrees to sell to Wal-Mart, pursuant to the
558      terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit I-1, that parcel of land described on the
559      attached Exhibit I-2 and depicted on the attached Exhibit I-3 (the "Excess Parcel").
560      Wal-Mart, upon or prior to recording the Plat, shall pay the City $69,645.00 as
561      consideration for the Excess Parcel in exchange for an executed quit claim deed for
562      same, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit I-1.

563   8. Changes in Official Controls. For two (2) years after the date of the approval of the
564      Plat, no amendments to the City's Comprehensive Plan or official controls shall apply
565      to or affect the use, development density, lot size, lot layout or dedications required or
566      permitted by the approved Plat, unless expressly required by state or federal law or
567      agreed to in writing by the City and Wal-Mart.

Plan Review Fee:
When a building permit is required and a plan is required to be submitted, a plan checking fee
shall be paid. Plan checking fees for all buildings, except for construction costs in R-1 and R-2
zones which do not involve new single family structures and are of less than seven thousand
dollars ($7,000.00), shall be sixty five percent (65%) of the building permit fee as set forth in
Section 901.06 of this chapter, except as modified in M.S.B.C. Section 1300. (Ord. 1110, 4-13-
1992)

The plan review fees specified are separate fees from the permit fees and are in addition to the
permit fees.

When submittal documents are incomplete or changed so as to require additional plan review or
when the project involves deferred submittal items an additional plan review fee shall be charged.

Expiration of plan review. Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following
the date of application shall expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review
may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official. The building
official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days on
request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have
prevented action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than once. In order to
renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new
plan review fee.

Refund Fee:
The building official may authorize refunding of any fee paid hereunder which was erroneously
paid or collected.

The building official may authorize a refunding of permit fees paid when no work has been done
under a permit issued in accordance with this code.

The building official may authorize a refunding of plan review fees paid when an application for a
permit for which a plan review fee has paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is
done.

The building official shall not authorize refunding of any fee paid except on written application
filed by the original permittee not later than 180 days after the date of fee payment.

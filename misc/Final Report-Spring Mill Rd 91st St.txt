                                                                  Intersection Improvement Project


1. PROJECT LOCATION

   The project is located at the intersection of 91st Street and Spring Mill Road, north of the City
   of Indianapolis, Washington Township, Marion County, Indiana. Refer to Appendix "A" for
   maps that provide additional details on the location of the project.

2. PROJECT NEED AND PURPOSE

   The root needs for this project are to improve the substandard capacity and safety of the
   intersection. Due to regional growth, traffic volumes have increased in recent years. The
   configuration of the existing intersection and approaches were not designed to efficiently and
   safely service the traffic volumes occurring today. Further increases in delays and crashes
   may occur due to future growth.

3. EXISTING FACILITY

   The existing intersection of 91st Street and Spring Mill Road is an all-way stop controlled
   intersection with one approach lane in each direction. 91st Street, which runs east-west, is
   classified as an urban collector in the Functional classification Map as prepared by Office of
   Inventory and Tracking, Indiana Department of Transportation. The posted speed limit on
   91st Street is 35 mph in the vicinity of the study intersection. 91st Street is a two-lane facility
   providing one lane in each direction, approximately 9.5 foot wide each with a 1-foot
   aggregate shoulder. Spring Mill Road is also classified as an urban collector and has a
   posted speed limit of 35 mph. Spring Mill Road is a two-lane facility providing one lane in
   each direction, approximately 9 foot wide each with a 1-foot aggregate shoulder.

   The horizontal alignment of both roadways is tangent at the intersection. The vertical
   alignment of each approach is relatively flat on all legs of the intersection.

   The existing drainage within the project limits is by sheet flow and open V-ditches are
   located on both Spring Mill Road and 91st Street. An enclosed 18" storm pipe line is also
   located in the north-east corner of the intersection. This storm line flows from east and turns
   north along the apparent Right of Way (R/W) line east of Spring Mill Road. Beehive ground
   inlets are located on this storm line in the north-east quadrant of the intersection.


   The existing pavement on both roadways is Asphalt. Pavement failure and cracks were
   observed on all approaches of the intersection.

   Land uses in the vicinity of the intersection are primarily single family residential uses. For
   ground level photographs of the roadway approaches to the intersection, see Appendix B.

                                                              Intersection Improvement Project


4. TRAFFIC DATA

   Peak hour turning movement counts for this intersection were collected by DLZ Indiana,
   LLC as a part of a traffic signal warrant study dated January 2011, conducted for the City of
   Indianapolis Department of Public Works (DPW). The counts were collected on Thursday
   December 9th, 2010 under typical weekday traffic conditions. According to the information
   provided in the said study, the AM peak hour occurs from 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM and the PM
   peak hour occurs from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Traffic signal Warrant analysis and the Traffic
   Counts are included in Appendix C.

   To perform the capacity analysis for the design year (2031), existing traffic counts obtained
   from the afore mentioned traffic signal warrant study were linearly projected using an annual
   growth rate of 1.6%. This growth rate was derived from the Historic Traffic data obtained
   from the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO).

5. CRASH ANALYSIS

   The DPW provided the most recent three years (2008 ­ 2010) of crash data for the
   intersection of 91st Street and Spring Mill Road. The data is summarized in Table 5-1 below.

                 Table 5-1. Crashes at 91st Street and Spring Mill Road

   As shown in Table 5-1, right angle (33%) crashes are the most common crash type at the
   intersection of 91st Street and Spring Mill Road. The predominant cause of the right-angle
   crashes is likely failure to yield in the intersection.

6. CAPACITY ANALYSIS

   Intersection capacity analyses have been performed for the AM and PM peak hours under the
   Existing 2011 conditions and also for the No Build and Build 2031 (Design Year) traffic
   conditions. The analyses were based on the methodology described in the Highway Capacity

                                               2

   Manual (HCM, 2000). Synchro (Version 7) was used to evaluate the existing, No Build and
   Build scenarios. The measure of effectiveness to evaluate traffic operations at an
   intersections is the Level of Service (LOS). Various delay times correspond to a letter
   designation "A" to "F" ("A being the best and "F" being the worst). The minimum LOS
   typically accepted for a traffic movement for design purposes is LOS "D". Existing peak
   hour factors and truck percentages were also used in the analysis.

   Existing and No Build Scenarios:

   Table 6-1 below provides a summary of the Existing scenario and 2031 No Build scenario
   levels of service.

   As shown in Table 6-1, during the existing AM peak hour all approaches except the
   westbound approach are operating at a failing LOS, with the intersection operating at an
   overall LOS F. During the existing PM peak hour, all approaches are operating at LOS E or
   F, with the intersection also operating at an overall LOS F. It appears that the existing
   intersection control and lane configurations do not allow sufficient capacity, resulting in
   excessive control and queue delay during peak hours.

   The traffic operations are expected to significantly degrade by 2031 (Design Year) without
   implementing any intersection improvements. The intersection is expected to operate at an
   overall LOS F for all approaches experiencing excessive delays during both peak hours.

   Build Scenario:

   Due to the deteriorating LOS under No Build traffic conditions, as noted above, capacity
   analyses were further performed for two Build alternates: a signalized intersection evaluated
   with Synchro and a roundabout evaluated with Rodel. Table 6-2 shows the results of these
   capacity analyses. Additionally, Table 6-3 shows a comparison of anticipated queue lengths
   for the two Build alternates.

   future No Build 2031, No Build does not address the root problem as stated in Section 2 of
   this report and will not receive further consideration.

   The following two alternates were considered for improvements at the intersection:




                                                                   4

   Alternate 1 (Roundabout Alternate): This alternate involves reconstructing the intersection
   and approaches to provide a single-lane roundabout. As shown in Table 6-2, the roundabout
   is expected to provide LOS A for all approaches during the AM and PM peak hours under
   2031 traffic conditions. As shown in Table 6-3, the longest vehicular queue length
   associated with this alternate is expected to be two vehicles.

   Alternate 2 (Signal Alternate): This alternate involves installation of a new traffic signal at
   this intersection and addition of left-turn lanes on all approaches. As shown in Table 6-2,
   this alternate would provide acceptable LOS for all movements during the AM and PM peak
   hours under the year 2031 traffic conditions. All movements are expected to operate at LOS
   C or better during both peak hours. As shown in Table 6-3, the longest queues are expected
   to occur on the southbound through/right-turn lane group, where the 95th percentile queue
   length is expected to be 9 vehicles long in the AM peak hour and 10 vehicles long in the PM
   peak hour.

7. DETAILS OF BUILD ALTERNATES

   Alternate # 1 (Roundabout Alternate):

   This alternate proposes a complete reconstruction of the existing intersection and roadway
   approaches to install a single-lane roundabout. The proposed roundabout will have 19 foot
   wide entries with a 19 foot wide circulatory roadway and a 100 foot inscribed circle
   diameter. Curbing would be required in order to control the speeds of approaching vehicles
   and to efficiently remove storm water from the project area. For the purposes of the cost
   estimate, a storm sewer system was assumed to be needed to carry the storm water to north of
   the intersection.

   Overall, the roundabout should meet the design criteria established in NCHRP 672,
   commonly referred to as the Federal Highway (FHWA) Roundabout Guide. The roundabout
   would have a design speed of 27 mph (maximum entry speed) and the difference between
   circulatory and entering speeds would be no greater than 12 mph. All entering R1 fast path
   measurements should meet requirements set forth in NCHRP 672 and a WB-50 design
   vehicle accommodated for all turning movements. The roundabout is expected to satisfy the
   project's purposes and needs by reducing overall intersection delays, crash frequency and
   severity, compared to the existing conditions or the signalized intersection alternate.

   A conceptual roundabout layout has been prepared for the intersection of 91st Street and
   Spring Mill Road and is included in Appendix E.

   Preliminary opinion of the probable costs for this alternate is $ 1,322,856.00. Detailed cost
   breakdown is given in Section 17 of this report.

   Alternate # 2 (Signalized Intersection Alternate):

   As noted in section 4 of this report, a traffic signal warrant study was conducted by DLZ
   Indiana, LLC for this intersection. As per this study traffic warrants 2 and 3 were met under
   the existing conditions. The signalized intersection option was considered for evaluation on
   the basis of this study. This option would require reconstruction of all the approaches, the
   addition of a left-turn lane on all approaches, and the installation of a traffic signal.

   The signalized intersection alternate satisfies the project's needs and purposes as it is
   expected to increase the overall traffic capacity at the intersection and may reduce the
   frequency and severity of crashes. However, the eastbound and westbound approaches are
   expected to experience long queues as noted in section 6 of this report.

   As a part of this study, a conceptual signalized intersection layout was developed and is
   included in Appendix F.

   Following improvements are recommended under this alternate:

          ·   Increase the through travel lane width to 11' and provide left turn lanes on all the
              approaches.
          ·   Provide adequate storage and transition lengths for each left turn lane based on
              turning volumes and right-of-way impacts.
          ·   Install a Traffic Signal at the intersection and optimize traffic signal timing and
              phasing.
          ·   Provide appropriate turning radii to accommodate the WB-50 design vehicle.
          ·   Improve the existing 1' gravel shoulder to 4' paved shoulder on both streets.


   Preliminary opinion of the probable costs for this alternate is $ 1,534,351.00. Detailed cost
   estimate breakdown is given in Section 17 of this report.

9. PAVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:

   Full depth pavement is proposed for the construction of the Recommended alternate. As per
   INDOT Design Standards, the recommended pavement thickness will be in the range of 12"
   to 15". A pavement thickness of 13" was assumed for estimating purposes.

   The final pavement type and thickness will be determined during the design stage in
   consultation with INDOT and Indianapolis DPW. A Geotechnical evaluation will be required
   for this project before the pavement design can be conducted.

10. PAVEMENT MARKING AND SIGNING

   All pavement markings and roadway signage shall be in accordance with the current Manual
   on uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and the current Indiana Design Manual.

11. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

   A Preliminary evaluation of environmental impacts and a "red flag" survey has been
   conducted. The survey is provided in Appendix G.

12. PERMITS

   Any work within a jurisdictional wetland will require a section 401/404 Water Quality
   Permit from US Army Corps of Engineers and the Indiana Department of Environmental
   Management. A Rule 5 permit will be required if one acre or more of land disturbing
   activities are required. All permitting requirements should be investigated during detailed
   design of the project.

13. SURVEY REQUIREMENTS

   Topographic survey should extend a minimum of 600' along all the approaches. Total length
   of the topographic survey will be approximately 2400'. The survey should extend a
   minimum of 25' beyond the proposed R/W on all the approaches and should be enough to
   encompass building corners, finish floor elevations and other information needed for the
   completion of the design.

14. UTILITIES

   DLZ conducted a site visit of the project site on May 19, 2011. The utilities that appear to be
   within the project limits may include underground telephone, water main, gas main, overhead
   electric, cable, sanitary, telephone and pipe culverts. A enclosed 18" storm system is also
   located in North-east quadrant of the intersection. Utility relocation may be needed at
   several locations.

   As per the information received from the Utility Companies thus far, there are no known
   utility easements within the project area. The designer shall coordinate with all local utilities
   companies for utility verification, easements and any potential conflicts with proposed
   construction.

   Early utility coordination letters were sent on April 27, 2011 (via email) to the following
   utility companies:

     AT&T

   All the responses received thus far from the utility companies have been included in
   Appendix H, early Utility coordination.

15. MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC

   To minimize the construction time and costs associated with construction phasing it is
   recommended that the intersection be closed for the duration of the construction. Appropriate
   detour signing should be provided for both 91st Street and Spring Mill Road for the road
   closures. However access should be maintained to all local residences throughout
   construction.

16. RIGHT-OF-WAY:

   As obtained from the City's IMAGIS data drawings, the existing R/W is 70' along eastern
   and southern approach and 90' along' along western and northern approach. The existing
   R/W limits shown in this report are approximate and will need to be verified and determined
   during the design process.

   Below is the summary of the anticipated new R/W needed for each Alternate.

18. RECOMMENDATONS

   Both of the aforementioned intersection alternates satisfy the needs of the project, which are
   to improve the substandard capacity and safety.

   Both alternates are expected to improve the LOS for this intersection and will increase safety
   of the intersection. As stated in section 6, roundabout alternate is expected to provide an
   overall intersection LOS A while signalized intersection alternate is expected to provide LOS

   C or better. The roundabout alternate may have queues of two vehicles or less for all legs,
   while as explained in section 7 of this report, signal alternate is expected to have queues of 9
   vehicles per lane in the south bound through/right turn lane.

   As explained in Section 16, Roundabout alternate at this intersection is expected to cost
   approximately $211,495 less than the signal alternate and is expected to provide better
   overall traffic operations and safety. A roundabout may be more feasible option at this
   location.

   Therefore, based upon gathered data, field visits and the information compiled in this report,
   it is recommended that the roundabout alternate be constructed at this location.

configurations and traffic control devices were determined from field visits and existing speed limits
were identified from Google's Street View.

2. Capacity Analysis

Highway Capacity Software (HCS) 2000 was used to perform the intersection capacity analysis.
Parameters such as traffic control type, lane configurations, traffic volumes, truck percentages, and
peak hour factors were entered as input for the software. A summary of the intersection Levels of
Service (LOS) and average seconds of delay per vehicle by approach as predicted by HCS is
presented in Table 1 below. Approaches with LOS E or F are highlighted in red. HCS capacity
analyses worksheets for the AM and PM peak hours for each intersection are presented in Exhibit 2
­ Capacity Analysis Reports.

3. Signal Warrant Analysis

Signal warrant analysis was conducted using the procedures outlined in the 2009 version of the
Federal Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and utilizing the traffic volumes
stated earlier in Section 1. Warrant Analyses were conducted for the study intersections for
following three volume warrants only:

·    Warrant 1 (Eight-Hour Volume Warrant)
·    Warrant 2 (Four-Hour Volume Warrant)
·    Warrant 3 (Peak Hour Volume Warrant)
                                                                                          Mr. Nathan Sheets
                                                                                         City of Indianapolis
                                                                        Capacity and Signal Warrant Analysis
                                                                                            January 17, 2011
                                                                                                      Page 3



  Warrant 1 requires that entering traffic volumes at the major and minor roadway approaches meet or
  exceed certain traffic volume thresholds for any eight hours of the day. Warrant 2 requires that
  entering traffic volumes at the major and minor roadway approaches meet or exceed certain traffic
  volume thresholds displayed on a chart for any four hours of the day. Warrant 3 has two conditions.
  First for thresholds of entering traffic volumes displayed on a chart and the second for a combination
  of total vehicular delay and entering traffic volumes, either of which can meet the warrant if the
  required conditions exist for any four consecutive 15-minute periods. Furthermore, the right turn
  reduction factors for the minor road approaches were applied in the signal warrant analyses. These
  volume reduction factors were determined using the research presented in the article titled "Traffic
  Signal Warrants: Two Agencies' Preference", as presented in the ITE Journal, January 2001. This
  ITE publication is attached as Exhibit 3 for reference.

  See Exhibit 4 for the spreadsheets and charts used in the signal warrant analysis for each
  intersection. A summary of the results of the signal warrant analysis for all intersections is shown in
  Table 2.

  4. Conclusions and Recommendations

  Based on the Section 3 above, none of the studied intersections met Warrant 1 ­ Eight Hour Volume
  Warrant. Furthermore, none of the studied traffic volume warrants were met for the following
  intersections:

  ·   Shadeland Avenue & 43rd / 42nd Streets
  ·   10th Street & Lansdowne Road
  ·   Post Road & Prospect Street
                                                                                          Mr. Nathan Sheets
                                                                                         City of Indianapolis
                                                                        Capacity and Signal Warrant Analysis
                                                                                            January 17, 2011
                                                                                                      Page 4



·   German Church Road & Prospect Street
·   Bluff Road & Thompson Road
·   Franklin Road & Raymond Street

Warrant 2, Warrant 3 or both warrants were met for the following intersections:

·   62nd Street & Cooper Road
·   Township Line Road & Dugan Drive
·   Oaklandon Road & 75th Street
·   Bradbury Avenue & Sam Jones Expressway Ramps
·   Spring Mill Road & 91st Street
·   Thompson Road & 5 Points Road
·   Meridian School Road & Rahke Road
·   Thompson Road & Sherman Drive


It should be noted that the intersections of Township Line Road & Dugan Drive and Bradbury
Avenue & Sam Jones Expressway Ramps were found to be very close to meeting the traffic
volume requirements for Warrants 1 and 2.

The intersection of Meridian School Road & Rahke Road meets the peak hour warrants only but
does not meet the four or eight hour warrants. Traffic is highly peaked given the intersection's close
proximity to two schools and off peak traffic is relatively lighter. During the AM peak hour all
approaches operate at LOS F with long delays. The southbound approach fails during the PM peak
hour. Additional investigations should be conducted to determine if signalization is appropriate.
Other warrants such as the Pedestrian Volumes, School Crossings, and Crash Experience should be
considered. Adding auxiliary turn lanes to the intersection such as northbound and southbound right-
turn lanes or an eastbound left-turn lane may also improve peak hour delay. Furthermore, an actuated
traffic signal with only peak hour operation may also be considered at this location. Alternately, a
roundabout traffic control may also improve delays at this location, if deemed feasible.

In addition, the north and south legs at the Thompson Road & 5 Points Road intersection are
skewed. If the intersection is considered for traffic signal installation, the intersection should be
realigned for potential safety reasons.

Most of the study intersections are all-way stop controlled with single lane approaches. The peak
hour capacity analysis indicates that nearly all of these intersections operate at failing levels of
service during one or both peak hours. Auxiliary turn lanes should be considered at these locations
to improve traffic operations and prior to considering the installation of a traffic signal. In addition,
other warrants (such as the crash warrant), were not analyzed as part of this study but should be
considered before making a decision on a potential traffic signal installation at any of the study
intersection.

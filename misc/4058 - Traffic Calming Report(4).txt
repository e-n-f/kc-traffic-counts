1.0      INTRODUCTION

      1.1 Overview

         BETA Group, Inc, (BETA) in coordination with the Town of Westwood (Town), has developed a
         proposed Traffic Calming and Safety Improvement Plan (TCSIP)for the High Rock Street, Dover
         Road, Conant Road, Country Lane, Sunset Road and Lorraine Road neighborhoods. This plan is the
         product of a comprehensive traffic calming process undertaken in response to neighborhood safety
         and traffic operational concerns stemming from the presence of a significant vehicular cut-through
         route along these local residential roadways.

         By definition, traffic calming involves changes in street alignment, installation of barriers, and
         other physical measures to reduce traffic speeds and/or cut-through volumes, in the interest of street
         safety, livability, and other public purposes.1 Traffic calming when applied in an appropriate and
         justified manner has proven to be an effective means to reduce vehicle speeds, volumes and improve
         safety.

         In addition to describing the proposed TCSIP, this report documents the process which has led to its
         development, including an existing conditions assessment, an engineering feasibility analysis and
         the consensus building effort as well as providing a summary of future milestones which will likely
         need to be achieved prior to plan implementation.

         From the onset of this endeavor it has been made clear that funding has not yet been identified for
         the implementation of any traffic calming measures which may be proposed as part of this effort.
         This is a common condition of traffic calming endeavors. It is the development, and subsequent
         stakeholder endorsement, of a proposed traffic calming plan that is often a prerequisite for any
         funding requests. This is true whether or not the requests are to a municipality or other funding
         source.

         To first determine if the use of traffic calming measures is warranted an existing condition
         evaluation, or needs assessment, was conducted. This assessment clearly indicates the presence of a
         major, peak-hour vehicular cut-through route within these residential neighborhoods. Furthermore,
         vehicle operational speeds are shown to be approximately 10 mph higher than the posted speed
         limits along the local roadways studied. Based on these findings, and considering the intended
         functional use of the roadways in question, the implementation of traffic calming measures is
         justified to address associated neighborhood safety and traffic operational concerns.

BETA Group, Inc.                                                                                             1

       Congestion along High Street (Route 109) is clearly the driving factor behind the utilization of this
       cut-through route. For a variety of reasons related to infrastructure limitations and regional growth,
       High Street has become oversaturated during peak commuting periods. While beyond the scope of
       this project, addressing this root congestion would be the most effective means by which to reduce
       the desirability of the cut-through route and calm traffic within the study area neighborhoods. As
       such, the Town should continue to pursue improvements to traffic operations along High Street
       independent of any traffic calming options discussed herein. It must be recognized though, that
       while improvements along High Street could provide meaningful benefits, any such improvements
       are not likely to completely eliminate the incentive for the use of the identified cut-through route.
       To completely eliminate this incentive would require a substantial increase in capacity along High
       Street, something that would necessitate a significant capital investment and a long term engineering
       process. It would also require reconsideration and redevelopment of alternatives for High Street.
       For these reasons it is the opinion of the engineering team (BETA & Town) that the implementation
       of the proposed TCSIP represents an effective course of action to address neighborhood safety and
       traffic operational concerns. Any future improvements made to High Street should be viewed as
       supplementing the benefits provided by the proposed TCSIP rather than negating its value.

       It is important to note that while the use of traffic calming measures is justified from an engineering
       perspective, other factors must carefully be deliberated prior to implementing the devices under
       consideration. These considerations are most notably; increased emergency response time, noise
       concerns, impacts on property values and decreased service levels or increased costs for removal of
       snow and ice.

               Without question a major obstacle to traffic calming implementation is opposition from fire-
               rescue services. These are justified concerns which will require careful planning and
               coordination with emergency personnel to ensure that response times remain within
               acceptable bounds. This challenge will require striking a balance between public policies,
               traffic calming needs and emergency response strategies which would address the desire for
               slower and safer traffic conditions and the want for prompt emergency response. This is a
               challenge which has been met by various communities utilizing a range of techniques which
               are subsequently described herein.

               Residents, particularly those who would directly abut proposed traffic calming devices, are
               often concerned about potential noise and property value impacts. Studies conducted have
               found that traffic calming devices lower overall noise levels by reducing operating speeds.
               This overall reduction may be offset in the immediate vicinity of some devices by the noise
               of braking and accelerating. The choice of construction materials can also influence noise
               levels. To date no studies have shown that traffic calming to have an effect on property
               values2.

               Snow and ice removal is also a concern which is routinely associated with traffic calming
               endeavors in communities which experience weather conditions similar to Westwood.
               Surveys of these communities reveal that traffic calming devices have not been reported to
               prevent snow removal, leave streets unsafe due to residual snow and ice, damage
               snowplows, or suffer serious damage themselves. But they may add to workload and
               expense.3 In these communities the staff responsible for snow and ice removal are typically
               housed within the same departments as those responsible for implementing traffic calming
               and collegiality prevails. Traffic calming devices within these communities are often
               denoted by bollards or other reflectorized markers to ensure visibility during winter weather
               conditions. Snow plow blades are typically outfitted with rubber tips, rollers or metal
               extensions to ensure that neither the traffic calming devices nor plows are susceptible to
               damage.

       The proposed TCSIP features a variety of traffic calming treatments including speed tables, raised
       intersections, alternative pavements and center islands. In addition a variety of safety improvements
       are proposed at various locations, most notably at the intersection of Dover Road and Conant Road a
       location of particular safety concern which cannot be completely mitigated by traffic calming
       measures alone. When complete the TCSIP would improve neighborhood safety and traffic
       operational concerns by slowing traffic to acceptable levels, addressing specific safety deficiencies
       and providing a significant deterrent to cut-through activity.

       Finally, as the traffic calming process for this endeavor advanced, the engineering team recognized
       that the investment necessary to implement a traffic calming program on the scale which would be
       required, while also maintaining community character, would be significant. For this and other
       reasons subsequently described in this report, it was determined that the development of a Phase I
       Plan which resembles a more equitable investment level would be beneficial. As such, in addition to
       the overall TCSIP this report presents a Phase I Plan which augments select priority elements of the
       TCSIP with speed humps at various locations throughout the study area. These speed humps would
       then be remove and replaced with other various elements of the TCSIP during subsequent
       implementation phases.

2.0      PROCESS

         The successful realization of any traffic calming plan is heavily dependent upon the process by
         which the plan is developed. Defining a structured process is key. This process must balance the
         desires of all stakeholders while also utilizing sound engineering judgment. A typical traffic
         calming process consists of four phases:

                 1.      Project Initiation
                 2.      Project Development
                 3.      Project Approval
                 4.      Project Implementation

         Project initiation occurs when a resident or group of residents petitions a municipality to address a
         perceived concern. Project development is the process by which a proposed conceptual plan is
         identified. It is during this phase that all supportive data is collected, stakeholder feedback is sought
         and engineering feasibility analyses are conducted. Often this is an iterative process to balance the
         needs of all stakeholders. Project approval occurs when a majority of the affected community
         supports to implement the proposed conceptual plan. Project Implementation involves seeking
         municipal approval, identifying funding sources, preparing detailed engineering design plans and
         finally construction.

         This report summarizes all work conducted through phase two , project development and discuss the
         parameters of phases three and four, project approval and project implementation.

      2.1 Project Initiation

         Resident concerns regarding neighborhood safety and traffic operations related to cut-through traffic
         within the study area have existed for some time. Recently these concerns were again brought to the
         attention of Town officials. The Town agreed to consider addressing these concerns through the
         implementation of traffic calming measures with the following stipulations:

                 1.      An independent assessment validates the concerns and the applicability of
                         implementing traffic calming measures.
                 2.      If justified, any traffic calming measures implemented would not have the potential
                         to create detrimental impacts elsewhere.
                 3.      The majority of residents within the affected community express their approval for
                         the proposed Traffic Calming Plan.
                 4.      It is recognized that there is currently no funding identified to implement a proposed
                         plan.

         To address the first item the Town engaged BETA to conduct a Traffic Calming Needs Assessment.
          This assessment included the collection of necessary traffic data to evaluate the cut-through
         concerns and determine the merits of implementing traffic calming measures. Based on this
         assessment, the use of traffic calming measures is justified. The needs assessment clearly indicates
         the presence of a vehicular cut-through route. Furthermore vehicle speeds are consistently higher

BETA Group, Inc.                                                                                        7

       than the posted speed limits along the study area roadways. The supportive data for these
       conclusions are presented in Chapter 3, Existing Conditions. The full Traffic Calming Needs
       Assessment is provided in the Appendix.

       The second stipulation infers that traffic calming measures which physically divert traffic will
       not be considered for use in the proposed plan. Restricting traffic operations in this fashion would
       likely have the effect of displacing traffic into other residential neighborhoods as traffic will
       continue to seek alternatives to High Street due to the prevalent congested conditions along this
       roadway. This is not viewed as a viable alternative, rather as simply shifting impact from one
       neighborhood to another. The traffic calming plan developed as part of this effort will focus only on
       the application of speed control traffic calming measures.

       The third stipulation reinforces the project approval phase of the traffic calming process. This phase
       is discussed in detail later in this chapter.

       The final stipulation was an attempt to convey from the onset that the Town of Westwood currently
       does not have funding reserved specifically for the implementation of traffic calming measures
       which may be proposed as part of this effort. This is a common condition of traffic calming
       endeavors. It is the development, and subsequent stakeholder endorsement, of a proposed traffic
       calming plan that is often a prerequisite for any funding requests. This is true whether the requests
       are to the Town or any other funding source.

       Having established that the use of traffic calming measures is justified to address the documented
       neighborhood safety and traffic operation concerns and having conveyed the project stipulations the
       project then entered into the project development stage.

   2.2 Project Development

       The proposed plan presented in this report is the result of an extensive public process. Community
       involvement in the development of the plan was initiated at the onset of the project through the
       identification of neighborhood liaisons. These individuals acted as stewards of the project on behalf
       of the larger affected community. It was recognized that, while one community, the study area is
       comprised of a collection of neighborhoods. The neighborhood liaisons include spokespersons for
       each of the following neighborhoods identified by street:

               1.     High Rock Street
               2.     Dover Road
               3.     Conant Road
               4.     Lorraine Road
               5.     Country Lane/Sunset Street

       Concurrent with the undertaking of the Traffic Calming Needs Assessment some of the
       neighborhood liaisons were engaged to provide initial input and to begin promoting awareness of the
       project.

Westwood, MA

       Upon completion of the Traffic Calming Needs Assessment the first in a series of neighborhood
       meetings was held on May 4, 2011. This meeting was held to engage the community for the first
       time in a discussion of the project and its goals. This meeting was very well attended. Topics at the
       meeting included the overall traffic calming process, the findings of the needs assessment as well as
       specific concerns of the community. Topics of cost, funding and potential solutions outside the
       study area were specifically deferred until a later date in order to focus on specific operational issues
       and to identify preferred treatments.

       Once the procedural topics were covered the meeting focused on the development of the proposed
       traffic calming plan. To facilitate this discussion the engineering team prepared a Preliminary
       Traffic Calming Plan to present the types of applicable traffic calming measures which could be
       considered for deployment within the study area. A copy of this plan is provided in the Appendix as
       part of the needs assessment. The meeting participants then broke out into neighborhood orientated
       groups to participate in charrette style discussions and to begin the consensus building process. At
       the end of the meeting participants were informed that an open comment period would be held for
       approximately one week to convey any additional concerns that may not have been discussed at the
       meeting.

       After the closing of the open comment period the engineering team re-assessed the preliminary
       traffic calming plan from the context of the input received. At this point it was clear that any
       proposed plan should be developed with three goals in mind.

               1.      Reduce Vehicle Speeds
               2.      Discourage Cut-Through Traffic
               3.      Improve Safety

       A comprehensive engineering assessment was then conducted to refine the plan with all stakeholder
       input in mind. This procedure resulted in the establishment of a significant portion of the proposed
       plan presented in this report, see Chapter 4.

       A second neighborhood meeting was held on June 14, 2011 to present an update to the plan
       development and to discuss funding and cost matters. Preliminary cost estimates were presented at
       this meeting. Depending upon the materials and construction techniques employed the conceptual
       plan was project to range in cost from $600,000 to $1,500,000 or more. It was concluded by the
       engineering team that the funding required to implement a plan which both satisfied the stated goals
       and did so in a manner respective of the community character, would likely exceed the resources that
       may be procured in any single funding cycle. As a result of this conclusion the engineering team
       presented two options. The first option was the presentation of a plan which addressed the speeding
       and cut-through concerns system wide at a reduced cost, but did not address community character
       concerns. The second option considered a phased implementation of the proposed plan. To provide
       a comparison the engineering team identified priority phase one elements of the plan which could be
       constructed at a more equitable funding level. These priority items included a variety of types of
       traffic calming treatments spread throughout the study area to provide some benefit to all
       neighborhoods. It was noted that this approach would have the added benefit of allowing
       stakeholders to obtain a working knowledge of the types of devices being considered prior to

BETA Group, Inc.                                                                                      9
High Rock Street/Dover Road/Conant Road/Lorraine Road/Country Lane/Sunset Road             Traffic Calming Study
Westwood, MA

       investing the majority of the funding required for full plan implementation. The attendees discussed
       the merits and implications of all alternatives. One notable concern with a phased approach was that
       the priority elements identified, while important and providing benefits locally, may not represent
       enough of a deterrent to have a significant effect on the overall cut-through volumes and speeds.
       After lengthy discussion it was decided that a phased approach was preferred but that the
       engineering team should investigate augmenting a potential phase one with additional speed humps
       which could be implemented to increase the cut-through deterrent.

       Subsequently the engineering team then investigated the merits of implementing additional lower
       cost speed control devices as part of a phase one implementation. It was viewed that the additional
       deterrent and speed control offered by these devices would warrant incurring modest additional cost
       as part of a phase one implementation as long as the majority of residents were willing to tolerate
       their less than desirable aesthetic appearance. The conceptual plan was then modified accordingly.
       The estimated cost of a phase one plan, inclusive of the additional devices, was determined to be
       approximately $250,000.

       The engineering team also engaged the Town's emergency response personnel during this period to
       receive their input. Based on these conversations the most significant concerns raised dealt with the
       impact to emergency response time. To minimize these concerns going forward coordination with
       emergency response personnel should be an integral part of the detailed design stage if and when the
       development of the plan progresses.

       A third and final neighborhood meeting was held on October 26, 2011 to present the revised phase
       one plan. This plan was generally very well received and it was determined that the plan had
       advanced to a stage where it was ready to advance to the project approval stage.

   2.3 Project Approval

       Initially the project approval stage was envisioned to include a mail in ballot procedure to determine
       neighborhood support. At the onset of the project the engineering team conducted a review of industry
       standards to determine appropriate criteria for project approval. As the implementation of traffic
       calming devices can prove contentious it was decided that a relatively conservative approval process
       would be implemented to ensure a high level of community support. The recommended criteria for
       neighborhood project approval are:

               1.     70% of all households return ballots
               2.     70% of ballots vote for approval

       As the engineering assessment and planning for the project progressed however, it was determined by
       the engineering team that the underlying neighborhood safety and traffic operational concerns were of a
       significant naturel and should be brought to the attention of the Town's governing bodies. Given the
       magnitude of the concerns involved the engineering team would defer to guidance from these bodies as
       how best to structure final project approval. It should be noted however that the neighborhood liasons
       did conduct there own unofficial survey to determine existing support for the proposed TCSIP. This



BETA Group, Inc.                                                                                 10
High Rock Street/Dover Road/Conant Road/Lorraine Road/Country Lane/Sunset Road             Traffic Calming Study
Westwood, MA

       survey was sent to 82 households, 67% of which responded. Of those who responded 72% indicated
       they would vote to implement the proposed plan.

   2.4 Project Implementation

       Upon completing the project approval stage the project would enter into the final phase, project
       implementation. Project implementation would require the successful completion of the following
       additional elements:

                      Procurement of Funding
                      Detailed Engineering Design
                      Construction

       Procurement of funding does not necessarily imply funding solely by the Town of Westwood.
       Funding may be sought from other sources independent of or in conjunction with Town funding.
       Potential other sources include state grants and private party contributions.

       Detailed engineering design will require some level of additional planning and possibly local
       permitting. Design details such as the final location of traffic calming elements, roadway drainage
       and profile, details, specifications and final estimates would be produced during this stage. Survey
       may be required for the design of the more sensitive traffic calming elements.

       Construction options may include going through an opening bidding process to procure an
       independent contractor to construct the proposed devices. The Town may wish to engage an
       engineer to provide construction services to ensure that the building of the proposed traffic calming
       devices adheres to recommended design standards. Training Town DPW staff on how to construct
       some of the less refined traffic calming elements may also be an option, particularly if the Town may
       consider implementing traffic calming elsewhere in the future.

       As a final note, if the Town anticipates additional traffic calming requests from other neighborhood
       groups in the future it may wish to consider developing a formal traffic calming policy which could
       be used to efficiently manage these requests. Sources are available to guide in the development of
       these policies.

3.0      EVALUATION

         BETA has conducted an extensive evaluation process to validate the neighborhood safety and traffic
         operational concerns and to determine the merits of implementing traffic calming measures to
         address these concerns. This evaluation was previously summarized in a Traffic Calming Needs
         Assessment submitted to the Town of Westwood in the form of a memorandum on April 6, 2011.
         Based on this assessment, the need for a traffic calming program is justified. The traffic evaluation
         clearly indicates the presence of a major vehicular cut-through route. Furthermore vehicle speeds
         are consistently higher than the posted speed limits along the study area roadways. Supportive
         elements of this memorandum are reiterated within this chapter.

      3.1 Field Observations

         During field visits conducted in March of 2011 BETA compared travel times along the High Street
         corridor and the alternative neighborhood cut-through route to quantify the incentive the cut-through
         route represents. Travel times were recorded along High Street between High Rock Street and
         Summer Street. These measurements were made in the northbound direction during the morning
         peak period and the southbound direction during the evening peak period to be consistent with the
         predominant traffic flows and cut-through activity. Measured travel times were approximately 11
         minutes and 4 minutes 32 seconds, during the morning and evening peak periods respectively.
         Alternatively travel times along the cut-through route were 6 minutes and 3 minutes 50 seconds,
         respectively. A summary of the determined travel time information is presented in Table 1 below.

                                          Table 1 ­ Travel Time Summary
                                                                  Dover Road
                                     Route 109                                           Time Difference
                                                                 (cut-through)
                   AM                   11:00                         6:00                     5:00
                   PM                    4:32                         3:50                     0:42

         As can be seen in Table 1 the time savings for a vehicle to use the cut-through route during the
         morning peak period is approximately 5 minutes and during the evening peak period is 42 seconds.
         The difference between time savings appears to be related to the location of the congestion on High
         Street during the two time periods. In the morning the congestion builds in the northbound
         direction, heading towards Rt 128/I-95. During this period vehicles are presented with the option of
         utilizing the cut-through route at a location relatively close to the beginning point of the congestion
         along High Street, giving the driver a significant incentive to choose to utilize the cut-through.
         During the evening peak period the congestion builds in the southbound direction, heading from Rt
         128/I-95. During this time period drivers are not presented with the option to utilize the cut-through
         route until a point much further along the corridor, thus comparatively lowering the incentive to
         utilize the cut-through route. Residents have noted that the use of the cut-through route during the
         evening period is enhanced during the warmer weather months when pedestrian activity along High
         Street increases. This point is reinforced by the observed traffic volumes as discussed below.




BETA Group, Inc.                                                                                      12

       Observations of vehicle queues were also made during the morning and evening peak periods.
       Notable queues4 consist of:

                       16 vehicles along Conant Road eastbound at High Street during the morning
                       peak period
                       13 vehicles along Hartford Street eastbound at High Rock Street during the
                       morning peak period
                       7 vehicles along High Rock Street southbound at Hartford Street during the
                       evening peak period
                       Queues of 5 vehicles or less along all other approaches

       The queues reported above represent classic standing queues. At other locations persistent rolling
       queues were observed and present their own operational difficulties. A rolling queue is a platoon of
       vehicles that never fully stops but are bunched together, traveling at a consistent low level speed.
       The presence of these rolling queues is primarily due to the lack of opposing volume at intersections
       within the study area. One significant contributing factor to rolling queues is school bus activity in
       the area.

       Other notable roadway and intersection features were also recorded during the field visits including
       sight lines, pavement markings, width and condition as well as posted speeds and the location of
       sidewalks and crosswalks.

   3.2 Traffic Data

       To assess existing traffic conditions in the study area, peak hour turning movement counts (TMC)
       were conducted on Tuesday, March 22nd, 2011 from 7:00-9:00AM and 4:00-6:00PM. These periods
       represent the most critical traffic volume conditions. Concurrent with the TMCs, automatic traffic
       recorder (ATR) counts were conducted along High Rock Street, Dover Road and Conant Road,
       collecting weekday data over a 48-hour period. The ATR's collected continuous traffic volume data,
       speed data and vehicle classification information at the following locations:

               1.      High Rock Street between #102 High Rock and the intersection of Westchester Road
               2.      Dover Road between #267 and #195
               3.      Conant Road between #223 and #175

       A review of the data indicated that the weekday morning peak period occurred from 7:15 AM to
       8:15 AM and the weekday evening peak period occurred 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM. A summary of the
       ATR data is presented in Table 2 below. Figure 2 provides the 2011 existing weekday morning and

       The ATRs also recorded 85th percentile operational speeds, the speed at which 85% of vehicles are
       traveling at or below. A summary of the posted and 85th percentile speeds is provided in Table 3.

       As can be seen in Table 3 the operational speeds along the subject roadways are generally 10 mph
       over the posted speed limit.

Westwood, MA

       Finally, a tracking study was performed on March 22, 2011 during the peak periods to determine the
       level of cut-through traffic. Vehicle tracking was conducted at the following locations:

               1.     High Rock Street at Hartford Street
               2.     Conant Road at High Street
               3.     Dover Road at High Street
               4.     Country Lane at Sunset Road

       The results percentage of all vehicles utilizing the study area roadways as a cut-through route as
       measured as a percentage of the total number of vehicles entering and exiting High Rock Street for
       each peak period are provided in Table 4 below and graphically on Figure 3.

       Based on the tracking study approximately 94% and 83% of vehicles travelling on High Rock Street
       are using the study neighborhood as a cut-through during the morning and evening peak periods
       respectively. It should be noted that the volume utilizing the cut-through is significantly higher
       during the morning peak period. In the morning approximately 60% of the traffic enters the cut-
       through route primarily as a left turn from Hartford Street, 25% enters from High Street, the remain
       15% diffuses into the cut-through route from the residential roadways along High Rock Street
       between Hartford Street and Dover Road, presumably as traffic from Hartford Street seeking to
       avoid congestion along this road as it approaches High Rock Street. As seen in Table 4 the majority
       (53%) of the cut-through traffic is destined towards Country Lane and Sunset Road, presumably
       towards Summer Street from which it will re-access High Street at their signalized intersection.
       About one third of the cut-through traffic chooses to re-enter High Street via the unsignalized
       intersection at Conant Road. Only a minor portion (9%) stays on Dover Road to re-enter High
       Street. In the evening the majority of traffic utilizing the cut-through route enters from Summer
       Street via Country Lane or Sunset Road. About one quarter enter via Dover Road. About two thirds
       of the traffic utilizing the cut-through in the evening are destined for Hartford Street westbound, the
       other third re-enters High Street from High Rock Road.

   3.3 Pedestrian Concerns

       The issue of pedestrian accommodation is one that was raised consistently throughout the traffic
       calming process. A by-product of cut-through traffic is pedestrian safety concerns given the lack of
       accommodations within the study area. During the field observations these concerns were validated
       by the presence of several school aged children observed throughout the study area, most notably at
       the intersection of the Conant Road at Country Lane and along Conant Road in the Lynn Terrace
       area. Furthermore there are approximately 16 school bus stops located throughout the study area
       neighborhoods.

       The implementation of the proposed TCSIP will provide some relief to these pedestrian concerns by
       reducing the number of vehicles utilizing the cut-through and slowing those which remain.
       However, the interjection of pedestrian accommodations into the plan which do not have a traffic
       calming component, such as sidewalks, would introduce additional issues that would further
       complicate the ability to implement the plan. There have been many instances of neighborhood
       groups requesting sidewalks and other pedestrian accommodations in recent years. The Town's
       policy for addressing these requests has been to create a policy that if all of a neighborhood can
       agree to being assessed a betterment charge for the construction of sidewalks the Town will provide
       the funding up front. This betterment can be paid back over a set period of time (or until the
       property is sold) with an annual interest assessment applied to the outstanding balance.

       If any of the individual neighborhoods strongly desire sidewalks and/or other pedestrian
       accommodations it is recommended that they be pursued independent of this project. The location
       of the traffic calming devices in the proposed plan does consider the benefit to pedestrians as
       individual locations.

4.0      TRAFFIC CALMING PLAN

         As described in Chapter 2, Process, the proposed Traffic Calming and Safety Improvement Plan has
         been developed as the result of an extensive public process. This chapter provides a description of
         the proposed elements of the Plan as well as differentiating specific traffic calming features and their
         effectiveness.

      4.1 Applicable Traffic Calming Devices

         Traffic calming devices generally fall into two categories, those elements which directly provide
         volume control and those measures which primarily provide speed control. Commonly used traffic
         calming devices for volume control include full and half road closures as well as physical diverters.
         As was identified from the onset of this endeavor, any traffic calming measures implemented will
         not have the potential to create detrimental impacts elsewhere. As a direct result of this condition,
         traffic calming devices used for volume control only are not considered to be applicable for this
         project.

         Traffic calming devices which were considered as part of this project are described below. For a
         variety of reasons, including neighborhood opposition and engineering feasibility, some of the
         devices were also removed from further consideration as noted.

         Pavement Markings
         Pavement Markings can be used as traffic calming measures that regulate traffic movements in lieu
         of or in combination with other physical changes to the roadway. The addition of striping a defined
         centerline and shoulder have been shown to have a calming effect on traffic particularly in locations
         where pavement markings had previously not existed.

         A number of comments received from the community have expressed a desire to limit the amount of
         new pavement markings within the study area to restrain impacts to community character. While
         the engineering team is aware of these concerns, the application of pavement markings is a low cost
         item which has been noted to have had significant beneficial impacts to vehicle speeds in similar
         applications. As such, the engineering team recommends the application of center line and shoulder
         markings along each of the affected study area roadways. The effect of these markings should be
         monitored. If it is determined that these markings do not produce a substantial benefit they need not
         be reapplied as part of routine maintenance.

       Curb Extensions
       These are physical devices which reduce the roadway width from
       curb to curb. When placed at intersections these devices are
       referred to as neckdowns and when applied at midblock locations
       curb extensions are referred to as chokers. Chokers force vehicles
       to slow while maneuvering through narrow points along the
       roadway while neckdowns at an intersection lead to tighter turning
       radii, also forcing vehicles to slow. Both devices offer additional
       safety benefits to pedestrians by reducing crossing width and
       creating areas                                                                Curb Extensions



       During the engineering feasibility assessment it was revealed that many of the subject roadways
       already exhibit a relatively narrow width which would render the construction of chokers infeasible.
       It was also determined that the existing curb-radii at the pertinent intersections were required to
       accommodate the movements of school bus and random larger delivery vehicles (figures
       demonstrating this need are provided in the appendix). The construction of neckdowns was also
       therefore determined to be infeasible, however the use of alternative pavements at some locations to
       mimic the effect of neckdowns without introducing a physical barrier to larger vehicle operations
       has been proposed.

       Chicanes
                                       Chicanes are S-shaped curve realignments of a normally straight
                                       roadway, which encourages slower speeds.

                                       Chicanes are not a preferred traffic calming treatment.




                   Chicanes

       Center Island
       Center islands are raised medians along the roadway centerline.
       They typically narrow the travel lanes, separate opposing traffic
       movements and may introduce a slight travel path deflection.
       When landscaped, they can improve the aesthetics of the corridor.
       They are feasible without major roadway changes when the right-
       of-way is available within the existing pavement width. Center
       islands may also be painted, but these are less effective than raised
       center islands, since vehicles can traverse a painted island.

       Center islands are considered a preferred traffic calming treatment         Center Island
       by the community and are considered where there is sufficient width available. In some instances

       mountable center islands are proposed to accommodate larger vehicles while still providing a traffic
       calming benefit.

       Gateway
                                                  Gateway features can be used to identify a change in the
                                                  roadway environment for vehicles entering the traffic
                                                  calming management area. Monuments or other
                                                  landscaping devices can be used to signify a change in
                                                  the area type. Gateways are often combined with other
                                                  traffic calming elements.


                        Gateway                   The use of gateway treatments as an efficient use of
                                                  available funds was questioned by the community.
                                                  Gateway treatments will be limited in the proposed
       plan.

       Roundabouts/Mini-Traffic Circles
       Roundabouts/mini-traffic circles consist of placing raised islands
       within an intersection around which traffic circulates in a
       counterclockwise direction. These devices have been shown to
       reduce vehicle speeds and improve safety. Mini traffic circles
       usually have 4-way stop control. Roundabouts (which have
       additional design characteristics) are often deployed at higher
       volume intersections.

       Roundabouts and mini-traffic circles were determined to be
                                                                                  Mini Traffic Circle
       inapplicable as part of the engineering assessment due to
       restrictions they would impose upon school bus and delivery
       vehicle operations.

                                              Speed Bumps
                                              Speed bumps are often the devices which come to mind
                                              when discussing traffic calming devices. Speed bumps were
                                              used in previous generations of traffic calming. They are
                                              narrow and often abrupt. Today they are found along private
                                              roadways and within parking lots.

                                              Speed bumps are not being considered as part of this effort.

       Speed Humps
       Speed humps are asphalt or rubber mounds that
       cover the full width of the roadway. Speed humps
       are typically 3 to 3.5 inches in height and 12 to 14
       feet long. They have been shown to slow vehicles
       to 20-23 mph to traverse.

       Speed humps were not considered to be a preferred
       traffic calming option for permanent installation by
       the community, however the use of speed humps as
       temporary measures during initial implementation                     Speed Hump
       phases was endorsed as a means to maximize cut-
       through deterrent.

                                                              long (10 foot plateau and two 6 foot ramps).

                                                              the ramps are sloped gently for a more
                                                              gradual slowing of vehicles than speed

                            Speed Table                       humps. The flat top allows a higher design
                                                              speed and smoother ride than humps. Speed
       tables are more desirable to emergency vehicles than speed humps as they are less jarring. When
       used in conjunction with a crosswalk speed tables are considered raised crosswalks.

       Speed tables are a preferred traffic calming device by the community and the design team.

       Speed Lumps/Cushions
       Speed lumps/cushions are speed humps with
       the wheel base of an emergency vehicle
       removed so these vehicles can proceed
       unimpeded. These devices are a relatively
       new form of traffic calming and the industry
       knowledge is still forming. While they
       introduce the possibility of calming traffic
       without introducing additional delay to
       emergency response times, the early input on
       these devices is that they may introduce
       erratic driving behavior by some drivers.
       Instances of vehicles aligning one wheel base                 Speed Lumps/Cushions
       with the gap between speed lumps and not
       reducing speeds give pause to recommending
       these devices.

       The application of speed lumps/cushions was carefully considered to address emergency response
       concerns. Ultimately the anecdotal evidence of erratic driving behavior gives cause to avoid
       recommending these devices at this time.

                                                                A raised intersection is a raised plateau

                                                                most expensive of traffic calming options,

                                                                two roadways at one location. These
                                                                devices also increase pedestrian safety
                                                                throughout the entire intersection.

                                                                Raised intersections are considered a
                         Raised Intersection                    preferred traffic calming device by the
                                                                community and engineering team.

       Dynamic Speed Feedback Signs
       Dynamic Speed Feedback Signs are radar activated signs that dynamically display
       approaching speeds for individual vehicles or display messages such as "SLOW
       DOWN" or "REDUCE SPEED" when a vehicle exceeds a certain speed. They
       alert drivers that they are speeding and create a sense of being monitored. They
       can be portable or permanent.

       Dynamic Speed Feedback Signs were not considered a preferred traffic calming
       device by the community during the open comment period and are not considered
       in the proposed plan.

       The TCSIP was developed utilizing those preferred devices outline above. In             Dynamic
       addition due to the limitation at certain locations the engineering team                 Speed
                                                                                            Feedback Sign
       recommends the use of some alternative designs including vehicle mountable
       center islands and flush channelization islands. The use of these devices will be described in more
       detail in the plan description.

       It should be noted that advanced warning signs are necessary to warn drivers of many of the
       proposed traffic calming devices. In addition to advanced warning signs the use of reflectorized
       object markers and/or bollards may be necessary to facilitate plowing operations.

       Finally it is important to note that while individual traffic calming devices will slow vehicles in the
       general vicinity of the device, to achieve corridor wide speed reductions will require proper spacing
       of devices. If spaced too far apart vehicles will accelerate back to preferred speeds between devices.
       Design guidance indicates a preference of 500 feet between devices to achieve adequate speed
       control. Volume impacts are much more difficult to predict and are dependent upon case specific
       driving factors. Empirical data suggests a higher end deterrent of approximately 30% for properly
       designed traffic calming corridors aimed at deterring cut-through traffic. This percentage should be
       tempered somewhat in this instance due to the lack of sufficient alternative routes.

   4.2 Key Considerations

       Traffic calming is a proven technique for addressing vehicle speed, traffic cut-through and safety
       issues. The introduction of traffic calming does however raise a number of associated concerns
       which must be carefully considered prior to implementation. These concerns are related to increases
       to emergency response time, noise concerns, impacts to property values and decreased service levels
       or increased costs for removal of snow and ice.

       Emergency Response
       A major obstacle to traffic calming implementation is often opposition from fire-rescue services.
       These are justified concerns which will require careful planning and coordination with emergency
       response personnel to ensure that response times remain within acceptable bounds. This challenge
       will require striking a balance between public policies, traffic calming needs and emergency
       response strategies which address the desire for slower and safer traffic conditions and the want for
       prompt emergency response.

       Various evaluations have been conducted to quantify the delay incurred by emergency vehicles
       based on a variety of standard traffic calming designs. The most conservative findings indicated a
       delay of 10 seconds of delay incurred on emergency vehicles per device. These evaluations also find
       that those traffic calming devices where the entire wheelbase of an emergency vehicle can rest upon
       a flat section, such as speed tables and raised intersections, reduce the jarring impact and associated
       delay imposed on these vehicles. From this standpoint speed tables and raised intersections are
       preferred over speed humps by emergency response personnel.

       A variety of techniques have been developed to address emergency vehicle response time concerns.
       Some municipalities have altered the design of traffic calming devices to reducing the vertical
       deflection of speed humps/tables. While this technique may lessen delay to emergency vehicles, it
       must be recognized that it will also directly lessen the speed control imposed upon standard vehicles.
       Other municipalities have experimented with split devices where emergency vehicle can weave
       around traffic calming devices in a slalom-like fashion. Care must be taken when designing these
       devices to ensure that passenger vehicles also do not avoid the devices in a similar fashion. Using
       some creative design techniques the City of Portland, Oregon has had demonstrated success with this
       type of installation. Finally, speed lumps/cushions as described in the previous section have shown
       to be beneficial to emergency vehicle operations. As previously discussed these devices have been
       anecdotally associated with erratic driving behavior of passenger vehicles.

       Initial discussions have been held with Town of Westwood emergency response personnel, these
       discussions should continue and all options should be weighed to ensure that a proper balance is
       struck between the desire to calm traffic and maintaining adequate emergency response times.

       Environmental and Property Value Impacts
       Residents, particularly those who would directly abut proposed traffic calming devices, are often
       concerned about potential environmental and property value impacts. Studies conducted have found
       that traffic calming devices actually reduce overall noise levels by 3 to 11 decibels (3 dBA is the
       minimum noise differential perceptible to the human ear) through the reduction of operating speeds.
        This overall reduction may be periodically offset by the noise of braking and accelerating at some
       devices. The choice of construction materials can also influence noise levels. Traffic calming
       devices have not been associated with substantial changes to air quality. The emission of pollutants
       from vehicles varies with operating speeds, some emissions increase at lower speeds, others at
       higher speeds. In other applications residents have expressed concern about traffic-induced
       vibrations with traffic calming devices and the impact on adjacent structures. While studies have
       found that vibrations may be perceptible by persons located up to 100 ft away when larger vehicles
       traverse vertical devices, these vibrations have been deemed highly unlikely to lead to structural
       damage to neighboring buildings. Finally, although some residents may be concerned that property
       values would be negatively affected by the installation of traffic calming devices, no studies have
       found this to be the case5.

       Snow and Ice Removal
       Snow and ice removal is also a concern which is routinely associated with traffic calming endeavors
       in communities which experience weather conditions similar to Westwood. Surveys of these
       communities reveal that traffic calming devices have not been reported to prevent snow removal,
       leave streets unsafe due to residual snow and ice, damage snowplows, or suffer serious damage
       themselves. But they may add to workload and expense.6 In these communities the staff responsible
       for snow and ice removal are typically housed within the same departments as those responsible for
       implementing traffic calming and collegiality prevails. To ensure traffic calming devices are visible
       during winter weather conditions they are typically delineated by bollards or other reflectorized
       object markers. Snow plow blades may need to be outfitted with rubber tips, rollers or metal
       extensions to ensure that damage is not incurred on the traffic calming device or plow blade during
       snow and ice removal.

   4.3 Proposed Traffic Calming and Safety Improvement Plan

       The proposed TCSIP is provided as Figure 4. Overall this plan consists of the following elements:

                      14      Speed Tables
                       6      Center Islands
                       4      Raised Intersections
                       3      Alternative Pavement Locations
                       1      Rumble Strip
                       1      Gateway
                      Safety Improvements at Various Locations
                      Center Line and Pavement Markings Throughout

       In addition to the overall plan a number of detailed graphics have been developed to convey specific
       improvements at various locations. These are provided as the figures listed below.

       The proposed TCSIP represents the culmination of the engineering feasibility assessment and
       community vetting process. It is a conceptual plan intended to convey the intent and scale of the
       proposed traffic calming program which would be required to achieve all desired goals. If endorsed
       and a funding source is identified an additional level of detailed design would be required prior to
       plan implementation

       The proposed improvements are described below in more detail below by street.

       High Rock Street
       The majority of cut-through traffic enters/exits the cut-through route at the intersection of High Rock
       Street at Hartford Street. This location would be the most preferential location for the creation of a
       gateway. Drivers entering High Rock Street would immediately be aware of the change in roadway
       character and that they are entering an area of traffic calming application. This improvement is
       provided as Figure 5 and consists of upgraded pedestrian crosswalks, alternative pavement along
       High Rock Street coupled with decorative bollards as well as additional curbing throughout the
       intersection.

       High Rock Street exhibits the highest operational speeds within the cut-through route. To address
       these speeding concerns 3 speed tables are proposed along this stretch of roadway, 2 between
       Hartford Street and Westchester Drive and another between Westchester Drive and Salisbury Drive.

       Finally, due to congestion on Hartford Street eastbound approaching High Rock Street, some cut-
       through traffic chooses to depart Hartford Street and cut-through the residential neighborhoods
       abutting High Rock Street to the west. This traffic then enters the cut-through route as a left-turn
       from Westchester Drive. To address the erratic behavior of these vehicles a center island is
       proposed on Westchester Drive at the intersection with High Rock Street. This island would be
       constructed of mountable curbing so as not to impede delivery vehicles or bus traffic. A series of
       planters along with a segment of center line markings would delineate the proposed island. The stop
       sign would be relocated and a stop bar added. These improvements are depicted as Figure 6.

       Dover Road
       The intersection of Dover Road and High Rock Street is the first significant intersection vehicles
       encounter along the cut-through route. The intersection currently exhibits less than ideal geometric
       alignment due to roadway grades and sight distance restrictions. A series of safety improvements
       including trimming vegetation to improve sight lines and advanced intersection warnings signs are
       proposed at this location. In addition, while narrowing the intersection geometry with curb
       extensions and/or raised center islands would impede school bus and delivery vehicle operations a
       series of alternative pavement techniques are proposed which would mimic the effect of these
       devices on passenger vehicles. These improvements are provided as Figure 7.

       The segment of Dover Road between High Rock Street and Carby Street is a ½ mile stretch of
       roadway abutted by residential properties. To control vehicle speeds along this stretch of roadway 4
       speed tables are proposed.

       At the intersection of Dover Road at Carby Street an area of alternative pavement is proposed.
       Carby Street serves as the entrance to the Town of Westwood Department of Public Works facility.
       Due to the nature of some of the larger vehicles routinely turning at this intersection the used of any
       raised traffic calming devices is not recommended. These proposed improvements are shown as
       Figure 8.

       The intersection of Dover Road at Conant Road is one of the most sensitive locations along the cut-
       through route. In the morning the majority of cut-through vehicles turn left from Dover Road to
       Conant Road. As these vehicles are often un-opposed they execute this left-turn maneuver at an
       excessive rate of speed, often encroaching into the opposing travel lane along Conant Road.
       Furthermore, sight distance along Conant Road is limited by an earthen mound to the west of the
       intersection. Any vehicles exiting Conant Road must encroach out into Dover Road to view
       oncoming vehicles, the very movement that left-turning vehicles from Dover Road are often
       encroaching upon. Finally there is a large undefined area to the east of Conant Road which is often
       used by idling vehicles. Improvements proposed at this location include creating a raised
       intersection, constructing a center island on Conant Road to channelize turning vehicles, regarding
       the earthen mound to improve sight distance and the restoration of green space to the east of Conant
       Road to provide a gateway style benefit. These improvements are provided as Figure 9.

       An additional speed table is proposed between Conant Road and Lorraine Road.

Westwood, MA

       Conant Road
       Conant Road also exhibit elevated speeds due to its straight alignment, particularly on its southern
       extend. To address these speeds a speed table and center island are proposed within the segment
       between Dover Road and Lynn Terrace.

       The intersection of Lynn Terrace is proposed to be a raised intersection. This would have the
       additional benefit of providing safety improvements for school children who are often observed at
       this intersection waiting of the school bus. These improvements are provided as Figure 10.

       Due to the roadway grades along the segment of Conant Road between Lynn Terrace and Lorraine
       Road/Country Lane the use of traffic calming devices is limited. To maintain adequate spacing
       between traffic calming devices a rumble strip is currently proposed in this segment. It is believed
       that this device could be located so as not to be directly adjacent to any abutting residents.

       The intersection of Conant Road at Lorraine Road/country Lane is also of significant concern. Most
       of the cut-through traffic accelerates through this intersection with little concern for opposing
       vehicles. A raised intersection is proposed for this location. As cut-through traffic exists along
       multiple legs of this intersection, this traffic calming feature would have the benefit of calming
       multiple roadways at one location. These improvements are provided as Figure 11.

       Two additional speed tables are proposed between Lorraine Road/Country Lane and High Street.

       Lorraine Road
       Lorraine Road is included within this traffic calming program as a result of the potential for traffic to
       divert to this roadway if the deterrent along Conant Road were sufficient. In addition to the raised
       intersection at Conant Road another is proposed at the intersection with Dover Road, shown as
       Figure 12. Two additional speed tables are proposed between Dover Road and Conant Road.

       Country Lane/Sunset Road
       One speed table is proposed along Country Lane between Conant Road and Sunset Road.

       At the intersection of Country Lane and Sunset Road a raised channelization island is proposed.
       This intersection is very wide and devoid of any traffic control features. The channelization island,
       shown as Figure 13 would force vehicles to navigate the intersection in a more appropriate manner.

       The intersections of Country Lane and Sunset Road at Summer Street are similar. Both exhibit
       unique operational behavior during the morning peak hour. At these locations cut-through traffic
       attempts to enter Summer Street. Downstream of these intersections is the signalized intersection of
       Summer Street at High Street. Queues from this intersection often extend beyond Country Lane and
       Sunset Road. As a result significant queues form along these roadways as cut-through traffic waits
       to enter Summer Street. Occasionally a vehicle will wish to turn left from Country Lane or Sunset
       Road onto Summer Street. These vehicles often grow impatient in a queue of right-turning vehicles
       and have been observed to "jump the queue" by driving along the opposite side of the roadway, an
       obvious safety concern. To address this raised, mountable center islands are proposed or physically

       restrict vehicles from executing this maneuver. These improvements are shown as Figure 14 and
       Figure 15 .for Country Lane at Summer Street and Sunset Road at Summer Street respectively.


   4.4 Plan Cost and Phase One Plan

       The cost associated with constructing traffic calming devices varies significantly depending upon the
       types of materials used. Materials range from simple asphalt moldings at the basic level to stamped
       concrete at an intermediate level and brick pavers, cobblestone or other inlaid materials at the high
       end. Preliminary estimates for the TCSIP range from $600,000 at the basic level to $1,000,000 at
       the intermediate level and upwards of $1,500,000 or more at the high end.

       A prevailing concern expressed during the community consensus building effort was the effect
       traffic calming devices would have on the neighborhood character. Many residents expressed
       concern that the traffic calming devices could pose "visual pollution" and impose an additional
       hardship on the neighborhood residents if the basic level options were implemented.

       At any level the engineering team felt that the cost associated to implement the full TCSIP would
       likely exceed the capacity of funding available to construct the proposed plan in a single phase. In
       response the engineering team developed a Phase I Plan which represents a more equitable
       investment level. The Phase I Plan consists of priority elements of the TCSIP augmented with a
       number of speed humps (which would be replaced with speed tables during subsequent phases)
       implemented throughout the study area to maximize the cut-through deterrent. Furthermore, a
       phased implementation has the added benefit of introducing a variety of traffic calming elements on
       a gradual basis. As previously mentioned traffic calming devices, while often accomplishing their
       intended goal of calming traffic, may introduce additional concerns related to emergency response
       times, noise and snow and ice removal. A phased implementation affords all stakeholders the ability
       to become acquainted with traffic calming devices prior to full plan implementation. This would
       allow subsequent phases to be adjusted to reflect likes and dislikes of those devices already
       implemented.

       The Phase I Plan is presented a Figure 16. This plan includes the following features from the
       overall TCSIP:

                        Raised Intersection at Conant Road/Lorraine Road/Country Lane represented as
                        Figure 10.
                        Center island on Conant Road at Dover Road shown on Figure 8. Note that all
                        other improvements at this intersection would be deferred to subsequent phases.
                        Mountable center islands on Country Lane and Sunset Road at Summer Street as
                        shown on Figures 13 and 14 respectively.

       In addition to these permanent features the Phase I plan proposes seven speed humps deployed
       throughout the study area. These speed humps would augment the permanent features and maximize

       the cut-through deterrent. These speed humps are front-loaded on High Rock Street and Dover Road
       to further maximize the deterrent experienced by vehicles at the beginning of the cut-through route
       during the critical morning peak period. Finally the Phase I Plan includes implementing center line
       and fog line markings throughout the study area.

       The preliminary cost associated with the Phase I Plan is approximately $250,000 and is based upon
       an intermediate construction level associated with the permanent features.

5.0    CONCLUSION

       Current peak hour traffic conditions exhibited along High Rock Street, Dover Road, Conant Road,
       Country Lane and Sunset Road clearly justify the safety concerns raised by residents who live within
       the neighborhoods these roadways traverse. Existing traffic volumes and speeds are out of character
       with the intended functional use of these roadways and amplify existing safety deficiencies. Any
       reasonable course to offset these concerns and deficiencies is warranted and should be thoroughly
       examined.

       Congestion along High Street (Route 109) is clearly the driving factor behind these concerns. It is
       this root congestion which is pushing drivers onto these residential roadways and producing the cut-
       through route. Addressing capacity issues along High Street would be the most effective means by
       which to reduce the desirability of the cut-through route and calm traffic within the study area
       neighborhoods. As such, the Town should continue to pursue improvements to traffic operations
       along High Street independent of any other action. It must be recognized though, that while
       improvements along High Street could provide meaningful benefits, any such improvements are not
       likely to completely eliminate the incentive for the use of the identified cut-through route. To
       completely eliminate this incentive would require a substantial increase in capacity along High
       Street, something that would necessitate a significant capital investment and a long term engineering
       process. It would also require reconsideration and redevelopment of alternatives for High Street.

       As improvements along High Street are not likely to remedy the cut-through issues, consideration of
       traffic calming as a means to improve conditions is a reasonable and appropriate action. Traffic
       calming, deployed at an appropriate scale, will have the effect of slowing vehicles and improving
       overall safety while also providing some level of deterrent towards use of the cut-through route. The
       proposed Traffic Calming and Safety Improvement Plan provides a conceptual understanding of the
       infrastructure needs which would be required to accomplish the neighborhood safety and traffic
       operational improvement objectives. The TCSIP and associated Phase I plan have been developed
       with the input of neighborhood resident who are currently affected by the cut-through route and who
       would be exposed to the traffic calming features on a routine basis. The significant majority of these
       residents appear supportive of the proposed plan. If endorsed by the Town governing authority the
       plan could then be utilized to pursue funding from any available source. If a funding source is
       identified the plan should then be advanced to a detailed design stage and then to construction. The
       benefits of the TCSIP however, must be tempered with a note of caution and carefully considered in
       light of other key considerations which traffic calming "solutions" will impact to some degree such
       as emergency response times, noise impacts and snow and ice removal. The community must come
       to a consensus that the benefits of the proposed TCSIP outweigh any potential adverse impact to
       these considerations and that the plan ultimately strikes the proper balance between public policies,
       traffic calming needs and emergency response strategies.

       INTRODUCTION
       BETA Group, Inc. (BETA), on behalf of the Town of Westwood (Town) has conducted a Traffic
       Calming Needs Assessment within the High Rock Street, Dover Road, Conant Road and Country
       Lane neighborhoods. This assessment provides a summary of existing traffic conditions within
       the neighborhoods and quantifies the need for the implementation of a traffic calming program.
       By definition, traffic calming involves changes in street alignment, installation of barriers, and
       other physical measures to reduce traffic speeds and/or cut-through volumes, in the interest of
       street safety, livability, and other public purposes.1If justified, this document will also provide a
       description of commonly used applicable traffic calming devices and a preliminary traffic
       calming plan to act as a starting point for discussion.

       The adoption of any traffic calming plan can only occur as a result of a structured process. This
       process is heavily dependent upon the input of the residents within the neighborhoods which abut
       the subject area. If a traffic calming program is found to be justified through this assessment, the
       eventual preferred plan is then developed through close coordination between the Town, the
       residents and the engineers. It is important to note that for the plan to successfully be adopted as
       the guiding plan for the future implementation of traffic calming devices requires the direct
       approval of the majority of the affected residents. As such it is critical that the public play an
       active role in the traffic calming planning process.

       The details of the traffic calming process as they specifically pertain to this project will be an
       integral part of the first neighborhood meeting to discuss the project. This meeting is scheduled
       for the evening of May 4, 2011.

       The subsequent portions of this memorandum summarize BETA's initial findings as part of the
       traffic calming needs assessment.

Residents within the High Rock Street, Dover Road, Conant Road and Country Lane
neighborhoods have expressed concern that these local roadways are actively being used as a
cut-through by traffic seeking to avoid peak period congestion along High Street (Route 109),
resulting in speed and safety issues within their neighborhoods. The Town has agreed to
consider addressing these concerns through the development of a traffic calming plan with the
stipulations that

       1. An independent assessment validates the cut-through concerns and the applicability of
          traffic calming measures.
       2. If justified, any traffic calming program implemented will not have the potential to create
          detrimental impacts elsewhere.
       3. The majority of residents within the neighborhoods affected directly express their
          approval for the traffic calming plan.
       4. It is recognized that there is currently no funding identified to implement the plan.

To address these concerns the Town has retained BETA to oversee the traffic calming planning
process. Based on our investigation, the need for a traffic calming program is justified. The
traffic volumes documented herein utilizing these roadways during peak hours clearly indicate
the presence of a cut-through route. Furthermore vehicle speeds are consistently higher than
the posted speed limits along these roadways. Field measurements reveal that use of the cut-
through has the potential to reduce travel time significantly when compared to utilizing High
Street only, particularly during the morning peak period.

Congestion along High Street (Route 109) is clearly the driving factor behind the utilization of
these neighborhood roads as a cut-through route. High Street provides an important connection
to Route 128/I-95 for communities to the west. Due to growth within these communities, and the
lack of other strong east-west connections to the interstate highway system in the area, High
Street has become oversaturated during peak commuting periods. While beyond the scope of
this traffic calming exercise, it should be noted that addressing this root congestion would be the
most effective means by which to reduce the desirability of the cut-through routes and calm
traffic within the subject neighborhoods. This however would require a substantial capital
investment to improve capacity along High Street and a long term engineering process.

It is worth noting that potential traffic calming measures which physically divert traffic will not
be considered applicable for use in this project. Restricting movements would likely divert
vehicles onto High Street, exacerbating an already congested condition, or creating impacts
within other neighborhoods. Therefore, this study will focus on the application of speed control
measures within these neighborhoods.

STUDY AREA
The main study area consists of the following sections of roadway and intersections. The study
area is also shown on Figure 1.

ROADWAY
High Rock Street ­ High Rock Street is classified by MassDOT as an urban collector and runs
east-west within the study area. The average daily traffic (ADT) along High Rock Street is
approximately 3,300 vehicles per day. The posted speed limit on the westbound approach is 30
mph. The approximate width is of High Rock Street is 22 feet and consists of one 9.5 feet travel
lane and 1.5 feet shoulder in each direction separated by a double yellow centerline (DYCL). A
bituminous concrete sidewalk exists along the southern section of High Rock Street from High
Street to Hartford Street. There are sight distance restrictions at the stop controlled approach to
Dover Road.

Dover Road ­ The limits of Dover Road included as part of this study are from its intersection
with High Rock Street and its intersection with High Street. Dover Road is classified by
MassDOT as an urban collector and runs north-south within the study area. The ADT along
Dover Road is approximately 3,050 vehicles per day. The posted speed limit in both the
northbound and southbound direction is 25 mph. The width of Dover Road is 22 feet and
consists of one 11 feet travel lane in each direction separated by a single solid yellow centerline.
There are no sidewalks along Dover Road in the study area. Utility poles, guardrail and fencing
abut a considerable amount of the edge of pavement along Dover Road.

Conant Road ­ Conant Road is classified as a local road by MassDOT and runs north-south from
Dover Road to Lynn Terrace and east-west from Lynn Terrace to High Street. The ADT along
Conant Road is approximately 2,050 vehicles per day. The posted speed limit on the northbound
approach is 30 mph. The width of Conant Road is 25 feet and consists of one travel lane in each
direction. There are no pavement markings or sidewalks along Conant Road in the study area.

Country Lane ­ Country Lane runs from Conant Road to Summer Street and is approximately 24
feet wide. There is no posted speed limit and there are no pavement markings or sidewalks in the
study area.

All study area roadways are under the jurisdiction of the Town of Westwood.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS
During field observations made in March of 2011, roadway and intersection geometric
configurations / physical features were recorded. These features include sight lines, pavement
markings, width of pavement, posted speeds, location of sidewalks, crosswalks and the general
nature of pavement condition and traffic operations. On-site observations were made during the
morning and afternoon commuting peak periods.

Queues were also observed during the morning and evening peak traffic periods. Notable queues2
consist of:

          16 vehicles along Conant Road eastbound at High Street during the morning peak period
          13 vehicles along Hartford Street eastbound at High Rock Street during the morning peak
          period
          7 vehicles along High Rock Street southbound at Hartford Street during the evening peak
          period
          Queues of 5 vehicles or less along all other approaches

The queues reported above represent classic standing queues. At other locations persistent rolling
queues were observed and present their own operational difficulties. A rolling queue is a platoon of
vehicles that never fully stops but are bunched together, traveling at a consistent low level speed.
The presence of these rolling queues is primarily due to the lack of opposing volume at intersections
within the study area.

During field observations, BETA also measured the travel time through the High Street corridor
between High Rock Street and Summer Street. These measurements were made in the
northbound direction during the morning peak period and the southbound direction during the
evening peak period to be consistent with the predominant traffic flows and cut-through activity.
Measured travel times were approximately 11 minutes and 4 minutes 32 seconds, during the
morning and evening peak periods respectively. BETA additionally measured the travel time of
the neighborhood cut-through during the morning peak period and in reverse during the evening
peak period. Travel times were 6 minutes and 3 minutes 50 seconds, respectively. A summary
of the travel time information is presented in Table 1 below.

                                     Table 1 Travel Time Summary
                                                     Dover Road
                             Route 109                                                    Time Difference
                                                    (cut-through)
         AM                    11:00                     6:00                                    5:00
         PM                     4:32                     3:50                                    0:42

As can be seen in Table 1 the time savings for a vehicle to use the cut-through during the
morning peak period is approximately 5 minutes and 42 seconds during the evening peak period.
The difference between time savings appears to be related to the location of the congestion on
High Street during the two time periods. In the morning the congestion builds in the northbound
direction, towards Rt 128/I-95. During this period vehicles are presented with the option of
utilizing the cut-through route at point relatively near the beginning point of the congestion on
High Street, giving the driver a significant incentive. During the evening peak period the
congestion builds back towards Rt 128/I-95 in the southbound direction. In this case drivers do
not have the option to utilize the cut-through route until a point much further along into the
congestion, thus lowering the incentive to do so. This point is reinforced by the observed traffic
volumes as presented subsequently in this memorandum.

Residents have noted that the use of the cut-through route during the evening period is enhanced
during the warmer weather months when pedestrian activity along High Street increases.

During the morning peak period, several school aged children and adults were observed in the
area of the Conant Road at Country Lane intersection and along Conant Road in the Lynn
Terrace area. There are currently no sidewalks or crosswalks in this area.

TRAFFIC DATA
To assess existing traffic conditions in the study area, peak hour turning movement counts
(TMC) were conducted on Tuesday, March 22nd, 2011 from 7:00-9:00AM and 4:00-6:00PM.
These periods represent the most critical traffic volume conditions. Concurrent with the TMCs,
automatic traffic recorder (ATR) counts were conducted along High Rock Street, Dover Road
and Conant Road, collecting weekday data over a 48-hour period. The ATR's collected
continuous traffic volume data, speed data and vehicle classification information at the following
locations:

       1. High Rock Street between #102 High Rock and the intersection of Westchester Road
       2. Dover Road between #267 and #195
       3. Conant Road between #223 and #175

A review of the data indicated that the weekday morning peak period occurred from 7:15 AM to
8:15 AM and the weekday evening peak period occurred 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM. Figure 1 provides
the 2011 existing weekday morning and evening peak hour traffic volumes. A summary of the
ATR data is presented in Table 2 and graphically also on Figure 1 below.

As can be seen in Table 3 the operational speeds along the subject roadways are generally 10
mph over the posted speed limit.

Finally, a tracking study was performed on March 22, 2011 during the peak periods to validate the
level of cut-through traffic. Vehicle tracking was conducted at the following locations:

1.   High Rock Street at Hartford Street
2.   Conant Road at High Street
3.   Dover Road at High Street
4.   Country Lane at Sunset Road

The results of the tracking study for each peak period are provided in Table 4 below and
graphically on Figure 2.

Based on the license plate study results during the morning and evening peak periods,
approximately 94% and 83% of vehicles travelling on High Rock Street are using the study
neighborhood as a cut-through, respectively. It should be noted that the volume utilizing the cut-
through is significantly higher during the morning peak period. In the morning approximately
60% of the traffic enters the cut-through route primarily as a left turn from Hartford Street, 25%
enters from High Street, the remain 15% diffuses into the cut-through route from the residential
roadways along High Rock Street between Hartford Street and Dover Road, presumably as
traffic from Hartford Street seek to avoid congestion along this road as it approaches High Rock
Street. As seen in Table 4 the majority (53%) of the cut-through traffic is destined towards
Country Lane and Sunset Road, presumably towards Summer Street from where it will re-access
High Street via the signalized intersection. About one third of the cut-through traffic chooses to
re-enter High Street via the unsignalized intersection at Conant Road. Only a minor portion
(9%) stays on Dover Road to re-enter High Street. In the evening the majority of traffic utilizing
the cut-through route enters from Summer Street via Country Lane or Sunset Road. About one
quarter enter via Dover Road. About two thirds of the traffic utilizing the cut-through in the
evening are destined for Hartford Street westbound, the other third re-enters High Street from
High Rock Road.

TYPICAL TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES
Commonly used traffic calming measures are described below. Advanced visual cues are
necessary to warn drivers of many of these measures.

         PAVEMENT MARKINGS
         Pavement Markings can be used as traffic calming measures that regulate traffic
         movements in lieu of physical changes to the roadway. The addition of striping a defined
         centerline and shoulder inherently have been shown to calm traffic. In certain
         applications, these measures may produce the same effect as the physical traffic calming
         measures. However, police enforcement is often required to ensure motorist compliance.

         CURB EXTENSIONS - BULB-OUTS, NECKDOWNS, CHOKERS, MID-BLOCK CROSSINGS
         These are physical devices placed in the roadway to create horizontal deflections by
         narrowing points along the roadway by expanding the curbing. Narrowing sections of the
         roadway is referred to as a choker or mid-clock crossing; narrowing at an intersection is
         referred to as a neckdown or bulb-out. These techniques can be used to narrow lanes and
         slow traffic. Curb extensions along a roadway force vehicles to slow while maneuvering
         the narrow points while curb extensions at an intersection lead to tighter turning radii,
         forcing vehicles to slow.

         These devices are appropriate for local roads with little heavy vehicle traffic.

         CHICANES
         Chicanes are S-shaped curve realignments of a normally straight roadway, which
         encourages slower speeds.

         CENTER ISLAND
         Center islands are usually raised islands (also called medians) within the roadway
         centerline. They usually narrow the travel lane at that location and separate opposing
         traffic movements. When landscaped, they can improve the aesthetics of the corridor.
         They are feasible without major roadway changes when the right-of-way is available
         within the existing pavement width. Center islands may also be painted, but these are less
         effective than raised center islands, since vehicles can traverse a painted island.

         GATEWAY
         Gateway features can be used to identify a change in the environment for vehicles
         entering the traffic calming management area. Monuments or other landscaping devices
         can be used to signify a change in the area type.

         MINI TRAFFIC CIRCLE
         Mini traffic circles are raised islands placed in intersections. Traffic circulates
         counterclockwise around these islands. They are especially good for calming
         intersections within neighborhoods where speeds, volumes, and safety are problems.
         Mini traffic circles usually have 4-way stop control.

         SPEED HUMPS AND TABLES
         Speed humps are asphalt or rubber mounds that cover the full width of the roadway.
         Speed tables are essentially speed humps that have been modified with a flat top. The flat
         top is typically long enough for the entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on and the
         ramps are sloped more gently for a more gradual slowing of vehicles than speed humps.
         The flat top allows a higher design speed and smoother ride than humps. Speed tables are
         more desirable to emergency vehicles.

         SPEED CUSHIONS/LUMPS
         Speed cushions/lumps are designed as three separate speed humps. They effectively slow
         vehicles down and allow wider axle emergency vehicles to pass without slowing them
         down.

         RAISED INTERSECTIONS/CROSSWALKS
         A raised intersection/crosswalk is a raised plateau, usually three to four inches above
         adjacent streets and are good for high-pedestrian areas.

         DYNAMIC SPEED DISPLAYS AND VEHICLE ACTUATED SIGNS
         Radar activated signs that dynamically display approaching speeds for individual vehicles
         or display messages such as "SLOW DOWN" or "REDUCE SPEED" when a vehicle
         exceeds a certain speed. They alert drivers that they are speeding and create a sense of
         being monitored. They can be portable or permanent.

It should also be noted that during inclement weather, particularly snowy conditions,
maintenance/plowing crews need to be mindful of vertical traffic calming device locations.
Vertical traffic calming devices such as speed humps, tables, cushions and unexpected curb
extensions need to be clearly identified with advanced warning signs and/or a reflectorized
object markers or plastic bollards at each location. Snow plows must reduce speed to a minimal
condition when plowing these vertical traffic calming devices.

Speed humps and cushions/lumps can be permanent (asphalt) or temporary (rubber). Rubber
devices have the benefit that they can be pulled up and moved without being destroyed. This can
be convenient for municipalities who may wish to store these devices during the winter months
to eliminate the potential of snow plow damage.

PRELIMINARY TRAFFIC CALMING PLAN
BETA's observations and data collection support the use of traffic calming measures to target the
reduction of vehicle speeds within the neighborhood. The recommendations presented below are
approaches that BETA believes will successfully address the issues identified in this needs
assessment. This preliminary traffic calming plan is intended to foster discussion amongst all
stakeholders. It will likely be refined as the traffic calming process progresses to address
specific needs. Figure 3 presents the types of proposed traffic calming devices and their
associated locations under this preliminary plan. Note that to achieve effective speed control
vertical devices should be spaces approximately 400 feet apart.

LOCATIONS
High Rock Street
      Repaint double yellow centerline (DYCL) and shoulder pavement markings along the
      length of the road.
      Install a vertical speed control device in the vicinity of the midway point on High Rock
      Street between High Street and Hartford Street.
      Install a gateway along High Rock Street just north of Hartford Street
      Install a vertical speed control device approximately 400 feet north of Hartford Street
      Install dynamic speed limit signs in the area of 169 High Rock Street
      Add curb-extensions at the intersection with Westchester Drive
      Add curb-extensions at the intersection with Salisbury Drive

High Rock Street at Dover Road
      Safety improvements should be made to address awkward geometry and sight distance
      restrictions. Vegetation should be trimmed. Re-stripe stop bar and repair existing stop
      sign. Consideration should be given to installing a flashing beacon at this location.

Dover Road
      Paint double yellow centerline (DYCL) and shoulder pavement markings along the
      length of the road within the study area. Travel way width should be restricted.
      Install a vertical speed control device approximately 400 feet east of High Rock Street.
      Install dynamic speed limit signs approximately 800 feet east of High Rock Street
      Install a vertical speed control device approximately 800 feet west of Carby Street.
      Install a vertical speed control device approximately 400 feet west of Carby Street.
      Create a raised intersection at the intersection with Carby Street.
      Install a vertical speed control device approximately 400 feet south of Conant Road.

Dover Road at Conant Road
      Add curb extensions at the intersection.
      Add a median island to the Conant Road approach to reduce pavement width.

Conant Road
      Paint double yellow centerline (DYCL) and shoulder pavement markings along the

   SUBJECT:   Adopt National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Document in
              Support of a Categorical Exclusion for Development of the Corona
              Transit Center; Authorize Staff to Submit NEPA Documentation to
              the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for Approval

   Summary:   At its December 20, 2007, meeting, the Board adopted a Mitigated
              Negative Declaration environmental document in accordance with
              the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines for
              development of the Corona Transit Center. The proposed transit
              center location is 31 E. Grand Blvd., Corona, CA. The City of
              Corona reviewed the environmental impacts of this project and
              established that the project would not have a significant impact on
              the environment and supported the Agency's adoption of a
              Negative Declaration at its April 2, 2008, City Council meeting.

              Because the project is funded, in part, with federal capital
              assistance, the project must also comply with the National
              Environmental Policy Act guidelines. The environmental
              documentation supports a determination that the project would
              qualify for a Categorical Exclusion pursuant to either 23 CFR Part
              771.117(a) or 23 CFR 771(d)(4) and (10). Preliminary evaluation of
              the proposed project suggests that it fall under the type of project
              identified in Section 771.117(d)(10). CEs include actions that do not
              individually or cumulatively have significant adverse social,
              economic, or environmental effects and are excluded from the
              requirement to prepare an Environment Assessment (EA) or
              Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). A copy of the National
              Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Document can be obtained from
              the clerk of the board or at the Agency's website.

   Fiscal Impact:

                Once the FTA has determined that a CE is appropriate for this
                project, it may act on the Agency's application for financial
                assistance.

   Recommendation:

                Approve and recommend this item to the full Board of Directors for
                their consideration as follows:

                ·   Adopt National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Document in
                    support of a Categorical Exclusion for development of the
                    Corona Transit Center located at 31 E. Grand Blvd., Corona,
                    CA.

                ·   Authorize staff to submit NEPA documentation to the Federal
                    Transit Administration for approval.

PROJECT INFORMATION

Project: Corona Bus Transit Center.

Project Location: A 2-½ acre site at 31 East Grand Boulevard (at the Northeast corner of Main Street and
Grand Boulevard), in the City of Corona, County of Riverside, California. The site is one block north of State
Route 91 and 1½ miles west of Interstate 15, and immediately south of the Corona Metrolink Station. The
Assessor's Parcel Number (APN) is 119-320-50-1.

Project Proponent: Riverside Transit Agency (RTA), 1825 Third Street, Riverside, CA 92517; Vince
Rouzaud, Director, Purchasing and Materials, (909) 565-5180.

Project Description: The RTA proposes to develop a bus transit center with an 8-bay bus plaza, driver
restroom, and approximately 26-stall parking lot. The transit center would be a common destination for all
bus routes serving western Riverside County, and a transfer point for passengers on all routes. The location
of the transit center would be directly south of the Metrolink Station in the center of Corona, thus giving
intracity train commuters nearby access to the RTA bus system and vice versa.
In RTA's tentative design for the transit center, the parking lot would occupy the eastern portion of the
property and the bus loading platforms would be in the western portion. Buses would enter/exit the facility
from/to Grand Boulevard via a driveway at the eastern corner of the property. Passenger vehicles would enter
the parking lot, also from Grand Boulevard, via a second driveway in the middle of the property and exit via
the transit vehicle driveway; the passenger vehicle entrance driveway would be opposite to the entrance to the
Caltrans park-and-ride lot across Grand Boulevard.

EXISTING CONDITIONS

The City of Corona lies on a river plain, framed by mountains and constrained by the Cleveland National
Forest to the south and the heavily vegetated Prado Basin to the northwest. The San Bernardino Mountains
are about 17 miles north of the City; the Chino Hills are about 8 miles west; and the Santa Ana Mountains are
about 8 miles south; and there are low hills to the east. The region, like most of southern California, has a
Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild winters and hot, dry summers.
The project site is in an urbanized, mostly industrial/commercial area, with an established residential area
immediately south (across Grand Boulevard). The site is approximately 610 feet above mean sea level, and
has slopes of 2 to 8 percent. In the western portion, the eastern and southern edges of the site are banked
because both Main Street and (in the western portion of the site) Grand Boulevard are above the site grade
level.
Two commuter facilities are adjacent to the site: the North Main Corona Metrolink Station on the north, and a
park-and-ride lot on the south (across Grand Boulevard), which is operated by the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans). Local access to the project site is from Grand Boulevard (on the southern border)
and regional access is from I-15 and SR-91. This property is currently vacant; the western portion was
formerly used as a recycling center and had portable and/or temporary facilities. The zoning, designated land
use, and existing land uses of the project site and its surrounding properties are as follows:

SUMMARY OF IMPACTS

In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines and the CEQA
Environmental Checklist Form (Appendix G of the Guidelines), the Initial Study (IS) evaluated 16 categories
of potential environmental impacts of the proposed project, with the following results:
Potentially Significant Impacts: No significant project impacts were found that cannot be mitigated to less
than significant. In addition, the discussion in Section 3-SVII (Mandatory Findings of Significance) of the IS
concludes that the project would have no unmitigable significant impacts.
Less-Than-Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated: One or more mitigable significant project
impacts were found for the following three categories of environmental impacts: cultural resources, geology
and soils, and noise. These mitigation measures are specified in the next section of this MND (Mitigation
Measures).
Less-Than-Significant Impacts: One or more less-than-significant project impacts were found for seven
categories of impacts: aesthetics, air quality, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality,
public services, transportation and traffic, and utilities and service systems.
No Impact: No project impacts were found for six other categories of impacts: agricultural resources,
biological resources, land use and planning, mineral resources, population and housing, and recreation.
Conclusion: In conclusion, although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
there would not be a significant effect in this case because revisions to the project have been made by or
agreed to (as mitigation) by RTA. A Mitigated Negative Declaration will be prepared in accordance with
CEQA.

MITIGATION MEASURES

Mitigation Measures
For all project impacts that are less than significant with mitigation incorporated, revisions have been made to
the project to mitigate the impacts. These mitigation measures are specified for certain potentially significant
impacts on cultural resources, geology and soils, and noise. The project revisions are specified in the related
technical sections of Section 3.5 (Environmental Checklist Form) of the IS, and are presented as a group in
Table MND-1 (Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program), below.

Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
A Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) has been prepared pursuant to Public Resources
Code Section 21081.6, which requires adoption of a reporting or monitoring program for projects in which the
Lead Agency has incorporated mitigation measures in the project to avoid significant environmental effects.
The RTA, as Lead Agency, is responsible for implementation of the MMRP. Before final approval of the
proposed project, RTA decision-makers must define specific reporting monitoring and reporting procedures
and how they will be enforced during project construction and operation, as appropriate.
Table MND-1 lists:
     The potentially significant environmental impacts (categorized by type of environmental impact);
     The required mitigation measure for each potentially significant impact;
     The phase of the project (preconstruction, construction, before occupancy, and after occupancy)
     during which the measure must be monitored;
     The agency responsible for enforcing the mitigation measure; and
     The agency responsible for monitoring implementation and operation of the mitigation measure.

AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS

The IS is being published collaterally (i.e., in the same volume) with, and immediately following, this MND.

The IS/MND is available for public review at the RTA office at 1825 West Third Street, Riverside, CA

SUMMARY

S.1      PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Site. The project site is 2.1 acres of property located at 31 East Grand Boulevard in the City of
Corona, immediately northeast of the intersection of Grand Boulevard and Main Street. The Riverside Transit
Agency (RTA) is currently in the process of acquiring the property. The site is one block north of the
Riverside Freeway (State Route [SR-] 91) and approximately 1½ miles west of Interstate (I-) 15. Two
existing transportation facilities for commuters are adjacent to the site: the North Main Corona Metrolink
Station (250 East Blaine Street) on the north, and a park-and-ride lot on the south (across Grand Boulevard),
which is operated by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Local access to the project site
is from Grand Boulevard (on the southern border) and regional access is from I-15 and SR-91. This property
is currently vacant; the western portion was formerly used as a recycling center and had portable and/or
temporary facilities.
Proposed Project. The RTA proposes to develop the site as a bus transit center, with a 8-bay bus plaza, a
driver restroom, and approximately 26-stall parking lot. The transit center would be a common destination
for all bus routes serving western Riverside County, and a transfer point for passengers on all routes. The
location of the transit center would be adjacent to the Metrolink Station in the center of Corona, thus giving
intracity train commuters immediate access to the RTA bus system and vice versa. To access Metrolink
trains, RTA patrons would walk on the sidewalks of the adjacent city streets (Grand Boulevard, Main Street,
and Blaine Street). A pedestrian bridge staircase and elevator tower is intended to be constructed from just
east of the bus loading area, extend across the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) freight rail track and
connect to the existing Metrolink Passenger bridge, to give transit patrons more convenient passage between
the two modes of travel.
In RTA's preliminary design for the center, the parking lot would occupy the eastern portion of the property
and the bus loading platforms would be in the western portion. Buses would enter/exit the facility from/to
Grand Boulevard via a driveway at the eastern corner of the property. Passenger vehicles would enter the
parking lot, also from Grand Boulevard, via a second driveway in the middle of the property; this driveway
would be opposite the entrance to the Caltrans park-and-ride lot across Grand Boulevard. Passenger vehicles
would leave the parking lot via the transit vehicle driveway.
Project Objectives. RTA is proposing this project to meet the following objectives:
       Link public transportation modes (automobiles, transit [bus], rail [Metrolink], bicycle, and
       pedestrian);
       Provide regular and express service between transit centers and major destinations;
       Coordinate bus transfers and synchronize route schedules for passenger convenience;
       Reduce vehicle and pedestrian congestion around major business activity centers;
       Provide a central information area for passengers, including route maps and schedules;
       Provide passenger amenities (such as covered waiting areas, benches, and vending machines);
       Provide persons with disabilities access to the transit system; and
       Provide an attractive, convenient, comfortable, and safe waiting and transfer area so passengers do
       not have to cross streets to board buses.

S.2       PROJECT IMPACTS

This Initial Study evaluated 16 categories of potential environmental impacts of the proposed project, as
required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)5 and in accordance with the CEQA
Environmental Checklist Form.6 The results of the evaluation are described in Section 3.4 (Environmental
Checklist Form) and summarized as follows:
       Potentially Significant Impacts: No significant project impacts were found that cannot be
       mitigated to less than significant.
       Less-Than-Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated: One or more mitigable significant
       project impacts were found for the following three categories of environmental impacts: cultural
       resources, geology and soils, and noise; see Section S.3 (Mitigation Measures).
       Less-Than-Significant Impacts: One or more less-than-significant project impacts were found for
       seven categories of impacts: aesthetics, air quality, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology
       and water quality, public services, transportation and traffic and utilities and service systems.
       No Impact: No project impacts were found for six other categories of impacts: agricultural
       resources, biological resources, land use and planning, mineral resources, population and
       housing, and recreation.
In addition, the discussion in Section 3-SVII (Mandatory Findings of Significance) concludes that the project
would have no unmitigable significant impacts.
Conclusion. In conclusion, although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment,
there would not be a significant effect in this case because revisions to the project have been made by or
agreed to (as mitigation) by RTA. A Mitigated Negative Declaration will be prepared in accordance with
CEQA.

1         INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to Section 21065(a)(b) of the Public Resources Code (PRC), the acquisition and improvement of an
approximately 2.1-acre vacant lot, in the City of Corona, constitutes a project requiring compliance with the
provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), codified as PRC '21000 et seq. This Initial
Study (IS) has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines for
Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act, codified in the California Code of Regulations
(CCR), Title 14, Chapter 3, '15000 et seq. (State CEQA Guidelines), for the purpose of analyzing the direct,
indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the proposed project.

1.1       PROJECT OVERVIEW

The project site is 2.1 acres of property located at 31 East Grand Boulevard in the City of Corona, in the
County of Riverside, California. The property is immediately northeast of the intersection of Grand
Boulevard and Main Street. Two existing transportation facilities are adjacent to the site: the North Main
Corona Metrolink Station (250 East Blaine Street) on the north, and the Metrolink park-and-ride log on the
south (across Grand Boulevard). This property is currently vacant, and the western portion was formerly used
as a recycling collection center.
The Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) proposes to develop the site as a bus transit center with an 8-bay bus
plaza, driver restroom, and an approximately 26-stall parking lot. RTA provides both local and regional
services in western Riverside County, with 38 fixed-route, 5 CommuterLink routes, and demand-responsive
(Dial-A-Ride) services. Its service area spans more than 2,500 square miles and includes approximately one
million residents. To meet future regional transit needs, RTA plans to increase bus service, add new local and
regional commuter routes, and develop a Bus Rapid Transit project.

1.2       PURPOSE AND LEGAL AUTHORITY

1.2.1     Purpose
Section 15063(a) of the State CEQA Guidelines requires that the Lead Agency shall conduct an Initial Study
to determine if the project may have a significant effect on the environment." Before initiating any action
subject to CEQA, the Lead Agency is required to undertake a formal environmental evaluation of the
proposed action. In accordance with '15063(c) of the State CEQA Guidelines, the purposes of an IS are to:
      (1) Provide the Lead Agency with information to use as the basis for deciding whether to
          prepare an EIR, ND, or MND;
      (2) Enable an applicant or Lead Agency to modify a project, mitigating adverse impacts before
          an EIR is prepared thereby enabling the project to qualify for a ND or a MND;
      (3) Assist in the preparation of an EIR, if one is required, by focusing the EIR on the effects

          will not have a significant effect on the environment;
      (6) Eliminate unnecessary EIRs; and
      (7) Determine whether a previously prepared EIR could be used with the project.

1.2.2     Legal Authority
The RTA, acting in its capacity as Lead Agency, is required to prepare an IS to determine whether the
proposed project will have a significant environmental impact. If the IS finds that there is evidence that any
aspect of the project, either individually or cumulatively, may cause a significant environmental effect, the
Lead Agency will further find that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is warranted to analyze
environmental impacts. However, if the IS finds that there is no evidence that the project, either as proposed
or as modified to include the mitigation measures identified in the IS, may cause a significant effect on the
environment, the Lead Agency will find that the proposed project will not have a significant effect on the
environment and will prepare an ND or MND.
This document presents the results of the environmental analysis required under Section 15063 of the State
CEQA Guidelines. This analysis supports the finding that, on the basis of information presented herein, the
development of the proposed project, as described below, will not result in any significant effects on the
environment, and an MND will be prepared.

1.3       STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS

Section 15063(d) of the State CEQA Guidelines identifies specific disclosure requirements for inclusion in an
IS. Pursuant to those requirements, an IS includes the following:
      (1) Description of the project, including the location of the project;
      (2) An identification of the environmental setting;
      (3) An identification of environmental effects by use of a checklist, matrix, or other method,
          provided that entries on a checklist or other form are briefly explained to indicate that there
          is some evidence to support the entries;
      (4) Discussion of ways to mitigate the significant effects identified, if any;
      (5) An examination of whether the project would be consistent with existing zoning, plans and
          other applicable land use controls; and
      (6) The name of the person or persons who prepared or participated in the preparation of the IS.

2         PROJECT DESCRIPTION

2.1       BACKGROUND

The Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) currently operates transit services for a 2,500-square mile service area
in western Riverside County. Directly operated services are in the core area of Riverside, Moreno Valley,
Perris, Corona, and adjacent areas, and contracted services are provided to outlying areas. RTA has 38 fixed-
route services, five CommuterLink routes, and dial-a-ride services using 231 vehicles.7 All RTA buses use
compressed natural gas (CNG), which is a cleaner-burning fuel and has fewer air pollutant emissions than
does diesel-fuel. Most RTA operations are conducted from its headquarters in the City of Riverside (at 1825
Third Street), which houses administration, operations, and maintenance activities.
RTA proposes to design and construct a bus transit center in Corona to serve the diverse travel patterns of its
patrons. The transit center would be a common destination for all bus routes serving western Riverside
County, and a transfer point for passengers on all routes. The location of the transit center would be adjacent
to the Metrolink Station in the center of Corona, thus giving intracity train commuters immediate access to the
RTA bus system and vice versa. The transit center would have an 8-bay bus plaza, driver restroom, and an
approximately 26-stall parking lot.

2.2       PROJECT OBJECTIVES
RTA is proposing this project to meet the following objectives:
       Link public transportation modes (automobiles, transit [bus], rail [Metrolink], bicycle, and
       pedestrian);
       Provide regular and express service between transit centers and major destinations;
       Coordinate bus transfers and synchronize route schedules for passenger convenience;
       Reduce vehicle and pedestrian congestion around major business activity centers;
       Provide a central information area for passengers, including route maps and schedules;
       Provide passenger amenities (such as covered waiting areas, seating and vending machines;
       Provide persons with disabilities access to the transit system; and
       Provide an attractive, convenient, comfortable, and safe waiting and transfer area so
       passengers do not have to cross streets to board buses.

2.3       PROJECT LOCATION

The proposed project is in the City of Corona (City), which is immediately southwest of the City of Riverside
in western Riverside County, California. The site is in Section 25 of Township 3 South, Range 7 West, and is
on the Corona North, CA, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map of the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Two major freeways intersect in the City: the north-south Interstate 15 (I-15) and the east-west State Route
91 (SR 91). In addition, a rail line crosses the City that is used by Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF)
Railway for freight traffic and by Metrolink, a commuter train. See Figure 2-1 (Regional Vicinity Map).

The site of the proposed project is Assessor's Parcel Number (APN) 119-320-50-1,8 a 2.1-acre vacant lot at 31
East Grand Boulevard, immediately northeast of the intersection of Grand Boulevard and Main Street. The
site is one block north of the Riverside Freeway (State Route [SR-] 91) and approximately 1½ miles west of
Interstate (I-) 15. The western portion of the site is bounded by Main Street, a major arterial that connects the
site with the downtown area to the south. The North Main Corona Metrolink Station is immediately north of
the site, at 250 East Blaine Street. Local access to the project site is from Grand Boulevard (on the southern
border) and regional access is from I-15 and SR-91. The site is in the southeastern corner of the North Main
Street District Specific Plan (SP-99-1) (also known as the North Main Opportunity District),9 and is just
outside the northern perimeter of Corona's Downtown Revitalization Area.10 See Figures 2-2 (Project Area
Aerial Photograph).

2.4       ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Regional. Corona lies on a river plain, framed by mountains and constrained by the Cleveland National
Forest to the south and the heavily vegetated Prado Basin to the northwest. The San Bernardino Mountains
are about 17 miles north of the City; the Chino Hills are about 8 miles west; and the Santa Ana Mountains are
about 8 miles south; and there are low hills to the east. The region, like most of southern California, has a
Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild winters and hot, dry summers.
Project Site. The site is approximately 610 feet above mean sea level, and has slopes of 2 to 8 percent. In the
western portion, the eastern and southern edges of the site are banked because both Main Street and (in the
western portion of the site) Grand Boulevard are above the site grade level. The site soils are Garretson
gravelly very fine sandy loam on an alluvial fan and are well drained. The nearest water is Temescal Wash
(about ½ mile northwest). The nearest wells are more than 1/8 mile south of the site, and the groundwater at
these wells is more than 75 feet below ground surface and flows to the northwest.
See Figures 2-3a and 2-3b (Site Photographs).

2.5       PROJECT COMPONENTS

RTA plans to construct a bus transit center comprising an 8-bay bus plaza, driver restroom and an
approximately 26-stall paved parking lot. The facility would accommodate passengers only, and would not
provide any bus maintenance, washing, or refueling.
In RTA's tentative design for the transit center, the parking lot would occupy the eastern portion of the
property and the bus loading platforms would be in the western portion. Buses would enter/exit the facility
from/to Grand Boulevard via a driveway at the eastern corner of the property. Passenger vehicles would enter
the parking lot, also from Grand Boulevard, via a second driveway in the middle of the property; this
driveway would be opposite the entrance to the Caltrans park-and-ride lot across Grand Boulevard.
A pedestrian bridge extension with staircase and elevator will be constructed just east of the bus plaza
between the center and the Metrolink Station (and will connect with the existing Metrolink bridge crossing
over the BNSF freight rail track) to give transit patrons more convenient passage between the two modes of
travel. If the pedestrian passageway is not built, bus patrons would access the Metrolink Station by walking
west along Grand Boulevard, then north along Main Street and east along Blaine Street, as currently is the

3.3     ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION

On the basis of this initial evaluation:

I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and a             
NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.


I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there will
not be a significant effect in this case because revisions to the project have been made by or agreed to   ;
by the applicant. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.


I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required.                                                                   

I find that the proposed project MAY have a "potentially significant impact" or "potentially
significant unless mitigated" on the environment, but at least one effect 1) has been adequately
analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and 2) has been addressed by
mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis as described on attached sheets. An                      
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required, but it must analyze only the effects that remain
to be addressed.


I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, because
all potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earlier EIR pursuant to
applicable standards, and (b) have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR, including       
revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed upon the project, nothing further is required.

3.4     EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS:

1.       A brief explanation is required for all answers except "No Impact" answers that are adequately
supported by the information sources a lead agency cites in the parentheses following each question. A "No
Impact" answer is adequately supported if the referenced information sources show that the impact simply
does not apply to projects like the one involved (e.g., the project falls outside a fault rupture zone). A "No
Impact" answer should be explained where it is based on project-specific factors as well as general standards
(e.g., the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants, based on a project-specific screening
analysis).
2.     All answers must take account of the whole action involved, including offsite as well as onsite,
cumulative as well as project-level, indirect as well as direct, and construction as well as operational impacts.
3.       Once the lead agency has determined that a particular physical impact may occur, then the checklist
answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant, less than significant with mitigation, or
less than significant. "Potentially Significant Impact" is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that an
effect may be significant. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impact" entries when the
determination is made, an EIR is required.
4.      "Negative Declaration: Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated" applies where the
incorporation of mitigation measures has reduced an effect from "Potentially Significant Impact" to a "Less-
Than-Significant Impact". The lead agency must describe the mitigation measures, and briefly explain how
they reduce the effect to a less than significant level (mitigation measures from Section XVII, "Earlier
Analyses," may be cross-referenced).
5.       Earlier analyses may be used, where pursuant to the tiering, program EIR, or other CEQA process, an
effect has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration. Section 15063(c)(3)(D). In this
case, a brief discussion should identify the following:
a)      Earlier Analysis Used. Identify and state where they are available for review.
b)      Impacts Adequately Addressed. Identify which effects from the above checklist were within the
scope of and adequately analyzed in the earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards and state
whether such effects were addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis.
c)     Mitigation Measures. For effects that are "Less than Significant with Mitigation Measures
Incorporated," describe the mitigation measures, which were incorporated or refined from the earlier
document and the extent to which they address site-specific conditions for the project.
6.      Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information sources for
potential impacts (e.g., general plans, zoning ordinances). Reference to a previously prepared or outside
document should, where appropriate, include a reference to the page or pages where the statement is
substantiated.
7.      Supporting Information Sources: A source list should be attached, and other sources used or
individuals contacted should be cited in the discussion.
8.      This is only a suggested form, and lead agencies are free to use different formats; however, lead
agencies should normally address the questions from this checklist that are relevant to a project's
environmental effects in whatever format is selected.
9.       The explanation of each issue should identify: the significance criteria or threshold, if any, used to
evaluate each question; and the mitigation measure identified, if any, to reduce the level of impact to less than
significant.

I. AESTHETICS--Would the project:

a. Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?                                                     ;          
b. Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not
limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a                                       ;          
state scenic highway?

c. Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality
of the site and its surroundings?
                                                                                                            ;          
d. Create a new source of substantial light or glare, which would
adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area?
                                                                                                            ;          

II. AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES--In determining whether
impacts to agricultural resources are significant environmental
effects, lead agencies may refer to the California Agricultural
Land Evaluation and Site Assessment Model (1997) prepared by
the California Department of Conservation as an optional model
to use in assessing impacts on agricultural farmland. Would the
project:

a. Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of
Statewide Importance (Farmland), as shown on the maps
prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring                                                               ;
Program of the California Resources Agency, to non-agricultural
use?

b. Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a
Williamson Act contract?
                                                                                                                       ;
c. Involve other changes in the existing environment, which, due
to their location or nature, could individually or cumulatively result                                                 ;
in loss of Farmland, to non-agricultural use?


III. AIR QUALITY--Where available, the significance criteria
established by the applicable air quality management or pollution
control district may be relied upon to make the following
determinations. Would the project:

a. Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air
quality plan?
                                                                                                            ;          
b. Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to
an existing or projected air quality violation?
                                                                                                            ;

IV. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES--Would the project:

a. Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through
habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate,
sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans,                                                  ;
policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish

or probable impacts of other activities through direct removal,
filling, hydrological interruption, or other means?

d. Interfere substantially with the movement of any resident or
migratory fish or wildlife species or with established resident or
migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of wildlife nursery
                                                                                                                  ;

XVII. MANDATORY FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE

a. Does the project have the potential to degrade the quality of
the environment, substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or
wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below
self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal                                                   ;
community, reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or
endangered plant or animal, or eliminate important examples of
the major periods of California history or prehistory?

b. Does the project have impacts that are individually limited, but
cumulatively considerable? ("Cumulatively considerable" means
that the incremental effects of a project are considerable when
viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, effects of
                                                                                       ;

3.6       ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION
The following analysis contains the supportive information used by RTA, in its role as Lead Agency, to
derive the preliminary environmental impact conclusions on the CEQA Environmental Checklist Form
(Section 3.1).
The proposed project was evaluated for each of the sixteen topical environmental issues on the checklist, and
each potential type of impact (including both direct and indirect impacts) was categorized by its estimated
severity as one of the following:
       Potentially Significant Impact;
       Less-Than-Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated (specified mitigation measures would
       reduce the impact to below a level of significance);
       Less-Than-Significant Impact (the potential impact would be below the significance threshold); or
       No Impact.
In addition, the seventeenth item on the checklist, "Mandatory Findings of Significance," addresses potential
impacts on the environmental in general, habitat for and populations of fish and wildlife, plant communities,
sensitive species, and historic and prehistoric resources; cumulative impacts, short-term vs. long-term
environmental goals; and adverse effects on humans.
The following evaluation provides substantive information related to the environmental topical issues on the
Environmental Checklist. This section is organized similarly to the Checklist, i.e., the same impact categories
and enumeration is used as in the Checklist.

I.        AESTHETICS--Would the project:
(a)       Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The predominant scenic vistas from the project site are those of the
mountains and hills surrounding the river valley in which the City lies. At project build-out, the project
would aesthetically change the existing site conditions by constructing a bus center on currently vacant
property. The transit center includes an 8-bay bus plaza, driver restroom, and an approximately 26-stall
parking lot. The nearest sensitive viewers are residents who live immediately south and southeast of the
project site, across Grand Boulevard. These viewers are at least 100 feet away; the transit center structures
would be low on their view horizon, and their views of the mountains would not be adversely affected.
(b)     Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings,
and historic buildings within a state scenic highway?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project site is in a mostly developed urban area, and has been
substantially disturbed by paving and various commercial and industrial operations; there are no significant
scenic resources on the project site. There are no State-designated (or eligible State-designated) scenic
highways in or near the City of Corona.11
The City has designated several of its roadways as providing scenic vistas. Of these roadways, only three are
in the vicinity of the project site: Grand Boulevard, Main Street (from Third Street south), and the
interchange of Interstate 15 (I-15) with State Route (SR) 91. The site is not visible from Main Street's scenic
segment. The scenic vista from the I-15/SR 91 interchange is of the mountains, and the proposed transit

 INITIAL STUDY                                                                    3--Environmental Analysis 




center would appear too low on the horizon to detract from the view. Although the site is on scenic Grand
Boulevard, developing it as a bus transit center with parking would not significantly affect the views from this
roadway, because the surrounding area already has similar land uses and facilities (such as the Metrolink
park-and-ride lot on the southern side of Grand Boulevard across from the site).
Therefore, there would be no significant impact on scenic resources.
(c)        Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project site is located in a mixed-use urban area, and the surrounding
land uses are light industrial, general commercial, residential, and transportation-related (the Metrolink
Station and parking lots). The proposed project would, therefore, be in character with the surrounding
neighborhood, and the general visual character of the site and surrounding area would not be significantly
impacted.
There are tall palm trees approximately every 60 feet along the northern side of Grand Boulevard, which
abuts the southern boundary of the site. These palms are protected by the South Corona Palm Tree Policy,
which requires that they be relocated if they cannot be protected in place.12 To avoid relocation of any palm,
the project driveways would need to be no wider than 44 feet and located between palms. If the project
driveways cannot be so sized and located, the project would relocate the affected palm(s) to a vacant palm
planting location on Grand Boulevard. This potential impact is less than significant.
(d)     Create a new source of substantial light or glare, which would adversely affect day or nighttime
views in the area?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project would include the installation of new lighting for site and
passenger security during nighttime. However, the site is surrounded by industrial, commercial, and other
transit-related uses. The nearest residential area is immediately southeast, across the intersection of Grand
Boulevard and Victoria Avenue, and one home is immediately south, at the northeastern corner of this
intersection.
Because Grand Boulevard is well lit, the additional light from the transit center facility would not be a
noticeable change to sensitive viewers, and they would not be adversely affected. In addition, as part of the
project design, lighting would be oriented downward and inward (towards the parking lot and transit center)
and would be shielded to minimize light spill onto adjacent property. As part of the City's project review
process, the proposed lighting plan would not be approved unless it complies with City requirements.
Glare can be caused by reflections from building surfaces, pavement, and vehicles. It is not expected that the
bus transit center would be composed of highly reflective or polished surfaces that would reflect glare more
than do the surrounding uses.
Therefore, no significant impacts related to light or glare would result.

II.        AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
 (a)   Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance
(Farmland), as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring
Program of the California Resources Agency, to non-agricultural use?
No Impact. There is no existing Prime Farmland or agricultural resources onsite (General Plan Map, 1994).
According to the Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessments (July 2002), there is no historical record of any
agricultural use of the site. Therefore, no impacts on agricultural resources are anticipated.

(b)     Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a Williamson Act contract?
No Impact. The project site is zoned for Mixed Use: Commercial and Residential, and is not subject to a
Williamson Act contract. Therefore, the proposed uses would not conflict with either zoning for agricultural
use or a Williamson Act contract and no project impact would result.
(c)      Involve other changes in the existing environment, which, due to their location or nature, could
result in conversion of Farmland, to non-agricultural use?
No Impact. There is no farmland on or near the project site. Therefore, the proposed project would not
involve changes to the existing environment which could result in the conversion of farmland to a non-
agricultural use and no project impact would result.

III.    AIR QUALITY
The project is located in the city of Corona within the eastern portion of the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB).
Within the SCAB, air quality management is under the jurisdiction of the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD).
The SCAQMD is responsible for preparing a regional Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) to improve air
quality in the SCAB. The AQMP includes a variety of strategies to accommodate growth, to reduce the high
levels of pollutants within the region, to meet State and federal air quality performance standards, and to
minimize the fiscal impact that pollution control measures have on the local economy.
SCAQMD adopted its CEQA Air Quality Handbook in 1993 to assist other public agencies with the
preparation of air quality analyses. The SCAQMD-established thresholds for construction and operation
emissions are used to evaluate impacts on regional air quality.
The following acronyms for criteria air pollutants are used in this section:
        CO:      Carbon monoxide
        NOx:     Nitrogen oxides
        O3:      Ozone
        PM10:    Respirable particulate matter up to 10 micrometers in diameter
        VOC:     Volatile Organic Compounds

Since sulfur dioxide and lead are not of concern for a transportation project, they are not discussed in the air
quality analysis.
Impact Thresholds
Air quality impacts are typically divided into two categories: short-term impacts and long-term impacts.
Short-term impacts are associated with construction activities, such as site grading, excavation, structural
construction, paving, and finishing of the proposed project. Long-term impacts are associated with the
operation of the proposed project upon its occupancy. Table 3-1 (SCAQMD Significance Thresholds)
presents the emission significance thresholds for criteria pollutants. A project is considered to generate a
regional air quality impact if emissions from its construction and/or operational activities exceed the
corresponding SCAQMD significance thresholds.

Greenhouse Gases
Finally, although greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are of increasing concern, the proposed project will have
no effect upon them. The proposed project would construct a bus transit center, which would reduce
passenger vehicle miles traveled and associated emissions (including GHGs) by providing an alternative
method of transportation. Therefore, GHGs is not discussed in the air quality analysis.
Would the project:
(a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The applicable air quality plan for the project area is the 2007 AQMP,
which was adopted by the SCAQMD Governing Board on June 1, 2007. In order to develop strategies to
meet federal and State air quality standards, the AQMP incorporates land use assumptions from local general
plans and regional growth projections developed by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) to estimate stationary and mobile air emissions associated with projected population and planned
land uses. That is, if the proposed land use is consistent with the local general plan, then the impact of the
project is presumed to have been accounted for in the AQMP. Another measurement tool in determining
consistency with the AQMP is to determine how a project accommodates the expected increase in population
or employment. Generally, if a project is planned in a way that minimizes vehicle miles traveled (VMT) both
within the project vicinity and the surrounding area, and consequently minimizes air pollutant emissions, that
aspect of the project is consistent with the AQMP.
The proposed project would construct a bus transit center, which would reduce VMT by providing an
alternative method of transportation. The resulting reduction in the number of vehicle trips and miles traveled
would in turn, reduces vehicle emissions. Furthermore, the project would not generate population and
employment growth; it would be neither a source of new housing nor a significant source of new jobs.
Therefore, the project would be consistent with the AQMP and would result in a less-than-significant impact.
(b)     Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air
quality violation?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. Project emissions were calculated using the URBEMIS 2007, an emissions
model approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). URBEMIS is a computer program that can
be used to estimate emissions associated with land development projects in California. The model
incorporates EMFAC 2007 emission factors and Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation
rates to estimate on-road vehicle emissions; and emission factors and assumptions from CARB OFFROAD
model to estimate off-road vehicle emissions. Modeling output files are attached in Appendix A.
Short-Term (Construction) Impacts.
Construction of the proposed project would generate temporary, short-term emissions of various air

emissions during construction would principally consist of exhaust emissions from off-road heavy-duty diesel
and gasoline powered construction equipment and fugitive particulate matter from earthwork and material
handling operations. Off-site exhaust emissions would result from trucks hauling of construction debris, and
workers commuting to and from the project site.
The proposed project would include construction of an 8-bay bus transit center and paved parking spaces for
passenger vehicles. The project construction activities would include site preparation and grading, structural
construction, paving, and finishing and cleanup. Since detailed construction design information was not
available at the time this document was prepared, the estimated construction phasing was based on the
approximate project schedule provided by the project applicant. For modeling purposes it is assumed that:
     Construction of the project would take about six months to complete;
     A maximum total of five pieces of construction equipment would be operating
     simultaneously per day; and
     One haul truck roundtrips per day would be needed to deliver construction material or soil
     hauling to or from the project site.
Emissions of criteria pollutants from the construction activities were estimated using the construction module
of URBEMIS 2007. Equipment exhaust emissions were determined using the URBEMIS 2007 default values
for horsepower and load factors, which were from the CARB OFF-ROAD model. The type and number of
pieces of equipment anticipated in each phase of construction were estimated from equipment requirements of
typical construction projects. The predicted unmitigated emissions of the proposed project are shown in
Table 3-2 (Project Construction Emissions) and compared to SCAQMD's thresholds of significance.
As shown in Table 3-2 (Project Construction Emissions), maximum daily emissions would be below the
SCAQMD significance thresholds for all criteria pollutants. Therefore, air quality impacts associated with
construction of the proposed project would be temporary and less than significant.

Long-Term (Operational) Impacts.
The primary source of operational emissions from the proposed project would be mobile source emissions
generated from project-induced vehicle trips, such as trips to and from the bus transit center by bus patrons.
Other emissions, identified as area source emissions, would be generated from energy consumption by the
proposed land use, fuel combustion from landscaping maintenance equipment, and emissions associated with
structural maintenance activities.
Operational emissions from the proposed project were estimated using the operational (vehicle) and area
emissions modules of URBEMIS 2007. The analysis is based on an estimated three daily vehicle trips
generated per on-site parking space, plus the estimated dial-a-ride trips. Since the remaining RTA bus fleet

would be powered by compressed natural gas (CNG),13 trips and associated emissions from the CNG buses
were not included. Further, default values generated by URBEMIS 2007, such as the vehicle traveling speed
and distance assumptions, were used in the model run. Temperature data were entered using climatic
information provided in Appendix G of the URBEMIS 2002 user manual.14 The results of the URBEMIS
2007 model for operational emissions are shown in Table 3-3 (Project Operational Emissions) and the
detailed output sheets are provided in Appendix A.

As shown in Table 3-3, the long-term emissions of the project would not exceed the SCAQMD significance
thresholds for criteria pollutants. Therefore, the long-term air quality impact associated with the proposed
project, would be less than significant.
(c)     Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project
region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard (including
releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors)?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. According to the CARB,15 the SCAB is a State and national nonattainment
area for O3 and PM10.16 The AQMP includes performance standards aimed at reducing these high levels of
pollutants within the region. In general, if the environmental analysis shows that an individual project is
consistent with the AQMP performance standards, the proposed project's cumulative impact is considered to
be less than significant. If the analysis shows that the proposed project does not comply with the standards,
then cumulative impacts are considered to be significant, unless there is other pertinent information to the
contrary.
The proposed project would comply with AQMP performance standards because it is not growth inducing
and, as discussed in Item III.b, above, it would not introduce significant new air emissions to the region. In
addition, the proposed project would provide services for an alternative method of transportation, hence
helping to reduce vehicle travel and in turn reducing vehicle emissions in the region. The reduction in vehicle
emissions due to operation of the project would offset potential project-generated new mobile and area source
emissions. Therefore, the impact would be less than significant.
(d)       Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. Sensitive receptors are persons who would be more susceptible to air
pollution than the general population, such as children, athletes, the elderly, and the chronically ill. Examples
of land uses where substantial numbers of sensitive receptors are often found are schools, daycare centers,
parks, recreational areas, medical facilities, nursing homes, and convalescent care facilities. Residential areas
are also considered to be sensitive to air pollution because residents (including children and the elderly) tend

to be at home for extended periods of time, resulting in sustained exposure to pollutants.
The only sensitive receptors within ¼-mile of the project site are several single-family residences about 100
feet southeast of the project site. The nearest schools and other sensitive receptors are farther than ¼-mile
from the project site.
Short-Term (Construction) Impacts. To estimate the impact of construction emissions on sensitive receptors,
a screening analysis based upon the SCAQMD's localized significance threshold (LST) methodology17 was
performed. LSTs represent the maximum NOx, CO, and PM10 emissions from a project that are not expected
to cause or contribute to an exceedance of the most stringent applicable Federal or State ambient air quality
standard. Note that LST does not apply to VOC emissions since there is no ambient air quality standard for
VOC.
SCAQMD has developed mass rate look-up tables that can be used to determine whether a project may
generate significant localized air quality impacts to off-site receptors (including sensitive receptors).
Emissions from the project's on-site construction activities are compared to the thresholds (obtained from the
look-up tables), which vary by geographic location, distance from the proposed project to the sensitive
receptor, and project site coverage area. Table 3-4 (Localized Significance Threshold Analysis for
Construction) shows the results of the LST analysis18.

As shown in Table 3-4, maximum daily on-site construction emissions would not exceed the LSTs for all
criteria pollutants. Impacts on sensitive receptors are therefore less than significant.
Long-Term (Operational) Impacts. Operation of the proposed project would not generate significant
stationary source emissions. Area source emissions that would be generated on-site due to operation and
maintenance of the facility would be minimal, and would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial
pollutant concentrations. Further, with the exception of a portion of the smaller vehicles (12 passengers) for
the dial-a-ride operation (that would run on unleaded gasoline), the RTA bus fleet would be powered by
CNG.19 Criteria air pollutants emitted from the operation and idling of the buses would be minimal.
Operation of the proposed project would increase local vehicle traffic, which may contribute to off-site air

quality impacts. The traffic increases in nearby intersections may contribute to traffic congestion, which may
create "pockets" of CO called "hotspots." These pockets have the potential to exceed the State 1-hour
standard of 20 ppm and/or the 8-hour standard of 9.0 ppm, thus affecting sensitive receptors that are close to
these roadways or intersections. CO hotspots typically are found at busy intersections, but can also occur
along congested major arterials and freeways. They occur mostly in the early morning hours when winds are
stagnant and ambient CO concentrations are elevated. In accordance with the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans) CO Protocol,20 CO hotspots are evaluated when a project degrades the level of
service (LOS) at a nearby signalized intersection to "E" or worse. Typically, hotspots analyses are not
performed for unsignalized intersections, which have lower traffic volumes than those with signals. This is
particularly the case when a hotspots analysis shows no impacts for the most congested, signalized
intersections.
According to the project traffic study,21 the proposed project would not degrade the studied signalized
intersections to LOS C or worse during the peak hours. Therefore, impacts from CO hotspots would not
occur.
(e)       Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. Construction activities occurring for the proposed project would generate
airborne odors associated with the operation of construction vehicles (i.e., diesel exhaust), asphalt operations,
and the application of paints and coatings. These emissions would occur during daytime hours only, and
would be isolated to the immediate vicinity of the construction site and activity. As such, they would not
affect a substantial number of people.
The proposed project operation would not introduce significant odor generating sources, such as wastewater
treatment facility, landfill, or other industrial land uses that generate objectionable odors. Operation of the
facility would generate odors associated with maintenance and passenger activities; however, these types of
odors are not considered objectionable odors that would affect large numbers of people. Therefore, a less
than significant impact would occur.

IV.       BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES--Would the project:
(a)      Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any
species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans, policies, or
regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Game or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service?
No Impact. The project site is already highly disturbed. The western portion of the project site is paved; the
surface of the eastern portion is mostly dirt and gravel, with scattered patches of vegetation. (See Figure 2-4a
through Figure 2-4d, Site Photographs.)
A review of the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB)22 for the Corona North and Corona South
7.5-minute series topographic quadrangles23 was conducted to determine which special status species have the
potential to occur in the project study area or immediate vicinity. This review resulted in the potential
occurrence of 28 such species, as listed in Table 3-5 (Special-Status Species with the Potential to Occur in the
Project Study Area).

Although some special-status wildlife species exist in the City, their habitat is limited to Temescal Wash
(which is about ½ mile away from the site, with an industrialized area lying between the two) and the Santa
Ana River (which is about four miles away from the site).24 Several types of sensitive habitat occur in the
City (southern willow scrub, southern riparian forest, southern sycamore alder riparian woodland, southern
coast live oak riparian forest, and Riversidean sage scrub), but there is none on the project site.
Because there is no habitat for any sensitive species on or near the site, the proposed project would not
adversely affect any threatened, endangered, or special-category species or modify a critical habitat of any
protected species.
(b)     Have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community
identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations or by the California Department of Fish and
Game or US Fish and Wildlife Service?
No Impact. See Response IV(a), above. There is no riparian habitat or other sensitive natural habitat on or
near the site; thus, no impacts would occur.
(c)    Have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act (including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.) through direct
removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other means?
No Impact. See Response IV(a), above. No Section 404 wetland habitat or any other sources of water exist
onsite;25 thus, no impacts would occur.
(d)     Interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife
species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native
wildlife nursery sites?
No Impact. The project site is highly disturbed and is in an urbanized and industrialized area, and has no
known sensitive biological resources. Nor are there any wildlife dispersal or migration corridors in the
project vicinity; the nearest open space Temescal Wash, which is approximately 1/2 mile northeast of the
site.26 No impacts on wildlife movement or migration or on native wildlife nursery sites would occur.
(e)    Conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources, such as a tree
preservation policy or ordinance?
No Impact. See Response IV(a), above. The project site has no sensitive habitat or biological resources
(such as the Coastal live oak) that are protected by local policies or ordinances. Therefore, there would be no
conflict-related impact. (The tall palms along Grand Boulevard are protected by the City of Corona as an
aesthetic resource. See Section 3-I, Aesthetics.)

Low = Low potential for occurrence - No recent or historical records exist of the species occurring in the project area or its
immediate vicinity (within approximately 5 miles) and the diagnostic habitat requirements strongly associated with the species
do not occur in the Project area or its immediate vicinity.
Moderate = Moderate potential for occurrence - Either a historical record exists of the species in the project area or its
immediate vicinity or the diagnostic habitat requirements associated with the species occur in the Project area or its
immediate vicinity.
High =        High potential for occurrence - Both a historical record exists of the species in the project area or its immediate

 3--Environmental Analysis                                                                   INITIAL STUDY 




(f)   Conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community
Conservation Plan, or other approved local, regional, or state habitat conservation plan?
No Impact. Riverside County has prepared two habitat conservation plans. The Stephens Kangaroo Rat
Habitat Conservation Plan27 has been submitted to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for review, and is not yet in force.28 The Multiple-Species
Habitat Conservation Plan29 was adopted by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors on June 17, 2003, but
will not be in force until it has been reviewed and approved by the fourteen cities in the MSHCP area and take
permits have been issued by the USFWS and the CDFG. Although the general project area is in the
MSHCP's Temescal Canyon Area Plan, the project site itself is outside of the MSHCP Criteria Areas and so
is not subject to critical species surveys.30
The project site is not in or near any established habitat conservation area, and there would be no impact from
a conflict with a conservation plan.

V.       CULTURAL RESOURCES--Would the project:
(a)    Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource as defined in
§15064.5?
No Impact. No permanent structures are currently on the project site; previous buildings that existed
historically were removed many years ago (before 1967).31 The site is highly disturbed and there are no
buildings nearby with noteworthy architectural design or historic interest.32 Therefore, no impacts on
archaeological or historic properties potentially eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places, the California Register of Historic Places, or the California Historic Landmarks would occur.
(b)    Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to
§15064.5?
Less-Than-Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated. The City of Corona has relatively few areas
that would be considered potentially sensitive for archaeological resources.33 The site is highly disturbed and
has no known archaeological resources, nor are there any significant cultural resources near the site.
Therefore, the probability of finding significant cultural resources on the site is low. However, should any
archaeological resources be uncovered during site preparation or project construction, the following
mitigation measure would ensure that no significant impacts would occur:
         V-1. During construction, the project proponent and/or the building contractor shall halt
         grading or any other construction activity immediately if suspected archaeological resources
         are uncovered by the activity. The City shall be notified immediately and a professional
         archaeologist shall be summoned to determine the significance of resources and recommend
         appropriate mitigation measures.

(c)    Directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource or site or unique geologic
feature?
Less-Than-Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated. The site is highly disturbed and has no
known paleontological resources, nor are there any significant paleontological resources near the site.
Therefore, the probability of finding significant paleontological resources on the site is low. However, should
any paleontological resources be uncovered during site preparation or project construction, the following
mitigation measure would ensure that no significant impacts would occur:
          V-2     During construction, the project proponent and/or the building contractor shall halt
          grading or any other construction activity immediately if suspected paleontological resources
          are uncovered by the activity. The City shall be notified immediately and a certified
          paleontologist shall be summoned to determine the significance of resources and recommend
          appropriate mitigation measures.
(d)       Disturb any human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries?
No Impact. The project site is highly disturbed and in an urbanized industrial area. No human remains or
cemeteries are anticipated to be disturbed by the proposed project. In the unlikely event that a previously
unidentified human remain are exposed during project construction activities; then no further disturbance
shall occur onsite until the County Coroner has made a determination of origin and disposition pursuant to
Public Resources Code Section 5097.98. If the remains are determined to be prehistoric, the Coroner will
notify the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC), which will determine and notify a Most Likely
Descendant (MLD). The MLD may recommend scientific removal and nondestructive analysis of human
remains and items associated with Native American burials. Therefore, with compliance with these existing
regulations, no project impact would result.

VI.       GEOLOGY AND SOILS--Would the project:
(a)     Expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including the risk of loss,
injury, or death involving:
       (i)     Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the most recent Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial
evidence of a known fault? (Refer to Division of Mines and Geology Special Publication 42).
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The City is considered to be seismically active, as is most of southern
California. The closest major fault system to the project site is the Elsinore fault zone, which has three faults
in the City:
       The Chino-Central Avenue fault, at its closest, is approximately 2 miles west of central
       Corona, and could produce a maximum moment magnitude 6.7 earthquake.
       The Glen Ivy fault is located along the southwestern boundary of the City; at its closest, this
       fault is approximately 3½ miles west of central Corona. The Glen Ivy fault is in an Alquist-
       Priolo Earthquake Fault zone, and could produce a maximum moment magnitude 6.8
       earthquake.
       The Whittier fault, at its closest, is approximately 4½ miles northwest of central Corona.
The project site is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone.34 Although the project site could
be subject to seismic ground rupture, the design and construction of the proposed bus center would conform

 3--Environmental Analysis                                                                   INITIAL STUDY 




to the City's building and permitting requirements, which include structural requirements for withstanding
fault rupture; therefore, the impact would be less than significant.
In addition, as part of the City's transportation infrastructure, the proposed bus center is considered by the
City to be an "essential facility," and as such would be subject to strict design and construction requirements
to ensure that it would continue to function throughout and after a seismic disaster.35
          (ii)    Strong seismic ground shaking?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. See Response VI(a)(i), above. The impact would be less than significant.
          (iii)   Seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction?
No Impact. Generally, the hazards associated with liquefaction range from minimal ground cracking to sand
boils, lateral spreads, and slumping. The project site is not located within an area known to be susceptible to
liquefaction, subsidence, or other ground failure impacts;36 thus, no ground failure impacts would occur.
In addition, as part of the City's transportation infrastructure, the bus center is considered by the City to be an
"essential facility," and as such would be subject to strict design and construction requirements to ensure that
it would continue to function throughout and after a seismic disaster.
          (iv)    Landslides?
No Impact. Generally, the hazards associated with landslides comprise rock falls, disrupted soil slides, rock
slides, soil lateral spreads, soil slumps, soil block slides, and soil avalanches. The project site is in a flat
valley floor, a considerable distance from any steep slopes or hillside terrain, and is therefore not subject to
potential landslides.
(b)       Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project would not result in any uses that would cause substantial soil
erosion at the project site. Grading and compaction of the site soils during project construction could cause
some minor temporary soil erosion. However, over the long term, the entire surface of the project site would
be developed by pavement, structures, and landscaping, so there would be no erosion during project
operation. Because the site is highly disturbed and has not been used for agricultural production, any loss of
topsoil would not be significant.
(c)     Be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result
of the project, and potentially result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence,
liquefaction or collapse?
Less Than Significant with Mitigation Incorporated. See Responses VI(a)(iii) and VI(a)(iv), above.
During construction and operation of the proposed project, no significant problems caused by geologic or soil
instability is expected. However, the following mitigation measure would ensure that no impact related to
geologic or soil instability would occur:
          VI-1 Before project grading, a complete geotechnical evaluation will be conducted by a
          qualified professional to analyze subsurface conditions and to provide geotechnical
          recommendations for the proposed earthwork, foundation construction, and preliminary
          pavement design.

In addition, as part of the City's transportation infrastructure, the bus transit center is considered by the City
to be an "essential facility," and as such would be subject to strict design and construction requirements to
ensure that it would continue to function throughout and after a geologic disaster.
(d)     Be located on expansive soil, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the Uniform Building Code (1994),
creating substantial risks to life or property?
No Impact. Predominantly, the soil associations in the City of Corona are Monserate-Arlington-Exeter and
the soils consist of sandy loam to loam on the surface with a shallow to deep hardpan. These soils have a low
to moderate expansion potential and are well drained.37 See Response VI(c), above. Therefore, no impact
would occur.
(e)    Have soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative waste water
disposal systems where sewers are not available for the disposal of waste water?
No Impact.      The existing sewer system would serve the bus transit center's requirements for disposal of
waste water, and there would be no project impact related to septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal
systems.

VII.     HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS--Would the project:
(a)     Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use,
or disposal of hazardous materials?
No Impact. As part of the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (November 2007) conducted for the
project site, an environmental records search was conducted by EDR. This record search was for properties
where petroleum products or hazardous materials were transferred, stored, generated, used, disposed of, or
released within a mile of the project site. Based on this review, no releases were reported with the project
site. Some unauthorized releases of fuel from underground storage tanks have occurred within one mile of the
project site. These sites have been remediated to the satisfaction of lead regulatory agencies and reported
cases have been closed.38
(b)    Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable
upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment?
No Impact. Refer to Response VII(a), above. It is not expected that hazardous materials will be used or
stored on site, except for cleaning products associated with the driver restrooms. The amounts used and
stored will be small, and no environmental impact is anticipated from an accidental spill.
(c)    Emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or
waste within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school?
No Impact. There are no existing or proposed schools within ¼ mile of the project site.39 The closet school
to the project site is St. Edwards Catholic School located approximately ½ mile to the southwest of the project
site at 500 South Merrill Street. Therefore, no impact would occur.

(d)     Be located on a site which is included on a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to
Government Code Section 65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a significant hazard to the public or
the environment?
No Impact. Refer to Response VII(a).
(e)    For a project located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been
adopted, within two miles of a public airport or public use airport, would the project result in a safety
hazard for people residing or working in the project area?
No Impact. There is no airport within a 2-mile radius of the project site,40 so the project site would not
expose people working near the project area to a safety hazard and no impact would occur.
(f)    For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, would the project result in a safety hazard
for people residing or working in the project area?
No Impact. Refer to Response VII(e), above.
(g)   Impair implementation of or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or
emergency evacuation plan?
No Impact. As part of the City's transportation infrastructure, the bus transit center would be considered by
the City to be an "essential facility," and as such would be subject to strict design and construction
requirements to ensure that it would continue to function throughout and after a disaster, and could assist with
an emergency evacuation..41 The project would not adversely impact the City's emergency operations plan
or with major emergency evacuation routes out of the area. Therefore, no impact would occur.
(h)     Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires,
including where wild lands are adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with
wild lands?
No Impact. The proposed project area is located within a long-established urban area, and is not near wild
lands. Furthermore, Corona Fire Station #2 is located within approximately 1/2 mile of the project site, at 225
East Harrison Street. The project would pose no risk related to wildland fire.

VIII.     HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY--Would the project:
(a)       Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The City of Corona lies in the central portion of the Santa Ana Watershed.
Water runoff in the City flows into the Prado Flood Control Basin and, ultimately, the Santa Ana River, then
into the Pacific Ocean. The river flow is a significant source of local groundwater recharge. The proposed
bus center facility at the project site would be considered a municipal construction project for storm water
runoff. Therefore, operation of the proposed project would be covered by the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region (SARWQCB) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) No. CAS 618033. The NPDES permit regulates general construction and operational activities.
Compliance with standard permit conditions would ensure that there would be no violation of water quality or
waste discharge requirements. There would be no significant impacts on water quality standards or water
discharge requirements.


40
      According to The Thomas Guide, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, 2002, Page 742, the nearest airport is the
      Ajo-Corona Municipal Airport, which is in an unincorporated area more than two miles northwest of the project site

recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local
groundwater table level (e.g., the production rate of pre-existing nearby wells would drop to a level
which would not support existing land uses or planned uses for which permits have been granted)?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The local groundwater in the 26-square-mile Temescal groundwater basin
supplies about 45% of the water supply of the City of Corona.42 The western portion of the proposed project
site is currently paved, and the project would add more pavement (8-bay bus plaza, driver restroom, and
parking lot) and landscaping. As the entire parcel is 2.1 acres in size, these facilities would not significantly
increase the amount of impervious surfaces. Water usage by the site is expected to be minimal, as most of the
site is proposed to be utilized by the parking area and the bus plaza. Therefore, the project would not result in
substantial groundwater depletion or interception of an aquifer by cuts or excavations, or in substantial loss of
groundwater recharge capability. No significant impacts would occur.
(c)      Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the
alteration of the course of a stream or river, in a manner, which would result in substantial erosion or
siltation on- or off-site?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The nearest regional drainage pathway is Temescal Wash, which (at its
closest point) is about one-half mile east of the project site; water flows generally westward until it
discharges into the Santa Ana River about five miles from the project site.43 Although the project would
replace the site's existing soil, gravel, and vegetation with impervious surfaces, all drainage systems in the
vicinity are already well established. As noted previously, the area of new impervious surfaces will be
minimal. No significant drainage or erosion impacts would occur.
(d)     Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the
alteration of the course of a stream or river, or substantially increase the rate or amount of surface
runoff in a manner which would result in flooding on- or off-site?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. Refer to Response VIII(c), above. As noted, the nearest surface water
resource is located approximately one-half mile away. There are no streams or rivers located on the proposed
project site. The increase in surface runoff expected to result from implementation of the proposed project
would be less than significant.
(e)    Create or contribute runoff water which would exceed the capacity of existing or planned storm
water drainage systems or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. Refer to Responses VIII(a) and VIII(c), above, regarding drainage systems,
and to Response VIII(a) regarding storm water runoff. A less-than-significant increase of surface runoff is
expected to result from implementation of the proposed project. This increase is not anticipated to exceed the
capacity of existing or planned storm drain systems, nor substantially increase polluted runoff.
(f)       Otherwise substantially degrade water quality?
No Impact. Compliance with NPDES permit conditions would ensure that there would be no violation of
water quality or waste discharge requirements. Refer also to Response VIII(a), above.

(g)   Place housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a federal Flood Hazard
Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard delineation map?
No Impact. The project does not propose any residential uses; thus, there would be no increased risk of
flooding inhabited areas. Further, the project site is not located in a 100-year flood hazard area.
(h)    Place within a 100-year flood hazard area structures which would impede or redirect flood
flows?
No Impact. It is not expected that the parking lot or bus plaza would include any structure that would impede
flood flows, as the project site is not in a 100-year flood hazard area; thus, there would be no impact.44
(i)     Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding,
including flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project site is just within the southern perimeter of the City's dam
inundation hazard area because of the potential failure of one or both of the dams than contain Lake Mathews,
which is southeast of the City.45 However, the proposed structure(s) for the transit facility on the project site
would serve only transient passengers and for only brief periods. The number of people and the size of the
structure(s) that would be impacted are small, and the impact would be less than significant.
(j)       Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow?
No Impact. The project site is not in a coastal area subject to seiche or tsunami and is not within or adjacent
to a hillside area subject to mudflows; there would be no impact.

IX.       LAND USE AND PLANNING

Would the project:
(a)       Physically divide an established community?
No Impact. The project site is in an urbanized, mostly commercial area. Although there is an established
residential area immediately southeast of the site, the project would not divide any established community.
Therefore, no impact would occur.
(b)     Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction
over the project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, local coastal program, or
zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect?
No Impact. The zoning and land uses (both designated and existing) of the project site and the surrounding
properties are as follows:46

There are no applicable plans, policies, regulations to avoid or mitigate an environmental effect, so the project
would have no impact. See Response (f) in Section 3.5-IV (Biological Resources).
(c)   Conflict with any applicable habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation
plan?
No Impact. The project site is not within any applicable habitat conservation area, so there would be no
impact. See also Section IV(f) in Biological Resources.

X.        MINERAL RESOURCES--Would the project:
(a)     Result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would be of value to the
region and the residents of the state?
No Impact. There are no mineral deposits of statewide or regional importance at the project site, so there
would be no impact.
(b)     Result in the loss of availability of a locally-important mineral resource recovery site delineated
on a local general plan, specific plan or other land use plan?
No Impact. See Response X(a), above.

XI.       NOISE
Noise Definitions. Noise is generally defined as unwanted or intrusive sound. Sound is mechanical energy
transmitted by pressure waves in a compressible medium such as air. Sound is characterized by various
parameters that include the rate of oscillation of sound waves (frequency), the speed of propagation, and the

pressure level or energy content (amplitude). In particular, the pressure level has become the most common
descriptor used to characterize the loudness of an ambient sound level. The decibel (dB) scale is used to
quantify sound intensity. Because sound pressure can vary by over one trillion times within the range of
human hearing, a logarithmic loudness scale is used to keep sound intensity numbers at a convenient and
manageable level. Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies within the entire spectrum,
noise measurements are weighted more heavily within those frequencies of maximum human sensitivity in a
process called "A-weighting," written as dBA.
Noise Scales. Several rating scales have been developed to analyze the adverse effect of community noise on
people. Because environmental noise fluctuates over time, these scales account for the dependence of the
effect of noise on the total acoustical energy content as well as the duration of occurrence. The noise scales
that are applicable to this analysis are the equivalent noise level (Leq), and the community noise equivalent
level (CNEL). Leq is a measurement of the acoustic energy content of noise averaged over a specified time
period. Thus, the Leq of a time-varying sound and that of a steady sound are the same if they deliver the same
amount of energy to the receptor ear during exposure. CNEL is a 24-hour average Leq that accounts for the
sensitivity to noise during evening and nighttime hours. CNEL is calculated by adding 5 dBA to sound levels
in the evening (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and adding 10 dBA to sound levels at night (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.).
When evaluating environmental community noise levels, a 3-dBA increase over 24 hours is barely perceptible
to most people; a 5-dBA increase is readily noticeable; and a 10-dBA increase is perceived as a doubling of
loudness.
Noise Standards
To limit population exposure to physically and/or psychologically damaging, as well as intrusive noise levels,
the federal government, the State of California, various County governments, and most municipalities in the
State have established standards and ordinances to control noise. No federal noise requirements or
regulations are directly applicable to the proposed project. The Governor's Office of Planning and Research
of the State of California issued its General Plan Guidelines in 2003 depicting the severity of noise intrusion
on specified land uses.49 Residential development within the State is generally discouraged where outdoor
exposures exceed 60 to 65 dBA CNEL. The following categories are used for judging the severity of noise
intrusion on specified land uses:
     Normally Acceptable: Is generally acceptable, with no mitigation necessary.
     Conditionally Acceptable: May require some mitigation, as established by a noise study.
     Normally Unacceptable: Requires substantial mitigation.
     Clearly Unacceptable: Probably cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant level.
In regard to interior noise standards, Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations establishes noise
insulation standards and identifies 45 dBA CNEL as the standard for new multifamily residential housing
units.
The City of Corona Municipal Code limits loud and unnecessary noises, and uses the CNEL scale as the
noise-measuring scale to determine consistency with the City's General Plan. §17.84.040 of the Corona
Municipal Code regulates noise caused by community development and identifies standards for noise from
both stationary sources (including construction noise) and mobile (transportation) sources. Table 3-6a
(Stationary Noise Source Standards) presents the standards that are not to be exceeded at the property line of
the receiving land uses.

The Noise Ordinance further specifies noise levels that cannot be exceeded for a specified period of time.
The time limits are listed in the first column of Table 3-6b (Exterior Noise Standards). Column 2 lists the
equivalent noise metric in terms of "percent noise level" (L%). The percent noise level describes the noise
level that is exceeded during a certain percentage of the measurement period. For example, the L25 noise level
is the level exceeded 25% of the measurement period (e.g., 15 minutes in an hour). If the ambient noise level
in a category exceeds the noise limits, the cumulative period applicable to that category is increased to reflect
the ambient noise level.

Threshold of Significance. A project is considered to have a significant noise impact when it causes an
adopted noise standard to be exceeded for the project site or for adjacent sensitive receptors. If noise levels
currently exceed the applicable standards, the noise impact of a project is determined by the extent of increase
in noise level due to the project. A 3-dBA increase in noise levels is considered a potentially significant
impact, and a 5-dBA increase in noise levels is a clearly significant impact.
Noise Environment. The noise environment in the project area is dominated by traffic noise on Grand
Boulevard, Main Street and SR-91, and by the train traffic on the railway just north of the project site.
Sensitive Receptors. The purpose of these standards is primarily to protect sensitive land uses from high
levels of noise exposure. Noise-sensitive receptors are generally considered to be human activities or land
uses that may be subject to stress or substantial interference from noise. Land uses with sensitive receptors
include residential dwellings, churches, hospitals, nursing homes, libraries, and school classrooms. Sensitive
receptors may also be threatened or endangered noise-sensitive biological species.
Noise Impact Determinations
Noise impacts associated with land use development projects include short-term and long-term impacts.
Construction activities, especially heavy equipment operation, would create noise increases on and adjacent to
the construction site. Long-term noise impacts include project-generated on-site and off-site noise sources.
Typical on-site noise sources during operations would include operation of mechanical equipment, landscape
and building maintenance, and other land-use associated operational activities. Off-site noise would be
attributable to project-induced traffic, which would cause an incremental increase in noise levels within and
near the project.
The noise impact from project generated on-site noise sources are evaluated in 3.XI.(a); construction noise
impact are evaluated in Section 3.XI.(c), and off-site noise impacts from project induced traffic are evaluated
in 3.XI.(d). Project generated construction and operational groundborne vibration impacts are evaluated in
Section 3.XI.(b).
(a)    Would the project result in exposure of persons to or generation of noise levels in excess of
standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other
agencies?
Less Than Significant Impact.
The proposed bus transfer facility is anticipated to comprise an 8-bay bus plaza, driver restroom, and an
approximately 26 stall paved parking lot. On-site noise sources during operations would include passenger
and pedestrian activities, bus parking and idling on premises, and periodic landscape and facility maintenance
activities.
Passenger and pedestrian activities on the project site would be limited to scheduled bus hours. Periodic
landscape and facility maintenance activities would be infrequent, and would be limited to daytime hours.
These activities would not generate noise that is different than what are considered typical for residential land
uses in the neighborhood vicinity. As such, noise impact is considered less than significant.
The proposed project operation would introduce frequent bus trips during its hour of operation. Noise
exposure from a bus transit center can be assessed using approach and methodology suggested by the Federal
Transit Administration (FTA).50 Noise exposure in terms of Leq and CNEL at an equivalent distance of 50
feet from the center of the noise source is calculated using the FTA suggested source reference levels and then
adjusted for site-specific operational condition. The numbers of buses that would be assessing the site during
daytime peak and off-peak, evening, and early morning hours are estimated using the bus schedule

The closest sensitive receptor in the project area is the residence on Grand Boulevard, which is at more than
200 feet from the bus platforms. As shown in Table 3-7, operation of the proposed project would result in a
noise exposure of less than 52 dBA at the closest sensitive receptors. The exposure would not be audible
under the existing noise environment in the vicinity and would be below the City of Corona noise level
standards for residential land uses. Noise impact would be less than significant.
Note that this assessment of noise exposure does not take into account noise attenuation from any noise
barriers. Noise exposure from the operation of the proposed project could be further attenuated with the
presence of noise barriers at the property boundaries.
Construction noise impact is evaluated in Section 3.XI.(c).
(b)     Would the project result in exposure of persons to or generation of excessive groundborne
vibration or groundborne noise levels?
Vibration is sound radiated through the ground. Groundborne noise is the rumbling sound caused by the
vibration of building interior surfaces. The ground motion caused by vibration is measured as peak particle
velocity (PPV) in inches per second and is referenced as vibration decibels (VdB). Typical outdoor sources
of perceptible groundborne vibration are construction equipment and traffic on rough roads.
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) indicates that vibration levels in critical care areas, such as
hospital surgical rooms and laboratories, should not exceed 0.2 inch per second of PPV.53 The FTA also uses
a PPV of 0.2 inch per second as vibration damage threshold for fragile buildings and a PPV of 0.12 inch per
second for extremely fragile historic buildings. The FTA criterion for infrequent groundborne vibration
events (less than 30 events per day) that may cause annoyance are 80 VdB for residences and buildings where
people normally sleep, and 83 VdB for institutional land uses with primarily daytime use.54
§17.84.050 of the Corona Municipal Code prohibits ground vibration which is perceptible without
instruments at any point on any affected property adjoining the property on which the vibration source is

No Impact.
Construction (Short-Term) Impacts
It is expected that groundborne vibration from project construction activities would cause only intermittent,
localized intrusion. The proposed project's construction activities most likely to cause vibration impacts are:
      Heavy Construction Equipment: Although all heavy, mobile construction equipment has the
      potential of causing at least some perceptible vibration while operating close to buildings, the
      vibration is usually short-term and is not of sufficient magnitude to cause building damage.
      It is not expected that heavy equipment such as bulldozers would operate close enough to
      any residences to cause vibration impact.
      Jackhammers and Vibratory Compaction Equipment: This type of equipment would be used
      for relatively short periods of time during preparing the site for utility undergrounding and
      for final site restoration. If residents complain about intrusive vibration, the contractor
      would be required to modify the procedure or to complete the task in a manner that would
      cause the minimum amount of hardship for the affected residents.
      Trucks: Trucks hauling building materials to construction sites can be sources of vibration
      intrusion if the haul routes pass through residential neighborhoods on streets with bumps or
      potholes. Repairing the bumps and potholes almost always eliminates the problem.
The FTA has published standard vibration level and peak particle velocities for construction equipment
operations.55 The calculated root mean square (RMS) velocity level expressed in VdB and PPV for
construction equipment at distances of 40, 60, and 100 feet are listed in Table 3-8 (Vibration Levels of
Construction Equipment).

The closest sensitive receptors in the project area are a single-family residence on Grand Boulevard and
several houses on Victoria Avenue, south of the project site. These residences are located at distances of 100
feet and farther from the project site. As shown in Table 3-8, vibration levels would be less than the FTA
damage threshold of 0.12 inch per second PPV for fragile historic buildings at the nearest residential units. In
addition, construction would occur during daytime on weekdays, when most people are away from their
homes, thus minimizing the number of people who might be affected. Since it is not expected that heavy

equipment such as large bulldozers would operate close enough to any residences, the project construction
would not generate groundborne vibrations that cause human annoyance or exceed the perception threshold.
Therefore, the construction impact would be less than significant.
Operation (Long-Term Impacts)
Operation of the proposed project would not involve loud equipment or other significant sources of
groundborne vibration or groundborne noise. Vehicles that would be driven onsite to the parking lot would
have rubber tires with limited speed, which typically would not create groundborne vibration. Therefore, the
impact from the project's operation would be less than significant.
(c)     Would the project result in a substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the
project vicinity above levels existing without the project?
Less-Than-Significant Impact.
The project may contribute to a permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the project vicinity due to
project-generated vehicle traffic on neighborhood roadways and at intersections. A noise impact would occur
if the project contributes to a permanent increase in ambient noise levels affecting sensitive receptors along
roadways that would carry project-generated traffic.

Due to the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale, it is commonly assumed that a doubling of traffic on any
given roadway would cause a noise increase of approximately 3 dBA. Based on the vehicle trip projections
from the traffic study,56 the proposed project would introduce an insignificant increase over the baseline
traffic volumes existing without the proposed project at build-out.57 Therefore, roadway noise increase in the
vicinity due to project-induced traffic would be imperceptible, and the impact would be less than significant.
The calculation worksheets showing vehicle trip contributions from the proposed project to the future
traffic volumes during peak hours are provided in Appendix B.

(d)     Would the project result in a substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels
in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project?
Less-Than-Significant Impact with Mitigation. Construction of the proposed project would generate
intermittent high noise levels on and adjacent to the site. Construction noise levels would fluctuate,
depending on the type and intensity of construction activity, equipment type and duration of use, and the
distance between the noise source(s) and the receiver. Average (equivalent) construction noise levels
projected at the nearest residence from the project site are presented in Table 3-9 (Project Construction Noise
Levels at Nearest Sensitive Receptors). This table lists the loudest types of equipment operating at the
construction site, the typical noise level generated by this equipment at a distance of 50 feet and at the nearest
receivers, and the composite averages (equivalent site noise levels) of the noise from all equipment.
For the purpose of this analysis, the distance from the nearest sensitive receptors to the project site boundary
was considered to estimate the noise emission levels. The nearest sensitive receptor is the residence at 44
Grand Boulevard, which is about 100 feet southeast of the project site boundary. There are also houses along
Victoria Avenue that are 150 feet and farther to the southeast of the project site.

    Utilization Factor is estimated as percentage of daily shift that the equipment would be operating at full power.


As shown in Table 3-9, the proposed project would result in construction noise levels above 75 dBA at the
closest sensitive receptors when project construction activities occur near the southeast corner of the project
site. Maximum noise levels during the loudest construction activities (when occur near the site boundary)
may exceed the City of Corona noise standards occasionally at the nearest receptors. The noise levels at the
receptors (residential units) would be somewhat attenuated because the grade level of the project site is
substantially lower than that of Grand Boulevard and the residences.
Impact and Mitigation. Compliance with the City's construction noise control ordinance and equipping all
construction equipment with effective mufflers would ensure that construction noise impacts remain less than
significant. The following noise mitigation measures would be required:
            X-1     During construction, RTA shall ensure that construction activities comply with the
            City of Corona Municipal Code, Section 17.84.040 ­ D(2), which states that construction
            noise shall be limited to weekdays, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., and
            Sundays and federal holidays between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
            X-2     During construction, RTA shall ensure that all construction equipment, fixed or
            mobile, is properly operating (tuned-up) and that mufflers are working adequately.
            X-3     During construction, RTA shall ensure that all construction equipment is located
            such that emitted noise is directed away from sensitive noise receivers.
            X-4     During construction, RTA shall ensure that stockpiling and vehicle-staging areas are
            located as far as practical from noise-sensitive receptors during construction activities.

(e)     For a project located within an airport land use plan or, where such a plan has not been
adopted, within two miles of a public airport or public use airport, would the project expose people
residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The proposed project site would not be located within an airport land use
plan. The closest airport is the Corona Municipal Airport, which is approximately two miles northwest of the
project site. It is a recreational airport that experiences more than 60,000 annual operations (landings plus
takeoffs). The airport is open to the public for general aviation and has no control tower. The airport
generally serves small aircraft, is located in the Prado Flood Control Basin, and is approximately ½ mile from
the nearest residential neighborhoods; therefore, it is not a substantial source of noise at any sensitive land
use, and noise from the airport does not affect most of the City, including the project area. Thus, the proposed
project would not expose people to excessive noise levels from airport activities, and the impact would be less
than significant.
(f)    For a project within the vicinity of a private airstrip, would the project expose people residing
or working in the project area to excessive noise levels?
No Impact. The project site is not within a two-mile vicinity of a private airstrip. Therefore, no impact
would occur.

XII.     POPULATION AND HOUSING
City of Corona. The City of Corona currently occupies 38.5 square miles, and has more than 41,000
dwelling units.58 The City is the fastest growing city in the Inland Empire. Between 1990 and 2000, the
City's population grew almost 49%, and the number of households grew more than 58% as of 2002, its
population had reached 133,966.59 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2006 American Community
Survey, the City had a population of approximately 161,998 as of 2006.60

Would the project:
(a)    Induce substantial population growth in an area, either directly (for example, by proposing new
homes and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extension of roads or other infrastructure)?
No Impact. The proposed project site is in an established urban area and would not eliminate any previous
constraint to growth. There would be no related increase in population.
(b)    Displace substantial numbers of existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement
housing elsewhere?
No Impact. No existing housing is located on the project site, nor would any housing be displaced by the
implementation of the proposed project.
(c)    Displace substantial numbers of people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing
elsewhere?
No Impact. No residential uses occur on the project site nor would any persons be displaced by the

XIII.     PUBLIC SERVICES
Would the project result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or
physically altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the
construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable
service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for any of the following public services:
(a)       Fire protection?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The addition of a permanent structure and parking facilities at the project
site would somewhat increase area demand for fire protection, but the project would not be sizable enough to
require construction or expansion of any fire stations or other facilities. However, a Development Impact Fee
collected by the City during its project review and approval process would reduce any potential impacts on
fire protection to less than significant.61
(b)       Police protection?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The addition of an active bus transit station would somewhat increase the
area demand for police protection, but the project would not be sizable enough to require construction or
expansion of any police stations or other facilities. RTA would fence the transit center facility and RTA
security personnel would monitor it regularly, thus providing additional security to the transit center patrons
and employees. In addition, a Development Impact Fee collected by the City during its project review and
approval process would reduce any potential impacts on police protection to less than significant.62
(c)       Schools?
No Impact. The proposed project would not add any residences, and thus would not generate any additional
students; no impact on school facilities would occur.
(d)       Parks?
No Impact. The proposed project would not add any residences, and thus would not generate any additional
demand for parks; no impact on park facilities would occur. In addition, a Development Impact Fee collected
by the City during its project review and approval process would help fund the City parks program.63
(e)       Other public facilities?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. A Development Impact Fee collected by the City during its project review
and approval process would reduce any potential impacts on other public facilities (such as sidewalks and
street improvements) to less than significant.64 No additional impacts on other public facilities have been
identified. (Refer to Section XVI for a discussion of potential impacts on utilities and service systems.)

XIV.      RECREATION--Would the project:
(a)      Cause an increase in the use of existing neighborhood and regional parks or other recreational
facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated?
No Impact. The proposed project would not add any residences, and thus would generate no additional
demand for parks or other recreational facilities; no impact on recreation would occur. In addition, a

Development Impact Fee collected by the City during its project review and approval process would help
fund the City parks program.65
(b)     Does the project include recreational facilities or require the construction or expansion of
recreational facilities, which might have an adverse physical effect on the environment?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The proposed project does not include recreational facilities and does not
require expansion or construction of new recreational facilities. A Development Impact Fee collected by the
City during its project review and approval process would reduce any potential impacts on recreational
facilities to less than significant.66

XV.      TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC
The following discussions are based on a traffic study conducted for the project by Katz, Okitsu &
Associates.67 The study area consists of four intersections:
         Main Street & SR-91 Westbound Freeway Ramps;
         Main Street and Grand Boulevard;
         Transit Station ­ Park & Ride Driveways and Grand Boulevard (proposed); and
         Joy Street & Grand Boulevard).
Existing Intersection Level of Service
A.M and P.M. traffic counts were performed at the study intersections. From the traffic count at the study
area intersections, average vehicle delay and corresponding level of service (LOS) was determined for the
study area intersections under multiple study periods. Table 3-10 (Intersection Performance ­ Existing
Conditions) provides the LOS at each study intersection under existing conditions.

as those queues are caused by capacity problems on the freeway ramp and mainline facilities are not
necessarily these intersections.


Project Trips
To analyze traffic in the post-project period, trips were added to existing volumes that included those to be
generated by the transit service and the increase local activity created by the new shuttle/dial-a-ride loading
area and off-street parking area. Trips equal to the number of parking spaces at the east end of the project
area were added to the inbound trips in the A.M. peak period and outbound trips in the P.M. peak period.
This methodology was used because Metrolink trips consist mostly of home to work trips whereby vehicles
would arrive during the traditional A.M. commuting period and depart during he traditional P.M. commuting
period. Shuttle/dial-a-ride trips were also factored into trip generation totals at the project parking lot
driveway.
Intersection Level of Service
Table 3-11 (Intersection Performance ­ Existing + Project Conditions) summarizes the LOS of the study area
intersections for the existing condition plus project trips. The level of service analysis includes an optimized
timing and coordination scheme for the four study intersections.

The addition of project traffic and traffic signal timing and coordination adjustments for queuing control
would not worsen the level of service at the study intersection.
Traffic Signal Timing/Coordination Analysis
As part of the construction of the Corona Transit Station, a new traffic signal is planned for installation at the
access driveway to the station on Grand Boulevard. Signal spacing and coordination between the proposed
signal and existing nearby signals were analyzed. Based on this analysis, queuing at the study intersections
would not extend to adjacent intersections in the post-project period. The progression of traffic along Grand
Boulevard could be controlled through a coordinated timing plan that would include the intersections with Joy
Street, the project transit access driveway (and the Caltrans park and ride access driveway) and Main Street.
Inputs into the queuing analysis acknowledged the long A.M. peak queues at the westbound on-ramp to the
SR-91 freeway at Main Street. Control for this ramp was simulated within the analysis in order to allow a
queue to form. The analysis therefore takes into account the limited ability of the receiving lanes at the on-
ramp to absorb traffic flows from the Main Street intersection during this period.

 INITIAL STUDY                                                                      3--Environmental Analysis 




Physical Traffic Signal Spacing Issues
The spacing between the proposed traffic signal and the existing traffic signal at Main Street & Grand Avenue
was examined for stopping distance and general visibility issues. The distance between these two traffic
signals is approximately 350 feet at the closest points of the intersections. Based on the Caltrans Highway
Design Manual, stopping distances at a design speed of 45 mph would be 57 meters or 187 feet. The distance
between the signals therefore provides adequate stopping distance.
Based on site visits by Katz, Okitsu Associates, it was determined that there is also no major site distance
issue at the proposed traffic signal location. From the limit line of the eastbound approach of the Main Street
& Grand Boulevard intersection, advance signals at the proposed signal would be visible. From the threshold
of the receiving lanes at the east leg of the intersection, the proposed traffic signal and the intersection would
be fully visible.
Based in the overlap between the westbound left turn lane pocket at the intersection of Main Street & Grand
Boulevard, and the proposed eastbound left turn pocket into the Corona Transit Station, two transit buses
could be accommodated with the Corona Transit Station inbound left turn pocket on Grand Boulevard. This
pocket distance should be adequate for the traffic generation expected from the proposed project.
Would the project:
(a)     Cause an increase in traffic which is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and
capacity of the street system (i.e., result in a substantial increase in either the number of vehicle trips,
the volume to capacity ratio on roads, or congestion at intersections)?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. None of the LOSs forecast by the project traffic study would be lower than
C, so a less than significant impact is expected to occur.
(b)    Exceed, either individually or cumulatively, a level of service standard established by the county
congestion management agency for designated roads or highways?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The County of Riverside's Congestion Management Plan specifies that all
new development must achieve or maintain a minimum LOS of C.68 See Response XV(a) above.
(c)    Result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a
change in location that results in substantial safety risks?
No Impact. The project does not propose any uses which could cause any changes to air traffic patterns.
(d)     Substantially increase hazards due to a design feature (e.g., sharp curves or dangerous
intersections) or incompatible uses (e.g., farm equipment)?
No Impact. The proposed project would not result in substantial hazards due to a design feature. As part of
standard development procedures, site plans are submitted to the City for review and approval prior to
issuance of building permits to ensure adequate design and safety.
(e)       Result in inadequate emergency access?
No Impact. The project driveway(s) would meet all City requirements for access by emergency vehicles, and
would have no impact on emergency access.

(f)       Result in inadequate parking capacity?
No Impact. Adequate parking would be provided on the project site to accommodate the anticipated bus
passengers and RTA employees, and the parking plan would be reviewed by the City for compliance with
parking standards during final plan check. There would be no parking capacity impact.
(g)    Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs supporting alternative transportation (e.g.,
bus turnouts, bicycle racks)?
No Impact. The project is a public bus transit center located adjacent to a Metrolink Station, and so supports
the use of both buses and commuter rail as alternative transportation modes. The project would not conflict
with any adopted policies, plans, or programs, and would have no related impact.

XVI.      UTILITIES AND SERVICE SYSTEMS--Would the project:
(a)    Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the applicable Regional Water Quality Control
Board?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. Refer to Response VIII(a), above.
(b)    Require or result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment facilities or
expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project site is in an urbanized area with established water and
wastewater treatment facilities. The proposed bus transit center facility and landscaping would require only a
moderate amount of water. The project would not result in the need for expanded treatment facilities. In
addition, the City of Corona has established assessment districts whereby utility costs are distributed and fees
assessed on all developed properties, which would reduce any potential impacts on water and wastewater
treatment facilities to less than significant.69
(c)     Require or result in the construction of new storm water drainage facilities or expansion of
existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental effects?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project would not require onsite construction of drainage improvements
to convey storm water flows to area drainage facilities. Because the project is not expected to alter drainage
patterns in the area (refer to Response VIII[c], above), no area expansion or new storm water drainage
facilities would be required and there would be no environmental impact. In addition, the City of Corona has
established assessment districts whereby utility costs are distributed and fees assessed on all developed
properties, which would reduce any potential impacts on storm water drainage facilities to less than
significant.70
(d)    Have sufficient water supplies available to serve the project from existing entitlements and
resources, or are new or expanded entitlements needed?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project site is in an urbanized area with established water resources.
The proposed bus transit center facility and landscaping would require only a moderate amount of water. The
project would not result in the need for new or expanded water entitlements. In addition, the City of Corona
has established assessment districts whereby utility costs are distributed and fees assessed on all developed
properties, which would reduce any potential impacts on water supplies to less than significant.71

(e)     Result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider which serves or may serve the
project that it has adequate capacity to serve the project's projected demand in addition to the
provider's existing commitments?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project site is in an urbanized area with adequate wastewater treatment
capacity. The proposed bus transit center facility would not result in the need for additional treatment
capacity. In addition, the City of Corona has established assessment districts whereby utility costs are
distributed and fees assessed on all developed properties, which would reduce any potential impacts on
wastewater treatment capacity to less than significant.72
(f)    Be served by a landfill with sufficient permitted capacity to accommodate the project's solid
waste disposal needs?
Less-Than-Significant Impact. The project site is in an urbanized area with adequate permitted landfill
capacity. The proposed bus transit center facility would not result in the need for additional landfill capacity.
 In addition, the City of Corona has established assessment districts whereby utility costs are distributed and
fees assessed on all developed properties, which would reduce any potential impacts on solid waste disposal
and landfill capacity to less than significant.73
(g)       Comply with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations related to solid waste?
No Impact. The proposed project would comply with all federal, state, and local statutes related to solid
waste. Thus, no impact would occur.

XVII. MANDATORY FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE
(a)     Does the project have the potential to degrade the quality of the environment, substantially
reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-
sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, reduce the number or restrict the
range of a rare or endangered plant or animal or eliminate important examples of the major periods of
California history or prehistory?
No Impact. Based on the preceding analyses (in particular, Section IV, Biological Resources, and Section V,
Cultural Resources), the proposed project does not have the potential to degrade the quality of the
environment, substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population
to drop below self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, reduce the number or
restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal, or eliminate important examples of the major
periods of California history or prehistory. There would be no impact.
(b)      Does the project have impacts that are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable?
("Cumulatively considerable" means that the incremental effects of a project are considerable when
viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the
effects of probable future projects)?
Less-Than-Significant Impact with Mitigation Incorporated. The project traffic impact analysis takes into
account a concurrent project that would add 714 parking stalls to the Corona Metrolink Station.74 The
proposed installation of a traffic signal at the access driveway to the Corona Transit Station on Grand
Boulevard would reduce the potential cumulative impacts due to this project to less than significant.

As provided in more detail in each individual impact discussion of this Initial Study, implementing the
mitigation measures and complying with applicable codes, ordinances, laws, and other required regulations
would reduce all project potentially significant impacts to less than significant. Project impacts would not be
cumulatively considerable, and would be less than significant after mitigation.
(c)   Does the project have environmental effects which will cause substantial adverse effects on
human beings, either directly or indirectly?
Less-Than-Significant with Mitigation Incorporated. As discussed in the analyses in this Section 3,
implementation of the specified mitigation measures would reduce any potentially significant impacts of the
project related to cultural resources, geology and soils, and traffic and transportation to less than significant.

1           INTRODUCTION
The Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) proposes to design and construct a bus transit center in the City of
Corona to serve the diverse travel patterns of its patrons. The transit center would be a common destination
for all bus routes serving western Riverside County and a transfer point for passengers on all routes. The
location of the transit center would be adjacent to the Metrolink Station in the center of Corona. Federal,
state, and local funds would be applied to develop the new facility, and therefore environmental
documentation to support the facility must comply with both the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

1.1         NEPA REQUIREMENTS AND LEGAL AUTHORITY

The primary law governing the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) environmental protection process is
NEPA, as amended, and many different federal laws, rules, and regulations that govern environmental review
of federally assisted mass transportation projects. NEPA establishes protection of the environment as a
national priority and mandates that environmental impacts must be considered before any federal action that
has the potential to affect the human environment is undertaken. NEPA has four primary purposes: to
declare a national environmental policy; to promote efforts to protect the environment; to improve national
understanding of environmental issues; and to establish the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). The
"action-forcing" provisions of NEPA are contained in Section 102 C (42 United States Code [U.S.C] 4332).
This section includes three primary mandates:

      (1)     To the extent possible, policies, regulations, and laws of the federal government must be
              interpreted and administered in accordance with NEPA;
      (2)     Federal agencies must use an interdisciplinary approach in planning and decision-making that
              impact the human and natural environment; and
      (3)     The preparation of an EIS is required on all major federal actions that might significantly adversely
              affect the human or natural environment.

Preliminary consultation with the FTA indicated that the proposed project may meet the criteria for a
Categorical Exclusion (CE), as outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 23, Sections 771.115
and 771.117. CEs include actions that do not individually or cumulatively have significant adverse social,
economic, or environmental effects and are excluded from the requirement to prepare an Environmental
Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). If a project is identified as qualifying as a CE,
no further action under NEPA is required. Once the FTA has determined that a CE is the appropriate for this
action, it may act on the application for financial assistance.

23 CFR 771.117 lists types of projects that are categorically excluded, and Section 771.117(d) specifically
lists the types of projects that would be designated as a CE only after FTA approval. Approval would be
predicated on documentation submitted by the applicant that demonstrates that the specific conditions for a
CE have been satisfied and that significant environmental effects will not result. Preliminary evaluation of
the proposed project suggests that it fall under the type of project identified in Section 771.117(d)(10):

            "Construction of bus transfer facilities (an open area consisting of passenger shelters, boarding
            areas, kiosks and related street improvements) when located in a commercial area or other high
            activity center in which there is adequate street capacity for project bus traffic."
            (23CFR771.117(d)(10))

While it appears that the project meets the criteria for a CE, the FTA's final determination will be made after
review of this document.

1.2     ORGANIZATION OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document is based on a CE checklist based on 23CFR 771.117(d). This checklist is presented in Section
2.0 of this document. Many of the checklist items have been addressed in the CEQA Initial Study/Mitigated
Negative Declaration (IS/MND) that has been prepared for the proposed project. For those items, the reader
is referred to specific sections of the IS/MND, which is attached to this document in Appendix A. Other
checklist items require new responses. Those new responses are provided in Section 3.0.

_____L. COMMUNITY DISRUPTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: Provide a socio-economic
profile of the affected community. Describe the impacts of the proposed project on the community. Identify
any community resources that would be affected and the nature of the effect.

Response L:

Socioeconomic profile of the community:

The City's Redevelopment and Economic Development Department prepared a "Community Profile" as part
of its 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan to assess the City's housing and community development needs.3 As
stated in the Community Profile, U.S. Census data indicates that the population of Corona was 124,966 in
2000, compared to 76,095 in 1990.4 Between 1990 and 2000, more population growth occurred in the City
(39%) than in Riverside County (24%).5 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2006 American Community
Survey, the City had a population of approximately 161,998 as of 2006.6

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, approximately 47% of City residents were White, 36% Hispanic, 7%
Asian or Pacific Islander, and 6% Black. Native Americans and "Others" made up less than 1% of the
population. The proportion of Hispanic residents in the City increased by about 6 percentage points, while
the proportion of White residents declined by about 13 percentage points over the same period. 7 Figures 3-1,
3-2, 3-3 of the 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan show the locations of concentrations of Black, Hispanic, and
Asian populations in the City. A review of these figures indicates that the project site is located in an area
identified as having a high concentration of Hispanic households, but no concentration of Black or Asian
households.

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, median household income in the City was $59,615, 22% higher than the
countywide median of $42,887.8 Based on 2000 U.S. Census data, 6% of the City's total households were
extremely low income, 7% were low income, and 12% were moderate income. 9 Hispanic households (38%)
had a considerably higher percentage of low and moderate income households than the rest of the City, and
proportionally fewer White households (20%) had low and moderate income. 10 Concentrations of low and
moderate income populations are located in older portions of the City surrounding the 91 Freeway. 11 As
shown in Figure 3-5 of the 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan, the project site is located in an area of low to
moderate income populations. 12

Impacts of the proposed project on the community:

Operation of the proposed project would not generate significant environmental effects, including effects to
human health. Construction of the proposed project would generate potentially significant effects related to
archaeological and paleontological resources, geologic risks, and short-term noise. However, with the
incorporation of mitigation measures, each of these potential effects would be reduced to less-than-significant
levels. (Refer to the Summary section in the attached IS/MND.) Thus, the proposed project would not
generate a significant and avoidable adverse human health or environmental effect--all potential significant
effects would be mitigated such that they would be rendered less than significant.

In addition, the proposed project would not result in a cumulatively considerable exposure to health or
environmental hazards. The project traffic impact analysis takes into account a concurrent project that would
add 714 parking stalls to the Corona Metrolink Station (see Appendix B of this document).13 The proposed
installation of a traffic signal at the access driveway to the Corona Transit Station on Grand Boulevard would
reduce the potential cumulative impacts due to the proposed project to less than significant levels. The
proposed project would not result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria air pollutant,
would not generate a CO hot spot, or otherwise result in a significant air quality impact. Refer to the attached
IS/MND, Section 3.6, Subsection III (Air Quality), questions a, b, c, d, and e.

Furthermore, as provided in more detail in each individual impact discussion of the attached IS/MND,
implementing the mitigation measures and complying with applicable codes, ordinances, laws, and other
required regulations would reduce all project potentially significant impacts to less than significant levels.
Project impacts would not be cumulatively considerable, and would be less than significant after mitigation.

Finally, the proposed project would not physically divide the community. The proposed project would be
constructed on an existing vacant lot, off-street. It would located adjacent to existing transportation uses,
including Metrolink tracks, a park-and-ride lot, an arterial roadway (Grand Boulevard), and the Riverside
Freeway. It would not add new roadways, rail tracks, or other facilities that would obstruct the passage of
pedestrians or cars.

Community resources that would be affected:

The proposed project would not result in significant effects to community resources. The proposed project
would not construct new housing; thus, the proposed project would not generate significant impacts to public
services and the availability of utilities. The proposed project would not generate significant unavoidable
impacts to natural resources. Finally, the proposed project would not generate unmitigated impacts related to
the community environment, including aesthetics, noise, and traffic. For discussions, see the attached
IS/MND, Section 3.6, Subsections:

     ·    Community resources: XIII (Public Services), XIV (Recreation), and XVI (Utilities and Service
          Systems).
     ·    Natural resources: III (Air Quality), IV (Biological Resources), and VIII (Hydrology and Water
          Quality).
     ·    Community environment: I (Aesthetics), XI (Noise), and XV (Transportation/Traffic).

 CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION 




Conclusion:

Although the proposed project would be constructed in an area (1) of low to moderate income and (2) that has
a high concentration of minority persons, the proposed project would not generate a disproportionately high
adverse human health or environmental effect on a minority and/or low-income population because the
proposed project would not generate a significant and avoidable adverse human health or environmental
effect--all potential significant effects would be mitigated such that they would be less than significant.

_____M. USE OF PUBLIC PARKLAND AND RECREATION AREAS: Indicate parks and recreational
areas on the site map. If the activities and purposes of these resources will be affected by the proposed
project, state how.

Response M: The proposed project would not include parkland or recreational areas; thus, no parkland or
recreational areas are shown on Figure 2-4 (Conceptual Site Plan) of the attached IS/MND. For a discussion

Response R: Please refer to the attached IS/MND, Section 3.6, Subsection XV (Transportation/Traffic)
questions d and e. In addition, a pedestrian bridge staircase and elevator tower is intended to be constructed
from just east of the bus loading area, extend across the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) freight rail
track and connect to the existing Metrolink Passenger bridge, to give transit patrons safe and convenient
passage between the two modes of travel.

_____S. IMPACTS CAUSED BY CONSTRUCTION: Describe the construction plan and identify impacts
due to construction noise, utility disruption, debris and spoil disposal, air and water quality, safety and
security, and disruptions of traffic and access to property.

Response S: The attached IS/MND, Section 3.6, discusses impacts due to construction noise, debris disposal,
air and water quality, and disruptions of traffic. Please refer to:

    ·    Construction noise: Subsection XI (Noise), question d.
    ·    Construction debris: Subsection XVI (Utilities and Service Systems), questions f and g.
    ·    Construction impacts to air quality: Subsection III (Air Quality), question b.
    ·    Construction impacts to water quality: Subsection VIII (Hydrology and Water Quality), questions a
         and c.
    ·    Construction impacts to traffic: Subsection XV (Transportation and Traffic), question a.

Connection to public utilities will be coordinated with the appropriate utility company during construction so
that disruption is minimized. Access to the property during construction would not be an issue of concern for
this project because the contractor would ensure that the project site is secured during project construction.

1. Introduction

This document examines traffic circulation issues associated with the proposed North Main
Metrolink Transit Station, to be developed by the Riverside Transit Authority (RTA). The
proposed Project site is located within the City of Corona. Katz, Okitsu & Associates was
retained to study the traffic impacts of the proposed Project, under a sub-contract with Psomas.

A. Project Details

The proposed Project site is located at the northeast corner of the Main Street/Grand Boulevard
intersection. This site is roughly bounded by the freight/Metrolink railroad corridor on the north,
Grand Boulevard on the south, the Main Street overhead structure on the west, and existing
development on the east.

The RTA would develop the Transit Station project to provide an off-street bus transfer point for
up to five RTA lines, two City of Corona Cruiser lines and Dial-A-Ride service. Bus access to the
Station would be provided via a driveway across Grand Boulevard from the eastern end of the
existing Caltrans Park & Ride lot. A new vehicle parking lot of 45 spaces would be provided to the
east of the Station, where a loading area for the Dial-A-Ride service would also be provided. A
small public plaza would be provided between the main Station bus loop and the new parking
area, with a new bridge connection to the existing Metrolink station pedestrian bridge to the
north.

The Project study area, as defined through scoping efforts with engineering staff at the City of
Corona, encompasses four roadway intersections. Traffic conditions, concentrating on traffic
signal timing and coordination, were examined for existing and existing + project conditions
during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak periods. Key tasks undertaken for this traffic analysis
include: 1) definition of study approach, 2) determination of existing traffic conditions, 3) trip
generation forecasts of the planned project land use, 4) assignment of Project-generated trips to
the study area roadway system and, 5) evaluation of signal timing issues at the existing and
proposed study intersections.

The location of the Project site within the surrounding street system is illustrated in Figure 1.

B. Project Study Area

As previously stated, four intersections were selected for analysis. Three of the study intersections
are existing intersections controlled by traffic signals, and the remaining intersection is a proposed
intersection.

The proposed intersection would be formed by a relocated Caltrans Park & Ride lot driveway on
the south and an access driveway to the Transit Station. As part of the current project design
plans, this intersection would be signalized to allow for safe and efficient movement of transit
vehicles into and out of the proposed Station.

The list of study intersections is provided below:

  1.    Main Street & SR-91 Westbound Freeway Ramps
  2.    Main Street & Grand Boulevard
  3.    Transit Station ­ Park & Ride Driveways & Grand Boulevard (proposed)
  4.    Joy Street & Grand Boulevard

The locations of the study intersections are illustrated in Figure 2.

C. Analysis Methodology

The proposed Station site is located within the City of Corona. Katz, Okitsu & Associates
coordinated with City engineering staff at the start of this study to achieve consensus on study
intersections and analysis methodology. A full traffic impact study has not been required by the
City. An analysis of signal timing and coordination was conducted to determine if the addition of
a new traffic signal at the project driveway on Grand Boulevard would be feasible.

2. Existing Study Area Conditions

This section documents the existing conditions in the study area. The discussion presented here is
limited to specific roadways in the project site vicinity. Figure 3 depicts the lane configurations
and traffic control at the study intersections.

A. Existing Roadway System

Significant roadway facilities within the study area are described below. The discussion on
roadways presented here are roadways that are approaches to the study intersections.

SR-91 (Riverside Freeway) ­ This limited-access facility has a full-access interchange with
Main Street near the project site. At this diamond interchange, Main Street is grade-separate from
the SR-91 via an underpass. Dedicated carpool lanes are provided at the interchange on-ramps.

Main Street ­.This arterial roadway provides four travel lanes to the south of Grand Boulevard,
and on-street parking is generally prohibited within the immediate study area. Northward from
Grand Boulevard, and within the extents of the overhead structure that spans the railroad
corridor, six travel lanes are provided. The roadway provides north-south access between the City
of Norco on the north, the primary study intersections, and the center of Corona to the south.

Grand Boulevard ­ This arterial roadway is a loop road that forms a one-mile diameter circle
within Corona. The study intersection of Main Street & Grand Boulevard is the northern point
within this loop and the roadway would provide direct access to the Station site. Four travel lanes
are provided along most segments of the roadway. A continuous center two-way left-turn lane is
provided on segments to the immediate east and west of Main Street.

Joy Street ­- This collector roadway defines the eastern limit of the project study area. The
facility has two travel lanes and on-street parking is prohibited within the study area. Joy Street
provides access to a number of collectors and local streets within an area that is primarily
developed with light industrial and office uses.

B. Existing Transit Service

The study area is served by bus transit lines operated by the Riverside Transit Authority (RTA)
and the City of Corona. These services are listed below.

RTA Line 3 operates as a local north-south bus route that provides service to Norco, Riverside
Community College (RCC) ­ Norco, the North Main Street corridor, and Corona. Service is also
provided to the North Main Metrolink Station. The line operates from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on
weekdays with an approximate peak trip frequency of 40 minutes. On Saturdays, similar service
is provided from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

RTA Line 149 operates primarily as an express route on the SR-91 freeway, between Riverside
and Orange. Within the study area, the route follows Main Street and Grand Boulevard to serve
the North Main Metrolink Station on a route deviation from the freeway. On weekdays, four
inbound and four outbound trips are provided to Orange during the a.m. and p.m. peak commute
periods. On Saturdays and Sundays, two inbound and two outbound trips are provided.

RTA Line 206 operates primarily as an express route on the I-15 freeway between Corona and
communities to the south, with a northern terminus at the North Main Metrolink Station and a
southern terminus in Temecula. The line also serves Murrieta and Lake Elsinore. On weekdays,
five inbound trips to Corona are provided in the a.m .peak period and five outbound trips are
provided in the p.m. peak period. Two to three reverse trips are provided during the same periods.

The Corona Cruiser Blue Line operates as a circulator route that serves the northern, southern ,
and eastern areas of Corona, including service to the existing North Main Metrolink Station.
Service is provided with an approximate trip frequency of one hour, from approximately 5:00 a.m.
to 9:00 p.m. on weekdays and from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Saturdays.

The Corona Cruiser Red Line operates as a second circulator route within Corona, which serves
the western and southeastern areas of Corona, including service to the existing North Main
Metrolink Station. Service is provided within a similar time range to the Blue Line.

The routes of these transit lines within the study area are illustrated within Figure 4.

C. Existing Intersection Level of Service

A.m. and p.m traffic counts were performed at the study intersections. Traffic count data is
provided in Appendix A of this report. From the traffic counts at the study area intersections,
average vehicle delay and corresponding level of service (LOS) was determined for all of the study
area intersections under multiple study periods. Table 1 provides the LOS at each study
intersection for existing conditions.

The LOS values are based on the average delay per vehicle at the critical intersection approaches
(provided as output in seconds by the Highway Capacity Manual module within the Synchro
program). Poor levels of service values (E or F) are highlighted by bold text. The future
intersection #3 was omitted as it is currently unsignalized and the Synchro analysis output does
not provide a level of service value for such a configuration.

Table 1 indicates that all of the study intersections operate at acceptable LOS C or better under
existing conditions. AM peak period queues at the SR-91 westbound ramps would not be
represented in these values as those queues are caused by capacity problems on the freeway ramp
and mainline facilities and not necessarily these intersections.

The traffic analysis worksheets for existing conditions are provided in Appendix B of this report.
The existing peak-hour turn movement volumes at the study intersections are provided in Figure 5
(a.m. peak) and Figure 6 (p.m. peak).

3. Project Trip Generation and Access

This section defines the traffic that would be generated by the proposed project in terms of bus
trips and trips to the new parking lot area.

A. Aspects of Proposed Project

Two access driveways would be provided on Grand Boulevard at the project site. The western
driveway would be aligned with a repositioned driveway at the Caltrans park and ride lot on the
south side of the street, providing access for transit vehicles into and out of the planned bus loop
and transit station. The second driveway that would be located at the east end of the project site
would provide access to the proposed on-site parking area and shuttle/dial-a-ride loading area.

The project site plan is provided in Figure 7.

B. Project Trips and Access

In order to analyze traffic in the post-project period, trips were added to existing volumes that
included those to be generated by restructured transit service and the increased local activity
created by the new shuttle/dial-a-ride loading area and off-street parking area. During fieldwork
efforts, the existing Caltrans park and ride lot was examined for available spaces. This effort was
supplemented with aerial maps. The additional trips were added to that facility's driveway to
assure that volumes represented capacity conditions.

The new off-street parking area at the east end of the project site would have 46 public vehicle
parking spaces. Trips equal to this total number of spaces were added to the study ­ inbound trips
in the a.m. peak period and outbound trips in the p.m. peak period. This methodology was used
because Metrolink trips consist mostly of home to work trips whereby vehicles would arrive
during the traditional a.m. commuting period and depart during the traditional p.m. commuting
period. Shuttle/dial-a-ride trips were also factored into trip generation totals at the project
parking lot driveway.

Trips generated specifically for the potential retail/newsstand use at the project site were not
included in the analysis. These uses would be complementary to the project transit use and it is
not anticipated that outside trips would be generated for retail uses.

Table 2 provides an overview of the transit service that is likely to be re-routed to serve the
centralized point of the Transit Station. This information was provided to Katz, Okitsu &
Associates by RTA staff. The number of trips that would be generated by dial-a-ride vehicles is
unknown by RTA and was estimated for the purposes of trip generation.

4. Existing + Project Conditions

This section provides a summary of the analysis of traffic conditions at the study intersections
with the addition of traffic generated by the proposed project. Traffic volumes for future
conditions with the project were created by adding the traffic volumes in Figures 8 and 9 to the
existing traffic counts. The resulting peak-hour traffic volumes for this scenario are provided in
Figure 10 (a.m. peak) and Figure 11 (p.m. peak).

A. Intersection Level of Service

Table 3 summarizes the LOS of the study area intersections under this scenario. The level of
service analysis includes an optimized timing and coordination scheme for the four study
intersections.

The addition of project traffic and traffic signal timing and coordination adjustments for queuing
control would not worsen the level of service at the study intersections.

The analysis worksheets for this scenario are provided in Appendix C of this report.

B. Traffic Signal Timing/Coordination Analysis

As part of the construction of the Transit Station project, a new traffic signal is planned for
installation at the access driveway to the Station on Grand Boulevard. Signal spacing and
coordination between this proposed signal and existing nearby signals were examined within a
queuing analysis.

The overall queuing analysis results are provided within Figure 12 (a.m. peak) and Figure 13 (p.m.
peak). Symbols at the approach to each study intersection indicate the average, 95th percentile,
and maximum observed traffic queue limits. These queue lengths are estimated based on the data
inputs to the Synchro analysis.

The key indicators within the queuing figures are the 95th percentile queuing locations. These
represent locations on the roadway facilities where queuing is expected to extend during no more
than 5% of occurrences. Use of the 95th percentile queue length calculation is commonly used for
purposed of roadway design. Overall, queuing at the study intersections would not extend to
adjacent intersections in the post-project period. The progression of traffic along Grand Boulevard
could be controlled through a coordinated timing plan that would include the intersections with
Joy Street, the project transit access driveway (and the Caltrans park and ride access driveway)
and Main Street.

Inputs into the queuing analysis acknowledged the long a.m. peak queues at the westbound on-
ramp to the SR-91 freeway at Main Street. Control for this ramp was simulated within the
analysis, in order to allow a queue to form. The analysis therefore takes into account the limited
ability of the receiving lanes at the on-ramp to absorb traffic flows from the Main Street
intersection during this period.

C. Physical Traffic Signal Spacing Issues

The spacing between the proposed project traffic signal and the existing traffic signal at Main
Street & Grand Avenue was examined for stopping distance and general visibility issues, as a
supplemental analysis to the queuing analysis.

The distance between these two traffic signals is approximately 350 feet at the closest points of
the intersections. Based on the Caltrans Highway Design Manual, stopping distance at a design
speed of 45 mph would be 57 meters or 187 feet. The distance between the signals therefore
provides adequate stopping distance.

Based on site visits conducted by Katz, Okitsu & Associates, it was determined that there is also
no major sight distance issue at the proposed traffic signal location. From the limit line of the
eastbound approach of the Main Street & Grand Boulevard intersection, advance signals at the
proposed signal would be visible. From the threshold of the receiving lanes at the east leg of the
intersection, the proposed traffic signal and the intersection would be fully visible.

Based on the overlap between the westbound left turn lane pocket at the intersection of Main
Street & Grand Boulevard, and the proposed eastbound left turn pocket into the Transit Station,
two transit buses could be accommodated within the Transit Station inbound left turn pocket on
Grand Boulevard. This pocket distance should be adequate for the traffic generation expected
from the proposed project.

5. Analysis Summary

The following are the conclusions made from the analysis within this report.

     ·     During the existing conditions scenario, the study intersections operate at Level of Service
           (LOS) C or better. Morning traffic queues at the SR-91 westbound on-ramp would not
           affect these values, as these queues are caused by capacity limitations of the freeway
           mainline and ramps and not the study intersections.

     ·     In order to analyze traffic in the post-project period, trips were added to existing volumes
           that included those to be generated by restructured transit service and increased local
           activity created by the new shuttle/dial-a-ride loading area and off-street parking area.

     ·     The progression of traffic along Grand Boulevard could be controlled through a
           coordinated timing plan that would include the intersections with Joy Street, the project
           transit access driveway (and the Caltrans park and ride access driveway) and Main Street.

     ·     The distance between these two traffic signals is approximately 350 feet at the closest
           points of the intersections. Based on the Caltrans Highway Design Manual, stopping
           distance at a design speed of 45 mph would be 57 meters or 187 feet. The distance
           between the signals therefore provides adequate stopping distance.

     ·     Based on site visits conducted by Katz, Okitsu & Associates, it was determined that there
           is also no major sight distance issue at the proposed traffic signal location.

UltraSystems Environmental Incorporated (UltraSystems) conducted a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment (ESA) for three parcels included in the proposed Riverside Transit Authority (RTA) North Main
Metrolink Transit Station, northeast of the intersection of Route 91 and Main Street in Corona, California
(subject property) in conformance with industry-accepted practices and American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) Standard E 1527-05). Currently, the subject property includes the Metrolink Station and
Parking Lot, vacant lot (proposed RTA Transit Station) and a Caltrans Park & Ride Lot. Grand Boulevard and
railroad tracks separate the three parcels.

The purpose of this Phase I ESA was to identify recognized environmental conditions (REC) for the subject
property that include: 1) Presence or likely presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products on the
subject property, 2) Conditions that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a
release of hazardous substances or petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground,
groundwater, or surface water of the subject property, and 3) Issues that may have an environmental impact
on the subject property.

This Phase I ESA included the following scope of work:

            Researched and reviewed available information regarding past owners and occupants of the subject
            property to assess the potential for contamination resulting from prior on-property activities.
            Researched available information regarding nearby adjacent properties for evidence of environmental
            conditions that could adversely impact the subject property.
            Attempted to interview available person(s) familiar with current and former on-property activities for
            relevant information regarding potential areas of environmental concern.
            Reviewed federal and state regulatory agency database information for the subject property and
            nearby properties to identify potential concerns that could adversely affect the environmental condition
            of the subject property.
            Performed a property visit to identify areas of environmental concern. To the extent possible, a
            review of immediately adjacent properties was also performed from the subject property and public
            thoroughfares.
            Prepared this Phase I ESA report to document the findings regarding the current environmental
            condition of the subject property.
The following conclusions are based on the findings of the Phase I ESA.

            Main Street, Grand Boulevard and railroad tracks were present in the vicinity of the subject property
            since 1901. Building structures occurred on the subject property from at least 1938 through at least
            1968. From 1977 to 2002, the Caltrans Park and Ride Parking Lot was present, and the remainder of
            the subject property was vacant land. Adjoining properties went through various stages of residential
            and commercial development during these time periods.
            Some unauthorized releases of fuel from underground storage tanks (USTS) have occurred at sites
            within one mile of the subject property. These sites have been remediated to the satisfaction of lead
            regulatory agencies, and reported cases have been closed. No releases were reported within the
            subject property.
            The Metrolink Station and Parking Lot and Proposed RTA Transit Station of the subject property are
            located within a 500 year Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain. The Caltrans
            Park & Ride Lot (south) parcel is not within the FEMA floodplain.


                                                                               1

UltraSystems Environmental Incorporated (UltraSystems) conducted a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment (ESA) for three parcels included in the proposed Riverside Transit Authority (RTA) North Main
Metrolink Transit Station, northeast of the intersection of Route 91 and Main Street in Corona, California
(subject property) (Figure 1) in conformance with industry-accepted practices and American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E 1527-05 (ASTM, 2005). The work was conducted at the request of
Mr. Jim Bliss of Pountney Psomas under contract with UltraSystems. Currently, the subject property includes
the Metrolink Station and Parking Lot, vacant lot (Proposed RTA Transit Station) and a Caltrans Park & Ride
Lot (Figure 2).


1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Phase I ESA was to identify recognized environmental conditions (REC) for the subject
property that include:

            Presence or likely presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products on the subject property.
            Conditions that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of
            hazardous substances or petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground,
            groundwater, or surface water of the subject property.
            Issues that may have an environmental impact on the subject property.
This report is not intended to serve as a compliance assessment of the subject property and does not include
de minimus conditions that generally do not present a material risk of harm to public health or the
environment, and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention of
appropriate governmental agencies. Qualifications of the individuals performing the Phase I ESA are included
in Appendix A.


1.2 Scope of Work
This Phase I ESA included the following scope of work:

            Researched and reviewed available information regarding past owners and occupants of the subject
            property to assess the potential for contamination resulting from prior on-property activities.
            Researched available information regarding nearby adjacent properties for evidence of environmental
            conditions that could adversely impact the subject property.
            Attempted to interview available person(s) familiar with current and former on-property activities for
            relevant information regarding potential areas of environmental concern.
            Reviewed federal and state regulatory agency database information for the subject property and
            nearby properties to identify potential concerns that could adversely affect the environmental condition
            of the subject property.
            Performed a property visit to identify areas of environmental concern. To the extent possible, a
            review of immediately adjacent properties was also performed from the subject property and public
            thoroughfares.
            Prepared this Phase I ESA report to document the findings regarding the current environmental
            condition of the subject property.

                                                     3.0 PHYSICAL SETTING

3.1 Topography
Review of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute series topographic quadrangle map of
Corona North, California reveals that the site is at an elevation approximately 600 feet above mean sea level,
and the topography appears to decline to the southwest.


3.2 Soils
Based on the property visit, the subject property is surrounded by urban land that is defined as an area where
more than 85% of the surface is covered by asphalt, concrete, buildings, and other structures. Urban land
contains soil that has been disturbed to the extent that no natural deposits may be found and the original
profile of the soil has been altered.


3.3 Underlying Formation
The subject property is within the Temescal Valley southeast of the Chino Plain within the Peninsula Range
Geologic Provence. Surface sediments are composed of recent alluvium, which overlies crystalline igneous
and metamorphic bedrock (DWR, March 1966).


3.4 Groundwater
According to EDR, there are 15 groundwater wells within one mile of the subject property. Groundwater
occurs within alluvial deposits and underlying fractured bedrock. The depth to groundwater beneath the
subject property is not known exactly because no wells occur within the subject property.


3.5 Surface Water
The Temescal Wash is an ephemeral tributary to the Santa Ana River and is approximately ½ mile north of the
subject property. According to EDR, the two north parcels of the subject property are located within a 500
year Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain.




                                                                               6

                             4.0 ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS RESEARCH
In an effort to identify past land uses and evidence of environmental concern within and near the subject
property, fire insurance maps, aerial photographs, topographic maps and relevant databases provided by EDR
and others were reviewed. These are discussed below.


4.1 Map Reviews
4.1.1 Fire Insurance Maps
There was no Sanborn fire insurance maps coverage for the subject property (Appendix C).

4.1.2 Aerial Photographs
Aerial photographs for the subject property and surrounding area for selected years from 1938 to 2002 were
obtained from EDR. Review of the aerial photographs revealed that building structures occurred on the
subject property from at least 1938 through at least 1968. From 1977 to 2002, the Caltrans Park and Ride
Parking Lot was present, and the remainder of the subject property was vacant land. Adjoining properties
went through various stages of residential and commercial development. Based on review of the aerial
photographs, no evidence of environmental impact was observed on the subject or adjoining properties. The
review findings are provided in Table 1, and copies of the aerial photographs are provided in Appendix D.

4.1.3 Topographic Quadrangle Maps
USGS topographic quadrangle maps of the Corona area available from 1901 to 1981 were reviewed to identify
evidence of man-made structures, fill areas, and natural features that may have an adverse effect on the
environmental condition of the subject property. Review of the topographic quadrangle maps revealed that the
vicinity of the subject property was developed with Main Street, Grand Boulevard and railroad tracks since
1901. Based on review of the topographic maps, no evidence of environmental impact was observed on the
subject property. Topographic maps are included in Appendix E.


4.2 Database Reviews
4.2.1 City Directories
City directories have been published for cities and towns across the U.S. since the 1700's, and may be used to
locate individuals and businesses in a particular urban or suburban area. The directory lists the name of a
resident, or if a business is operated at a certain address, the name and type of business. Based on review of
city directories, numerous commercial and light industrial businesses and residences occurred in the vicinity of
the subject property since 1924. It is not known if these businesses and residences were present on the
subject property. Based on the listing, no potential impacts to the subject property were identified. City
Directories are included in Appendix F.

4.2.2 Environmental Database
A search for environmental records was conducted by EDR to satisfy the government record search
requirements of ASTM Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessment (E 1527-00). A preliminary
screening was performed for properties where petroleum products or hazardous materials were transferred,
stored, generated, used, disposed of or released within up to one mile of the subject property by reviewing




                                                                               7

detailed information provided by EDR, and then assessing the potential for impact to the subject property. The
following criteria were used in the preliminary screening process.

            Listed properties where no violations or hazardous material releases were reported were considered
            to have a low potential to impact the subject property.
            Listed properties where hazardous material releases or spills were deemed insignificant by the
            regulatory authority were considered to have a low potential to impact the subject property.
            Listed properties with a "closed file" or "no further action" designation by the regulatory authority were
            considered to have a low potential to impact the subject property because these releases or spills
            have been mitigated or remediated.
            Listed adjoining or up-gradient properties with a reported spill or release of hazardous material and
            with "open" or "active" designations were considered to have a medium to high potential to impact the
            subject property, and these properties required further review.
Based on review, were unauthorized releases have occurred, the sites have been remediated to the
satisfaction of lead regulatory agencies, and the cases are closed. No releases were reported within the
subject property. To our knowledge, there is no intention to use local groundwater, and therefore,
groundwater impacts, if any, would not be expected to impact future subject property uses. A summary of
preliminary screening results is included in Table 2., and the EDR Radius Map environmental records
database is provided in Appendix G.

The potential adverse environmental impact that orphan sites may have on the subject property were
evaluated by reviewing street names in an effort to learn if the site is located on an adjoining property. Orphan
sites are properties where the location and address are not known to EDR. Based on the evaluation, no
environmental impacts to the subject property are expected from orphan sites.


4.3 Other Reports and Plans
No other reports were available for review for this Phase I ESA.




                                                                               8

                                                        5.0 PROPERTY VISIT
UltraSystems observed common areas of the subject property during the property visit. Weather conditions
at the time of the property visit consisted of clear skies with an approximate outside air temperature of 75
degrees Fahrenheit. Photographs taken during the property visit are included in Appendix B.


5.1 Underground Storage Tanks
No underground storage tanks (USTs) were observed on the subject property during the property visit. Based
upon the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.2 Aboveground Storage Tanks
No aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) were observed on the subject property during the property visit. Based
upon the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.3 Polychlorinated Biphenyl-Containing Electrical Equipment
A visual review was conducted for the presence of electrical equipment that could contain polychlorinated
biphenyl (PCB), an environmentally regulated material used in dielectric fluid in some electrical equipment. No
transformers, capacitors, or large switchgear equipment were observed on the subject property during the
property visit. Based upon the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.4 Hydraulic Equipment
No evidence of hydraulic equipment was observed on the subject property during the property visit. Based
upon the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.5 Asbestos-Containing Materials
A preliminary visual review was conducted for the presence of potential asbestos-containing materials
(PACMs). According to OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1926.1101 (k)), building owners are required, under
certain circumstances, to notify maintenance people and all persons potentially exposed to PACM at the
facility of the presence and location of materials that contain (or are presumed to contain) asbestos. Thermal
system insulation, surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring materials that are present in buildings
constructed prior to 1981, and have not been analytically tested and determined to be non-ACM, are to be
presumed to contain asbestos, and should be addressed in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.1101, as well as
other applicable federal, state, and local regulations.

Currently, there are no regulations requiring the removal of ACM unless it will be disturbed during renovation,
repairs, or demolition. The USEPA recommends that as long as the ACM does not pose an imminent health
threat, the materials can be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Plan. If not currently
available, an Asbestos-Containing Materials O&M Plan should be developed and implemented at the subject
property.

Based on the age of structures present on the subject property, no further action is recommended.




                                                                               9

5.6 Chemical, Hazardous Materials, and Raw Materials Storage
No Chemical, Hazardous Materials, and Raw Materials Storage were observed on the subject property during
the property visit. Based on the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.7 Waste Generation and Storage
Solid and liquid wastes generated at the site are disposed off-site. Based on the above information, no further
action is recommended.


5.8 Wells, Sumps, Pits, and Floor Drains
No wells, sumps, pits or floor drains were observed on the subject property during the property visit. Based on
the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.9 Storm water Runoff and Surface Water
Storm water runoff is expected to exit the subject property via overland flow and enter the municipal storm
water collection system via storm drains located along local roadways. Based upon the above information,
storm water runoff and surface water are not expected to be an environmental concern. No further action is
recommended at this time.


5.10 Lagoons, Septic Systems, and Separators
No evidence of lagoons or septic systems was observed on the subject property during the property visit.
Based on the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.11 Stressed Vegetation, Staining, and Odors
No evidence of stressed vegetation, outdoor staining, or odors were noted on the subject property during the
property visit. Based upon the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.12 Surface Disturbance
No evidence of surface disturbances was observed on the subject property during the property visit. Based
upon the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.13 Potential Wetlands
No evidence of wetland areas was observed on the subject property during the property visit. Review of the
detailed and physical settings source provided by EDR revealed that no delineated wetlands are located on
the subject property. Based upon the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.14 Radon
The subject property is located in Zone two of the federal EPA Radon Zone of Riverside County. The
maximum indoor air level for this zone is 4.0 Pico Curies per Liter. Based on the low radon potential for Los
Angeles, California, no further action regarding radon is recommended.



                                                                              10

5.15 Lead-Based Paint
A preliminary visual review was conducted for the presence of lead-based paint (LBP). Because the building
at 114 West Elmyra Street was constructed prior to 1978, LBPs may be located on the subject property. LBP
may be harmful to children and pregnant woman. Based on the age of structures present on the subject
property, no further action is recommended.


5.16 Air Emissions
No major air emissions sources were identified at the subject property during the property visit. Based upon
the above information, no further action is recommended.


5.17 On-Property Dry Cleaners
No dry cleaning operations were observed at the subject property at the time of the property visit. No dry
cleaners were identified during the historical review of the subject property. Based on the above information,
no further action is recommended.


5.18 Mold/Water Intrusion
Molds produce tiny airborne spores to reproduce. When mold spores land on a damp spot indoors, they may
begin growing and digesting whatever they are growing on in order to survive. No obvious visual evidence of
mold, water intrusion, water damage, or standing water was observed during the property visit. Based on the
above information, no further action is recommended.

                             6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
The following conclusions are based on the findings of the Phase I ESA.

            Main Street, Grand Boulevard and railroad tracks were present in the vicinity of the subject property
            since 1901. Building structures occurred on the subject property from at least 1938 through at least
            1968. From 1977 to 2002, the Caltrans Park and Ride Parking Lot was present, and the remainder of
            the subject property was vacant land. Adjoining properties went through various stages of residential
            and commercial development during these time periods.
            Some unauthorized releases of fuel from underground storage tanks (USTS) have occurred at sites
            within one mile of the subject property. These sites have been remediated to the satisfaction of lead
            regulatory agencies, and reported cases have been closed. No releases were reported within the
            subject property.
            The Metrolink Station and Parking Lot and Proposed RTA Transit Station of the subject property are
            located within a 500 year Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain. The Caltrans
            Park & Ride Lot (south) parcel is not within the FEMA floodplain.

              CERCLIS-NFRAP: As of February 1995, CERCLIS sites designated "No Further Remedial Action Planned" (NFRAP) have been removed from CERCLIS. N FRAP sites may be sites where, following an initial investigation, no contamination was found, contamination was removed quickl y without the need for the site to be on
              the NPL, or the contamination was not serious enough to require Federal Superfund Action or NPL consideration. EPA has remov ed approximately 25,000 NFRAP sites to lift the unintended barriers to the redevelopment of these properties and has archived th em as historical records so EPA does not needed repeat the
              investigations in the future. This policy change is part of the EPA's Brownfields Redevelopment Program to help cities, stat es, private investors and affected citizens to promote economic redevelopment of unproductive urban sites.

Experience

Mr. Herlihy has been involved with hydrologic testing and analysis since 1976, and performed
aquifer tests and hydrogeologic studies in a variety of geologic settings in California, Wyoming,
New Mexico, Texas, Australia and Mexico. Mr. Herlihy has been selected as a Subject Matter
Expert (SME) by the California Board of Registration for Geologists and Geophysicists to develop
qualifications for the practice of hydrogeology in California. His hydrologic experience includes soil
and groundwater assessments for remediation investigations and feasibility studies, and
groundwater resource studies in unconsolidated and fractured rocks. Mr. Herlihy has conducted
dozens of single well slug tests, production well step drawdown tests, and multi-well long term
aquifer tests in shallow low permeability water table aquifers, and deep high permeability artesian
aquifers. Aquifer test evaluation included delayed drainage, leakage, no flow and recharge
boundary conditions, fluctuating atmospheric pressure conditions, and well spacing from a few feet
to a quarter mile. Mr. Herlihy has developed conceptual, finite difference and analytical modeling
solutions to design groundwater remediation programs and to assess groundwater resources.

Representative Project Experience

Water Resource Study for Metro Red Line Segment #3: Mr. Herlihy presented a workplan to the
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to complete up to two years of
hydrological and biological monitoring to measure the potential effects on flora and water resources
within and near Runyon Canyon Park, California due to previous tunneling along Metro Red Line
Segment #3 Expansion to North Hollywood. The primary objectives of the monitoring program
were to: 1) Monitor groundwater elevations and spring flows in the vicinity of the Metro Red Line
Segment #3 alignment, 2) Determine if observed changes to groundwater elevations and spring
flows are a result of tunneling along Metro Red Line Segment #3, and 3) Determine if substantial
changes to flora are the result of changes in groundwater elevation and spring flows.

Metro Red Line Segment #3 includes the "Alignment Right" (AR) and "Alignment Left" (AL) which
are parallel tunnels that are approximately 21 feet in diameter, and approximately 15 feet apart.
The AR and AL tunnels extend approximately 12,900 feet from the Universal City Station, south
along Lankershim Boulevard, beneath the Santa Monica Mountains, and then to the
Hollywood/Highland Avenue station. The AR and AL are connected by 18 lateral tunnels for worker
access between tunnels (cross passages). Groundwater that may seep into the tunnels is
collected in subterranean pipe drains that direct seepage water to a sump (#39A) within cross
passage #39 at the southern extent of the rail lines. This water is directed by pumping to sanitary
sewer outfall #1070. The AR and AL tunnels pass through a truncated anticline of Cretaceous and
Paleocene rocks in the Santa Monica Mountains bounded by the Benedict Canyon Fault to the
north and the active Hollywood Fault to the south. The tunnels were constructed through six
"Reaches" which correspond to the geologic formations penetrated. Throughout the length of the
AR and AL tunnels, numerous shears, faults, fractured rock, and gouge zones provide substantial
secondary permeability. The Hollywood Fault Zone, which is referred to as the "Seismic Section",
contains brecciated granodiorite and gouge clays, and represents a barrier to groundwater flow.

Environmental studies in the 1980s identified the need for biological and hydrological monitoring to
assess potential impacts to flora above the AR and AL due to water drainage caused by tunnel
construction beneath the mountains. Prior to tunnel construction, the MTA (defendant) entered into
a 1996 Consent Decree (No. 96-2078 JGB) by the US Central District Court of California with
Rescue Our Canyons and Friends of Runyon Canyon (Plaintiffs). The decree required MTA "to
carry out whatever grouting is necessary ahead of and behind the boring machines to ensure there
is "zero leakage" beneath the seasonal springs". The reference to "zero leakage" was later clarified
by the plaintiffs to mean less than 200 gallons per minute (288,000 gallons per day) total
groundwater seepage into the tunnels. Tunneling and grouting for Metro Red Line Segment #3
beneath the Santa Monica Mountains proceeded from north to south, began in May 1996 and was
completed in November 1997 (UCM, April 2001). Additional pressure grouting around the AR and
AL to reduce groundwater seepage into the tunnels was completed in July 1999. The AR and AL
rail lines were ready for service in June 2000. As part of the Consent Decree, the MTA agreed to
supply Metropolitan Water District (MWD) water to drainages where springs were potentially
impacted by a decline in groundwater levels during and after construction of the AR and AL
tunnels. These supplemental flows are to be provided until pre-construction spring flows are
reestablished through natural recharge.

To comply with the Consent Decree, Mr. Herlihy, Dr. Philip Rundel (botanist), and MacTec
participated in a hydrological and biological monitoring program across the Santa Monica
Mountains within 6,000 feet of the AR and AL tunnel alignments. The monitoring included: 1)
Periodic monitoring by Mr. Herlihy of groundwater levels, temperature, pH, and electrical
conductivity at monitoring wells, 2)

Periodic monitoring by Mr. Herlihy of pressure head at three vibrating wire piezometers, and of
spring discharge and stream flow length beneath the spring headwaters, 3) Sampling by Dr. Philip
Rundel of flora in the vicinity of the wells and springs, and 4) Periodic measurements by MacTec of
pressure head above the AR and AL tunnel inverts using vibrating wire piezometers.

Periodic measurements by MacTec of discharge from the AR and AL tunnels. The findings are
reported quarterly to the MTA by Mr. Herlihy.

Various Hydrogeologic Studies, Southern California: The majority of the technical work in
California since December 1986 has centered around groundwater assessment and groundwater
remediation including the delineation of plumes of petroleum and chlorinated hydrocarbons in
groundwater. Mapping and delineation of these plumes included impacted groundwater in
fractured rock, mountainous terrain controlled by faulting, major water producing aquifers, high
permeability alluvial systems, coastal aquifers and low permeability silts and clays. The plumes
were delineated by accounting for historical water quality data, groundwater gradient, groundwater
velocity, changes in permeability within the aquifer, and preferential migration along faults, fractures
or high permeability zones.

Mr. Herlihy evaluated numerous sites for the presence and distribution of gasoline, diesel, waste
oil, other petroleum hydrocarbons, and chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated
with releases from USTs, above-ground storage tanks, ponds, and sumps. These evaluations
were conducted in alluvial sediments, low permeability units, near coast high permeability aquifers,
fractured rock, and major aquifers of the Los Angeles Basin.

Groundwater Modeling: Mr. Herlihy have performed numerical finite difference modeling
(MODFLOW) for an alluvial aquifer to predict dewatering requirements for mining within a highly
permeable alluvial system, and recently utilized MODFLOW to simulate two dimensional
groundwater flow to assess the location of injection and extraction wells to control the migration
and recovery of groundwater impacted with petroleum hydrocarbons at a site where the
permeability varied over an order of magnitude. Mr. Herlihy has used numerous analytical models
to predict the contaminant zone of capture at sites where sufficient information to use a numerical
model was not available. The analytical modeling results have usually proved adequate to estimate
the radius of influence or zone of contaminant capture.

Groundwater Resource Study, Yucaipa, California: Previous investigations indicated that
groundwater in the Yucaipa area was impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons. Mr. Herlihy conducted
a water resource study to determine the proportion of groundwater in the Yucaipa basin that could
be impacted by this release.

The Yucaipa Valley Water District (YVWD) obtains a majority of its municipal water supply from
groundwater sources within Older Alluvium deposits in the Yucaipa Basin. Consequently, concerns
were raised regarding the extent of the groundwater impact in the vicinity of a service station of
known gasoline releases, and to the proportion of the YVWD that could be potentially impacted due
to the suspected release. Local groundwater flow throughout the basin was controlled by faulting
and separated the Yucaipa Basin into several sub-basins.

At the time of the study, 25 wells within the Yucaipa Basin were used to supply water to the YVWD.
The groundwater contribution to the total YVWD supply, which is also derived from surface water
and other sources, has increased from approximately 87% in 1994 to approximately 93% in 1999.
In 1999, approximately 8,900 acre-feet of groundwater was produced which is almost equivalent to
the estimated perennial (sustainable) yield of 9,270 acre-feet for the Yucaipa Basin. The nearest
pumping well YVWD well (#07) to the highest impacted area was approximately 2,000 feet up-
gradient and accounted for approximately 3.4% (338 AF) of the total 1999 YVWD water supply.
The nearest YVWD down-gradient well (#11) was approximately 1.2 miles to the southwest in a
separate sub-basin on the opposite side of a suspected fault. This well accounted for approximately
0.5% (53 AF) of the total 1999 water supply.

Two nearby wells (#5 and 6) which were cross-gradient from the release, were used for water well
monitoring only and did not contribute water to the 1999 YVWD water supply. Based on these
findings, a conceptual model was prepared to serve as a basis to delineate the lateral and vertical
extent of impact, and to develop a groundwater fate-transport model as a predictive tool to
determine long term potential impacts, if any, to nearby YVWD water supply wells under various
groundwater-use scenarios. As currently used, however, the impact to nearby YVWD wells was
considered unlikely because the groundwater flow beneath the area of impact was away from one
of the water supply wells (#07), and the other water supply well (#11) was down-gradient of the
release area, but, on the opposite side of a fault.

Groundwater Remediation Closure, Valentec International Corporation: Near surface
groundwater was impacted by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the suspected release of
chlorinated solvents during degreasing operations at an industrial facility. Groundwater occurred
between approximately 10 to 15 feet below the ground surface. Prior to remediation, the plume
contained total VOC concentrations up to approximately 2,000 ug/L, and extended approximately
200 feet down-gradient of the release area. A vapor extraction and groundwater recovery
remediation system was designed under the supervision of Mr. Herlihy and began operation in
October 1997. During the two year operation of the system, the size of the plume decreased and
the VOC concentrations were reduced by up to two orders of magnitude. Mr. Herlihy established
that the most mobile VOCs were removed from the plume and future measurable migration of the
plume was unlikely. After a demonstration indicating that the plume was stable, the Regional
Water Quality Control Board closed the site in July 2002.

Stringfellow Superfund Site, Glen Avon, California: Mr. Herlihy was retained by the IT
Corporation (IT) to prepare a sampling and analysis plan (SAP) on behalf of the California
Department of General Services, Real Estate Services Division (RESD) and the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) in support of a variance for the disposal of filter
cake solids containing pesticides at concentrations above the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) universal treatment standard (UTS). Filter cake solids were wastes generated from the
ongoing groundwater remediation program at the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Facility (site) in
Glen Avon, California.

The filter cake was historically disposed of as a hazardous waste in a landfill. However, filter cake
derived from one (A-Stream) of the six (A- through F-Streams) liquid wastes treated contained
pesticides: 4,4'-DDE [1,1'-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene]; 4,4'-DDD [1,1-dichloro-2,2-
bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane]; 4,4'-DDT[1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane]; and 2,4'-
DDT[1,1,1-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethane].       In some cases, the concentrations of these
pesticides in this filter cake were above the EPA UTS of 0.087 mg/Kg. Consequently, this filter
cake would be banned from land disposal unless a variance was granted by the EPA under the
land disposal restriction (LDR) program. The purpose of the SAP was to acquire data to determine
if a variance for the land disposal of the Filter Cake was feasible.

Bradley Landfill, Waste Management Corporation: Three deep (up to 300 feet) duel completion
groundwater-monitoring wells were installed and historic data from exiting wells were used to: 1)
characterize groundwater quality up-gradient and down-gradient of the landfill in the San Fernando
Valley to verify the direction of groundwater flow and historic groundwater level fluctuations, 2)
establish spatial changes in groundwater quality and magnitude of groundwater level fluctuations,
and 3) further delineate a known fault within the alluvial aquifer system. Based on the findings of
the study, groundwater quality, levels and flow direction were controlled by the nearby groundwater
recharge spreading grounds located up-gradient of the landfill.

The landfill could potentially impact portions of this recharged groundwater, A fault in the area was
mapped within a 50-foot area of certainty in the vicinity of the landfill. The three wells were
included in the monitoring program for the landfill.

Chiquita Canyon Landfill, Laidlaw Waste Systems: Groundwater monitoring wells were installed
in the vicinity of a new landfill expansion area for the Chiquita Canyon Landfill near Santa Clarita,
California. and, the expansion area was geologically mapped. Based on the mapping and the
groundwater study, the direction of groundwater flow and groundwater quality was determined to
flow to the Santa Clarita River which was an intermittent gaining stream. Areas of existing
groundwater impact were identified, and a groundwater monitoring plan and contingency plan were
prepared to protect the nearby surface water and groundwater resources. A permit application for
the expansion area was submitted to the Regional Water Quality Control Board and was approved.
The landfill area expansion was constructed.

Campo Landfill, Mid-American Waste Systems: Mr. Herlihy participated in the estimation of
costs to develop a landfill on the Campo Indian Reservation near the south San Diego County
border with Mexico. Mr. Herlihy attended public hearings with Mid-American Waste Systems to
advise Mid-American of technical detail during the public hearing process to gain regulatory and
tribe approval for the landfill.

Hydrogeologic Assessment, Wyoming: The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and
the State of Wyoming requested a complete hydrogeologic study of an area proposed for uranium
mining using the new and advanced mining technique called in-situ mining. Hydrogeologic studies
and testing were used to design well fields for in-situ uranium mining operations. The well fields
were used to inject solutions into selected wells to dissolve and mobilize uranium minerals beneath
the water table, recover the uranium laden solutions from a series of extraction wells, and evaluate
groundwater quality and flow patterns using a series of monitoring wells. The hydrogeologic testing
and analysis that Mr. Herlihy performed was presented to the Federal NRC and the Wyoming
Department of Environmental Quality. Both agencies reviewed and accepted the testing results,
interpretations and groundwater flow predictions, and issued federal and state approvals for the
operation.

Aquifer Testing, Chemical and Flow Modeling and Site Remediation, Newport Beach,
California: Prior to 1984, vadose zone soils and the near surface Semi-perched aquifer were
impacted by the leakage of petroleum hydrocarbons from underground storage tanks (USTs) and
one of the dispenser islands at a former service station. The impacted interval within the vadose
zone occurred to a depth of approximately 25 feet below the ground surface (bgs) in fine well
graded sands with minor amounts of silts and clays. Three long term constant discharge rate
pumping tests were conducted across the site within the impacted aquifer which occurred between
the depths of 25 and 50 feet bgs. Based on the testing results, high permeability portions of the
aquifer were separated by numerous low permeability areas. Three extraction wells were placed
in the high permeability portions of the aquifer to capture contaminants on opposite sides of the low
permeability zones. Seven vapor extraction wells were placed within the impacted interval of the
vadose zone.

Soils were remediated using vapor extraction. Extracted vapors were treated using a catalytic
oxidation (CAT-ox) unit. Recovered groundwater was treated using a low profile stacked-tray air-
stripper, and the off-gases were combined with the gases from soil vapor extraction. A total of 200
pounds of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were recovered from the ground water, and
approximately 9600 pounds TPH were recovered from the soil.

Soil remediation has been completed, and closure for the soils portion of remediation has been
granted by the lead regulatory agency. This site has been developed into a corner shopping
center.

Brough Facility, San Gabriel Superfund Site, San Gabriel Valley: The former Brough site was
identified as a potential hazardous waste site and included in the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) database in April 1992.
Since the 1950's, the site has been used for steel wire manufacturing. A Hazard Ranking System
(HRS) was developed under CERCLA and SARA to assess the degree of risk to human health and
the environment posed by potential hazardous wastes at a site. The HRS analysis for this site
considered the potential migration of contaminants in groundwater, surface water and air, and the
potential exposure to soil. The potential areas of concern included: 1) the potential for groundwater
and surface water impact, and human exposure to lead and zinc in soil and air, 2) the potential for
groundwater impact due to the reported burial of waste of unknown composition, and 3) the
potential for groundwater and air impact due to possible leakage of acids containing metals from
liquids in the tanks and sludge-like materials within the secondary containment structures along the
"pickle line".

Based on the review of available documents and the results of the soil sampling program, the
following conclusions were drawn: 1) based of the laboratory results of the discrete and composite
soil samples collected near the surface, some surface soils up to approximately five feet bgs may
contain concentrations of some CCR Title 22 Metals above hazardous waste criteria, 2) the
subsurface soils sampled beneath portions of the "pickle line" may have been impacted by the wire
manufacturing process. This impact, however, did not render these soils hazardous according to
state of California numerical criteria, and 3) no chlorinated hydrocarbons were detected in any of
the soil samples tested. Therefore, past manufacturing processes associated with the "pickle line"
did not contribute to the chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants observed elsewhere within the San
Gabriel Groundwater Basin.

The potential sources of exposure to groundwater, surface water and air previously identified were
removed except for waste reportedly buried at the site. Therefore, the exposure risks to
groundwater, surface water and air associated with the removed sources were eliminated.

Remedial Action Plan ­ Chlorinated Hydrocarbons, Santa Ana, California: A remedial action
plan (RAP) was prepared to: 1) recover groundwater impacted with chlorinated hydrocarbons from
two water bearing zones beneath the manufacturing facility, 2) estimate the combined rate of
groundwater recovery from the two zones during future remediation, and 3) estimate the
concentration of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the combined groundwater discharge. Impacted
groundwater beneath the site occurs in the shallow "A"-zone and deeper "B"-zone aquifers, and
occurs beneath the northern portion of the property and beneath the manufacturing facility building.

Prior to the preparation of the of the RAP, single well step drawdown tests, a 48-hour constant
discharge rate pumping test and a 20-day Pilot Extraction Test were performed. Based on the
testing results, the radius of influence for an extraction well in the "A" zone was approximately 60
feet, and the radius on influence in the "B" zone was approximately 550 feet in the cross-gradient
directions. Using this estimate, two existing and two new extraction wells were proposed to recover
impacted groundwater along the center of the plume from the down-gradient extent to the area of
highest VOC concentrations (up to 22,250 g/l) near the up-gradient boundary.

SURROUNDING SITES: SEARCH RESULTS
Surrounding sites were identified in the following databases.

Elevations have been determined from the USGS Digital Elevation Model and should be evaluated on
a relative (not an absolute) basis. Relative elevation information between sites of close proximity
should be field verified. Sites with an elevation equal to or higher than the target property have been
differentiated below from sites with an elevation lower than the target property.
Page numbers and map identification numbers refer to the EDR Radius Map report where detailed
data on individual sites can be reviewed.

Sites listed in bold italics are in multiple databases.

Unmappable (orphan) sites are not considered in the foregoing analysis.


FEDERAL RECORDS
RCRAInfo: RCRAInfo is EPA's comprehensive information system, providing access to data supporting
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA) of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)
of 1984. RCRAInfo replaces the data recording and reporting abilities of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Information System(RCRIS). The database includes selective information on sites which generate,
transport, store , treat and/or dispose of hazardous waste as defined by the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA). Conditionally exempt small quantity generators (CESQGs) generate less than 100 kg of
hazardous waste, or less than 1 kg of acutely hazardous waste per month. Small quantity generators (SQGs)
generate between 100 kg and 1,000 kg of hazardous waste per month Large quantity generators generate over
1,000 kilograms (kg) of hazardous waste, or over 1 kg of acutely hazardous waste per month. Transporters are
individuals or entities that move hazardous waste from the generator offsite to a facility that can recycle,
treat, store, or dispose of the waste. TSDFs treat, store, or dispose of the waste.

   A review of the RCRA-SQG list, as provided by EDR, and dated 06/13/2006 has revealed that there are 9
   RCRA-SQG sites within approximately 0.25 miles of the target property.

ENVIROSTOR: The Department of Toxic Substances Control's (DTSC's) Site Mitigation and Brownfields
Reuse Program's (SMBRP's) EnviroStor database identifes sites that have known contamination or sites for which
there may be reasons to investigate further. The database includes the following site types: Federal
Superfund sites (National Priorities List (NPL)); State Response, including Military Facilities and State
Superfund; Voluntary Cleanup; and School sites. EnviroStor provides similar information to the information
that was available in CalSites, and provides additional site information, including, but not limited to,
identification of formerly-contaminated properties that have been released for reuse, properties where
environmental deed restrictions have been recorded to prevent inappropriate land uses, and risk
characterization information that is used to assess potential impacts to public health and the environment at
contaminated sites.

   A review of the ENVIROSTOR list, as provided by EDR, and dated 08/28/2007 has revealed that there are
   3 ENVIROSTOR sites within approximately 1 mile of the target property.

EDR PROPRIETARY RECORDS
EDR Manufactured Gas Plants: The EDR Proprietary Manufactured Gas Plant Database includes records of coal gas plants
(manufactured gas plants) compiled by EDR's researchers. Manufactured gas sites were used in the United States

from the 1800's to 1950's to produce a gas that could be distributed and used as fuel. These plants used
whale oil, rosin, coal, or a mixture of coal, oil, and water that also produced a significant amount of waste.
Many of the byproducts of the gas production, such as coal tar (oily waste containing volatile and
non-volatile chemicals), sludges, oils and other compounds are potentially hazardous to human health and the
environment. The byproduct from this process was frequently disposed of directly at the plant site and can
remain or spread slowly, serving as a continuous source of soil and groundwater contamination.

    A review of the Manufactured Gas Plants list, as provided by EDR, has revealed that there is 1
   Manufactured Gas Plants site within approximately 1 mile of the target property.

CERCLIS-NFRAP: CERCLIS No Further Remedial Action Planned
    Archived sites are sites that have been removed and archived from the inventory of CERCLIS sites. Archived status
    indicates that, to the best of EPA's knowledge, assessment at a site has been completed and that EPA has determined
    no further steps will be taken to list this site on the National Priorities List (NPL), unless information indicates
    this decision was not appropriate or other considerations require a recommendation for listing at a later time.
    This decision does not necessarily mean that there is no hazard associated with a given site; it only means that,
    based upon available information, the location is not judged to be a potential NPL site.

     RCRAInfo is EPA's comprehensive information system, providing access to data supporting the Resource Conservation
     and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984. RCRAInfo replaces
     the data recording and reporting abilities of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Information System (RCRIS).
     The database includes selective information on sites which generate, transport, store, treat and/or dispose of
     hazardous waste as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Conditionally exempt small
     quantity generators (CESQGs) generate less than 100 kg of hazardous waste, or less than 1 kg of acutely hazardous
     waste per month. Small quantity generators (SQGs) generate between 100 kg and 1,000 kg of hazardous waste per
     month. Large quantity generators (LQGs) generate over 1,000 kilograms (kg) of hazardous waste, or over 1 kg
     of acutely hazardous waste per month. Transporters are individuals or entities that move hazardous waste from
     the generator off-site to a facility that can recycle, treat, store, or dispose of the waste. TSDFs treat, store,
     or dispose of the waste.

    Brownfields Assessment Demonstration Pilots--minimize the uncertainties of contamination often associated with
    brownfields. Under the TBA program, EPA provides funding and/or technical assistance for environmental assessments
    at brownfields sites throughout the country. Targeted Brownfields Assessments supplement and work with other efforts
    under EPA's Brownfields Initiative to promote cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields. Cooperative Agreement
    Recipients-States, political subdivisions, territories, and Indian tribes become Brownfields Cleanup Revolving
    Loan Fund (BCRLF) cooperative agreement recipients when they enter into BCRLF cooperative agreements with the

   shut down, large piles of the sand-like material (mill tailings) remain after uranium has been extracted from
   the ore. Levels of human exposure to radioactive materials from the piles are low; however, in some cases tailings
   were used as construction materials before the potential health hazards of the tailings were recognized.

HIST FTTS: FIFRA/TSCA Tracking System Administrative Case Listing
     A complete administrative case listing from the FIFRA/TSCA Tracking System (FTTS) for all ten EPA regions. The
     information was obtained from the National Compliance Database (NCDB). NCDB supports the implementation of FIFRA
     (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act) and TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act). Some EPA regions
     are now closing out records. Because of that, and the fact that some EPA regions are not providing EPA Headquarters
     with updated records, it was decided to create a HIST FTTS database. It included records that may not be included
     in the newer FTTS database updates. This database is no longer updated.

    Program Facility Sites with Deed / Land Use Restriction. The DTSC Site Mitigation and Brownfields Reuse Program
    (SMBRP) list includes sites cleaned up under the program's oversight and generally does not include current
    or former hazardous waste facilities that required a hazardous waste facility permit. The list represents deed
    restrictions that are active. Some sites have multiple deed restrictions. The DTSC Hazardous Waste Management
    Program (HWMP) has developed a list of current or former hazardous waste facilities that have a recorded land
    use restriction at the local county recorder's office. The land use restrictions on this list were required by
    the DTSC HWMP as a result of the presence of hazardous substances that remain on site after the facility (or
    part of the facility) has been closed or cleaned up. The types of land use restriction include deed notice, deed
    restriction, or a land use restriction that binds current and future owners.

EDR PROPRIETARY RECORDS

Manufactured Gas Plants: EDR Proprietary Manufactured Gas Plants
    The EDR Proprietary Manufactured Gas Plant Database includes records of coal gas plants (manufactured gas plants)
    compiled by EDR's researchers. Manufactured gas sites were used in the United States from the 1800's to 1950's
    to produce a gas that could be distributed and used as fuel. These plants used whale oil, rosin, coal, or a mixture
    of coal, oil, and water that also produced a significant amount of waste. Many of the byproducts of the gas production,
    such as coal tar (oily waste containing volatile and non-volatile chemicals), sludges, oils and other compounds
    are potentially hazardous to human health and the environment. The byproduct from this process was frequently
    disposed of directly at the plant site and can remain or spread slowly, serving as a continuous source of soil
    and groundwater contamination.




                                                                                                                 TC2066137.2s   Page GR-19

EDR's GeoCheck Physical Setting Source Addendum is provided to assist the environmental professional in
forming an opinion about the impact of potential contaminant migration.

Assessment of the impact of contaminant migration generally has two principle investigative components:

 1. Groundwater flow direction, and
 2. Groundwater flow velocity.

Groundwater flow direction may be impacted by surface topography, hydrology, hydrogeology, characteristics
of the soil, and nearby wells. Groundwater flow velocity is generally impacted by the nature of the
geologic strata.




                                                                                     TC2066137.2s Page A-1
                                     GEOCHECK® - PHYSICAL SETTING SOURCE SUMMARY


GROUNDWATER FLOW DIRECTION INFORMATION
Groundwater flow direction for a particular site is best determined by a qualified environmental professional
using site-specific well data. If such data is not reasonably ascertainable, it may be necessary to rely on other
sources of information, such as surface topographic information, hydrologic information, hydrogeologic data
collected on nearby properties, and regional groundwater flow information (from deep aquifers).



TOPOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
Surface topography may be indicative of the direction of surficial groundwater flow. This information can be used to
assist the environmental professional in forming an opinion about the impact of nearby contaminated properties or,
should contamination exist on the target property, what downgradient sites might be impacted.

GROUNDWATER FLOW VELOCITY INFORMATION
Groundwater flow velocity information for a particular site is best determined by a qualified environmental professional
using site specific geologic and soil strata data. If such data are not reasonably ascertainable, it may be necessary
to rely on other sources of information, including geologic age identification, rock stratigraphic unit and soil
characteristics data collected on nearby properties and regional soil information. In general, contaminant plumes
move more quickly through sandy-gravelly types of soils than silty-clayey types of soils.



GEOLOGIC INFORMATION IN GENERAL AREA OF TARGET PROPERTY
Geologic information can be used by the environmental professional in forming an opinion about the relative speed
at which contaminant migration may be occurring.

DOMINANT SOIL COMPOSITION IN GENERAL AREA OF TARGET PROPERTY

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Soil Conservation Service (SCS) leads the National Cooperative Soil
Survey (NCSS) and is responsible for collecting, storing, maintaining and distributing soil survey information
for privately owned lands in the United States. A soil map in a soil survey is a representation of soil patterns
in a landscape. Soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed (SSURGO) soil survey maps.
The following information is based on Soil Conservation Service STATSGO data.

Soil Component Name:                   MONSERATE

Soil Surface Texture:                  sandy loam

Hydrologic Group:                      Class C - Slow infiltration rates. Soils with layers impeding downward
                                       movement of water, or soils with moderately fine or fine textures.

Soil Drainage Class:                   Well drained. Soils have intermediate water holding capacity. Depth to
                                       water table is more than 6 feet.

Hydric Status: Soil does not meet the requirements for a hydric soil.

Corrosion Potential - Uncoated Steel: MODERATE

USGS 7.5' Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
  Source: United States Geologic Survey
  EDR acquired the USGS 7.5' Digital Elevation Model in 2002 and updated it in 2006. The 7.5 minute DEM corresponds
  to the USGS 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-scale topographic quadrangle maps. The DEM provides elevation data
  with consistent elevation units and projection.

Scanned Digital USGS 7.5' Topographic Map (DRG)
  Source: United States Geologic Survey
  A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey topographic map. The map images
  are made by scanning published paper maps on high-resolution scanners. The raster image
  is georeferenced and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection.


HYDROLOGIC INFORMATION

Flood Zone Data: This data, available in select counties across the country, was obtained by EDR in 1999 from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Data depicts 100-year and 500-year flood zones as defined by FEMA.

NWI: National Wetlands Inventory. This data, available in select counties across the country, was obtained by EDR
in 2002 and 2005 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.


HYDROGEOLOGIC INFORMATION

AQUIFLOWR Information System
  Source: EDR proprietary database of groundwater flow information
  EDR has developed the AQUIFLOW Information System (AIS) to provide data on the general direction of groundwater
    flow at specific points. EDR has reviewed reports submitted to regulatory authorities at select sites and has
    extracted the date of the report, hydrogeologically determined groundwater flow direction and depth to water table
    information.

  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) leads the national
  Conservation Soil Survey (NCSS) and is responsible for collecting, storing, maintaining and distributing soil
  survey information for privately owned lands in the United States. A soil map in a soil survey is a representation
  of soil patterns in a landscape. Soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed (SSURGO)
  soil survey maps.

SSURGO: Soil Survey Geographic Database

  Telephone: 800-672-5559
  SSURGO is the most detailed level of mapping done by the Natural Resources Conservation Services, mapping
  scales generally range from 1:12,000 to 1:63,360. Field mapping methods using national standards are used to
  construct the soil maps in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. SSURGO digitizing duplicates the
  original soil survey maps. This level of mapping is designed for use by landowners, townships and county
  natural resource planning and management.

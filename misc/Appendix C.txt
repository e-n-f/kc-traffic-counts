Executive Summary
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed addition of
125,000 square feet (s.f.) of office space and 30,000 s.f. of restaurant space to the mixed-use
development at Santana Row in San Jose, California. The proposed additional office and restaurant
space would be constructed in lieu of 50,000 s.f. of approved retail space. The proposed 125,000 square
feet (s.f.) of office space would be in addition to the already approved but not yet constructed 100,000 s.f.
of office space on the Parcel 11 site. A traffic study was completed for the approved 100,000 s.f. of office
space in January 2008. However, this study analyzes only the proposed 125,000-s.f. increase in office
space along with the restaurant space and reduction in retail space. A new below grade structure on
Parcel 11 as well as other parking facilities within Santana Row will provide parking for the proposed
additional office and restaurant space.


Scope of Study
The purpose of the study is to identify the potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project. The
potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 16 signalized intersections
and 18 directional freeway segments. The study intersections were selected based upon the estimated
number of project trips through the intersection (10 or more trips per lane per hour). The study also
includes an operations analysis, based on vehicle-storage requirements at select intersections and site
access analysis, which includes level of service analysis and vehicle-storage requirements at the
proposed project entrance.
Traffic conditions at all of the study intersections and freeway segments were analyzed for the weekday
AM and PM peak hours. The weekday AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM
and the weekday PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the
most congested traffic conditions occur on a typical weekday.


Project Trip Generation
Hexagon has prepared project trip estimates for the proposed project based on trip generation rates
obtained from ITE's Trip Generation, Eighth Edition, 2008. ITE trip generation rates were used for both
the approved (retail) and proposed uses (office/restaurant) to maintain consistency with the original TIA
prepared for Santana Row.
In addition, the trip estimates for each of the proposed land use components of the proposed project were
reduced to account for internalization, or interaction, between each of the proposed land uses as well as
existing land uses at the Santana Row mixed-use development. The reductions are based on the Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE) procedure for estimating multi-use trip generation as identified in their

                                                                                                                      P a g e | i v

Trip Generation Handbook. Reductions of 3% during the AM peak hour and 13% during the PM peak
hour were applied to the office space and 12% during both peak hours were applied to the restaurant
space. The traffic estimated to be generated by the approved 50,000 s.f. of retail space was subtracted
from the gross project trips to calculate the additional traffic that would be generated by the proposed
office and restaurant space, or the net generated project trips.
Based on the trip generation rates recommended by the City of San Jose and mixed-use reductions, it is
estimated that the project would generate an additional 2,347 daily trips, with 205 trips occurring during
the AM peak hour and 277 trips during the PM peak hour. Using the specified inbound/outbound splits,
the project would produce 180 inbound trips and 25 outbound trips during the AM peak hour and 109
inbound trips and 168 outbound trips during the PM peak hour. The trip distribution pattern for the
proposed project was estimated based on existing travel patterns in the area and the locations of
complementary land uses.


Background Plus Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Table ES-1 summarizes the results of the intersection level of service analysis under background plus
project conditions. The results show that the intersections of Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street and
Stevens Creek Boulevard/Winchester Boulevard will operate at unacceptable LOS E during the PM peak
hour. The intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard is a protected intersection
and is not subject to the City's level of service policy. However, the addition of a second southbound left-
turn lane was included as part of the approved Valley Fair Expansion development. Traffic associated
with the Valley Fair Expansion development is included as part of background conditions of this study.
The Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard intersection will operate at LOS D conditions
during the PM peak hour with the addition of the identified second southbound left-turn lane.
The intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street would be significantly impacted by the
project, according to City of San Jose impact criteria. The impact and proposed improvements to mitigate
the impact are described below.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
Impact:         This intersection would operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour under background
                conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause the average critical
                delay to increase by more than four seconds and the v/c ratio to increase by more than
                one percent (0.01). Based on City of San Jose level of service impact criteria, this
                constitutes a significant impact.
Mitigation:     There are no physical feasible improvements that can be implemented at the Stevens
                Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection itself. However, there are planned
                improvements for the I-880/Stevens Creek Boulevard interchange that is adjacent to the
                Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection. The improvements to the
                interchange will reduce queuing and other operational problems along Stevens Creek
                Boulevard near the interchange, including the Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe
                Street intersection. Therefore, mitigation of the identified project impact at the Stevens
                Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection will consist of a fair-share contribution
                towards improvements to the planned I-880/Stevens Creek Boulevard interchange
                improvements. City staff shall determine the fair-share contribution.


Freeway Segment Analysis
The results of the freeway level of service analysis are summarized in Table ES 2. The freeway level of
service analysis shows that there would be no significant impact under project conditions on any of the
study freeway segments.

                                                                                   Page|v     
Santana Row Parcel 11 Office & Restaurant Space Development                                                        June 6, 2012 


Other Transportation Issues

Site Access
A review of the project site plan for the proposed office space on Parcel 11 was performed to determine if
adequate site access and on-site circulation are provided and to identify any access or circulation issues
that should be improved.

Olsen Drive Site Access and Operations
The proposed parking garage entrance along Olsen Drive driveway will be located at the same location
as the existing driveway that currently serves the surface parking lot on Parcel 11. The existing driveway
is located approximately 340 feet east of Winchester Boulevard and just east of the entrance to the
existing parking garage along the north side of Olsen Drive.
Level of Service Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis indicate that the proposed Parcel 11 garage entrance will
operate at LOS A conditions during the AM and PM peak hours. However, the minor street approach, the
proposed garage entrance in this case, is projected to operate at LOS E conditions during the PM peak
hour. The projected delay at the proposed garage entrance is due to inadequate gaps in the traffic stream
on Olsen Drive that do not allow for turning traffic from the proposed garage entrance.
Vehicular Queuing Analysis
The vehicular queuing analysis indicates that maximum vehicle queues at the proposed garage entrance
on Olsen Drive would not exceed two vehicles (50 feet) on either approach with the exception of the
proposed garage entrance itself, that is projected to have queues of up to six vehicles in the northbound
direction (Garage Exit to Olsen Drive). Therefore, the existing storage capacities at the entrance will be
adequate to accommodate project traffic.
It should be noted that the proposed site design including building locations, parking layout, driveway
locations, and street connections are conceptual only. The final design for these project components, as
well as crosswalks and drive aisles, will be determined with subsequent planning stages.

Winchester Boulevard Access and Operations
As currently proposed, the project would provide inbound access to Parcel 11 via a right-turn only
driveway on Winchester Boulevard, located approximately 200 feet south of Olsen Drive. Based on the
project trip distribution pattern, it was estimated that the proposed office space would generate
approximately 137 inbound trips during the AM peak hour and about 22 inbound trips during the PM peak
hour at this driveway. An inbound volume of 137 AM peak hour vehicles equates to about 2 vehicles
entering the site every minute. Due to the number of inbound project trips during the AM peak hour, this
driveway must be designed such that inbound vehicles are not required to stop once on site. This
recommended driveway design will allow inbound vehicles to flow into the site so that vehicle queues do
not back up onto Winchester Boulevard. The remaining project-generated trips would use Olsen Drive to
access the parking garage.

Truck and Emergency Vehicle Access
To determine if the site driveways are adequate for service and emergency vehicle access, the SU-30
AASHTO design vehicle turning specifications were checked against the driveway and roadway
geometrics associated with the site. The SU-30 design vehicle represents a 30-foot single-unit truck (such
as a garbage truck or fire truck). This procedure revealed that a 30-foot single-unit truck would be able to
make all required turning movements at the project driveways assuming 26-foot driveway widths. The
proposed driveway designs are adequate to accommodate an SU-30 truck.

                                                                                                                     P a g e | v i

Intersection Operational Deficiencies
The operations analysis indicated that the estimated maximum vehicle queues at some of the selected
study locations would exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity under background plus project
conditions. However, the addition of project traffic at the selected study locations would lengthen
projected vehicle queues by no more than one vehicle. Project generated traffic at other locations would
be too low to have a measurable effect on queue lengths.

Winchester Boulevard and WB I-280 On-Ramp
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the Winchester Boulevard and WB I-280 On-Ramp intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity under background plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The southbound left-turn
pocket has 150 feet of vehicle storage, which can accommodate about 6 vehicles. The estimated 95th
percentile vehicle queue during the PM peak hours under background plus project conditions would
exceed the left-turn pocket storage capacity by one vehicle. The existing southbound left-turn pocket
could be extended by removing the existing median and trees. However, a maximum left-turn pocket
storage inadequacy of only one vehicle is a worst-case traffic condition and is not likely to result in any
operational problems at this intersection. In addition, 95 percent of the time the southbound left-turn
pocket would be adequate to serve the estimated project traffic volumes.

Winchester Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the westbound left-turn pocket at the
Winchester Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle
storage capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background plus project
conditions during the PM peak hours of traffic. The westbound dual left-turn pockets have 350 feet of
vehicle storage per lane, which can accommodate about 14 vehicles per lane. The project would not
increase the 95th percentile vehicle queues during the PM peak hour. The left-turn pocket cannot be
extended due to the presence of back-to-back turn pockets. However, a second southbound left-turn lane
at the intersection would provide for more green time to all other approaches and improve intersection
operations.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Santana Row
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the westbound left-turn movement
at the Stevens Creek Boulevard and Santana Row intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity under background plus project conditions during the AM peak hour and currently exceed the
existing vehicle storage capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background
plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The westbound dual left-turn pockets have 150 feet of
vehicle storage per lane, which can accommodate about 6 vehicles per lane. The estimated 95th
percentile vehicle queue during the AM peak hours under background plus project conditions would
exceed the left-turn pocket storage capacity by one vehicle. The addition of project traffic would not
increase the 95th percentile vehicle queues during the PM peak hour.
The segment of Stevens Creek Boulevard between Winchester Boulevard and Monroe Street is regularly
congested during the peak commute periods of the day. Traffic volumes on Stevens Creek Boulevard are
heaviest in the westbound direction during the AM commute period and in the eastbound direction during
the PM commute period. The congestion is caused by the close spacing of several signalized
intersections along the Stevens Creek Boulevard. Left-turn queues in the westbound direction regularly
extend out of the provided turn-pockets at its intersections with Winchester Boulevard and Santana Row
during the PM peak hour. Vehicles making the westbound left-turn movement at Santana Row do not
clear within the allotted green time. Operations along Stevens Creek Boulevard can be improved by
providing longer left-turn pockets into the Santana Row entrance. The longer pockets will allow for more
storage capacity and prevent the blockage of through lanes.

                                                                                   Page|vii

Transit, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Facilities
The project would not have an adverse effect on existing transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities in the
study area.


Cumulative Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of service impact criteria, the
estimated cumulative project trips collectively would create a significant adverse traffic impact at the
following three intersections during the PM peak hour:

    ·     Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard
    ·     Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
    ·     San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard

Since the project would contribute 49, 53, and 17 percent of the increase in total PM peak hour traffic
volume at the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Winchester Boulevard, Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street
San Tomas Expressway/Stevens Creek Boulevard intersections, respectively, the project would
contribute a considerable amount of traffic to these cumulatively impacted intersections. Described below
are the cumulatively significant intersection impacts and possible intersection improvements that can be
implemented at each of the identified impacted intersections to mitigate impacts due to cumulative
growth.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard*
Impact:          This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E)
                 during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                 would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 9.5 seconds and the
                 volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.036 during the PM peak hour. This
                 constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                 cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                 intersection would be 49 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:      The significant cumulative impact to this intersection could be mitigated with the addition
                 of a second southbound left-turn lane. With this modification, the intersection would
                 operate at an acceptable level (LOS D) during the PM peak hour.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
Impact:          This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E)
                 during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                 would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 12.5 seconds and the
                 volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.049 during the PM peak hour. This
                 constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                 cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                 intersection would be 53 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:       Note that the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street intersection would be significantly
                  impacted by the project during the PM peak hour as described under background plus
                  project conditions (Chapter 5). The improvements that have been proposed to mitigate
                  the project impact at the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street intersection under
                  background plus project conditions also would be effective at improving the intersection
                  operations under cumulative conditions.

San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard*
Impact:        This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS F)
               during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
               would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 8.4 seconds and the
               volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.025 during the PM peak hour. This
               constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
               cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
               intersection would be 17 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:    According to the Comprehensive County Expressway Planning Study Implementation
               Plan, future improvements for San Tomas Expressway include widening of San Tomas
               Expressway from six to eight lanes. This is a Tier 1A project that currently is not funded.
               The widening of San Tomas Expressway would improve the operations of this
               intersection to better than background conditions.

Santana Row Parcel 11 Office & Restaurant Space Development                                      June 6, 2012 




1.       Introduction
This report presents the results of the traffic impact analysis conducted for the proposed addition of
125,000 square feet (s.f.) of office space and 30,000 s.f. of restaurant space to the mixed-use
development at Santana Row in San Jose, California. The proposed additional office and restaurant
space would be constructed in lieu of 50,000 s.f. of approved retail space. The proposed 125,000 square
feet (s.f.) of office space would be in addition to the already approved but not yet constructed 100,000 s.f.
of office space on the Parcel 11 site. A traffic study was completed for the approved 100,000 s.f. of office
space in January 2008. However, this study analyzes only the proposed 125,000-s.f. increase in office
space along with the restaurant space and reduction in retail space. A new below grade structure on
Parcel 11 as well as other parking facilities within Santana Row will provide parking for the proposed
additional office and restaurant space. The project site location and the surrounding study area are shown
on Figure 1. The project site plan is shown on Figure 2.


Scope of Study
The purpose of the study is to identify the potential traffic impacts related to the proposed project. The
potential impacts related to the proposed development were evaluated following the standards and
methodologies set forth by the City of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
(VTA). The VTA administers the County Congestion Management Program (CMP).
The study includes an analysis of AM and PM peak-hour traffic conditions for 16 signalized intersections
and 18 directional freeway segments. The study intersections were selected based upon the estimated
number of project trips through the intersection (10 or more trips per lane per hour). The study also
includes an operations analysis, based on vehicle-storage requirements at select intersections and site
access analysis, which includes level of service analysis and vehicle-storage requirements at the
proposed project entrance.

Traffic conditions at all of the study intersections and freeway segments were analyzed for the weekday
AM and PM peak hours. The weekday AM peak hour of traffic is generally between 7:00 and 9:00 AM
and the weekday PM peak hour is typically between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. It is during these periods that the
most congested traffic conditions occur on a typical weekday. Traffic conditions were evaluated for the
following scenarios:
   Scenario 1:   Existing Conditions. Existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes were obtained from
                 the City of San Jose and supplemented with new manual turning-movement counts
                 conducted in February and September 2011.

   Scenario 2:   Existing Plus Project Conditions. Existing plus project peak hour traffic volumes were
                 estimated by adding to existing traffic volumes the additional traffic generated by the
                 project. Existing plus project conditions were evaluated relative to existing conditions in
                 order to determine the effects the project would have on the existing roadway network.

   Scenario 3:   Background Conditions. Background traffic volumes were estimated by adding to
                 existing peak hour volumes the projected volumes from approved but not yet completed
                 developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet completed developments
                 was provided by the City of San Jose in the form of the Approved Trips Inventory (ATI).
                 Background conditions represent the baseline conditions to which project conditions are
                 compared for the purpose of determining project impacts.

   Scenario 4:   Background Plus Project Conditions. Projected peak hour traffic volumes with the
                 project were estimated by adding to background traffic volumes the additional traffic
                 generated by the project. Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to
                 background conditions in order to determine potential project impacts, according to the
                 City of San Jose Level of Service (LOS) Policy. The City of San Jose LOS Policy is the
                 adopted established threshold for California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).


                                                                            Page|4

    Scenario 5:   Cumulative Conditions. Cumulative conditions were represented by future traffic
                  volumes, at the date of project occupancy, on the future roadway network. Traffic
                  volumes under cumulative conditions were estimated by applying an annual growth
                  factor of 1.2 percent over 2 years to existing traffic volumes, adding trips from approved
                  developments, and adding project trips. This scenario was evaluated in order to fulfill
                  the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirement.


Methodology
This section presents the methods used to determine the traffic conditions for each scenario described
above. It includes descriptions of the data requirements, the analysis methodologies, and the applicable
level of service standards.

Data Requirements
The data required for the analysis were obtained from previous traffic studies, new traffic counts, the City
of San Jose, the CMP Annual Monitoring Report, and field observations. The following data were
collected from these sources:

·   existing traffic volumes
·   lane configurations
·   signal timing and phasing
·   average speeds on freeway segments
·   a list of approved and planned projects

Analysis Methodologies and Level of Service Standards
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). Level of Service
is a qualitative description of operating conditions ranging from LOS A, or free-flow conditions with little or
no delay, to LOS F, or jammed conditions with excessive delays. The analysis methods are described
below.

City of San Jose Signalized Intersections
All of the signalized study intersections are located in the City of San Jose and are therefore subject to
the City of San Jose Level of Service standards. The City of San Jose level of service methodology is
TRAFFIX, which is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method for signalized
intersections. TRAFFIX evaluates signalized intersections operations on the basis of average control
delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Since TRAFFIX is also the CMP-designated intersections
level of service methodology, the City of San Jose methodology employs the CMP defaults values for the
analysis parameters. The City of San Jose level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS D
or better. The correlation between average delay and level of service is shown in Table 1.

CMP Signalized Intersections
Since TRAFFIX is the designated level of service methodology for both the CMP and the City of San
Jose, the CMP study intersections are not analyzed separately, but rather are among the City of San
Jose signalized intersections analyzed using TRAFFIX. The only difference between the San Jose and
CMP analyses is that project impacts are determined on the basis of different level of service standards ­
the CMP level of service standard for signalized intersections is LOS E or better.

Freeway Segments
As prescribed in the CMP technical guidelines, the level of service for freeway segments is estimated
based on vehicle density. Density is calculated by the following formula:
                  D = V / (N*S)
                  Where:
                  D= density, in vehicles per mile per lane (vpmpl)
                  V= peak hour volume, in vehicles per hour (vph)
                  N= number of travel lanes
                  S= average travel speed, in miles per hour (mph)

The vehicle density on a segment is correlated to level of service as shown in Table 2. The CMP specifies
that a capacity of 2,300 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) be used for mixed-flow lane segments that are
three lanes or wider in one direction, and a capacity of 2,200 vphpl be used for mixed-flow lane segments
that are two lanes wide in one direction. A capacity of 1,800 vphpl was used for high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lanes. The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better.

Intersection Operations
The analysis of intersection level of service is often supplemented with an analysis of intersection
operations for selected intersections where the project would add a significant number of left-turning
vehicles. The operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high-demand movements at
intersections. Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the
probability of "n" vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

                                                                             Page|6

    A       Average operating speeds at the free-flow speed generally prevail. Vehicles                0-11
            are almost completely unimpeded in their ability to maneuver within the traffic
            stream.
    B       Speeds at the free-flow speed are generally maintained. The ability to                    >11-18
            maneuver within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted, and the general
            level of physical and psychological comfort provided to drivers is still high.
    C       Speeds at or near the free-flow speed of the freeway prevail. Freedom to                  >18-26
            maneuver within the traffic stream is noticeably restricted, and lane changes
            require more vigilance on the part of the driver.
    D       Speeds begin to decline slightly with increased flows at this level. Freedom to           >26-46
            maneuver within the traffic stream is more noticeably limited, and the driver
            experiences reduced physical and psychological comfort levels.
    E       At this level, the freeway operates at or near capacity. Operations in this level         >46-58
            are volatile, because there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic stream,
            leaving little room to maneuver within the traffic stream.

                             n!
        Where:

        P (x=n) = probability of "n" vehicles in queue per lane
        n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         = average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
            per hour)

The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-
turn storage requirements at signalized intersections.
The 95th percentile queue length value indicates that during the peak hour, a queue of this length or less
would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles. Or, a queue length larger than the 95th percentile queue
would only occur on 5 percent of the signal cycles (about 3 cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a
60-second cycle length). Therefore, left-turn storage pocket designs based on the 95th percentile queue
length would ensure that storage space would be exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95th percentile
queue length is also known as the "design queue length".

2.
Existing Conditions
This chapter describes the existing conditions for all of the major transportation facilities in the vicinity of
the site, including the roadway network, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Also included
are the existing levels of service of the key intersections and freeway segments in the study area.


Existing Roadway Network
Regional access to the project site is provided via I-880 and I-280. These facilities are described below.
I-880 is a six-lane freeway in the vicinity of the site. It extends north to Oakland and south to I-280 in San
Jose, at which point it makes a transition into SR 17 to Santa Cruz. Access to the site is provided via its
interchange with Stevens Creek Boulevard.

I-280 is an eight-lane freeway in the vicinity of the site. It extends northwest to San Francisco and east to
King Road in San Jose, at which point it makes a transition into I-680 to Oakland. Access to the site is
provided via its interchange with Winchester Boulevard.

Local access to the site is provided by Stevens Creek Boulevard, Winchester Boulevard, Tisch Way, and
Monroe Street. These roadways are described below.
Stevens Creek Boulevard is a divided six-lane east-west roadway in the vicinity of the project site. It
extends from Cupertino eastward to I-880, at which point it makes a transition into San Carlos Street to
Downtown San Jose. Access to the site is provided via its full access signalized intersection at Santana
Row.
Winchester Boulevard is a divided six-lane north-south roadway that runs from Los Gatos to Lincoln
Street in Santa Clara. Winchester Boulevard provides direct access to the Parcel 11 site via Olsen Drive.
Tisch Way is a two-lane east-west roadway that extends east from Winchester Boulevard to South
Monroe Street. Access to the site is provided via Winchester Boulevard.
South Monroe Street is a two-lane north-south roadway that extends north from Tisch Way to Stevens
Creek Boulevard.


Existing Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
There are no county designated bike lanes in the vicinity of the project site. However, some roadways
that do not provide designated bike lanes are identified bike routes.
Pedestrian facilities in the project area consist primarily of sidewalks along the streets. Sidewalks are
found along virtually all previously described local roadways in the study area and along the local

                                                                            Page|9

residential streets and collectors near the site. At South Monroe Street and Tisch Way, there is a
pedestrian footbridge over I-280 to South Monroe Street and Moorpark Avenue.


Existing Transit Service
Existing transit service to the study area is provided by the VTA. The VTA bus service is described below
and shown on Figure 3.

VTA Bus Service
The Valley Fair Transit Center is located at Valley Fair shopping mall, north of Santana Row, within close
proximity of the project site. The Valley Fair Transit Center is served by two bus lines (lines 23 and 60).
The 23 line provides service between DeAnza College and the Alum Rock Transit Center via Stevens
Creek Boulevard, with 10-15-minute headways during commute hours. The 60 line provides service
between the Winchester Transit Center and Great America via Winchester Boulevard, with 15-20-minute
headways during commute hours. Other bus lines in the vicinity of the project site include the 25 line that
provides service between the Alum Rock Transit Center and De Anza College, with 10-20-minute
headways during commute hours. The nearest bus stop locations are located at the Olin Avenue and
Olsen Drive intersections with Winchester Boulevard.


Existing Intersection Lane Configurations
The existing lane configurations at the study intersections were determined by observations in the field
and are shown on Figure 4.


Existing Traffic Volumes
Existing peak-hour traffic volumes were obtained from the City of San Jose TRAFFIX database and new
intersection turn-movement counts (conducted in February and September 2011) where counts were two
or more years old. The existing peak-hour intersection volumes are shown on Figure 5. Intersection
turning-movement counts conducted for this analysis are presented in Appendix A.


Existing Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of San Jose and CMP standards. The results of
the intersection level of service analysis under existing conditions are summarized in Table 3.

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of
service policy, the study intersection of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard currently
operates at an unacceptable LOS E during the PM peak hour.
All other study intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS D or better during both the AM and
PM peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against CMP standards, all of the CMP
intersections currently operate at an acceptable LOS E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of
traffic.
The intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Traffic volumes for the study freeway segments were obtained from the 2010 CMP Annual Monitoring
Report, which contains the most recent data collected for freeway segments located in Santa Clara
County. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 4. The results show 13 of the 18 directional
study freeway segments currently operate at an unacceptable LOS F during at least one peak hour of
traffic:
        Northbound SR 17, between Hamilton Avenue and I-280 (AM Peak Hour)
        Northbound I-880 between I-280 and Stevens Creek Boulevard (AM Peak Hour)
        Northbound I-880 between Stevens Creek Boulevard and Bascom Avenue (AM Peak Hour)
        Northbound I-880 between Bascom Avenue and The Alameda (AM Peak Hour)
        Eastbound I-280 between Lawrence Expressway and Saratoga Avenue (PM Peak Hour)

Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational deficiencies and to
confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this effort was (1) to identify any
existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to intersection level of service, and (2) to identify
any locations where the level of service calculation does not accurately reflect level of service in the field.
Field observations revealed the following operational problems that may not be reflected in level of
service calculations:
In general, Stevens Creek Boulevard experiences heavy congestion during the weekday PM peak hour in
both directions of travel between Winchester Boulevard and I-880. The congestion is made worse by the
close spacing of several signalized intersections along the roadway. At its intersections with I-880 and
Monroe Street, vehicles do not clear at nearly every approach during the PM peak hour. Left-turn queues
in the westbound direction regularly extend out of the provided turn-pockets at its intersections with
Winchester Boulevard and Santana Row during the PM peak hour. Vehicles making the westbound left-
turn movement at Santana Row do not clear within the allotted green time. Left-turn pockets in the
eastbound direction are adequate with no vehicles spilling out of the provided storage.
Operations along Stevens Creek Boulevard can be improved by providing longer left-turn pockets into the
Santana Row entrance. The longer pockets will allow for more storage capacity and prevent the blockage
of through lanes. A second southbound left-turn lane at the intersection with Winchester Boulevard would
provide for more green time to all other approaches and improve intersection operations. Improvements
to the intersections near the Monroe Street and I-880 intersections are physically restricted. There are
planned improvements at the Stevens Creek Boulevard and I-880 interchange that will provide additional
capacity.
The right lane on eastbound Stevens Creek Boulevard is sometimes congested from I-880 to Santana
Row. In addition, some vehicles aggressively enter the right lane at the last minute to avoid the long wait.
A possible improvement is to add storage to the on-ramp. There are planned improvements to the I-
880/Stevens Creek Boulevard/I-280 interchange. The improvements to the interchange will reduce
queuing and other operational problems along Stevens Creek Boulevard near the interchange.
All other study intersections operate without any major operational problems.

Existing Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes existing traffic conditions with the addition of the traffic that would be generated by
the proposed project. Existing plus project traffic conditions could potentially exist if the project was
constructed and occupied prior to the other approved projects in the area. It is unlikely that this traffic
condition would occur, since other approved projects expected to add traffic to the study area would likely
be built and occupied during the time the project is going through the development review and
construction process. This scenario describes a less congested traffic condition, since it ignores any
potential traffic from prior approvals. Existing plus project conditions also does not include any planned
and funded roadway improvements that have not been constructed.


Transportation Network Under Existing Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under existing plus project conditions would
be the same as the existing transportation network.


Project Description
The project includes the construction of 125,000 square feet (s.f.) of office space in addition to the
approved but not yet constructed 100,000 s.f. of office space on Parcel 11, for a grand total of 225,000
s.f. of office space. A traffic study was completed for the approved 100,000 s.f. of office space in January
2008. It should be noted that although the proposed project consists of only the addition of 125,000 s.f. of
office space, because the evaluation of existing plus project conditions requires the analysis of all future
land uses on site, whether they be approved or proposed, the analysis of the project under existing plus
project conditions includes the entire office development (approved 100,000 s.f. plus proposed 125,000
s.f. = 225,000 s.f.) along with the additional 30,000 s.f. of restaurant space. Similarly, the removal of the
approved 50,000 s.f. of retail space is not included within existing plus project conditions.


Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution step, an estimate is made
of the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment step, the
project trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections in the study area. These procedures are
described further in the following sections.



                                                                            Page|18

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation
rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development.
Hexagon has prepared project trip estimates for the proposed project based on trip generation rates
obtained from ITE's Trip Generation, Eighth Edition, 2008. ITE trip generation rates were used to maintain
consistency with the original TIA prepared for Santana Row.
In addition, the trip estimates for each of the land use components of the proposed project were reduced
to account for internalization, or interaction, between each of the proposed land uses as well as existing
land uses at the Santana Row mixed-use development. The reductions are based on the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) procedure for estimating multi-use trip generation as identified in their Trip
Generation Handbook. Reductions of 3% during the AM peak hour and 13% during the PM peak hour
were applied to the office space and 12% during both peak hours were applied to the restaurant space.
Based on the ITE trip generation rates and mixed-use reductions, it is estimated that the project would
generate an additional 4,791 daily trips, with 370 trips occurring during the AM peak hour and 486 trips
during the PM peak hour. Using the specified inbound/outbound splits, the project would produce 318
inbound trips and 53 outbound trips during the AM peak hour and 182 inbound trips and 304 outbound
trips during the PM peak hour. The project trip generation estimates are presented below in Table 5.

Trip Distribution
Peak hour project traffic was distributed to the transportation network based on existing travel patterns on
the surrounding roadway system and the locations of complementary land uses. The trip distribution
utilized in this analysis is identical to that used in the completed traffic study for the approved 100,000-s.f.
office space on the project site as well as other retail/restaurant uses at Santana Row. The project trip
distribution pattern is shown graphically on Figure 6.

Trip Assignment
The peak-hour trips associated with the proposed project were added to the transportation network
in accordance with the distribution pattern discussed above. Figure 7 shows the assignment of
project traffic on the local transportation network. A tabular summary of project traffic at each study
intersection is contained in Appendix C.


Existing Plus Project Traffic Volumes
Project trips, as represented in the above project trip assignment, were added to existing traffic volumes
to obtain existing plus project traffic volumes. The existing plus project traffic volumes are shown on
Figure 8. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.


Existing Plus Project Intersection Analysis

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under existing plus project conditions are
summarized in Table 6. The results show that the study intersection of San Tomas Expressway and
Stevens Creek Boulevard would continue to operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour. The remaining
study intersections would operate at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours.

CMP Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that all of the CMP study intersections would operate at
LOS E or better during the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.
The level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

Background Conditions
This chapter presents background traffic conditions, which are defined as conditions just prior to
completion of the proposed project. It describes the planned transportation system, the procedure used to
determine background traffic volumes, and the resulting traffic conditions. The background scenario
predicts a realistic traffic condition that would occur as approved development gets built and occupied.


Background Transportation Network
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under background conditions would be the
same as the existing transportation network.


Background Traffic Volumes
Background peak hour traffic volumes were estimated by adding to existing volumes the estimated traffic
from approved but not yet constructed developments. The added traffic from approved but not yet
constructed developments was obtained from the City of San Jose's Approved Trips Inventory (ATI)
database. The background traffic scenario predicts a realistic traffic condition that would occur as
approved development is built. Background traffic volumes are shown on Figure 9. The approved trips
and traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C. The ATI is contained in
Appendix B.


Intersection Levels of Service Under Background Conditions
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against City of San Jose and CMP standards. The results of
the intersection level of service analysis under background conditions are summarized in Table 7. The
intersection level of service calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.

City of San Jose Intersection Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of
service policy, the following study intersections would operate at unacceptable levels of service under
background conditions:

    ·   Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard ­ LOS E during the PM peak hour
    ·   Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street ­ LOS E during the PM peak hour
    ·   San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard ­ LOS E during the PM peak hour

All other study intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS D or better under background
conditions during both the AM and PM peak hours of traffic.

CMP Intersections
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against CMP standards, all of the CMP
intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS E or better under background conditions during the AM
and PM peak hours.

Background Plus Project Conditions
This chapter describes near-term traffic conditions that most likely would occur when the project is
complete. It includes a description of the City of San Jose significance criteria used to establish what
constitutes a project impact, a description of the transportation system under background plus project
conditions, the method by which project traffic is estimated, and any impacts caused by the project.
Background plus project conditions were evaluated relative to background conditions in order to
determine potential project impacts. This traffic scenario represents a more congested traffic condition
than the existing plus project scenario, since it includes traffic generated by approved projects in the area
that are built and occupied.
This traffic analysis assumes the project would consist of the addition of 125,000 square feet (s.f.) of
office space and 30,000 s.f. of restaurant space to the mixed-use development at Santana Row. The
proposed additional office and restaurant space would be constructed in lieu of 50,000 s.f. of approved
retail space. The proposed 125,000 square feet (s.f.) of office space would be in addition to an already
approved but not yet constructed 100,000 s.f. of office space on the Parcel 11 site. Access to the Parcel
11 site would be provided via Olsen Drive and Winchester Boulevard.


Significant Impact Criteria
Significance criteria are used to establish what constitutes an impact. For this analysis, the criteria used
to determine significant impacts on signalized intersections are based on City of San Jose Level of
Service standards. The City of San Jose LOS Policy is the adopted established threshold for CEQA.
Project impacts also were analyzed according to the County Congestion Management Program (CMP)
methodology for the four CMP study intersections and study freeway segments.

City of San Jose Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The project is said to create a significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection
in the City of San Jose if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
       background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under background plus project conditions,
       or
    2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
       conditions and the addition of project trips causes both the critical-movement delay at the
       intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to
       increase by one percent (.01) or more.




                                                                            Page|30  
Santana Row Parcel 11 Office & Restaurant Space Development                                       June 6, 2012 


An exception to this rule applies when the addition of project traffic reduces the amount of average
stopped delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average stopped delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by .01 or more.
A significant impact by City of San Jose standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures
are implemented that would restore intersection level of service to background conditions or better.

CMP Definition of Significant Intersection Impacts
The definition of a significant impact at a CMP intersection is the same as for the City of San Jose, except
that the CMP standard for acceptable level of service at a CMP intersection is LOS E or better. A
significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore intersection conditions to background conditions or better.

CMP Definition of Significant Freeway Segment Impacts
The CMP defines an acceptable level of service for freeway segments as LOS E or better. A project is
said to create a significant impact on traffic conditions on a freeway segment if for either peak hour:
    1. The level of service on the freeway segment degrades from an acceptable LOS E or better under
       existing conditions to an unacceptable LOS F under background plus project conditions, or
    2. The level of service on the freeway segment is LOS F under background plus project conditions
       and the number of project trips on that segment constitutes at least one percent of capacity on
       that segment.
A significant impact by CMP standards is said to be satisfactorily mitigated when measures are
implemented that would restore freeway conditions to background conditions or better.


Transportation Network Under Background Plus Project Conditions
It is assumed in this analysis that the transportation network under project conditions would be the same
as described under background conditions.


Project Trip Estimates
The magnitude of traffic produced by a new development and the locations where that traffic would
appear are estimated using a three-step process: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, and (3) trip
assignment. In determining project trip generation, the magnitude of traffic entering and exiting the site is
estimated for the AM and PM peak hours. As part of the project trip distribution, an estimate is made of
the directions to and from which the project trips would travel. In the project trip assignment, the project
trips are assigned to specific streets and intersections.

Trip Generation
Through empirical research, data have been collected that correlate to common land uses their
propensity for producing traffic. Thus, for the most common land uses there are standard trip generation
rates that can be applied to help predict the future traffic increases that would result from a new
development.
Hexagon has prepared project trip estimates for the proposed project based on trip generation rates
obtained from ITE's Trip Generation, Eighth Edition, 2008. ITE trip generation rates were used for both
the approved (retail) and proposed uses (office/restaurant) to maintain consistency with the original TIA
prepared for Santana Row.

                                                                            Page|31  
Santana Row Parcel 11 Office & Restaurant Space Development                                        June 6, 2012 


In addition, the trip estimates for each of the land use components of the proposed project were reduced
to account for internalization, or interaction, between each of the proposed land uses as well as existing
land uses at the Santana Row mixed-use development. The reductions are based on the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) procedure for estimating multi-use trip generation as identified in their Trip
Generation Handbook. Reductions of 3% during the AM peak hour and 13% during the PM peak hour
were applied to the office space and 12% during both peak hours were applied to the restaurant space.
The traffic estimated to be generated by the approved 50,000 s.f. of retail space was subtracted from the
gross project trips to calculate the additional traffic that would be generated by the proposed office and
restaurant space, or the net generated project trips.
Based on the trip generation rates recommended by the City of San Jose and mixed-use reductions, it is
estimated that the project would generate an additional 2,347 daily trips, with 205 trips occurring during
the AM peak hour and 277 trips during the PM peak hour. Using the specified inbound/outbound splits,
the project would produce 180 inbound trips and 25 outbound trips during the AM peak hour and 109
inbound trips and 168 outbound trips during the PM peak hour. The project trip generation estimates are
presented below in Table 8.

Trip Distribution and Assignment
The trip distribution pattern for the proposed project was estimated based on traffic patterns on the
surrounding roadway system and on the locations of complementary land uses. The trip distribution
utilized in this analysis is identical to that used in the completed traffic study for the approved 100,000-s.f.
office space on the project site as well as other retail/restaurant uses at Santana Row. The project trip
distribution pattern is shown graphically on Figure 6 in Chapter 3.
The peak-hour trips associated with the proposed project were added to the transportation network in
accordance with the distribution pattern discussed above. The trips generated by the approved 50,000 s.f.
of retail space were assigned separately and subtracted from the proposed office and restaurant trips.
Figure 10 shows the assignment of net project traffic on the local transportation network. A tabular
summary of project traffic at each study intersection is contained in Appendix C.


Background Plus Project Traffic Volumes
The project trips were added to background traffic volumes to obtain background plus project traffic
volumes. The background plus project traffic volumes at the study intersections are shown graphically on
Figure 11. Traffic volumes for all components of traffic are tabulated in Appendix C.


Intersection LOS Under Background Plus Project Conditions
Intersection levels of service were evaluated against the City of San Jose Level of Service Policy. The
results of the level of service analysis under background plus project conditions are summarized in Table
9.
The results of the level of service analysis show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of
service policy, the following study intersections would operate at unacceptable levels of service under
background plus project conditions:

    ·   Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard ­ LOS E during the PM peak hour
    ·   Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street ­ LOS E during the PM peak hour
    ·   San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard ­ LOS E during the PM peak hour

The intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard is a protected intersection and is
not subject to the City's level of service policy. However, the addition of a second southbound left-turn
lane was included as part of the approved Valley Fair Expansion development. Traffic associated with the

Valley Fair Expansion development is included as part of background conditions of this study. The
Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard intersection will operate at LOS D conditions during
the PM peak hour with the addition of the identified second southbound left-turn lane.
Based on the City of San Jose significance criteria, the intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard and
Monroe Street would be significantly impacted by the project. The addition of project traffic at the
intersection of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard will not be sufficient to meet the
City's significance criteria. The impact and proposed improvements to mitigate the impact is described
below.




                                                                                Page|36

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
Impact:          This intersection would operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour under background
                 conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause the average critical
                 delay to increase by more than four seconds and the v/c ratio to increase by more than
                 one percent (0.01). Based on City of San Jose level of service impact criteria, this
                 constitutes a significant impact.
Mitigation:      There are no physical feasible improvements that can be implemented at the Stevens
                 Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection itself. However, there are planned
                 improvements for the I-880/Stevens Creek Boulevard interchange that is adjacent to the
                 Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection. The improvements to the
                 interchange will reduce queuing and other operational problems along Stevens Creek
                 Boulevard near the interchange, including the Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe
                 Street intersection. Therefore, mitigation of the identified project impact at the Stevens
                 Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection will consist of a fair-share contribution
                 towards improvements to the planned I-880/Stevens Creek Boulevard interchange
                 improvements. City staff shall determine the fair-share contribution.
The implementation of the above intersection mitigation measure will reduce the project's impact on
transportation/traffic to a less-than-significant impact with mitigation. According to CMP impact criteria,
none of the CMP intersections would be significantly impacted by the project. The level of service
calculation sheets are included in Appendix D.


Traffic Operations at the Significantly Impacted Intersections
Traffic conditions at the study intersections were evaluated using level of service (LOS). The level of
service methodology for signalized intersections is the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method.
This method is applied using TRAFFIX software and evaluates signalized intersection operations on the
basis of average control delay time for all vehicles at the intersection. Note that the TRAFFIX level of
service calculation sheets (Appendix D) include vehicle delay, as well as volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio,
for each individual movement at the intersection. In addition, the intersection level of service analysis was
supplemented with an evaluation of vehicle queuing (length or number of vehicles) for individual high
demand turn movements at the study intersections. Average control delay, vehicle delay, and V/C ratio
for individual movements, and vehicle queuing collectively provide a useful measure of effectiveness
(MOE) for describing traffic operational conditions at an intersection. A detailed vehicle queuing analysis
is included in Chapter 6 of this traffic report.


Freeway Segment Level of Service Analysis
The results of the CMP freeway level of service analysis are summarized in Table 10. Traffic volumes on
the study freeway segments under background plus project conditions were estimated by adding project
trips to the existing volumes obtained from the 2010 CMP Annual Monitoring Report. The results show
that the project would not cause an increase in traffic volumes of one percent or more of freeway capacity
on any of the study freeway segments. Therefore, based on CMP impact criteria, the project would not
have a significant impact on freeways.

Other Transportation Issues
This chapter presents an analysis of other transportation issues associated with the project site, including:

    ·   Potential impacts to transit, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities
    ·   Site access and traffic operations under background plus project conditions
    ·   Intersection operations analysis ­ vehicle queuing and left-turn pocket storage at intersections
    ·   Freeway on-ramp meter analysis
Unlike the level of service impact methodology, which is adopted by the City Council, the analyses in this
chapter are based on professional judgment in accordance with the standards and methods employed by
the traffic engineering community.


Site Access and On-Site Circulation
With the exception of a limited access driveway along Winchester Boulevard, the project is not proposing
any additional access points to serve Parcel 11 or Santana Row. Parcel 11 will be served by one limited
access (inbound only) driveway on Winchester Boulevard and one full access driveway along Olsen
Drive. With the construction of a new parking structure on the project parcel it is expected that the
majority of vehicles bound for Parcel 11 will utilize the Olsen Drive and Winchester Boulevard entrances.

There are plans to extend Hatton Street south within the Santana Row project boundary. The extension
would be a private street constructed in conjunction with the future development of Parcel 10. The exact
alignment of the Hatton Street extension is yet to be determined, but it could potentially connect with a
planned extension of Hatton Street to Tisch Way that will be completed as part of a separate
development or be constructed to circulate around Parcel 10 and connect to the planned service road
described above. Nonetheless, adequate access to the proposed Parcel 11 is provided via existing
access points. The future extension and alignments of Hatton Street will need to be studied to evaluate
the effects on traffic circulation patterns not only within Santana Row, but also on the surrounding
roadway network.
An evaluation of site access and traffic operations was completed for each of the driveways that will serve
the Parcel 11 site. The details of the evaluation are described below.

Olsen Drive Site Access and Operations
The proposed parking garage entrance along Olsen Drive driveway will be located at the same location
as the existing driveway that currently serves the surface parking lot on Parcel 11. The existing driveway
is located approximately 340 feet east of Winchester Boulevard and just east of the entrance to the
existing parking garage along the north side of Olsen Drive.



                                                                            Page|39

Level of Service Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis indicate that the proposed Parcel 11 garage entrance will
operate at LOS A conditions during the AM and PM peak hours. However, the minor street approach, the
proposed garage entrance in this case, is projected to operate at LOS E conditions during the PM peak
hour. The projected delay at the proposed garage entrance is due to inadequate gaps in the traffic stream
on Olsen Drive that do not allow for turning traffic from the proposed garage entrance. The level of
service calculation sheets are contained in Appendix D.

Vehicular Queuing Analysis
The vehicular queuing analysis indicates that maximum vehicle queues at the proposed garage entrance
on Olsen Drive would not exceed two vehicles (50 feet) on either approach with the exception of the
proposed garage entrance itself, that is projected to have queues of up to six vehicles in the northbound
direction (Garage Exit to Olsen Drive). Therefore, the existing storage capacities at the entrance will be
adequate to accommodate project traffic.
It should be noted that the proposed site design including building locations, parking layout, driveway
locations, and street connections are conceptual only. The final design for these project components, as
well as crosswalks and drive aisles, will be determined with subsequent planning stages.

Winchester Boulevard Access and Operations
As currently proposed, the project would provide inbound access to Parcel 11 via a right-turn only
driveway on Winchester Boulevard, located approximately 200 feet south of Olsen Drive. Based on the
project trip distribution pattern, it was estimated that the proposed office space would generate
approximately 137 inbound trips during the AM peak hour and about 22 inbound trips during the PM peak
hour at this driveway. An inbound volume of 137 AM peak hour vehicles equates to about 2 vehicles
entering the site every minute. Due to the number of inbound project trips during the AM peak hour, this
driveway must be designed such that inbound vehicles are not required to stop once on site. This
recommended driveway design will allow inbound vehicles to flow into the site so that vehicle queues do
not back up onto Winchester Boulevard. The remaining project-generated trips would use Olsen Drive to
access the parking garage.

Truck and Emergency Vehicle Access
To determine if the site driveways are adequate for service and emergency vehicle access, the SU-30
AASHTO design vehicle turning specifications were checked against the driveway and roadway
geometrics associated with the site. The SU-30 design vehicle represents a 30-foot single-unit truck (such
as a garbage truck or fire truck). This procedure revealed that a 30-foot single-unit truck would be able to
make all required turning movements at the project driveways assuming 26-foot driveway widths. The
proposed driveway designs are adequate to accommodate an SU-30 truck.


Intersection Operations Analysis
The analysis of intersection level of service was supplemented with an analysis of intersection operations
for selected intersections where the project would add a significant number of left-turning vehicles. The
operations analysis is based on vehicle queuing for high demand left-turn movements at intersections.
Vehicle queues were estimated using a Poisson probability distribution, which estimates the probability of
"n" vehicles for a vehicle movement using the following formula:

         P (x=n) =       n e ­ ()
                           n!
Where:
         P (x=n) = probability of "n" vehicles in queue per lane

                                                                             Page|40  
Santana Row Parcel 11 Office & Restaurant Space Development                                      June 6, 2012 


        n = number of vehicles in the queue per lane
         = Average number of vehicles in the queue per lane (vehicles per hour per lane/signal cycles
            per hour)
The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to estimate the 95th
percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a particular movement; (2) the
estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet
per vehicle; and (3) the estimated maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned
available storage capacity for the movement. This analysis thus provides a basis for estimating future left-
turn storage requirements at signalized intersections. The 95th percentile queue length value indicates
that during the peak hour, a queue of this length or less would occur on 95 percent of the signal cycles.
Or, a queue length larger than the 95th percentile queue would only occur on 5 percent of the signal
cycles (about 3 cycles during the peak hour for a signal with a 60-second cycle length). Therefore, left-
turn storage pocket designs based on the 95th percentile queue length would ensure that storage space
would be exceeded only 5 percent of the time. The 95th percentile queue length is also known as the
"design queue length". The vehicle queue estimates and a tabulated summary of the findings are
provided in Table 11.

Winchester Boulevard and WB I-280 On-Ramp
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the Winchester Boulevard and WB I-280 On-Ramp intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity under background plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The southbound left-turn
pocket has 150 feet of vehicle storage, which can accommodate about 6 vehicles. The estimated 95th
percentile vehicle queue during the PM peak hours under background plus project conditions would
exceed the left-turn pocket storage capacity by one vehicle. The existing southbound left-turn pocket
could be extended by removing the existing median and trees. However, a maximum left-turn pocket
storage inadequacy of only one vehicle is a worst-case traffic condition and is not likely to result in any
operational problems at this intersection. In addition, 95 percent of the time the southbound left-turn
pocket would be adequate to serve the estimated project traffic volumes.

Winchester Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the westbound left-turn pocket at the
Winchester Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle
storage capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background plus project
conditions during the PM peak hours of traffic. The westbound dual left-turn pockets have 350 feet of
vehicle storage per lane, which can accommodate about 14 vehicles per lane. The project would not
increase the 95th percentile vehicle queues during the PM peak hour. The left-turn pocket cannot be
extended due to the presence of back-to-back turn pockets. However, a second southbound left-turn lane
at the intersection would provide for more green time to all other approaches and improve intersection
operations.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Santana Row
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the westbound left-turn movement
at the Stevens Creek Boulevard and Santana Row intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity under background plus project conditions during the AM peak hour and currently exceed the
existing vehicle storage capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background
plus project conditions during the PM peak hours of traffic. The westbound dual left-turn pockets have
150 feet of vehicle storage per lane, which can accommodate about 6 vehicles per lane. The estimated
95th percentile vehicle queue during the AM peak hours under background plus project conditions would
exceed the left-turn pocket storage capacity by one vehicle. The addition of project traffic would not
increase the 95th percentile vehicle queues during the PM peak hour.

The segment of Stevens Creek Boulevard between Winchester Boulevard and Monroe Street is regularly
congested during the peak commute periods of the day. Traffic volumes on Stevens Creek Boulevard are
heaviest in the westbound direction during the AM commute period and in the eastbound direction during
the PM commute period. The congestion is caused by the close spacing of several signalized
intersections along the Stevens Creek Boulevard. Left-turn queues in the westbound direction regularly
extend out of the provided turn-pockets at its intersections with Winchester Boulevard and Santana Row
during the PM peak hour. Vehicles making the westbound left-turn movement at Santana Row do not
clear within the allotted green time. Operations along Stevens Creek Boulevard can be improved by
providing longer left-turn pockets into the Santana Row entrance. The longer pockets will allow for more
storage capacity and prevent the blockage of through lanes.


Freeway On-Ramp Meter Analysis
An analysis of metered freeway on-ramps providing access to I-280 and I-880 from the project site was
performed to identify the effect of the addition of project traffic on the vehicle queues at the metered on-
ramps. Since the proposed project would generate very little outbound traffic during the AM peak hour,
the metered freeway on-ramps were evaluated during the PM peak hour of traffic only.
The two freeway on-ramps that are metered in the project study area during the PM peak hour are:

    ·   I-280 westbound diagonal on-ramp from Winchester Boulevard
    ·   I-880 southbound on-ramp from Stevens Creek Boulevard
The existing vehicle queue lengths at both metered ramps were measured in the field during the PM peak
hour of traffic. Based on field observations, the longest vehicle queue that developed on the I-880
southbound on-ramp was 10 vehicles in length and the longest vehicle queue that developed on the I-280
westbound on-ramp was 5 vehicles in length. The maximum vehicle queues that were measured in the
field occurred only once during the observation period and never backed up past the I-880/southboundI-
280 eastbound split in the case of the I-880 southbound ramp and to Winchester Boulevard in the case of
the I-280 westbound on-ramp. In fact, vehicle queues of between zero and three vehicles occurred much
more frequently on both metered on-ramps. This inherent variability is characteristic of vehicle queues
that occur at metered ramps during the PM peak hour, and is in contrast to the standing vehicle queues
that typically develop at metered ramps during the AM peak hour of traffic.
The proposed project would add 24 PM peak hour trips to each of the on-ramps. This equates to
approximately one vehicle trip added to each of the ramps every 2.5 minutes. Based on the variability of
the vehicle queues, the project could potentially add a vehicle to the maximum queue if a vehicle were to
arrive at just the right moment when the queue is at its maximum. Thus, it can be concluded that the
addition of PM project trips to the metered on-ramps would have very little effect on vehicle queues at the
ramp.
Based on the on-ramp meter analysis, existing vehicle storage on the I-880 and I-280 on-ramps is
adequate to serve the existing maximum vehicle queues that develop due to ramp metering, and would
continue to adequately serve the estimated maximum vehicle queues that would develop with the addition
of project-generated traffic.


Transit Services
Local bus line 60 operates along Winchester Boulevard adjacent to the project site. Bus stops for this line
in the northbound and southbound directions are located near the Winchester Boulevard/Olin Avenue and
Winchester Boulevard/Olsen Drive intersections, respectively. Due to the convenient location of the bus
stops, it is assumed that some employees of the proposed office development and patrons of the
restaurants space would utilize the existing transit service. Applying an estimated three percent transit
mode share, which is probably the highest that could be expected for the project, equates to
approximately 11 new transit riders during the AM peak hour and 15 new transit riders during the PM
                                                                           Page|43

peak hour. Assuming the existing transit service would remain unchanged with line 60 providing service
with 15-20-minute headways during the peak commute periods at bus stops along Winchester Boulevard,
the estimated number of new transit riders using the bus stops located near the project site would equate
to approximately 5 riders per bus during the AM and PM peak hours. These new riders could be
accommodated by the current available ridership capacity of the bus service in the study area, and no
improvements to the existing transit service would be necessary with the project.


Bicycle Facilities
There are no county designated bike lanes in the vicinity of the project site. However, some roadways
that do not provide designated bike lanes are identified bike routes.


Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian traffic primarily would consist of employees of the proposed office development walking to and
from the parking areas and other retail establishments located within Santana Row, as well as bus stops
on Winchester Boulevard. Crosswalks with pedestrian signal heads are located at all signalized
intersections in the study area. All of the roadways in the vicinity of the project site have sidewalks on
both sides of the street. Thus, the network of sidewalks in the immediate vicinity of the project site would
provide good connectivity between the site and other points of interest, and would serve the anticipated
pedestrian demand.

Cumulative Conditions
This chapter presents a summary of the traffic conditions that would occur under cumulative conditions.
Cumulative development typically includes projects that are in the pipeline (pending projects) but are not
yet approved. This traffic scenario is evaluated in order to fulfill California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) requirements.
The roadway network under cumulative conditions was assumed to be the same as described under
background plus project conditions. Traffic volumes under cumulative conditions were estimated by
applying to the existing volumes an annual growth rate of 1.2 percent over 2 years, then adding the trips
from approved developments and the project trips. Growth factors are commonly used to estimate
potential traffic growth resulting from future projects within Santa Clara County where there are no known
pending projects (such is the case here). The cumulative traffic volumes at the study intersections are
shown graphically in Figure 12. The purpose of analyzing cumulative conditions is to assess the future
traffic conditions that would occur at the time that the proposed development becomes occupied. For this
analysis, the assumed occupancy date is 2014.


San Jose Definition of Significant Cumulative Impacts
A significant cumulative traffic impact at an intersection is identified by comparing cumulative traffic
conditions against background traffic conditions. The cumulative projects collectively would create a
significant adverse impact on traffic conditions at a signalized intersection in the City of San Jose if during
either the AM or PM peak hour:
        1. The level of service at the intersection degrades from an acceptable LOS D or better under
           background conditions to an unacceptable LOS E or F under cumulative conditions, or
        2. The level of service at the intersection is an unacceptable LOS E or F under background
           conditions and the addition of cumulative project trips causes both the critical-movement
           delay at the intersection to increase by four (4) or more seconds and the volume-to-capacity
           ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.01 or more.
An exception to this rule applies when the addition of cumulative project traffic reduces the amount of
average delay for critical movements (i.e., the change in average delay for critical movements is
negative). In this case, the threshold of significance is an increase in the critical V/C value by 0.01 or
more.

Project Contribution to Cumulative Impacts
A single project's contribution to a cumulative intersection impact is deemed considerable in the City of
San Jose if the proportion of project traffic represents 15 percent or more of the increase in total volume
from background traffic conditions to cumulative traffic conditions.

Cumulative Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The intersection level of service results under cumulative conditions are summarized in Table 12. The
results show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of service impact criteria, the estimated
cumulative project trips collectively would create a significant adverse traffic impact at the following three
intersections during the PM peak hour:

    ·     Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard
    ·     Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
    ·     San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard

Since the project would contribute 49, 53, and 17 percent of the increase in total PM peak hour traffic
volume at the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Winchester Boulevard, Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street
San Tomas Expressway/Stevens Creek Boulevard intersections, respectively, the project would
contribute a considerable amount of traffic to these cumulatively impacted intersections. The intersection
level of service calculations are included in Appendix D.


Cumulative Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Described below are the cumulatively significant intersection impacts and possible intersection
improvements that can be implemented at each of the identified impacted intersections to mitigate
impacts due to cumulative growth.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard*
Impact:          This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E)
                 during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                 would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 9.5 seconds and the
                 volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.036 during the PM peak hour. This
                 constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                 cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                 intersection would be 49 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:      The significant cumulative impact to this intersection could be mitigated with the addition
                 of a second southbound left-turn lane. With this modification, the intersection would
                 operate at an acceptable level (LOS D) during the PM peak hour.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
Impact:          This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E)
                 during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                 would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 12.5 seconds and the
                 volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.049 during the PM peak hour. This
                 constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                 cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                 intersection would be 53 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:      Note that the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street intersection would be significantly
                 impacted by the project during the PM peak hour as described under background plus
                 project conditions (Chapter 5). The improvements that have been proposed to mitigate
                 the project impact at the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street intersection under
                 background plus project conditions also would be effective at improving the intersection
                 operations under cumulative conditions.

San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard*
Impact:                  This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS F)
                         during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                         would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 8.4 seconds and the
                         volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.025 during the PM peak hour. This
                         constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                         cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                         intersection would be 17 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:              According to the Comprehensive County Expressway Planning Study Implementation
                         Plan, future improvements for San Tomas Expressway include widening of San Tomas
                         Expressway from six to eight lanes. This is a Tier 1A project that currently is not funded.
                         The widening of San Tomas Expressway would improve the operations of this
                         intersection to better than background conditions.

Conclusions
The potential impacts of the project were evaluated in accordance with the standards set forth by the City
of San Jose and the Congestion Management Program (CMP) of Santa Clara County. The study included
the analysis of AM and PM peak hour traffic conditions for 16 intersections and 18 directional freeway
segments. Project impacts on other transportation facilities, such as bicycle facilities and transit service,
were determined on the basis of engineering judgment.


Background Plus Project Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results show that the intersection of Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street would be
significantly impacted by the project, according to City of San Jose impact criteria. The impact and
proposed improvements to mitigate the impact are described below.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
Impact:         This intersection would operate at LOS E during the PM peak hour under background
                conditions, and the added trips as a result of the project would cause the average critical
                delay to increase by more than four seconds and the v/c ratio to increase by more than
                one percent (0.01). Based on City of San Jose level of service impact criteria, this
                constitutes a significant impact.
Mitigation:     There are no physical feasible improvements that can be implemented at the Stevens
                Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection itself. However, there are planned
                improvements for the I-880/Stevens Creek Boulevard interchange that is adjacent to the
                Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection. The improvements to the
                interchange will reduce queuing and other operational problems along Stevens Creek
                Boulevard near the interchange, including the Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe
                Street intersection. Therefore, mitigation of the identified project impact at the Stevens
                Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street intersection will consist of a fair-share contribution
                towards improvements to the planned I-880/Stevens Creek Boulevard interchange
                improvements. City staff shall determine the fair-share contribution.


Freeway Segment Analysis
The freeway level of service analysis shows that there would be no significant impact under project
conditions on any of the study freeway segments.
                                                                              Page|49

Other Transportation Issues

Site Access
A review of the project site plan for the proposed office space on Parcel 11 was performed to determine if
adequate site access and on-site circulation are provided and to identify any access or circulation issues
that should be improved.

Olsen Drive Site Access and Operations
The proposed parking garage entrance along Olsen Drive driveway will be located at the same location
as the existing driveway that currently serves the surface parking lot on Parcel 11. The existing driveway
is located approximately 340 feet east of Winchester Boulevard and just east of the entrance to the
existing parking garage along the north side of Olsen Drive.
Level of Service Analysis
The results of the level of service analysis indicate that the proposed Parcel 11 garage entrance will
operate at LOS A conditions during the AM and PM peak hours. However, the minor street approach, the
proposed garage entrance in this case, is projected to operate at LOS E conditions during the PM peak
hour. The projected delay at the proposed garage entrance is due to inadequate gaps in the traffic stream
on Olsen Drive that do not allow for turning traffic from the proposed garage entrance.
Vehicular Queuing Analysis
The vehicular queuing analysis indicates that maximum vehicle queues at the proposed garage entrance
on Olsen Drive would not exceed two vehicles (50 feet) on either approach with the exception of the
proposed garage entrance itself, that is projected to have queues of up to six vehicles in the northbound
direction (Garage Exit to Olsen Drive). Therefore, the existing storage capacities at the entrance will be
adequate to accommodate project traffic.
It should be noted that the proposed site design including building locations, parking layout, driveway
locations, and street connections are conceptual only. The final design for these project components, as
well as crosswalks and drive aisles, will be determined with subsequent planning stages.

Winchester Boulevard Access and Operations
As currently proposed, the project would provide inbound access to Parcel 11 via a right-turn only
driveway on Winchester Boulevard, located approximately 200 feet south of Olsen Drive. Based on the
project trip distribution pattern, it was estimated that the proposed office space would generate
approximately 137 inbound trips during the AM peak hour and about 22 inbound trips during the PM peak
hour at this driveway. An inbound volume of 137 AM peak hour vehicles equates to about 2 vehicles
entering the site every minute. Due to the number of inbound project trips during the AM peak hour, this
driveway must be designed such that inbound vehicles are not required to stop once on site. This
recommended driveway design will allow inbound vehicles to flow into the site so that vehicle queues do
not back up onto Winchester Boulevard. The remaining project-generated trips would use Olsen Drive to
access the parking garage.

Truck and Emergency Vehicle Access
To determine if the site driveways are adequate for service and emergency vehicle access, the SU-30
AASHTO design vehicle turning specifications were checked against the driveway and roadway
geometrics associated with the site. The SU-30 design vehicle represents a 30-foot single-unit truck (such
as a garbage truck or fire truck). This procedure revealed that a 30-foot single-unit truck would be able to
make all required turning movements at the project driveways assuming 26-foot driveway widths. The
proposed driveway designs are adequate to accommodate an SU-30 truck.

                                                                            Page|50

Intersection Operational Deficiencies
The operations analysis indicated that the estimated maximum vehicle queues at some of the selected
study locations would exceed the existing vehicle storage capacity under background plus project
conditions. However, the addition of project traffic at the selected study locations would lengthen
projected vehicle queues by no more than one vehicle. Project generated traffic at other locations would
be too low to have a measurable effect on queue lengths.

Winchester Boulevard and WB I-280 On-Ramp
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the southbound left-turn pocket at
the Winchester Boulevard and WB I-280 On-Ramp intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity under background plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The southbound left-turn
pocket has 150 feet of vehicle storage, which can accommodate about 6 vehicles. The estimated 95th
percentile vehicle queue during the PM peak hours under background plus project conditions would
exceed the left-turn pocket storage capacity by one vehicle. The existing southbound left-turn pocket
could be extended by removing the existing median and trees. However, a maximum left-turn pocket
storage inadequacy of only one vehicle is a worst-case traffic condition and is not likely to result in any
operational problems at this intersection. In addition, 95 percent of the time the southbound left-turn
pocket would be adequate to serve the estimated project traffic volumes.

Winchester Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the westbound left-turn pocket at the
Winchester Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard intersection currently exceed the existing vehicle
storage capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background plus project
conditions during the PM peak hours of traffic. The westbound dual left-turn pockets have 350 feet of
vehicle storage per lane, which can accommodate about 14 vehicles per lane. The project would not
increase the 95th percentile vehicle queues during the PM peak hour. The left-turn pocket cannot be
extended due to the presence of back-to-back turn pockets. However, a second southbound left-turn lane
at the intersection would provide for more green time to all other approaches and improve intersection
operations.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Santana Row
The queuing analysis indicates that the maximum vehicle queues for the westbound left-turn movement
at the Stevens Creek Boulevard and Santana Row intersection would exceed the existing vehicle storage
capacity under background plus project conditions during the AM peak hour and currently exceed the
existing vehicle storage capacity, and would continue to do so under both background and background
plus project conditions during the PM peak hour. The westbound dual left-turn pockets have 150 feet of
vehicle storage per lane, which can accommodate about 6 vehicles per lane. The estimated 95th
percentile vehicle queue during the AM peak hours under background plus project conditions would
exceed the left-turn pocket storage capacity by one vehicle. The addition of project traffic would not
increase the 95th percentile vehicle queues during the PM peak hour.
The segment of Stevens Creek Boulevard between Winchester Boulevard and Monroe Street is regularly
congested during the peak commute periods of the day. Traffic volumes on Stevens Creek Boulevard are
heaviest in the westbound direction during the AM commute period and in the eastbound direction during
the PM commute period. The congestion is caused by the close spacing of several signalized
intersections along the Stevens Creek Boulevard. Left-turn queues in the westbound direction regularly
extend out of the provided turn-pockets at its intersections with Winchester Boulevard and Santana Row
during the PM peak hour. Vehicles making the westbound left-turn movement at Santana Row do not
clear within the allotted green time. Operations along Stevens Creek Boulevard can be improved by
providing longer left-turn pockets into the Santana Row entrance. The longer pockets will allow for more
storage capacity and prevent the blockage of through lanes.


                                                                            Page|51

Transit, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Facilities
The project would not have an adverse effect on existing transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities in the
study area.


Cumulative Intersection Level of Service Analysis
The results show that, measured against the City of San Jose level of service impact criteria, the
estimated cumulative project trips collectively would create a significant adverse traffic impact at the
following three intersections during the PM peak hour:

    ·     Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard
    ·     Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
    ·     San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard

Since the project would contribute 49, 53, and 17 percent of the increase in total PM peak hour traffic
volume at the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Winchester Boulevard, Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street
San Tomas Expressway/Stevens Creek Boulevard intersections, respectively, the project would
contribute a considerable amount of traffic to these cumulatively impacted intersections. Described below
are the cumulatively significant intersection impacts and possible intersection improvements that can be
implemented at each of the identified impacted intersections to mitigate impacts due to cumulative
growth.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Winchester Boulevard*
Impact:          This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E)
                 during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                 would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 9.5 seconds and the
                 volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.036 during the PM peak hour. This
                 constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                 cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                 intersection would be 49 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:      The significant cumulative impact to this intersection could be mitigated with the addition
                 of a second southbound left-turn lane. With this modification, the intersection would
                 operate at an acceptable level (LOS D) during the PM peak hour.

Stevens Creek Boulevard and Monroe Street
Impact:          This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E)
                 during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                 would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 12.5 seconds and the
                 volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.049 during the PM peak hour. This
                 constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                 cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                 intersection would be 53 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:       Note that the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street intersection would be significantly
                  impacted by the project during the PM peak hour as described under background plus
                  project conditions (Chapter 5). The improvements that have been proposed to mitigate
                  the project impact at the Stevens Creek Boulevard/Monroe Street intersection under
                  background plus project conditions also would be effective at improving the intersection
                  operations under cumulative conditions.

San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard*
Impact:         This intersection is expected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS F)
                during the PM peak hour under background conditions. The cumulative development
                would cause the intersection's average critical delay to increase by 8.4 seconds and the
                volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) to increase by 0.025 during the PM peak hour. This
                constitutes a significant impact to the intersection based on the City of San Jose
                cumulative impact criteria. The proposed project's contribution to traffic growth at this
                intersection would be 17 percent during the PM peak hour.
Mitigation:      According to the Comprehensive County Expressway Planning Study Implementation
                 Plan, future improvements for San Tomas Expressway include widening of San Tomas
                 Expressway from six to eight lanes. This is a Tier 1A project that currently is not funded.
                 The widening of San Tomas Expressway would improve the operations of this
                 intersection to better than background conditions.

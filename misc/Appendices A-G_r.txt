           Dear Ms. Getz:

           Traffic Planning and Design, Inc. (TPD) has prepared this response letter to address the Master
           Plan Transportation Impact Study (TIS) comments contained in the North Cornwall Township
           Engineer's (Rettew) review dated April 3, 2012. These comments were offered with respect to
           TPD's Master Plan TIS dated March 2, 2012.

           MASTER PLAN TRANSPORTATION IMPACT STUDY COMMENTS

           For the discussion below, the Master Plan TIS comments are shown in italic type, with the
           corresponding TPD response shown in regular type:

           1. The introductory paragraph of the TIS needs to be revised to include a narrative stating
              that the study is intended to provide an overall evaluation of the future transportation
              needs of the studied portions of the roadway corridors located within North Cornwall
              Township, South Lebanon Township and Lebanon City.

                 Response: The requested narrative has been provided in the revised TIS.

           2. The applicant needs to verify that the "Township Guidelines" and "Master Plan
              Guidelines" referenced in Table i are referring to the same requirements.

                 Response: The annotations referenced in Table i do refer to the same requirements. For
                 purposes of clarity, the table was updated accordingly in the revised TIS to utilize only the
                 "Master Plan Guidelines" annotation.

           3. Right-turn lane warrant analyses need to be provided for the following:
                    a. Westbound Rocherty Road at its intersection with Quentin Road (Route 72) under
                       2025 conditions.
                    b. Southbound Cornwall Road at its intersection with Rocherty Road under 2025 and
                       2035 conditions.

                 Response: The requested right-turn lane warrant analyses are provided in Appendix L of the
                 revised TIS.

Pittsburgh, PA                      Pottstown, PA                      Lehigh Valley, PA                           Camden, NJ

4. Additional information needs to be provided on the purpose of the proposed
   eastbound Rocherty Road left-turn lane at its intersection with the right-in/right-out
   driveway, as shown in Table i. We note this turn lane is not included on the exhibits
   presented at the March 6th Supervisors' meeting.

      Response: A separate left-turn is not proposed on the eastbound Rocherty Road approach at
      the right-in/right-out driveway. Table i was updated accordingly in the revised TIS.

5. The applicant needs to provide a narrative discussing the limitations, if any, and/or the
   feasibility of installing the improvements indicated under the Township Master Plan
   Guidelines.

      Response: The requested narrative has been provided in the revised TIS.

6. The TIS indicates a full access driveway on Cornwall Road under 2025 conditions and
   restricting exiting left turns under 2035 conditions, which requires a modification of
   the Settlement Agreement. As outlined in our preliminary/final land development
   plan review letter dated January 25, 2012, in response to the applicant's
   modification request, we recommend disapproval of this modification request.

      Response: The Board of Supervisors considered the Applicant' modification request related
      to providing full movements at the Cornwall Road driveway at their meeting on April 3,
      2012. The Board did not support the modification request for full movements, but did
      approve a modified request to permit left-in/right-in/right-out movements at the driveway.
      Therefore, the applicable traffic volumes and capacity analyses were updated accordingly in
      the revised TIS.

Thank you for your continuing review, and please call if there is any further information you
require with regards to these responses.

                  TPD# BLAC.A.00001

           Dear Ms. Getz:

           This letter regards the Springwood Development Partners, LP Development Plan (Phases 1 and
           1A) in North Cornwall Township, Lebanon County, PA. Traffic Planning and Design, Inc.
           (TPD) has prepared this response letter to address the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) comments
           contained in the North Cornwall Township Engineer's (Rettew) review dated January 25, 2012.
           These comments were offered with respect to TPD's Memorandum dated November 17, 2011.

           TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY COMMENTS

           For the discussion below, the TIS comments are shown in italic type, with the corresponding
           TPD response shown in regular type:

           We note that this submission does not constitute an official Traffic Impact Study (TIS) submission
           but rather provides a technical summary of the information to be included in the formal TIS. A
           full TIS will need to be submitted. In addition, it is important to note that while the information
           provided includes trip generation data for Phase 5 of the proposed development, this information
           was not accounted for in the capacity analyses. While it is understood that no specific timeline or
           plan exists for the development of Phase 5, the amount of development allowed in accordance
           with the Settlement Agreement for that lot represents a "worst-case" (highest traffic volume)
           scenario for the purposes of the Master Plan TIS. Without including traffic attributed to Phase 5
           of the development, it is difficult to determine whether the improvements proposed as part of
           Phases 1-4 will accommodate Phase 5 traffic or be compatible with potential future
           improvements once the Phase 5 lot is developed. Therefore, we note that the following comments
           are based on the development of Phases 1-4 only and recommend that additional Phase 5
           information be provided in order to produce an overall picture of the improvements needed
           within the study area of the Master Plan TIS.

           1. The TIS assumes granting of the modification request currently in front of the Township
              regarding the lane configuration at the southern driveway to Cornwall Road to allow
              entering and exiting left-turn movements. We note that depending on the outcome of the
              modification request, the TIS may need to be revised.

   Response: So noted.

2. There are multiple level of service degradations for both individual turning movements and
   overall intersections between future no-build and future build conditions, during both the
   2025 and 2035 time periods. The applicant needs to provide additional information detailing
   the causes of the degradations and the improvements necessary to mitigate the level of
   service. It is understood that some improvements may be outside the scope of this
   development but need to be included to provide a more comprehensive Master Plan TIS.

   Response: Per the direction of Rettew, additional capacity analyses have been completed in
   order to identify the additional roadway improvements necessary to provide for level of
   service `D' or better for the following conditions:
          2025 Projected Conditions (Build-Out of Phases 1, 1A and 50% of 2).
          2035 Projected Conditions (Build-Out of Phases 1, 1A, 2, 3 and 4).
          2035 Projected Conditions (Build-Out of Phases 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4 and 5).

   The additional capacity analyses (identified as Township Master Plan Guidelines) are
   included in Appendix K of the Master Plan TIS.

3. The applicant needs to confirm at what locations auxiliary turn lane warrants were
   evaluated and the analyses need to be provided.

   Response: The locations for which auxiliary turn lane analyses were evaluated are
   summarized in Tables 13 and 14 of the Master Plan TIS. The auxiliary turn lane analysis
   worksheets are included in Appendix L of the Master Plan TIS.

4. The results of the queue analysis show numerous queues that exceed both the future no-build
   queue and the proposed storage capacity of the auxiliary turn lane. Additional information
   needs to be provided identifying what improvements are necessary to accommodate the
   projected queue lengths.

   Response: The additional capacity analyses referenced in the response to comment #2 also
   considered the required lengthening of auxiliary turn lanes. The lane lengths utilized in the
   additional capacity analyses were based upon the methodologies contained in Chapter 11 of
   PennDOT's Publication 46 and Strike-Off Letter 470-08-07.

5. The applicant needs to verify the lane configuration shown at the intersection of Route 72
   and the Lowes's/K-Mart/Cedar Crest Square driveway under the 2035 projected with
   improvements condition during the PM peak hour. It appears the eastbound right turn is not
   accounted for.

   Response: The lane configuration has been revised accordingly in the Master Plan TIS.

6. The applicant needs to clarify whether a separate right-turn lane is proposed on eastbound
   Township Roadway at the middle driveway. The separate lane is shown in the capacity
   analyses but not referenced elsewhere in the TIS.

   Response: A separate right-turn lane is proposed on eastbound Township Roadway at the
   middle driveway. The recommendations of the Master Plan TIS have been revised
   accordingly.

7. The applicant needs to clarify whether a separate right-turn lane is proposed on southbound
   Cornwall Road at the right-in/right-out driveway to the western development. The separate
   lane is shown in the capacity analyses but not referenced elsewhere in the TIS.

   Response: A separate right-turn lane is proposed on southbound Cornwall Road at the right-
   in/right-out driveway to the western development. The recommendations of the Master Plan
   TIS have been revised accordingly.

8. The capacity analyses need to be revised at the proposed Cornwall Road southern access
   under 2035 projected conditions to include the proposed northbound right-turn lane.

   Response: The capacity analyses have been revised accordingly in the Master Plan TIS.

9. Both the 95th and 50th percentile queues on the northbound through movement at the
   intersection of Route 72 and the Lowe's/K-Mart/Cedar Crest Square driveway extend beyond
   the adjacent intersection under 2035 conditions during the weekday PM peak hour. The
   applicant needs to evaluate additional mitigation alternatives.

   Response: See the response to comments #2 and #4.

10. The proposed Township Roadway and a portion of the Phase 4 development are located on
    the Kreider tract. It is our understanding that this property is not owned by the applicant.
    Therefore, additional information needs to be provided clarifying how this proposed
    development will be accommodated.

   Response: So noted. This comment will be discussed in more detail when Springwood
   Development Partners, LP proceed with Phase 4 of the development.

Thank you for your continuing review, and please call if there is any further information you
require with regards to these responses.

Eric:

If PennDOT District 8-0 and Lebanon County sign-off on this, we will go along with it. I'm somewhat hesitant about this
since we have actual phf's from "real" data...my interpretation of the use of the 0.92 phf is for a planning study where
"real" data doesn't exist. The HCM indicates that using the 0.92 should be only if "real" or field data is not
available. However, if PennDOT and the County are OK with this approach, we will also concur.

John/Chris,

                                                            2
This email is intended to serve as a follow up to yesterday's meeting to discuss the preliminary findings of the
Master TIS for the North Cornwall Commons Development. In particular, it is in reference to TPD's
methodology related to the peak hour factors (PHF) utilized in the capacity analyses completed in conjunction
with the Master TIS. As we discussed, TPD utilized the following methodology related to the PHF's.

2025 Future Conditions:
The capacity analyses completed for the 2025 future conditions (both no-build and build) utilized PHF's by
movement in accordance with current PennDOT methodology. No adjustments were made to the PHF's noted
on the manual traffic count printouts. TPD utilized the current PennDOT methodology since the 2025 future
condition capacity analyses were completed for the initial phases of the development, and thus we would
anticipate presenting TIS's to PennDOT regarding these phases in the near future.

2035 Future Conditions:
The capacity analyses completed for the 2035 future conditions (both no-build and build) utilized a minimum
PHF of 0.92 for all movements. Please note that if the PHF for a particular movement exceeded 0.92 today, no
additional adjustments were made under the 2035 future conditions. Please note 0.92 was utilized in
accordance with Chapter 10 of the HCM 2000. TPD utilized this methodology for the "master planning"
portion of the study in order to maintain the spirit of preparing a realistic projection of future traffic operations.

Furthermore, it is our opinion that it the methodology is appropriate since the HCM 2010 will ultimately result
in utilization of the overall intersection PHF when conducting capacity analyses. Based upon feedback from
PennDOT, it is our understanding that they intend to adopt the HCM 2010 sometime in late 2011 or 2012. As
such, by the time Springwood gets to the later phases of the development, and TIS's are prepared for PennDOT,
the capacity analyses will be conducted utilizing of the overall intersection PHF. I have attached a summary of
the manual traffic counts for the development. As you will see, of the 33 counts completed, all but 9 have
overall intersection PHF's equal to or greater than 0.92.

Lastly, I would note that the utilized methodology is consistent with that recently accepted by PennDOT in the
Transportation Planning Study prepared by TPD for the Route 10 Improvement Project (SR 0010, Section 000,
MPMS# 10331). It has been TPD's experience that PennDOT deems the proposed methodology appropriate for
long-range planning.

I would appreciate your feedback on the proposed methodology.

           A scoping meeting was held to discuss the Master TIS Scoping Application dated March 11, 2011
           regarding the above noted project, as well as PennDOT's associated review of the Application dated
           March 23, 2011. A summary of key discussion points is summarized below.

           INTRODUCTION

           Eric Mountz began with a brief summary of the meeting held with PennDOT on February 11, 2011
           during which the Master TIS methodology was approved based upon support from North Cornwall
           Township and the Lebanon County Planning Department (see minutes from 2/11/11 meeting for
           more detail). Eric Mountz indicated that he met with Tom Kotay and John Schick on March 3,
           2011 to discuss the scope of the Master TIS. Based upon feedback received during that meeting
           TPD prepared and submitted the Master TIS Scoping Application dated March 11, 2011. PennDOT
           provided comments related to the Scoping Application dated March 23, 2011 (attached).

TOPIC 1 ­ REVIEW OF 3/23/11 MASTER TIS SCOPING APPLICATION COMMENTS

PennDOT reviewed and provided comments dated March 23, 2011 regarding the submitted Master
TIS Scoping Application. Each of the five (5) comments was discussed as described below:

Comment #1: Revisit the directional distributions used in the trip generation for the Office Park.
In the am peak 88%/12% is used, but both ITE and Table 1 in the scoping application indicate that
89%/11% is to be used. In the pm peak, it is 17%/83% instead of 14%/86%. In the Saturday peak,
it is 54%/46% instead of 74%/26%.
   Eric Mountz acknowledged the oversight in the application and indicated that the Office Park
   directional distributions would be revised accordingly when preparing the TIS.

Comment #2: Label the buildings on the site plans (restaurant, bank, pharmacy, office building,
townhouse, etc), at least for the early phases of development.
   Eric Mountz indicated that the labeling will be provided on future submissions.

Comment #3: Provide the January 7, 2011 memo detailing the growth rate methodology.
   Eric Mountz indicated that the memo was provided to the Department on March 23, 2011.
   Eric Mountz noted that the memo was prepared based upon a concern raised by Township and
   County staff that application of a background growth factor of 33% in addition to specifically
   including traffic from the six (6) nearby planned developments may be unrealistic, and could
   ultimately lead to overdesigned intersections and roadways. As such, the memo proposed to
   utilize the "Build-Up Method, Using Specific Developments" outlined in Chapter 4 "Non-Site
   Transportation Forecast" contained in the ITE's publication Transportation Impact Analyses for
   Site Development. Based upon this methodology TPD proposes to assign traffic from each of
   the 6 known nearby planned developments to the study area intersections based upon
   information contained in their respective TIS's. TPD will then evaluate each individual
   movement at the study area intersections and assign additional traffic from unknown future
   development in order to ensure that each individual movement will experience a minimum total
   background growth consistent with that recommended by the PennDOT Bureau of Planning and
   Research (BPR). For the subject site, the PennDOT BPR recommends using a background
   growth factor of 1.16% per year in Lebanon County for urban non-interstate roadways.
   Therefore, under the proposed methodology each individual movement at the study area
   intersections will experience a minimum total background growth percentage of 33% (1.16%
   per year, compounded over 25 years) for the 2035 conditions.
   Jason Bewley indicated that the Department is OK with the proposed methodology outlined in
   the memo dated January 7, 2011 related to the background growth.

Comment #4: Explain what differentiates Phase 1A from the rest of the phases (i.e., why isn't it
considered Phase 2).
   Joe Deerin explained that Phase 1 encompasses the entire section of development adjacent to
   Rocherty Road, including 160 townhomes. He noted that the desire is not to develop all 160
4/4/11 PennDOT Meeting

Page 3


   townhomes simultaneously, and as a result Phase 1A was indentified to include 108 townhomes
   which will be developed subsequent to the initial 52 townhomes.

Comment #5: Provide municipal comments or approval with the initial TIS submission.
   Eric Mountz indicated that the applicable comments will be provided with future submissions.

TOPIC 2 ­ GENERAL DISCUSSION ITEMS

   Mazhar Malik questioned the classification of the proposed roadway traversing both proposed
   development tracts. Jim Caldwell indicated that it will be a local roadway that will be taken
   over by the Township. Mazhar indicated that the Department will require a letter from the
   Township indicating that it is their intention to take over the roadway.
   Eric Mountz discussed the anticipated approach to identifying the roadway improvements in the
   Master TIS. He indicated that the TIS will analyze 10 and 20-year design horizons. The 10-
   year horizon (2025) will examine the initial phases of the subject development and will identify
   a core set of roadway improvements that will be required for the surrounding roadways. The
   20-year horizon (2035) will examine full build-out of the subject development and will identify
   the ultimate set of roadway improvements that will be required for the surrounding roadways to
   accommodate traffic from not only the subject development, but also development of adjacent
   developments within North Cornwall Township and the surrounding municipalities.
   Eric Mountz indicated that the intention is to utilize trip thresholds to determine when
   improvements indentified in the Master TIS will be required. He indicated that as each Land
   Development application is filed with the Township a traffic evaluation will be required to
   identify the improvements from the Master TIS that will be required for the particular proposal.
   He also noted that consideraion will be given to smart implementation of the improvements
   when reviewing each land development application (i.e. don't complete improvements at a
   particular intersection multiple times). John Schick added that this approach provides a built-in
   check to make sure the required improvements match the level of development.
   Mazhar Malik questioned if it would be more appropriate to tie the required improvements to
   building permits rather than trips since the Department does not have a mechanism to monitor
   trips as development progresses. John Schick and Tom Kotay both indicated that it is their
   preference to utilize the trip threshold approach since it provides flexibility as the development
   progresses and adapts to economic conditions. Mazhar indicated that he is OK with this
   approach, but acknowledged that a detailed monitoring agreement will be required. Jason
   Bewley echoed Mazhar's statement that a very detailed monitoring agreement is going to be
   required between the Developer, Township, County, and PennDOT.
   Eric Kinard questioned if the Developer will be responsible for all of the improvements
   identified in the Master TIS. Eric Mountz indicated that the Developer would not be
   responsible for all of the improvements, but rather would be responsible for a core set of
   roadway improvements and a fair-share of the ultimate set of roadway improvements. Tom
   Kotay indicated that the MPO will be a partner in the improvements, and that the Master TIS
   will help them identify improvements to be added to future amendments to the TIP.

   Eric Kinard questioned if it would make sense for the MPO to take the lead as the facilitator of
   the improvements. Bob Sentz indicated that he didn't see a problem with the MPO taking the
   lead, but noted that the Township will need to play a role in the decision making process.
   Jim Caldwell indicated that the municipalities within and including the Cornwall-Lebanon
   School District have begun a Regional Comprehensive Plan for the area.
   Eric Mountz indicated that the Master TIS will utilize a preferred LOS to identify necessary
   roadway improvements rather than PennDOT's current methodology related to mitigation
   between build and no-build conditions. Jason Bewley indicated that the Department is OK with
   the approach, and that their guidelines allow it with support from the Township and County.
   Jason Bewley questioned if the one-way pairs concept for Route 72 and Cornwall Road was
   going to be considered in the Master TIS. Tom Kotay indicated that it would not. He indicated
   that there is no need for the improvement today, and that development needs to progress in order
   to determine if the concept is viable. Tom noted that he feels the street system would need
   additional improvements to accommodate the concept.
   Mazhar indicated that Tucker Ferguson asked him to relay that the Department is fully
   supportive of this project, and will help to ensure it becomes a reality.

Based on the information provided in the Trip Generation Manual, an Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Informational Report, not all trips generated by the site are trips that are "new" to
the roadway system. In addition to the new trips generated, there are pass-by trips, which are trips
that are drawn from the passing traffic stream and do not add trips to the adjacent roadways. Pass-
by trip percentages for the proposed site were utilized as specified in the ITE Trip Generation
Handbook, June 2004 edition. The pass-by percentages utilized are shown in Table 2.

    The PennDOT Policies and Procedures for Transportation Impact Studies, January 28, 2009,
    recognizes the potential for non-vehicular trips and offers standard assumptions for the modal split of
    alternative trips provided that pedestrian, bike, and transit-friendly characteristics present. Based upon
    a review of Table 2 on page 21 of the document, TPD utilized modal trip reductions of 4%, 1%, and
    3% to account for alternative trips made by pedestrians, bikes, and transit vehicles, respectively.

    For purposes of this trip generation analysis, Full Build-Out of the proposed development plan
    was assumed to consist of the following mix of land uses:
        160 Condominium/Townhome dwelling units (ITE Land Use Code #230);
        100 room hotel (ITE Land Use Code #310);
        436,400 square foot office park (ITE Land Use Code #750);
        600,600 square foot Shopping Center (ITE Land Use Code #820).

    Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 summarize the trip generation for Full Build-Out of the proposed
    development for an average weekday and the weekday A.M., P.M., and Saturday midday peak
    hours, respectively.

         private roadways.

10. TIS ANALYSIS PERIODS AND TIMES:
   Peak Hours to be evaluated:
         Weekday A.M. peak hour (peak hour within the 7:00-9:00 A.M. peak period);
         Weekday P.M. peak hour (peak hour within the 2:30-6:00 P.M. peak period);
         Saturday midday peak hour (peak hour within the 10:45 A.M.-12:45 P.M. peak period).
   Study Years to be evaluated:
         Existing Conditions
         2025 Conditions (10-Year Build-Out)
         o Per the request of the Township and County, this study year has been included in
            order to analyze the future traffic conditions 10-years beyond opening of the proposed
            development.      The associated analyses will include traffic associated with the
            development related land uses/phases that are reasonably assumed to be constructed
            within the 10-year period. The specific land uses/phases to be assumed have not yet
            been determined, however will be provided for review in advance of proceeding with
            the TIS.
         2035 Conditions (20-Year Full Build-Out in accordance with Federal Design Standards)

11. TRAFFIC ADJUSTMENT FACTORS:
   a. Seasonal Adjustment: N/A
   b. Annual Base Traffic Growth: Based upon correspondence with Township and County
      staff, utilize the "Build-Up Method, Using Specific Developments" outlined in Chapter 4
      "Non-Site Transportation Forecast" contained in the ITE's publication Transportation
      Impact Analyses for Site Development. A summary of the proposed methodology is
      outlined below. Additional detail is included in the memorandum prepared by TPD dated
      January 7, 2011.
         TPD proposes to assign traffic from each of the six (6) known nearby planned
         developments (see section 12 below) to the study area intersections based upon
         information contained in their respective TIS's. TPD will then evaluate each individual
         movement at the study area intersections and assign additional traffic from unknown
         future development in order to ensure that each individual movement will experience a
         minimum total background growth consistent with that recommended by the PennDOT
         Bureau of Planning and Research (BPR). For the subject site, the PennDOT BPR
         recommends using a background growth factor of 1.16% per year in Lebanon County for
         urban non-interstate roadways. Therefore, under the proposed methodology each
         individual movement at the study area intersections will experience a minimum total
         background growth percentage of 33% (1.16% per year, compounded over 25 years) for
         the 2035 conditions.

   c. Pass-By Trips: Per ITE Trip Generation Handbook (see section #4 ­ Trip Generation for
      more information).
   d. Captured Trips for Multi-Use Sites: N/A.
   e. Modal Split Reductions: Per PennDOT Policies and Procedures for Transportation Impact
      Studies (see section #4 ­ Trip Generation for more information)
   f. Other Reduction: N/A

12. OTHER PROJECTS WITHIN STUDY AREA TO BE ADDED TO BASE TRAFFIC:
   TPD will specifically include background traffic volumes related to the following
   developments:
         BTKD Development (aka Sheetz Outparcels), located in North Cornwall Township on the
         northern side of Rocherty Road, east of Route 72. Based upon TPD's knowledge, the
         development will consist of 30,813 s.f. of specialty retail space.
         Tractor Supply Outparcels, located in North Cornwall Township on the eastern side of
         Route 72, north of Rocherty Road. Based upon TPD's knowledge, the outparcels will
         consist of a 4,279 s.f. drive-in bank and one other commercial user that will be consistent
         with current zoning for the parcel.
         Veteran's Administration Medical Center Expansion, located in South Lebanon
         Township between Lincoln Avenue and State Drive, north of Rocherty Road. The
         proposed expansion will consist of adding 504 employees at the existing facility.
         Alden Place, located in Cornwall Borough on the eastern side of Route 72, between
         Route 419 and Ironmaster Road. The proposed age-restricted development will be
         constructed in five (5) phases, with full build-out consisting of 505 residential dwelling
         units (445 single homes/villas in the Cornwall neighborhood and 60 single homes in the
         Northgate neighborhood). Based upon a conversation with a staff member of the
         communities sales office in October 2009, 100 of the units in the Cornwall neighborhood
         are built and occupied and 3 of the units in the Northgate neighborhood are built and
         occupied.
         The Preserve at Historic Cornwall Village, located in Cornwall Borough between Route
         322 and Route 419 in the vicinity of Burd Coleman Village and Minersvillage. Full
         build-out of the proposed development will consist of 590 residential dwelling units (390
         age-targeted units and 200 market-rate units), a hotel with 250 conventional rooms and
         60 cottages, a 60,000 square foot (s.f.) indoor water park, a village commercial area with
         150,000 s.f. of total space, and 12,000 s.f. of restaurant space.

13. TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT:
   The distribution and assignment of site-generated new trips will be based upon an analysis of
   the following: (1) existing traffic patterns and distributions within the study area; (2)
   available routes for travel; and (3) the proposed site driveway locations.

   For the office/residential land uses, a modified gravity model analysis was performed using
   the 2000 census journey to work figures for North Cornwall Township. The 2000 census
   journey to work figures summarize the number of people that travel to North Cornwall
Mr. Mazhar Malik

   Township to work from seventy-one surrounding municipalities in Berks, Chester,
   Cumberland, Dauphin, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon, Northumberland, Schuylkill,
   Westmoreland and York Counties. The results of the gravity model analysis are attached for
   reference. Furthermore, the trip distribution percentage between the eastern and western
   tracts of the development was determined based upon ITE's methodology for calculating the
   interaction factor for multi-use developments. The results of the interaction factor
   calculations are attached for reference. Based on the results of the gravity model and
   interaction factor methodology, the new office/residential trips for the proposed development
   were distributed to the local roadway network based on the percentages shown in Table 7.

   For the retail land uses, a gravity model analysis was performed using the 2000 census
   population figures for North Cornwall Township and the twelve (12) neighboring
   municipalities (approximately 10 mile radius). The results of the gravity model analysis are
   attached for reference. Furthermore, the trip distribution percentage between the eastern and
   western tracts of the development was determined based upon ITE's methodology for
   calculating the interaction factor for multi-use developments. The results of the interaction
   factor calculations are attached for reference. Based on the results of the gravity model and
   interaction factor methodology, the new retail trips for the proposed development were
   distributed to the local roadway network based on the percentages shown in Table 8.

        is towed from the scene of the crash.
   k. Weaving Analysis: N/A
   l.   Other Required Studies: N/A

18. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATIVE TO THE SCOPE OF
    THE TIS:

   During the previously referenced meeting with PennDOT on February 11, 2011, it was
   suggested that the Master Transportation Impact Study employ the basic principles of an
   ACT 209 Study. In particular, both the County and Township have recommended utilizing
   the "Preferred Level of Service" methodology associated with a Roadway Sufficiency
   Analysis to identify the required set of roadway improvements. As such, TPD proposes to
   utilize the noted methodology in place of the current level of service requirements identified
   in PennDOT's Transportation Impact Study Guidelines to determine the appropriate roadway
   improvements.

We appreciate your review of the enclosed information. If there are any questions or comments,
please do not hesitate to contact me.

INTRODUCTION

Tom Kotay and Kris Troup spoke on behalf of the Lebanon County Planning Department and
provided a brief overview regarding the importance of the proposed North Cornwall Commons
Development. Their key points were as follows:
   The project is supported by many of local entities including, but not limited to, the Lebanon
   County Planning Department, the Lebanon County Commissioners, the Lebanon Valley
   Expo Center, Lebanon County Economic Development Corporation, the City of Lebanon,
   North Cornwall Township, the Cornwall-Lebanon School District, the Lebanon County
   Chamber of Commerce, Lebanon Transit, the Lebanon VA Medical Center, Representative
   Gingrich, Senator Folmer, Senator Casey, and Congressman Holden.
   The project is located in the heart of one of the county's key growth areas, as designated in
   the Lebanon County Comprehensive Plan.
   The proposed development is consistent with three (3) key objectives of the Lebanon County
   Comprehensive Plan: (1) encourage development that includes multi-model transportation
   opportunities, (2) encourage development that preserves agriculture, and (3) encourage
   development in areas with suitable roadway infrastructure and promote PennDOT smart
   growth concepts.
   The proposed development will provide much needed jobs, an increased tax base, and needed
   service uses.
   Through added infrastructure sewer service will be extended to the adjacent Lebanon Valley
   Expo Center and County office building which currently are limited by on-site facilities.
   The proposed development will help facilitate many of the core transportation improvements
   that have been needed in the area for many years.

Eric Mountz provided an update regarding the current status of the transportation planning for
the proposed North Cornwall Commons Development. His key points were as follows:
   The development consists of approximately 150± acres which are bisected by Cornwall
   Road. The eastern tract consists of 81± acres and will include a 436,400 square foot Office
   Park, a 100-room hotel, and 160 luxury townhomes. The western tract consists of
   approximately 67± acres and will include a 600,600 square foot Towne Center.
   The proposed development has been in the planning stages for the past four years, and as of
   the fall of last year a Settlement Agreement was finalized with North Cornwall Township.
   A TIS scoping application for the project was approved by PennDOT on September 23,
   2010.
   Subsequent to receiving the approved TIS scope the developer identified a build-out schedule
   consisting of five (5) phases. The eastern tract is anticipated to comprise the first three (3)
   phases of development, with the final two (2) phases of development anticipated on the
   western tract.
   Based upon the anticipated phasing schedule, 70-75% of the total traffic generation for the
   development will not occur until phases 4 and 5 (i.e. shopping center on western tract).
2/11/11 PennDOT Meeting
North Cornwall Commons
Page 3


   Given the fact that a large majority of the traffic generation, and associated roadway
   improvements, will not occur until the final phases of development, phasing of the roadway
   improvements is critical to the project.
   The project team understands that PennDOT is receptive to phased roadway improvements,
   but also understands that PennDOT typically requires that all required right-of-way (ROW)
   for the overall set of roadway improvements is obtained in conjunction with the initial phase.
   Given the fact that obtaining all required ROW for the overall set of roadway improvements
   is likely to be difficult with the initial phase, the Project Team met with County and
   Township staff to discuss a strategy for implementation of long term transportation
   improvements.
   As a result of meetings with County and Township staff, it was suggested that the developer
   fund a Master Plan TIS that will be prepared on behalf of North Cornwall Township. The
   Master Plan TIS would consider the future transportation needs of the surrounding roadway
   network for a 20-year period (2035).
   By completing the Master Plan TIS, the developer could complete smaller studies as
   individual phases or parcels come on line. Under this option appropriate roadway
   improvements would be identified for the phase or parcel based upon the Master Plan TIS,
   and associated HOP applications would be filed with PennDOT. This methodology would
   eliminate the need to acquire all of the required ROW for the overall set of roadway
   improvements with the initial phase.

TOPIC 1 ­ MASTER PLAN TRANSPORTATION IMPACT STUDY

Based upon the information presented during the introductions, Jason Bewley indicated that he felt
that the proposed Master Plan TIS methodology is most appropriate since it will: (1) Link land use
and transportation needs in accordance with Smart transportation principals, and (2) Allow the
County and Township to take the lead on planning future transportation improvements. He
indicated that the State is encouraging economic development, and that the proposed development
will obviously help with that objective.

Jason questioned if the County or Township have a Transportation Impact Fee (ACT 209) or
Ordinances that will help drive the Master Plan TIS process. Tom indicated that the Township does
not have an ACT 209 and that there are not any specific Ordinances that will help drive the process,
however noted the location of the development is located in the urban growth boundary outlined in
the County's Comprehensive Plan. He indicated that the surrounding roadway network is generally
acceptable today, and therefore the goal is to properly plan for the future. Kris added that having
the ability to work with a single developer in planning the 150+/- acres is an ideal situation when
compared to potentially having to deal with multiple developers. Jim Caldwell added that the
municipalities within and including the Cornwall-Lebanon School District have begun a
Comprehensive Plan for the area. He also added that North Cornwall Township has completed a
Master Plan for Non-Motorized Trail Connections, and that the proposed development will
incorporate many elements of that plan including a trailhead connection to the adjacent rail-trail.

John Schick indicated that he envisions that the Master Plan TIS will include a comprehensive list
of improvements that will be required to accommodate future transportation needs. The list will
2/11/11 PennDOT Meeting

need to include trip thresholds related to when each improvement will be required. As development
comes on line the associated trip generation will need to be considered and an appropriate level of
improvements will be required. Joe Deerin indicated that John's approach is appropriate given the
fact that he and Rich Welkowitz cannot afford to fund all of the required improvements that will be
identified in the Master Plan TIS, nor will they create the need for all of the future improvements.

Scott Russell indicated that a similar Master Plan process is underway in East Hempfield Township,
Lancaster County. He indicated that the Project team is more than welcome to coordinate with
Rettew regarding the details of that process. He also indicated that many of the elements from an
ACT 209 study would be appropriate to consider when preparing the Master Plan TIS.

TOPIC 2 ­ REQUIRED RIGHT-OF-WAY

Joe Deerin indicated that the Settlement Agreement for the project includes a condition that North
Cornwall Township must promptly employ Eminent Domain to obtain additional temporary and/or
permanent ROW for streets (and related grading, traffic control equipment, utilities, and stormwater
facilities). He indicated that construction will not proceed on buildings for a particular phase or
parcel if the ROW for associated roadway improvements has not been secured. Therefore, he noted
that PennDOT does have a mechanism in place to ensure that required roadway improvements will
be constructed in conjunction with development of appropriate phases or parcels.

Mazhar Malik indicated that the District will cooperate fully with the phasing of roadway
improvements, and that all of the required ROW for the overall set of roadway improvements does not
need to be acquired with the initial phase of development. He mentioned that PennDOT's Expedited HOP
review process can be utilized, and that roundabouts should be considered when developing the required
roadway improvements.

Jason Bewley stressed the importance of identifying the required roadway improvements and
associated required ROW in a timely manner. He also reiterated Mazhar's recommendation to
consider "out-of-the-box" roadway improvements when completing the master Plan TIS. Tom
indicated that the County's CCIP is considering such measures, including one-way pairs for Route
72 and Cornwall Road. He indicated that he feels the one-way pair concept will be difficult given
the lack of a true grid system in the area.

TOPIC 3 ­ BACKGROUND GROWTH FACTOR

Eric Mountz indicated that the County and Township have both raised some concerns relative to the
background growth factor to be utilized in the Master Plan TIS. PennDOT's BPR data indicates a
recommended growth factor of 1.16% per year, which would result in a growth factor of 33% for
the 2035 future conditions. The general consensus is that application of a background growth factor
of 33% in addition to specifically including traffic from the 6 nearby planned developments is
unrealistic, and could ultimately lead to overdesigned intersections and roadways. As such, TPD
prepared a memo dated January 7, 2011 proposing an alternative methodology, at the direction of
the County and Township staff. Eric requested that the Department review the contents of the
memo and offer their feedback. Jason Bewley indicated that the Department would consider an
alternative methodology as long as there is information to back the methodology up.

TOPIC 4 ­ ACTION ITEMS

Eric Mountz indicated that he will schedule a meeting with the County and Township staff to
discuss the scope of the Master Plan TIS. Subsequent to that meeting an amended Scoping
Application will be submitted to PennDOT.

Joe Deerin and Rich Welkowitz indicated that they will continue to explore potential funding
sources for the required roadway improvements, and are working with the County in order to place
some of the core roadway improvements onto their Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).
They noted that having the projects on the TIP will provide a tremendous benefit when exploring
potential funding sources.

The meeting concluded with Joe Deerin and Rich Welkowitz thanking the Department for their
cooperation, and noted that they look forward to working together to make their project a reality.

The above is TPD's understanding of the items discussed at the meeting. If the attendees do not agree with
these minutes or would like to add to them, please contact Eric Mountz (717-234-1430 x2147,

           As you are aware, a meeting was held on Tuesday, December 14, 2010 to discuss the anticipated
           phasing and the methodologies to be utilized in preparation of the Transportation Impact Study
           (TIS) for the above noted project. One of the key items discussed during the meeting was
           development of the 2035 future condition traffic volumes. A summary was presented outlining
           the composition of the 2035 future condition traffic volumes based upon current PennDOT
           methodology, as noted below:
                   2010 Existing Traffic Volumes = 54%
                   Background Growth Traffic Volumes = 29%
                   o Includes background growth factor of 33% (1.15% per year compounded for 25 years)
                      and the following 6 nearby planned developments:
                       Sheetz Outparcels, located in North Cornwall Township
                       Tractor Supply Outparcels, located in North Cornwall Township

Background Growth Factor for TIS

Discussion ensued regarding the background growth traffic volumes, and the fact that they
comprise a significant portion of the 2035 future condition traffic volumes. The general
consensus was that application of a background growth factor of 33% in addition to specifically
including traffic from the 6 nearby planned developments was unrealistic, and could ultimately
lead to overdesigned intersections and roadways. A good example of the inflated traffic volumes
that could occur as a result of this methodology are the through volumes along Route 72 at its
intersection with the Lowe's/Cedar Crest Square/Tractor Supply Driveways. These movements
are both approximately 500-600 vehicles during the peak hours under the 2010 existing
conditions. The 33% background growth factor increases the volumes for the movements by
150-200 vehicles and the nearby planned developments add an additional 150-175 vehicles. In
total this increases the through volumes to 800-1,000 vehicles in each direction. By all accounts
this 60-70% increase in traffic volume over the 2010 existing conditions does not appear to be
consistent with anticipated growth patterns for the area. As such, TPD was directed to explore
additional alternatives with respect to application of background growth.

In exploring additional alternatives with respect to application of background growth, TPD
reviewed Chapter 4 "Non-Site Transportation Forecast" contained in the ITE's publication
Transportation Impact Analyses for Site Development. The publication notes that there are three
principal methods of projecting non-site traffic. Each of the methods and their corresponding
advantages and concerns are noted below:
 1. Build-Up Method, Using Specific Developments
    o Typically appropriate in areas of moderate growth;
    o Usually used when the project has a horizon of five years or less; and,
    o Often the best method when there is good local information on development approvals.
 2. Use of Area Transportation Plan or Modeled Volumes
    o Often used with large, regional projects that will develop over a long period;
    o Often appropriate for areas of high growth; and,
    o Locally credible transportation plan data that is adaptable to the study year must be
       available.
 3. Trends or Growth Rate Method
    o Typically used for small projects that will be built within a year or two;
    o Local recordkeeping of traffic counts must be good;
    o At least five years of data showing stable growth should be available;
    o Simple, straightforward approach;
    o Not appropriate for long-range horizons; and,
    o May result in over- or undercounting of non-site traffic growth.

Based upon the above, method 2 "Use of Area Transportation Plan or Modeled Volumes" would
be most appropriate for the subject development. Unfortunately, a local transportation plan is
not available, and thus the method cannot be utilized. Therefore, the next best option is to utilize
method 1 "Build-Up Method, Using Specific Developments" since there is good local
information on development approvals. As noted in the ITE publication, this method is
appropriate when considering a study area with several major projects being developed during
the same period as the subject project. This technique is most beneficial when it is desired to
accurately reflect local area traffic patterns that will change as a result of limited or moderate
Background Growth Factor for TIS

non-site development, or when the project site is in an area where available traffic volume
projections are sketchy. The concept consists of projecting peak hour traffic to be generated by
approved and anticipated developments in the study area (background development),
assigning it to the projected street system, and adding in through traffic with both trip ends
outside the study area (background growth). Trips already made in the area street system
should be accounted for to avoid double counting.

The "Build-Up Method, Using Specific Developments" was discussed in detail during a
conference call between Eric Mountz, John Schick, and Tom Kotay on Tuesday, January 4,
2011. Based upon this call it was determined that the method is most appropriate in estimating
background growth for the subject project since it blends known traffic from nearby planned
developments with unknown traffic that may occur in the future. It was agreed that the method
will result in the most realistic future traffic projections for regional projects with a 20-year plus
build-out horizon.

Utilizing the "Build-Up Method, Using Specific Developments" for the TIS for the subject site,
TPD proposes to assign traffic from each of the 6 above noted known nearby planned
developments to the study area intersections based upon information contained in their respective
TIS's. TPD will then evaluate each individual movement at the study area intersections and
assign additional traffic from unknown future development in order to ensure that each
individual movement will experience a minimum total background growth consistent with that
recommended by PennDOT's Bureau of Planning and Research (BPR). For the subject site,
PennDOT's BPR recommends using a background growth factor of 1.15% per year in Lebanon
County for urban non-interstate roadways. Therefore, under the proposed methodology each
individual movement at the study area intersections will experience a minimum total background
growth percentage of 33% (1.15% per year, compounded over 25 years) for the 2035 future
conditions. Please note that there are particular movements that will experience background
growth in excess of 33% as a result of the nearby planned developments alone. This
methodology would modify the previously noted composition of the 2035 future condition traffic
volumes, as follows:
     2010 Existing Traffic Volumes = 60%
     Background Growth Traffic Volumes = 21%
     Additional North Cornwall Commons Traffic Volumes = 19%

If you have any questions or comments related to this proposed methodology regarding
development of the background growth traffic, please call.

Based on the information provided in the Trip Generation Manual, an Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Informational Report, not all trips generated by the site are trips that are "new" to
the roadway system. In addition to the new trips generated, there are pass-by trips, which are trips
that are drawn from the passing traffic stream and do not add trips to the adjacent roadways. Pass-
by trip percentages for the proposed site were utilized as specified in the ITE Trip Generation
Handbook, June 2004 edition. The pass-by percentages utilized are shown in Table 2.

The PennDOT Policies and Procedures for Transportation Impact Studies, January 28, 2009,
recognizes the potential for non-vehicular trips and offers standard assumptions for the modal split of
alternative trips provided that pedestrian, bike, and transit-friendly characteristics present. Based upon
a review of Table 2 on page 21 of the document, TPD utilized modal trip reductions of 4%, 1%, and
3% to account for alternative trips made by pedestrians, bikes, and transit vehicles, respectively.

For purposes of this trip generation analysis, Phase 1 of the proposed development was assumed
to consist of the following mix of land uses:
    80 Condominium/Townhome dwelling units (ITE Land Use Code #230);
    97,600 square foot Office Park (ITE Land Use Code #750);
    226,900 square foot Shopping Center (ITE Land Use Code #820).

Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 summarize the trip generation for Phase 1 of the proposed development for an
average weekday and the weekday A.M., P.M., and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively.

   TPD will specifically include background traffic volumes related to the following
   developments:
       Sheetz Outparcels, located in North Cornwall Township on the northern side of Rocherty
       Road, east of Route 72. Based upon TPD's knowledge, the outparcels will consist of 9,500
       s.f. of professional office space, 20,000 s.f. of retail space, and a 5,786 s.f. sit-down
       restaurant. TPD will assume full build-out of this development by 2014.
       Tractor Supply Outparcels, located in North Cornwall Township on the eastern side of
       Route 72, north of Rocherty Road. Based upon TPD's knowledge, the outparcels will
       consist of a 4,279 s.f. drive-in bank and two (2) 6,500 s.f. high-turnover (sit-down)
       restaurants. TPD will assume full build-out of this development by 2014.
       Veteran's Administration Medical Center Expansion, located in South Lebanon
       Township between Lincoln Avenue and State Drive, north of Rocherty Road. The
       proposed expansion will consist of adding 504 employees at the existing facility. TPD
       will assume full build-out of this development by 2014.
       Alden Place, located in Cornwall Borough on the eastern side of Route 72, between
       Route 419 and Ironmaster Road. The proposed age-restricted development will be
       constructed in five (5) phases, with full build-out consisting of 505 residential dwelling
       units (445 single homes/villas in the Cornwall neighborhood and 60 single homes in the
       Northgate neighborhood). Based upon a conversation with a staff member of the
       communities sales office in October 2009, 100 of the units in the Cornwall neighborhood
       are built and occupied and 3 of the units in the Northgate neighborhood are built and
       occupied. TPD will assume full build-out of this development by 2014.
       The Preserve at Historic Cornwall Village, located in Cornwall Borough between Route
       322 and Route 419 in the vicinity of Burd Coleman Village and Minersvillage. Full
       build-out of the proposed development will consist of 590 residential dwelling units, a
       hotel with 250 conventional rooms and 60 cottages, a 60,000 square foot (s.f.) indoor
       water park, a village commercial area with 150,000 s.f. of total space, and 12,000 s.f. of
       restaurant space. Phase 1 of the proposed development will consist of 137 residential
       dwelling units, the hotel with 250 conventional rooms and 60 cottages, and the 60,000
       square foot (s.f.) indoor water park. TPD will assume phase 1 of this development by
       2014 and full build-out by 2022.

13. TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT:
   The distribution and assignment of site-generated new trips will be based upon an analysis of
   the following: (1) existing traffic patterns and distributions within the study area; (2)
   available routes for travel; and (3) the proposed site driveway locations.

   For the office/residential land uses, a modified gravity model analysis was performed using
   the 2000 census journey to work figures for North Cornwall Township. The 2000 census
   journey to work figures summarize the number of people that travel to North Cornwall
   Township to work from seventy-one surrounding municipalities in Berks, Chester,
   Cumberland, Dauphin, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon, Northumberland, Schuylkill,
   Westmoreland and York Counties. The results of the gravity model analysis are attached for
   reference. Furthermore, the trip distribution percentage between the eastern and western
   tracts of the development was determined based upon ITE's methodology for calculating the
   interaction factor for multi-use developments. The results of the interaction factor
   calculations are attached for reference. Based on the results of the gravity model and
   interaction factor methodology, the new office/residential trips for the proposed development
   were distributed to the local roadway network based on the percentages shown in Table 11.

   For the retail land uses, a gravity model analysis was performed using the 2000 census
   population figures for North Cornwall Township and the twelve (12) neighboring
   municipalities (approximately 10 mile radius). The results of the gravity model analysis are
   attached for reference. Furthermore, the trip distribution percentage between the eastern and
   western tracts of the development was determined based upon ITE's methodology for
   calculating the interaction factor for multi-use developments. The results of the interaction
   factor calculations are attached for reference. Based on the results of the gravity model and
   interaction factor methodology, the new retail trips for the proposed development were

                             Alternative #2.pdf


Eric,

We have received the Department's review dated 8/19/10 regarding the TIS Scoping Application dated 5/24/10
for the proposed North Cornwall Commons Development in North Cornwall Township, Lebanon County. As
you are aware, both the County MPO and North Cornwall Township supported the proposed trip generation
outlined in the Scoping Application, which included assumptions related to the pass-by and internal capture
percentages during time periods for which the ITE Trip Generation handbook does not contain published
data. The assumptions utilized in the Scoping Application were consistent with the methodology approved by
the Department for the Preserve at Historic Cornwall Village project located just south of the proposed site in
Cornwall Borough. However, as noted in comment #2 of the Department's review, TPD's assumptions related
to the pass-by and internal capture percentages are not being permitted. Consequently, a 2nd meeting has been
requested with the Department to further discuss the topic. While awaiting the meeting, TPD has prepared a 2nd
alternative trip generation calculation for the project that is 100% compliant with published ITE data. The
attached email summarizes the 1st alternative trip generation calculation that was provided to the Department for
review on 6/29/10.

As outlined in the attached PDF, the trip generation was recalculated utilizing ITE Land Use Code #750 (Office
Park) for the proposed office space, bank, pharmacy, and restaurants located on the 81+/- acre tract located on
the eastern side of Cornwall Road. This was done in place of the methodology outlined in the Scoping
Application which utilized ITE Land Use Codes 710 (General Office Building), 912 (Drive-In Bank), 881
(Pharmacy/Drugstore with Drive-Through Window), and 932 (High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant)
individually. It is our opinion that use of Land Use Code #750 is appropriate for the eastern tract since it fits
that description contained in the ITE manual which states, "Office Parks are usually suburban subdivisions or
planned unit developments containing general office building and support services, such as banks, restaurants,
and service stations". Furthermore, the published data for Land Use Code #750 is based upon multiple studies
and the size of the proposed office park is consistent with the average size of the sites studied for the published
data. It is our opinion that this is a very similar concept to utilizing Land Use Code #820 for a Shopping Center
in place of the respective Land Use Codes for each individual user in a retail complex. As noted in the
attachment, no internal capture was assumed during any of the analyzed time periods for purposes of this
analysis. The below table compares the external trip generation between the methodology proposed in the
Scoping Application and the methodology which utilizes ITE Land Use Code #750.

                                                       External Trip Generation

                                                             1
As shown in the above table, the methodology that utilizes ITE Land Use Code #750 results in an external trip
generation that is comparable, but lower, than that proposed in the Scoping Application. Therefore, we believe
it is appropriate to utilize either the trip generation outlined in the TIS Scoping Application or one of the
alternatives presented to the Department. We look forward to discussing this topic in more detail once a
meeting date is set. In the meantime, if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

           A meeting was held to discuss the Transportation Impact Study (TIS) Scoping Meeting Application,
           dated 5/24/10 for the proposed North Cornwall Commons project in North Cornwall Township,
           Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. The proposed development includes two (2) parcels of land located
           to the north of Rocherty Road (S.R. 2002) along Cornwall Road (S.R. 2001). There is a 67± acre
           parcel located on the western side of Cornwall Road (S.R. 2001) that is proposed to consist of a
           600,600 square foot (s.f.) shopping center consisting of an integrated mix of big box retail, strip
           retail, and pad sites. There is also an 81± acre parcel located on the eastern side of Cornwall Road
           (S.R. 2001) that is proposed to consist of a 409,000 s.f. office park, a 100 room hotel, an 11,400 s.f.
           pharmacy, two (2) 6,000 s.f. sit-down restaurants, a 4,000 s.f. drive-in bank, and 160 rental luxury
           townhomes.

With development of the proposed site the Applicant is proposing to construct a new east-west
Township Roadway that will connect Cornwall Road (S.R. 2001) to Route 72 (S.R. 0072) via the
existing access to the Tractor Supply/Cedar Crest Square. The 67± acre parcel will be served via
three (3) full-access driveways to the proposed Township Roadway and two (2) right-in/right-out
driveways to Cornwall Road (S.R. 2001). The 81± acre parcel will be served via a full-access
driveway to Cornwall Road (S.R. 2001), a right-in/right-out driveway to Cornwall Road (S.R.
2001), two (2) full-access driveways to Rocherty Road (S.R. 2002), and a full-access connection to
Norman Drive.

The following items were discussed:

1. Eric Mountz (EM) gave an overview of the project (as described above) which included the
   proposed land uses, the sizes of the proposed uses, the proposed driveway locations, and a
   brief summary of the adjacent roadway network.
2. Joe Deerin (JD) stated that the Lebanon County Comprehensive Plan has designated the area
   where the proposed site is located as the area for future growth in Lebanon County. JD also
   informed PennDOT that a mutually agreed upon development agreement is in place between
   North Cornwall Township and Springwood Development Partners. The only remaining
   action is for the judge to sign the agreement.
3. EM asked if there were any general questions prior to discussing the contents of the Scoping
   Application. Jason Bewley (JB) asked if the previous studies for the developments
   previously proposed on the subject parcels would be updated, or if TPD would be completing
   a new TIS. EM stated that there were previously three (3) separate TIS's prepared for the
   Wal-Mart, the North Cornwall Commons Shopping Center, and the North Cornwall
   Commons Business Park TIS. EM noted that the proposed TIS will start from the beginning
   with the Scoping Application and follow the new PennDOT guidelines, since it will include
   all three of the land parcels noted above. EM added that the only information that will be
   utilized from the prior TIS's is the background information. He also noted that new traffic
   counts were conducted in June 2009 prior to school being out for the summer.
4. EM noted that prior to the Scoping Application meeting, TPD received feedback in the form
   of emails and memorandums from both the County and Township regarding the proposed
   TIS scope. He noted that a meeting was held on June 22, 2010 between the County, the
   Township, and the Project team in order to discuss the feedback from both parties. Based
   upon the outcome of that meeting, both the County and Township agreed that they were
   comfortable with the scope outlined in the May 24, 2010 Application. The applicable
   feedback from the Township and County are attached for reference.
5. EM suggested that each section of the Scoping Application be reviewed on a point-by-point
   basis. The discussions related to the sections were as follows:
   a. Section #1 (Location of Proposed Development) ­ Covered during introduction.
   b. Section #2 (Description of Proposed Development) ­ EM described the proposed size and
      approximate locations of the land uses on the aerial site plan. EM noted that the
      proposed TIS will include phasing, with the opening year being 2012, the phase 1 build-
      out year being 2014, the full build-out year being 2022, and the design year being 2027.
Meeting Minutes

       EM noted that the full build-out year of 2022 was used in order to be consistent with the
       proposed H&K development, the Preserve at Historic Cornwall Village, which is located
       to the south of the proposed site. Mazhar Malik (MM) asked what was proposed in Phase
       1 of the study. EM stated that there will be 226,900 s.f. of retail space built on the 67±
       acre parcel and 97,600 s.f. of office space and 80 rental luxury townhomes built on the
       81± acre parcel. MM stated that the Department will consider phasing of roadway
       improvements; however all of the right-of-way needs to be in place in order for the
       Highway Occupancy Permit (HOP) to be issued. TPD requests PennDOT's feedback
       confirming that the proposed phasing and analysis years of 2014, 2022, and 2027 are
       acceptable.
       JB questioned if there were any public funds that will be used for this project. JD
       explained that Springwood Development Partners is working with Delta Development
       Group and The Carmen Group on applications for both State and Federal Funding. He
       added that Lebanon County is also involved in the applications through Tom Kotay (TK)
       at the Lebanon County Planning Department. JD reported that no public funds have been
       awarded yet, however they are confident that they will be awarded some funds in the
       coming months. JB indicated that if public funds are utilized the criteria for the TIS are
       slightly different than the PennDOT standards. EM agreed and noted that they only real
       difference is that the study associated with the public funds must consider a 20-year
       design horizon rather than the 5-year horizon required by PennDOT. He added that with
       the proposed phasing for the PennDOT TIS the design year is proposed to be 2027.
       Therefore, the difference between years between the Federal and PennDOT guidelines
       may not be that significant, especially given the fact that the background growth factor
       for the area is only 1.15% per year. It was agreed that this issue would be addressed if
       public funds are awarded for the project.
       EM asked if there were any more questions related to the phasing of the study. JB stated
       that he hadn't had a chance to review the Application in detail. EM asked how long it
       would take to receive feedback regarding the proposed scope for the TIS. JB suggested
       submitting the meeting minutes and noting in the minutes the items related to the scope
       that require the Department's feedback.
   c. Section #3 (Development Schedule and Staging) ­ Covered in Section #2.
   d. Section # 4 (Trip Generation) ­ EM described the assumed land uses, internal capture
      percentages, pass-by percentages, and modal trip reduction. EM discussed the pass-by
      and internal capture percentage assumptions utilized for the trip generation during time
      periods for which there is not published ITE data. He noted that assumptions for pass-by
      percentages were utilized for the shopping center (Land Use Code #820), the pharmacy
      (Land Use Code #881), the drive-in bank (Land Use Code #912), and the high-turnover
      restaurant (Land Use Code #932). He indicated that an assumed pass-by rate of 10% less
      than the weekday P.M. peak was utilized for the weekday A.M. peak and the Saturday
      midday peak if there was no published data. EM noted that no internal capture was
      assumed during the weekday A.M. peak, however TPD did utilize the ITE published
      internal capture percentages for the weekday midday time period to calculate the
      Saturday midday internal capture rate. He indicated that he felt this was appropriate
Meeting Minutes

       given the two time periods should have similar characteristics, with the Saturday midday
       potentially even having higher rates since most people consolidate trips on their day off.
       EM noted that all of the assumptions were consistent with the H&K TIS scoping
       application that was approved by PennDOT in December 2009. JB indicated that it is
       PennDOT's policy to stick to and only utilize ITE published data so that PennDOT can
       be consistent for all projects that are presented to them. JB also stated that he would
       consider local data and background information to support the reductions. EM indicated
       that the assumptions are consistent with the H&K development, and at the scoping
       meeting for that project, it was stated that PennDOT would accept the assumptions if the
       County and the Municipality supported them. Therefore, TPD proceeded under that same
       directive and had meetings with the County and the Township to discuss the assumptions.
       Ultimately it was agreed that both parties supported the assumptions and the associated
       trip generation presented in the scoping application. EM noted that if local data was
       collected for the Saturday midday peak hour, it would most likely come back with higher
       percentages than those assumed, and if approved by the district office, would be available
       to be used by everyone, not just this project. EM indicated that the developer may
       consider collecting the local data if they would be able to use the rates for future projects.
       EM noted that a pass-by reduction is crucial because the 3,500 Saturday midday peak
       hour trips are not realistic for this development. He noted that the roadway
       improvements will be difficult enough but with 3,500 trips, would likely be impossible.
       JB indicated that the 3,500 trips is not realistic, however he wants background support in
       order to approve the assumptions. TPD requests PennDOT's feedback regarding the
       proposed assumptions related to the pass-by and internal capture percentages
       during time periods for which there is not published ITE data.

       EM described the modal trip reduction. He indicated that the maximum reduction rates
       contained on page 21 of PennDOT's TIS Guidelines were utilized for the following
       reasons: 1) Lebanon Transit has agreed to extend bus service to the site, 2) extensive
       internal trails and sidewalks are being proposed on site, and 3) a direct connection is
       being provided to the existing Lebanon Valley Rail-Trail located on the eastern property
       boundary of the 81± acre parcel. He noted that although the existing area does not meet
       the PennDOT criteria to take the maximum reductions, the accommodations being
       proposed in conjunction with the development are anticipated to meet the criteria. He
       added that the Municipality is requiring the developer to provide every possible measure
       to allow for pedestrian/bicycle connectivity and public transportation, thus creating a
       "livable community". Jim Caldwell (JC) indicated that as long as the developer has
       documentation from Lebanon Transit regarding the anticipated bus routes, he would be
       ok with the maximum reduction. JB stated that he needs justification that there is will be
       a future demand to justify the modal trip reductions. JD indicated that he could contact
       Lebanon Transit and get documentation regarding the future demand and the anticipated
       facilities proposed for the site. John Schick (JS) stated that he would like documentation
       from Lebanon Transit as well. It was agreed that it was appropriate to utilize the
       maximum model trip reductions, contingent upon providing a letter from Lebanon Transit
       regarding the anticipated bus routes. Post Meeting Update: The requested letter from
       Lebanon Transit is attached.

   g. Section #7 (Traffic Impact Assessment Required) ­ Did not require discussion.
   h. Section #8 (TIS Study Area) ­ EM described the proposed study area intersections. He
      noted that they are consistent with the intersections analyzed as part of the previously
      discussed TIS's completed in the area. Eric Kinard (EK) requested that a one mile radius
      (related to unsignalized intersections) and a two mile radius (related to signalized
      intersections) be placed on the location map in order to look at the potential need to
      include additional intersections in the TIS (attached). JB questioned why the intersection
      of Route 72 and Cornwall Road was not included as a study area intersection. EM noted
      that the intersection had been previously discussed in detail with the County and
      Township. He stated that it is highly likely that the PennDOT LOS requirements will not
      be met, and thus an alternative transportation plan (ATP) would likely be required. TK
      added that the County is aware that the intersection is currently congested, particularly
      during the start/end of school, and has overlooked needed improvements at the
      intersection since funding just isn't available. Therefore, at the June 22, 2010 meeting
      with the County and Township it was agreed that the developer would do a supplemental
      analysis of the intersection and provide the information to the County since TK stated
      that it would be helpful in their future corridor study. JC noted that the intersection
      cannot be overlooked, however the Township agreed with the County to keep the
      intersection out of the study if a supplemental analysis was completed. This way the
      developer would be contributing towards the future planning efforts at the intersection
      rather than providing improvements at another location as part of the ATP. EK indicated
      that he will need to see where the intersection falls within the previously discussed radii,
      but it was very likely that the intersection will need to be included in the TIS.
       JB questioned if access could be provided to Isabel Drive to reduce the traffic at the
       access intersection with Route 72. According to JC one of the lots may be available for
       purchase, but the other vacant lots have land development approvals or have begun
       construction.
       Jim Loser (JL) indicated that South Lebanon Township would like to see the intersection
       of Wilhelm Avenue and Lincoln Avenue studied. EM questioned if the intersection was
       included in the VA Medical Hospital TIS since the intersection is in very close proximity
       to the hospital's access to Lincoln Avenue. It was determined that the intersection was
       not included in the VA TIS. TK indicated that he thought that the intersection should
       have been studied by the VA Medical Hospital, but noted regardless he felt it would
       appropriate to include the intersection in the study area for the subject TIS.

       TPD requests PennDOT's feedback regarding the proposed study area intersections
       for the TIS.

   j. Section #10 (TIS Analysis Periods and Times) ­ EM indicated that the weekday A.M.,
      weekday P.M., and Saturday midday time periods were proposed to be analyzed as part
      of the TIS. He noted that the P.M. time period studied was 2:30-6:00 P.M. to account for
      the school traffic and the Saturday midday time period was 10:45 A.M. - 12:45 P.M.
      since the peak from the hose counts showed a higher peak at slightly early time period
      then typically studied.
   k. Section #11 (Traffic Adjustment Factors) ­ Did not require discussion.
   l. Sections #12 (Other Projects Within Study Area to be Added to Base Traffic) ­ JB
      questioned if the future land parcels along the Route 72 corridor were included as nearby
      developments. EM indicated that traffic from five (5) nearby developments were
      included, which includes the developments along the Route 72 corridor. EM added that
      the TIS for the proposed VA Medical Hospital Expansion required mitigation at the
      intersection of Rocherty Road and Cornwall Road. The TIS for that project recommend
      that a fee in-lieu-of contribution be made for future improvements at the intersection
      rather than completing half of the ultimate improvements that will required in the future
      once all of the proposed developments in the vicinity of the intersection are built-out. JC
      indicated that North Cornwall Township is coordinating with South Lebanon Township
      to set-up an escrow agreement for the $480,000 fee in-lieu-of contribution.
6. JB questioned if there was anything on the Lebanon County TIP within the study area of this
   TIS and EM answered there was not.
7. JB questioned if there are any critical intersections between the proposed site and the H&K
   site that are not being analyzed as part of one of the TIS's. EM indicated that the H&K TIS
   studied up to the Route 72 and Route 419 intersection and the Route 419 and Cornwall Road
   intersection. He noted that there were no critical intersections between the H&K study area
   intersections and the proposed study area intersections for this project.
8. EM questioned the process of obtaining an approved TIS scope. PennDOT indicated that
   they wanted to see the meeting minutes (with unanswered scope items highlighted) and the
   radii figure. Once they review that information they will send a letter confirming the
   required scope for the TIS.

These comments reflect our understanding of the issues discussed at the meeting. If any attendee
does not agree with these minutes or would like to add to them, please contact us as soon as
possible.

Based on the information provided in the Trip Generation Manual, an Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) Informational Report, not all trips generated by the site are trips that are "new" to
the roadway system. In addition to the new trips generated, there are pass-by trips, which are trips
that are drawn from the passing traffic stream and do not add trips to the adjacent roadways. Pass-
Mr. Mazhar Malik

by trip percentages for the proposed site were utilized as specified in the ITE Trip Generation
Handbook, June 2004 edition. The pass-by percentages utilized are shown in Table 2. Please note
that a pass-by percentage of 10% less than the weekday P.M. peak hour was utilized for other peak
time periods for which published data was not available. Regarding pass-by assumptions for peak
time periods during which data is not available, ITE's Trip Generation manual, 5th Edition, provides
the following indication: The data from a limited number of studies also indicate that the
percentage of pass-by trips is higher during the P.M. peak period (4:00 to 6:00 P.M.) than during
the rest of the day. The percentage of pass-by trips entering a shopping center during hours other

The PennDOT Policies and Procedures for Transportation Impact Studies, January 28, 2009,
recognizes the potential for non-vehicular trips and offers standard assumptions for the modal split of
alternative trips provided that pedestrian, bike, and transit-friendly characteristics present. Based upon
a review of Table 2 on page 21 of the document, TPD utilized modal trip reductions of 4%, 1%, and
3% to account for alternative trips made by pedestrians, bikes, and transit vehicles, respectively.

The ITE Trip Generation Handbook, June 2004 edition, recommends that when studying multi-use
developments (i.e., the proposed development) that an interaction factor be applied to the trip
generation to determine the quantity of "external trips" (trips from external roadways) and "internal
trips" (trips between uses on-site that do not utilize the external roadways). This methodology was
utilized to determine the interaction factor between the office, residential, and retail land uses on the
81+/- acre tract on the eastern side of Cornwall Road. In order to take a conservative approach
when calculating the interaction factor the pharmacy, bank, and restaurants were summed together
into a general "retail" category. This methodology is conservative in the fact that it assumes zero
interaction between similar land uses (i.e. nobody who uses the bank will also use the pharmacy).
In order to be further conservative the hotel was not included in the calculation of interaction factor.
Based on this analysis, interaction factors of 11%, 9% and 12% were calculated under the full build-
out conditions for the uses assumed to interact with one another for an average weekday and the
        Mr. Mazhar Malik

        weekday P.M. and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively. No interaction factors were assumed
        under Phase 1 of the development, as well during the weekday A.M. peak hour under full build-out
        of the development. The Multi-Use Development Trip Generation and Internal Capture Summary
        sheets are attached for reference.

        It should be noted that the interaction factor calculation for the Saturday midday peak hour utilizes
        the internal capture rates contained in Tables 7.1 and 7.2 of the ITE Trip Generation Handbook,
        June 2004 edition related to the weekday midday peak hour. Although there is not specific
        published data related to internal capture percentages during the Saturday midday peak hour, it is
        reasonable to assume the Saturday midday would have similar characteristics to the weekday
        midday time period, if not a higher percentage. Since the computations are based on a percentage of
        trips and not number of trips, the interaction is based on types of trips being performed during a
        certain time period. It is our opinion Saturday trips to retail establishments reflect the same type of
        multi-destination visits as during a midday peak hour.

        For purposes of this trip generation analysis, Phase 1 of the proposed development was assumed
        to consist of the following mix of land uses:
            80 condominium/townhome dwelling units (ITE Land Use Code #230);
            97,600 square foot office park (ITE Land Use Code #710);
            226,900 square foot Shopping Center (ITE Land Use Code #820).

        Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 summarize the trip generation for Phase 1 of the proposed development for an
        average weekday and the weekday A.M., P.M., and Saturday midday peak hours, respectively.

       will assume full build-out of this development by 2014.
       Alden Place, located in Cornwall Borough on the eastern side of Route 72, between
       Route 419 and Ironmaster Road. The proposed age-restricted development will be
       constructed in five (5) phases, with full build-out consisting of 505 residential dwelling
       units (445 single homes/villas in the Cornwall neighborhood and 60 single homes in the
       Northgate neighborhood). Based upon a conversation with a staff member of the
       communities sales office in October 2009, 100 of the units in the Cornwall neighborhood
       are built and occupied and 3 of the units in the Northgate neighborhood are built and
       occupied. TPD will assume full build-out of this development by 2014.
       The Preserve at Historic Cornwall Village, located in Cornwall Borough between Route
       322 and Route 419 in the vicinity of Burd Coleman Village and Minersvillage. Full
       build-out of the proposed development will consist of 590 residential dwelling units, a
       hotel with 250 conventional rooms and 60 cottages, a 60,000 square foot (s.f.) indoor
       water park, a village commercial area with 150,000 s.f. of total space, and 12,000 s.f. of
       restaurant space. Phase 1 of the proposed development will consist of 137 residential
       dwelling units, the hotel with 250 conventional rooms and 60 cottages, and the 60,000
       square foot (s.f.) indoor water park. TPD will assume phase 1 of this development by

13. TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT:
   The distribution and assignment of site-generated new trips will be based upon an analysis of
   the following: (1) existing traffic patterns and distributions within the study area; (2)
   available routes for travel; and (3) the proposed site driveway locations.

   For the office/residential land uses, a modified gravity model analysis was performed using
   the 2000 census journey to work figures for North Cornwall Township. The 2000 census
   journey to work figures summarize the number of people that travel to North Cornwall
   Township to work from seventy-one surrounding municipalities in Berks, Chester,
   Cumberland, Dauphin, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon, Northumberland, Schuylkill,
   Westmoreland and York Counties. The results of the gravity model analysis are attached for
   reference. Furthermore, the trip distribution percentage between the eastern and western
   tracts of the development was determined based upon ITE's methodology for calculating the
   interaction factor for multi-use developments. The results of the interaction factor
   calculations are attached for reference. Based on the results of the gravity model and
   interaction factor methodology, the new office/residential trips for the proposed development
   were distributed to the local roadway network based on the percentages shown in Table 11.

   For the retail land uses, a gravity model analysis was performed using the 2000 census
   population figures for North Cornwall Township and the twelve (12) neighboring
   municipalities (approximately 10 mile radius). The results of the gravity model analysis are
   attached for reference. Furthermore, the trip distribution percentage between the eastern and
   western tracts of the development was determined based upon ITE's methodology for
   calculating the interaction factor for multi-use developments. The results of the interaction
   factor calculations are attached for reference. Based on the results of the gravity model and
   interaction factor methodology, the new retail trips for the proposed development were
   distributed to the local roadway network based on the percentages shown in Table 12.

INTRODUCTION 
North  Cornwall  Township  is  located  in  Lebanon  County,  southwest  of  the  City  of  Lebanon.  In  addition  to  bordering  the 
city,  North  Cornwall  Township  also  shares  a  boundary  with  West  Lebanon,  Annville,  South  Annville,  North  Lebanon, 
West  Cornwall,  and  South  Lebanon  Townships,  and  Cleona  and  Cornwall  Boroughs.  The  Township  is  experiencing 
increased  commercial  and  residential  growth,  as  development  pushes  outward  from  the  City  of  Lebanon.  The  northern 
and  eastern  portions  of  the  Township  are  largely  of  a  suburban  nature,  and  contain  a  variety  of  residential  subdivisions, 
a  commercial  corridor,  and  an  office  park.  The  southwestern  portion  of  the  Township  has  a  decidedly  different 
character. This area of the Township is agricultural and more rural in nature; population and development are less dense 
and  roadways  are  less  congested.  The  Township  also 
contains  three  creeks,  the  Quittapahilla  Creek,  Snitz 
Creek,  and  Beck  Creek;  a  country  club;  a  golf  course;  the 
Lebanon  Expo  Center;  and  several  recreational  and 
historical resources. 

North  Cornwall  Township  recognizes  that  with  this 
diversity  in  land  use  comes  a  mixture  in  the  type  and 
amount of residents and visitors that are travelling within 
or  through  the  Township.  Although  the  primary  mode  of 
transit  for  most  residents  and  visitors  is  by  automobile, 
the  Township  feels  that  it  is  necessary  to  plan  for  and 
implement  safe  and  appropriate  facilities  to 
accommodate            pedestrians,       joggers,       bicyclists, 
equestrians,  and  other  forms  of  nonmotorized 
transportation.  Furthermore,  as  development  and  the 
price  of  gas  increase,  and  as  people  look  to  improve  their 
own  health  and  the  health  of  the  environment,  the 
number of people opting for nonmotorized transportation is only expected to increase. 

P URPOSE   OF   THE   P LAN  

The  purpose  of  the  North  Cornwall  Township  Master  Plan  for  NonMotorized  Trail  Connections  is  to  lay  the  foundation 
for  a  network  of  greenways,  trails,  and  onroad  designated  routes  in  the  Township  that  provide  safe  and  direct 
connections  for  nonmotorized  transportation,  and  opportunities  for  passive  recreation  and  the  conservation  of  natural 
resources.  This  plan  and  accompanying  maps  represent  the  Township's  intent  to  improve  and  enhance  the  Township's 
nonmotorized transportation network. 

R ELATIONSHIP   TO   S TATE   P LANNING   D OCUMENTS  

This  plan  has  been  designed  to  be  consistent  with  several  state  planning  documents  and  initiatives,  including  the  PA 
Department  of  Conservation  and  Natural  Resources'  (DCNR)  20092013  statewide  comprehensive  outdoor  recreation 
plan  (SCORP),  Pennsylvania  Outdoors:  The  Keystone  for  Healthy  Living,  and  the  PA  Department  of  Transportation's 
(PennDOT) Smart Transportation Initiative. The plan also supports the Keystone Principles developed by the Department 

N ORTH   C ORNWALL   T OWNSHIP   M ASTER   P LAN   FOR   N ON  M OTORIZED   T RAIL   C ONNECTIONS                             1 | P A G E  
of Community and  Economic Development (DCED)  and is  consistent with the  Department  of Environmental Protection's 
initiatives  of  improving  the  environment  by  giving  people  options  for  nonmotorized  transit,  thereby  encouraging 
increased bicyclist and pedestrian activity, and decreased dependency on the automobile. 

Pennsylvania  Outdoors:  The  Keystone  for  Healthy  Living  was  developed  to  direct  the  use  of  federal  Land  and  Water 
Conservation  Funds  that  come  to  the  state.  It  consists  of  a  statewide  assessment  of  outdoor  recreation  needs  and 
supplies,  as  well  as  an  action  plan  for  future  steps  to  help  enhance  outdoor  recreation.  The  action  plan  is  organized 
thematically under four goals: 

    ·    Strengthen connections between outdoor recreation, healthy lifestyles, and economic benefits in communities; 
    ·    Reconnect  people  to  the  outdoors  and  develop  a  stewardship  ethic  through  outdoor  recreation  opportunities 
         and experiences; 
    ·    Develop  a  statewide  land  and  water  trail  network  to  facilitate  recreation,  transportation,  and  healthy  lifestyles; 
         and, 
    ·    Enhance outdoor recreation through better state agency cooperation. 

The  North  Cornwall  Township  Master  Plan  for  NonMotorized  Trail  Connections  directly  supports  the  first  three  of  these 
overriding  goals,  as  it  will  connect  people  to  parks  and  other  destinations  within  and  in  proximity  to  the  Township; 
encourage people to get outdoors to reach their destinations and to recreate; and create a network of trails to facilitate 
recreation, transportation, and support healthy lifestyles in the community. 

This  plan  also  supports  many  of  the  principles  of  PennDOT's  Smart  Transportation  initiative.  Smart  Transportation  is 
partnering  to  build  great  communities  for  future  generations  of  Pennsylvanians  by  linking  transportation  investments 
with land use planning and decisionmaking.  The Township's plan helps  to advance several  of Smart  Transportation's 10 
themes: 

    ·    Leverage  and  preserve  existing  investments  ­  where  practicable,  North  Cornwall's  plan  looks  at  using  the 
         existing roadway network to move nonmotorized users. 
    ·    Choose  projects  with  high  value/price  ratio  ­  the  Township  will  work  to  implement  projects  that  form  key 
         connections between neighborhoods and destinations. 
    ·    Safety  always  and  maybe  safety  only  ­  safety  has  been  a  key  theme  of  this  plan  and  all  proposed  connections 
         were designed with the intent of ensuring safety for the user. 
    ·    Accommodate all modes of travel ­ this plan strives to accommodate various types of nonmotorized users, such 
         as bicyclists, pedestrians, and equestrians. 
    ·    Enhance  local  network  ­  North  Cornwall  Township  has  developed  this  plan  with  an  eye  toward  regional 
         connections and the ways in which enhancing the local network can benefit the region. 
    ·    Build  towns  not  sprawl  ­  North  Cornwall  Township  has  distinct  neighborhoods  and  community  resources;  this 
         plan  will  look  to  enable  connections  for  nonmotorized  users  between  neighborhoods  and  destinations,  helping 
         to build a strong community, and increase walkability and bikeability, and enhance the overall quality of life. 
    ·    Understand the  context; plan and design within  the context ­ this  plan recognizes that  the word "trail" can have 
         many  interpretations,  and  that  improvements  associated  with  one  proposed  connection  may  be  very  different 
         than  improvements  associated  with  another  proposed  connection  due  to  existing  transportation,  land  use,  and 
         environmental conditions. 
    ·    Develop  local  governments  as  strong  land  use  partners  ­  North  Cornwall  Township  intends  to  use  this  plan  to 
         guide  future  development  decisions,  and  intends  to  work  with  developers,  Lebanon  County,  surrounding 
         municipalities, and PennDOT to enable key nonmotorized connections.

The  plan  is  organized  into  four  sections,  including  this  introductory  section.  The  second  section  reviews  existing 
conditions  within  the  Township  as  they  pertain  to  the  nonmotorized  transportation  network  and  the  system's 
components including destinations, natural features  and greenways; proposed  trail connections, and the  different types 
of  users  expected  to  take  advantage  of  these  facilities.  The  third  section  describes  the  public  outreach  program 
associated  with  this  planning  effort  and  sets  forth  goals  and  objectives  for  nonmotorized  trail  connections  in  the 
Township.  The  fourth  section  represents  the  action  plan  for  the  future  and  is  meant  to  assist  the  Township  with 
implementing  the  plan.  It  discusses  key  issues  and  opportunities,  provides  a  descriptive  list  of  projects,  and  details  first 
steps  for  the  Township  to  take  to  implement  short  term  improvements.  The  fourth  section  also  includes  a  phasing  plan 
of the overall trails system projects. Several appendices are also included with the plan. 

The  plan  has  been  structured  to  be  user  friendly.  It  is  meant  to  be  used  and  handled  often  as  the  Township  moves 
forward  with  implementation.  The  implementation  strategies  and  phasing  plan  are  meant  to  be  used  as  a  checklist  to 
get  work  done.  The  top  three  priority  linkages  are  detailed  to  describe  the  project  in  detail  and  provide  typical  sections 
for  reference  and  consideration  during  the  design  phase  of  these  and  similar  improvement  projects.  The  maps  are 
intended  to  graphically  show  the  "big  picture"  of  the  Township's  plans  for  trail  development.  As  key  projects  are 
implemented,  the  Township  will  review  and  update  the  plan  to  define  new  short  term  improvements,  and  revise  the 
maps  so  that  they  reflect  completed  projects  and  new  priorities.  Concurrently,  the  Township  will  involve  Lebanon 
County  Planning  Department,  surrounding  municipalities,  and  other  key  stakeholders  to  develop  a  system  of  non
motorized trail connections that can serve the region within and beyond North Cornwall Township boundaries. 

B UILDING   P ARTNERSHIPS  

North  Cornwall  Township  recognizes  that  they  will  need  to  engage  numerous  partners  in  order  to  successfully 
implement the plan and develop a system of nonmotorized connections to serve the community and throughtravelers. 
To that end, the Township  will be looking to partner  with surrounding  municipalities, Lebanon County, PennDOT, DCNR, 
and other state agencies, local groups and organizations, developers, residents, and the business community to  develop 
and maintain portions of the trail system. 

The  Township  also  understands  that  education  and  outreach  are  critical  to  helping  people  understand  that  safe, 
effective, nonmotorized connections are being developed, and to communicate rules and regulations to the community 
to ensure appropriate use of the trails system.

ENVISIONING THE FUTURE 
E STABLISHING   THE   S TUDY   C OMMITTEE  

North  Cornwall  Township  had  an  idea  of  the  overriding  goals  that  it  wanted  to  accomplish  through  this  planning  effort, 
but  wanted  to  ensure  that  the  final  plan  represented  various  viewpoints  that  exist  in  the  Township.  To  that  end,  the 
Township  organized  a  study  committee  comprised  of  individuals  representing  the  Township  staff,  Planning  Commission, 
Recreation  Board,  Board  of  Supervisors,  as  well  as  the  CornwallLebanon  School  District,  Lebanon  County  Planning 
Department,  area  businesses,  and  residents.  Study  committee  members  were  asked  to  attend  eight  meetings  including 
two  joint  meetings  with  the  Township  Board  of  Supervisors,  a  joint  meeting  with  the  Planning  Commission,  a  joint 
meeting with the Recreation Board, and a community public meeting. 

C OMMUNITY   P UBLIC   M EETING   AND   K EY   S TAKEHOLDER   I NVOLVEMENT  

Following  the  study  committee's  refinements  to  the  draft  proposed  connections  map,  North  Cornwall  Township 
conducted  a  community  public  meeting  on  Tuesday,  June  15,  2010,  at  the  Neversink  Fire  Company,  to  present  and 
receive  feedback  on  the  draft  map.  The  meeting  was  advertised  on  the  Township  website  and  a  press  release  was 
submitted to the Lebanon Daily News. The study committee indentified 25 key stakeholders in the community that were 
personally invited to attend the meeting to provide input. These individuals received letter invitations and a hard copy of 
the  draft  proposed  connections  map.  Key  stakeholders  included  representatives  from  the  following  groups  and 
organizations: 

    ·    Pennsylvania  Department  of  Conservation  and                      ·   Quittapahilla Creek Watershed Association

After  listening  to  an  overview  of  the  draft  proposed  connections  map,  meeting  attendees  broke  out  into  five  small 
groups  to  more  closely  scrutinize  the  proposed  destinations  and  the  best  routes  to  connect  them,  as  well  as  to  discuss 
the  top  priorities  on  which  the  Township  should  focus.  Each  small  group  presented  their  feedback  to  the  larger 
combined group or meeting attendees. The meeting concluded with attendees participating in a visioning exercise to list 
"one  thing"  that  they  wanted  the  plan  to  do  or  accomplish.  Full  results  from  the  public  participation  meeting  are 
included in Appendix IV of this report.

Several  key  themes  emerged  from  the  public  participation  meeting.  Coming  out  of  the  meeting,  the  study  committee 
focused  on  these  themes  to  further  refine  the  map  and  identify  the  top  three  priority  projects  for  implementation. 
These themes included: 

    ·    Safety 
    ·    Importance of connecting to the Lebanon Valley Rail Trail, and the importance of the rail trail itself 
    ·    Connecting the parks 
    ·    Connecting people to the parks 
    ·    Consider establishing an eastwest connection along the Quittapahilla Creek (previously not depicted on map) 
    ·    Utilize existing Townshipowned properties, easements, or rights of way where possible 

P RESENTATION   TO   THE   P LANNING   C OMMISSION   AND   R ECREATION   B OARD  

Following the community public meeting, the study committee held joint meetings with the Recreation Board (June 21st) 
and  Planning  Commission  (June  30th)  to  present  the  results  of  the  public  participation  meeting,  and  to  discuss  priority 
projects  and  proposed  nonmotorized  trail  connection  facilities,  and  specific  improvements.  Additional  feedback 
received  from  the  Lebanon  Valley  Bicycle  Coalition  was  also  presented  to  the  study  committee,  Recreation  Board,  and 
Planning Commission. 

The  study  committee  worked  to  revise  a  draft  North  Cornwall  Township  Master  Plan  for  NonMotorized  Trail 
Connections  before  the  draft  plan  was  presented  to  the  Board  of  Supervisors  at  a  regular  meeting  on  August  3,  2010. 
The final plan was presented to the Supervisors at their September 7, 2010 meeting.

Goals  and  objectives  for  North  Cornwall  Township's  system  of  nonmotorized  trail  connections  evolved  throughout  the 
master  planning  process  as  follows.  These  goals  and  objectives  have  provided  critical  guidance  in  developing  the 
concepts contained in the master plan. 

    ·    Develop a system of nonmotorized trail connections that provides a safe and enjoyable experience for all users. 
    ·    Develop  a  system  of  nonmotorized  trail  connections  that  involves  a  variety  of  different  types  of  facilities 
         including  offroad  shared  use  paths,  bicycle  lanes,  combination  bicycle/pedestrian  lanes,  sidewalks,  and 
         equestrian trails. 
    · Connect neighborhoods and areas of concentrated residential development to the parks, commercial areas, and 
         other key destinations within and in proximity to the Township. 
    · Enable  connections  between  planned  nonmotorized  trail  connections  in  North  Cornwall  Township  and 
         connections in neighboring municipalities. 
    · Consider the Snitz and Quittapahilla Creek stream corridors as a mechanism for greenway and trail development 
         to provide a corridor for wildlife migration and a mechanism for human nonmotorized transportation. 
    · Be  costefficient  by  making  use  of  existing  sidewalks,  Township  owned  property,  easements,  and  roadway 
         infrastructure,  and  by  encouraging  new  trail  connections  to  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  new  residential 
         and commercial developments. 
    · Develop  a  system  of  nonmotorized  trail  connections  that  provides  recreational  opportunities,  an  alternative 
         means of transportation, and enhances tourism and economic development opportunities. 
    · Establish  a  coordinated  plan  for  community  outreach  and  education  to  make  people  aware  of  the  non
         motorized connections that exist, and to communicate rules and regulations, helping to ensure safety for users.

GETTING THERE ­ AN ACTION PLAN FOR THE FUTURE 
S UMMARY   OF   K EY   I SSUES   AND   O PPORTUNITIES  

Several  issues  and  opportunities  were  identified  at  the  public  participation  meeting  and  further  clarified  through 
discussions with the study committee, Planning Commission, Recreation Board, and through field verification. 

I SSUES /N EEDS  

    ·    Existing  lack  of  a  nonmotorized  trail  connection  between  the  Township's  population  centers  and  the  parks  and 
         recreational resources currently being developed in the Township and surrounding communities. 
    ·    Existing  lack  of  a  nonmotorized  trail  connection  between  the  various  parks  and  recreational  resources  that  the 
         Township is planning to develop, including Gloninger Park, Gloninger Woods Park, and Snitz Creek Park. 
    ·    Existing  lack  of  a  nonmotorized  trail  connection  between  the  Township's  population  centers  and  commercial 
         areas. 
    ·    Need  to  consider  regional  trail  resources,  such  as  the  Lebanon  Valley  Rail  Trail,  and  trail  development  efforts  in 
         surrounding municipalities. 
    ·    Need  to  consider  that  nonmotorized  transportation  in  North  Cornwall  Township  does  not  begin  and  end  at 
         Townshipboundaries. 
    ·    Need  to  consider  that  different  users  have  different  needs  and  safety  should  be  a  priority  for  all  users.  Several 
         existing  roadways  have  "choke  points"  that  inhibit  safety  for  bicyclists,  pedestrians,  and  other  nonmotorized 
         users. 

O PPORTUNITIES  

    ·    The  Snitz  Creek  and  Quittapahilla  Creek  provide  opportunities  for  northsouth  and  eastwest  connections, 
         respectively, between population centers and key destinations. 
    ·    The Lebanon Valley Rail Trail serves as a tremendous regional recreation and alternative transportation resource 
         in  close  proximity  to  the  Township  and  there  may  be  multiple  opportunities  for  the  Township  to  provide 
         connections to this resource. 
    ·    Moving  forward,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  work  with  developers  to  ensure  that  trail  resources  are  integrated 
         into plans for new developments in the Township. 
    ·    Existing  sidewalk  networks,  Townshipowned  property,  and  sewer  easements  may  offer  opportunities  for  trail 
         development. 
    ·    Existing roadway rights of way provide opportunities for the Township to implement nonmotorized connections 
         through appropriate roadway widening, striping, and signage. 
    ·    Opportunities  for  partnerships.  As  part  of  the  master  plan  process,  North  Cornwall  Township  has  involved 
         numerous  partners.  Going  forward,  it  will  be  important  for  the  Township  to  continue  to  engage  these  partners, 
         including  the  Lebanon  County  Planning  Department,  surrounding  municipalities,  homeowners  associations,  the 
         Lebanon Valley Bicycle Coalition, and other interested groups and organizations to further implementation.

R ECOMMENDED   N ON  M OTORIZED   T RAIL   C ONNECTION   F ACILITIES  

The  proposed  system  of  nonmotorized  connections  in  North  Cornwall  Township  incorporates  multiple  types  of  trail 
facilities.  The  specific  facility  that  is  proposed  at  each  location  is  dependent  on  the  location,  proposed  user,  nearby 
connections,  and  the  existing  resources  that  are  available,  e.g.  sidewalks,  roadway  shoulders,  etc.  This  section  discusses 
typical design standards for each of the different types of proposed facilities. 

Several  sources  were  used  to  develop  standards  for  North  Cornwall  Township  to  use  as  a  base  as  it  moves  forward  with 
implementation  of  the  trails  system.  These  sources  include  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and 
Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO)  DRAFT  Guide  for  the  Planning,  Design,  and  Operation  of  Bicycle  Facilities  (February 
2010);  AASHTO  Guide  for  the  Development  of  Bicycle  Facilities  (1999);  Montgomery  County  Planning  Commission's 
Guidelines  for  Trail  Development  within  Montgomery  County,  Pennsylvania;  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation, 
Federal  Highway  Administration's  Manual  on  Uniform  Traffic  Control  Devices  for  Streets  and  Highways  2009.  The  draft 
AASHTO  publication  represents  the  update  to  the  1999  guide.  The  first  three  sources  noted  were  primarily  used  to 
establish construction design standards, while the FHA's manual was used to recommend appropriate signage. 

S HARED   U SE   P ATH  

AASHTO defines a shared  use path as "physically separated from motorized vehicular traffic by an open  space or  barrier 
and  either  within  the  highway  rightofway  or  within  an  independent  rightofway.  Shared  use  paths  should  be  thought 
of  as  a  system  of  offroad  transportation  routes  for  bicyclists  and  other  users  that  extends  and  complements  the 
roadway  network."  Shared  use  paths  are  designed  to  accommodate  twoway  travel  for  various  nonmotorized  users, 
and are not meant to preclude onroad bicycle facilities. 

Typical  design  standards  for  shared  use  paths  take  into  account  the  usable  width,  horizontal  clearance  required,  and 
ADA accessibility, among other factors as shown in Table 2. Although recommended widths  for a paved shared use path 
range  from  1014  feet,  depending  on  the  amount  and  types  of  nonmotorized  traffic,  a  reduced  width  of  8  feet  may  be 
used for a short distance to avoid a physical constraint, or where the following conditions prevail: 

    ·    Bicycle traffic is expected to be low, even on peak days or during peak hours. 
    ·    Pedestrian use of the facility is not expected to be more than occasional. 
    ·    Horizontal and vertical alignments provide safe and frequent passing opportunities. 
    ·    The  path  will  not  be  regularly  subjected  to  maintenance  vehicle  loading  conditions  that  would  cause  pavement 
         edge damage.

As  the  Township  looks  at  the  design  of  each  specific  facility,  appropriate  surface  material  will  also  need  to  be 
considered.  In  high  use  areas,  it  is  recommended  that  the  Township  look  at  paving  shared  use  paths;  in  areas  with  a 
lower  volume  of  use,  the  Township  may  instead  consider  Nature  Trail  Pathway  Mix  material  or  a  packed  stone  dust. 
Nature  Trail  Pathway  Mix  is  described  as  a  selfhealing  trail  material  that  has  been  used  on  the  York  County  Rail  Trail.  It 
was  developed  by  York  Building  Products  and  is  a  blend  of  stone  and  clay  binders  that  provides  a  stable  walking  and 
riding surface on walkways, bike paths, and rail trails. 

S IDEWALK   /   B IKE   L ANE  

A combination of sidewalks and bike lanes are recommended in areas where an existing continuous sidewalk is in place, 
or  is  able  to  be  extended  to  serve  neighboring  properties  and  form  a  continuous  sidewalk.  In  areas  where  this  type  of 
facility  is  proposed,  pedestrians  are  to  be  accommodated  on  the  sidewalk,  and  bicyclists  are  to  be  accommodated  on
road  through  either  a  striped  bicycle  lane  or  unstriped  shared  lane.  Shared  lanes  are  discussed  further  in  the  section 
that talks about bicycle lanes. Should the width of the existing automobile travel lanes become a concern in these areas, 
the  Township  may  consider  limiting  parking  to  one  side  of  the  street  to  gain  additional  travel  lane  width.  Typical 
standards for bicycle lanes are discussed in greater detail in the following sections. 

In areas where sidewalk/bike lane facilities are proposed, the Township will need to consider retrofitting bicycle facilities 
on  existing  streets,  either  by  widening  the  roadway  or  reconfiguring  the  existing  roadway.  In  order  to  leave  the  existing 
sidewalk  undisturbed  for  pedestrian  use,  the  Township  will  need  to  look  into  retrofitting  bicycle  facilities  without 
widening the existing roadway. There are three methods of modifying the roadway to improve bicycle accommodation: 

     ·    Reduce or reallocate the width used by travel lanes. 
     ·    Reduce the number of travel lanes. 
     ·    Reconfigure or reduce onstreet parking. 

It  is  important  to  remember  that  surface  condition  significantly  affects  bicycle  travel,  control,  and  comfort.  Other 
improvements may be needed to better accommodate bicyclists including: 

     ·    Repairing rough or uneven pavement surfaces. 
     ·    Replacing unsafe drainage grates with a design that is compatible with bicycle use. 
     ·    Raising or lowering existing drainage grates and manhole or utility covers so they are flush with the pavement. 

Sidewalks  can  provide  a  safe  place  for  pedestrian  movement,  but  should  not  be  used  by  bicyclists.  After  a  continuous 
sidewalk  is  established,  it  will  be  important  that  it  is  continuously  maintained  and  kept  free  of  vegetation  and  other 
debris,  to  provide  a  smooth,  passable  surface.  The  North  Cornwall  Township  Subdivision  and  Land  Development 
Ordinance  specifies  that  sidewalks  shall  be  four  feet  wide  in  single  family  residential  developments;  five  feet  wide  in 
multifamily  residential  developments;  and  ten  feet  wide  in  commercial  developments.  The  Township  will  also  need  to 
consider ADA accommodations, crosswalks, and appropriate traffic calming measures, especially at busy intersections. 

B IKE   /   P EDESTRIAN   L ANE  

A combination bicycle/pedestrian lane is proposed in areas where separated sidewalks do not currently exist and where 
it  is  not  practical  to  establish  new  sidewalks.  In  such  situations,  the  combination  bicycle/pedestrian  lane  will  be  located 
on  the  roadway.  These  areas  are  located  within,  on  the  edge,  or  adjacent  to  neighborhoods,  where  it  is  likely  that  there 
will  be  a  combination  of  pedestrians  and  bicyclists  using  the  connection  for  transportation,  recreation,  or  to  reach  a 
particular destination. 
N ORTH   C ORNWALL   T OWNSHIP   M ASTER   P LAN   FOR   N ON  M OTORIZED   T RAIL   C ONNECTIONS                            19   |   P A G E  
Each  area  will  need  to  be  evaluated  during  the  design  phase  of  the  project  to  determine  what  particular  improvements 
are  necessary.  Within  neighborhoods,  the  speed  and  volume  of  automobile  traffic  may  be  low  enough  that  erecting 
signage  to  raise  awareness  of  bicyclists  and  pedestrians  is  the  only  improvement  necessary.  If  it  is  determined  that  a 
striped shoulder is warranted, it is recommended that the width of the lane be at least 5 feet, and wider where possible, 
to  encourage  safety  for  bicyclists,  pedestrians,  and  motor  vehicle  traffic.  In  cases  where  limited  space  is  available,  and 
conditions  are  practical  for  shared  use  of  the  roadway  by  automobiles  and  bicycles,  the  Township  may  consider 
designating a 4 foot to 5 foot lane for pedestrian use, and allowing bicyclists to share a travel lane with motorists. 

In  cases  where  bicyclists  and  pedestrians  are  using  a  combination  bicycle/pedestrian  lane,  appropriate  signage  and 
traffic  calming  techniques  should  be  put  in  place  to  encourage  motorists  to  slow  down,  and  to  alert  motorists  and 
bicyclists  that  they  are  within  a  residential  area  and  the  presence  of  an  additional  user  is  likely.  A  toolbox  of  traffic 
calming techniques is included in Appendix II. 


S HARED   L ANES   (B ICYCLES   AND   A UTOMOBILES )  

The  2010  draft  AASHTO  publication  notes  that  "there  are  no  bicyclespecific  designs  or  dimensions  for  shared  lanes  on 
roadways,  but  various  design  features  can  make  shared  lanes  more  compatible  with  bicycling,  such  as  good  pavement 
quality,  adequate  sight  distances,  roadway  designs  that  encourage  lower  speeds,  and  bicyclecompatible  drainage 
grates,  bridge  expansion  joints,  and  railroad  crossings.  Generally  speaking,  roadways  that  carry  low  volumes  of  traffic, 
and/or where traffic typically operates at low speeds, may be suitable as shared lanes in their present condition." 

North Cornwall Township may consider utilizing shared lanes (bicycle/automobile) in conditions where roadway width is 
inadequate to safely and comfortably accommodate a bicycle/pedestrian lane alongside traffic lanes. In these cases, the 
Township  may  also  consider  an  open  space  separation  or  barrier  between  the  shared  lane  and  the  pedestrian  lane, 
essentially creating a pedestrian pathway. 

When  utilizing  a  shared  lane  approach,  lane  widths  of  14  feet  or  greater  enable  motorists  to  pass  a  bicycle  without 
encroaching  into  the  adjacent  lane.  Adding  additional  lane  width  should  be  weighed  against  the  potential  for  motorists 
to  travel  at  higher  speeds  in  these  circumstances,  potentially  compromising  bicycle  comfort  and  safety.  A  shared  lane 
marking  symbol  is  useful  in  situations  where  there  is  inadequate  width  to  accommodate  bicyclists  in  a  separate  bicycle 
lane, and helps to increase awareness for motorists and other bicyclists. A "Share the Road" sign may be useful in shared 
lane areas, but should not be used to designate a bike route. 

B ICYCLE   L ANE  

Bicycle lanes are proposed in areas that bicyclists typically travel, and are designed to carry oneway bicycle traffic in the 
same  direction  as  automobile  traffic.  In  North  Cornwall  Township,  bicycle  lanes  are  proposed  in  areas  where  bicyclists 
are  predominantly  riding  to  reach  a  destination,  and  where  there  is  little  pedestrian  activity  anticipated,  due  to  low 
population  densities.  In  these  areas,  paved  shoulders  can  be  designated  as  bike  lanes  by  installing  bike  lane  symbol 
markings, and meeting all bicycle lane criteria. 

Bike  lanes  are  used  to  delineate  available  road  space  for  preferential  use  by  bicyclists  and  to  facilitate  more  predictable 
movements  by  bicyclists  and  motorists.  Bike  lanes  should  have  a  smooth  riding  surface,  and  raised  surfaces  should  not 
be  used  to  separate  the  bicycle  lane  from  the  traffic  lane,  as  bicyclists  may  need  to  enter  the  automobile  travel  lane  to 
pass other bicycles or to execute turns.

AASHTO recommends that bicycle lane width be determined by context and anticipated use. Under most circumstances, 
the  preferred  width  for  bicycle  lanes  is  five  feet.  For  roadways  with  no  curb  and  gutter  and  no  onstreet  parking,  the 
minimum  width  of  a  bike  lane  is  four  feet.  Wider  bicycle  lanes  may  be  desirable  under  the 
following conditions: 

    ·    Adjacent  to  a  narrow  parking  lane  with  vehicle  turnover,  such  as  those  servicing 
         shops or restaurants. 
    ·    In  areas  with  high  bicycle  use,  a  bike  lane  width  of  6  to  8  feet  makes  it  possible  for 
         bicycles to ride sidebyside or pass each other without leaving the lane. 
    ·    On  highspeed  (greater  than  45  mph)  and  high  volume  roadways,  or  where  there  is 
         a  substantial  number  of  heavy  vehicles,  a  wide  bicycle  lane  provides  additional 
         lateral  separation  between  motor  vehicles  and  bicycles  to  minimize  wind  blast  and 
         other effects. 

In North Cornwall Township, a 4 to 5 foot bicycle lane is considered adequate in most areas 
that bicycle lanes are recommended. Appropriate signage will help to increase awareness of 
bicyclists in these areas. 


R ECOMMENDED   S IGNAGE  

The  Manual  on  Uniform  Traffic  Control  Devices  states  that  the  BIKE  LANE  (R317)  sign  shall  be  used  only  in  conjunction 
with  marked  bicycle  lanes,  and  shall  be  placed  at  periodic  intervals  along  the  bicycle  lanes.  The  AHEAD  (R317a)  sign 
should be mounted directly below a R317 sign in advance of the beginning of a marked bicycle lane. The ENDS (R317b) 
sign  should  be  mounted  directly  below  a  R317  sign  at  the  end  of  a  marked  bicycle  lane.  Sign  images  are  from  the 
Manual of Traffic Signs by Richard C. Moeur. 

S EPARATED   E QUESTRIAN   T RAIL  

Equestrian  trails  are  recommended  in  select  locations  in  the  Township  to  enable  equestrians  to  travel  from  the  riding 
stables to the equestrian facilities on the Lebanon Valley Rail Trail. Aside from this area, as of 2010, there has not been a 
large  demand  for  equestrian  facilities  in  the  Township,  but  the  Township  may  reevaluate  the  need  for  additional 
equestrian facilities in the future. 

Equestrian  trails  should  be  unpaved,  natural  surfaces,  separated  from  all  other  types  of  motorized  and  nonmotorized 
traffic.  Equestrian  trails  should  be  designed  as  separated,  offroad  facilities,  at  least  ten  feet  to  twelve  feet  wide.  The 
Township may consider utilizing Nature Trail Pathway Mix, or a similar material in these areas. 

G REENWAYS  

For  the  purpose  of  this  plan,  greenways  are  proposed  as  facilities  that  provide  a  natural  resources  conservation 
component.  Presently,  areas  designated  as  greenway  are  not  proposed  for  trail  development,  but  may  be  evaluated  for 
trail development at a later time. Additionally, some areas where shared use  paths are proposed, for example along  the 
Snitz  and  Quittapahilla  Creeks,  may  offer  opportunities  for  natural  resources  conservation  as  well.  These  two  locations, 
specifically, should be recognized as having conservation and recreation components.

R ECOMMENDED   S IGNAGE   ­   O VERALL  

The U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for 
Streets  and  Highways  (2009)  states,  "The  Bicycle  Warning  (W111)  sign  alerts  the  road  user  to  unexpected  entries  into 
the  roadway  by  bicyclists,  and  other  crossing  activities  that  might  cause  conflicts.  These  conflicts  might  be  relatively 
confined,  or  might  occur  randomly  over  a  segment  of  roadway.  The  combined  Bicycle/Pedestrian  (W1115)  sign  may  be 
used  where  both  bicyclists  and  pedestrians  might  be  crossing  the  roadway,  such  as  at  an  intersection  with  a  shared  use 
path.  A  TRAIL  XING  (W1115P)  supplemental  plaque  may  be  mounted  below  the  W1115  sign.  A  supplemental  plaque 
with  the  legend  AHEAD  or  XX  FEET  may  be  used  with  the  Bicycle  Warning  or  combined  Bicycle/Pedestrian  sign.  A 
fluorescent  yellowgreen  background  color  may  be  used  for  this  sign  or  plaque.  The  background  color  of  the  plaque 
should match the color of the warning sign that it supplements. In situations where there is a need to warn motorists to 
watch for bicyclists traveling along the highway, the SHARE THE ROAD (W161P) plaque may be used in conjunction with 
the W111 Sign."

North Cornwall Township may consider these signs, in addition to the bike lane sign and appropriate pavement markings 
to  increase  awareness  of  and  to  mark  the  location  of  a  nonmotorized  trail  connection  or  crossing.  During  the  design 
phase  for  specific  facilities,  North  Cornwall  Township  should  reference  both  MUTCD  and  AASHTO  guidelines  for 
recommended signs and onroad markings applicable to and most appropriate for each specific improvement.

This  section  sets  forth  a  phasing  plan  for  the  entire  trails  system.  For  each  trail  project,  the  table  lists  the  proposed  type  of  improvement,  the  ease  of 
implementation, the priority status, and the timeframe to implement. Each of these three  qualifiers is described in more detail below. Each "trail project" listed 
in  the  table  may  include  more  than  one  of  the  proposed  facilities  described  in  the  earlier  implementation  strategies  section,  and  represent  workable  projects 
that, when complete, will establish a key nonmotorized connection. This approach will assist the Township in creating usable connection facilities, rather than a 
segmented trail system. 

    ·    Ease  of  Implementation  ­  classified  as  easy,  moderate,  or  challenging,  this  field  rates  the  level  of  difficulty  of  the  proposed  project  and  lists  key  steps 
         that will be required to complete the project. 

    ·    Priority Status ­ classified as low, medium, or high, this field can also be thought of as the level of importance or criticality to the Township trails system. 
         Priority status does not necessarily correspond directly to the implementation timeframe, as there could be segments that are considered a low priority, 
         but  are  easy  to  implement,  and  are  therefore  projected  to  be  completed  in  a  short  or  medium  timeframe.  Conversely,  there  may  also  be  proposed 
         projects  that  are  of  a  medium  to  high  priority,  but  due  to  circumstances  surrounding  the  project,  e.g.  necessary  partners  or  other  trail  components  that 
         are not yet constructed, they may not be completed in the near term. 

    ·    Timeframe  to  Implement  ­  classified  as  short,  medium,  or  long,  this  field  identifies  when  the  project  will  be  implemented.  Although  the  Township  will 
         first focus on short term improvements, it should also consider components of medium to long term projects that may take multiple years to implement, 
         such as projects that involve a land acquisition or easement.

         Thursday, August 23, 2012          6 AM ­ 7 PM                   Partly Cloudy (30%)

  Counter: Tom VandenHeuvel
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: NCDOT Count Assignments 12-07119 thru 12-07121 were counted on the same day,
  with one counter assigned to each zone (aka count assignment) of the SR 1320 (Erwin Road) corridor. Counters
  used Jamar count boards to count pedestrians crossing north to south and south to north across Erwin Road
  within their zone. The pedestrians inside and outside the designated crosswalk were counted separately for
  Count Assignments 12-07119 & 12-07121. Each zone was marked in the field and divided by traffic cones. See
  the map attached on page 4 for the complete study area map of the 3 zones counted.

  NOTES
  1) Durham County Schools were not in session on that date of the count;
     nor was Duke University which is located in the immediate vicinity of
     the studied corridor.
  2) Five (5) disable peds were observed crossing Erwin Road within the
     crosswalk at Fulton Drive. At 8:15 AM a wheelchair bound ped
     crossed traveling SB; at 12:15 PM a crutch bearing ped crossed
     traveling SB; at 3:15 PM a motorized wheelchair bound ped crossed
     traveling NB; at 3:30 PM a crutch bearing ped crossed traveling NB;
     and at 3:45 PM a wheelchair bound ped crossed traveling NB.                                           VICINITY MAP
  3) The WB approach grade is -3% and EB is -2%.
  4) Area lighting was present at the
     count location.
  5) No highway construction was
     observed that impacted normal
     traffic or pedestrian patterns.
  6) Data collection equipment was
     operating correctly at time of
     count.
  7) Counter took breaks from 10:00 ­
     10:15 AM and from 2:00 ­ 2:30 PM.
     Data for these periods was
     interpolated.
  8) The counter did not have any
     additional notes.

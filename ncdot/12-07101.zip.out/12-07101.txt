  Counter: Tom VandenHeuvel
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: NCDOT Count Assignments 12-07101 thru 12-07107 were counted on the same day,
  with one counter assigned to each zone (aka count assignment) of the NC 210 (Murchison Road) corridor.
  Counters used Jamar count boards to count pedestrians crossing east to west and west to east across NC 210
  within their zone. Each zone was marked in the field with a traffic cone. See the map attached on page 3 for the
  complete study area map of the 7 zones counted.

  NOTES
  1) Fayetteville State University is located in the immediate vicinity
     of the studied corridor and was is session on the date of the
     count, as were all Cumberland County Schools.
  2) Of the pedestrians counted, one disabled was observed utilizing
     a motorized wheelchair which crossed from the eastern side of
     NC 210 (Murchinson Road) to the western side.
  3) All approach grades are 0%.
  4) Area lighting was present at the count location.
  5) No highway construction was observed that impacted normal
     traffic or pedestrian patterns.                                                                   VICINITY MAP
  6) Data collection equipment was
     operating correctly at time of
     count.
  7) Counter took breaks from 9:30
     ­ 9:45 AM and from 1:30 ­ 2:00
     PM. Data for these periods was
     interpolated.
  8) Counter Notes: Many
     pedestrians were observed
     crossing south of the W.T.
     Brown Drive / Coley Drive and
     NC 210 (Murchinson Road)
     intersection. Pedestrians were
     only counted within the
     requested count zone, which
     began approximately 50 feet
     south of the intersection.

  Counter: Jim Haggard
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: NCDOT Count Assignments 12-07125 thru 12-07138 were counted over a two day
  period, with one counter assigned to each zone (aka count assignment) of the SR 1340 (Prospect Road)/North
  Odum Street corridor. Counters used Jamar count boards to count pedestrians crossing east to west and west
  to east across Prospect Road/North Odum Street within their zone. Each zone was marked in the field with a
  traffic cone. See page 3 for a map of the complete study area & a summary of the 14 zones counted.

  NOTES
  1) UNC Pembroke is located in the immediate vicinity of the studied
     corridor and was is session on the date of the count, as were all
     Robeson County Schools.
  2) Of the pedestrians counted, none were disabled.
  3) All approach grades are 0%.
  4) Area lighting was present at the count location.
  5) No highway construction was observed that impacted normal
     traffic or pedestrian patterns.                                                                  VICINITY MAP
  6) Data collection equipment was operating correctly at time of
     count.
  7) Counter took breaks from 1:00
     ­ 1:30 PM and 4:30 ­ 4:45 PM.
     Data for these periods was
     interpolated.
  8) The counter did not have any
     additional notes.

            Count Day & Date               Count Time(s)       Weather Conditions (Chance of Precipitation)
         Thursday, August 23, 2012          6 AM ­ 7 PM                   Partly Cloudy (30%)

  Counter: Al Daniels
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: NCDOT Count Assignments 12-07119 thru 12-07121 were counted on the same day,
  with one counter assigned to each zone (aka count assignment) of the SR 1320 (Erwin Road) corridor. Counters
  used Jamar count boards to count pedestrians crossing north to south and south to north across Erwin Road
  within their zone. The pedestrians inside and outside the designated crosswalk were counted separately for
  Count Assignments 12-07119 & 12-07121. Each zone was marked in the field and divided by traffic cones. See
  the map attached on page 4 for the complete study area map of the 3 zones counted.

  NOTES
  1) Durham County Schools were not in session on that date of the
     count; nor was Duke University which is located in the immediate
     vicinity of the studied corridor.
  2) Of the pedestrians, none were disabled.
  3) All approach grades are 0%.
  4) Area lighting was present at the count location.
  5) No highway construction was observed that impacted normal traffic
     or pedestrian patterns. However, the counter did note that building
     construction work was taking place just north of his count zone. He
                                                                                                         VICINITY MAP
     estimated that 75% of the pedestrians crossing in either direction
     from 7:00 to 8:00 AM were
     construction workers coming to or
     from this site. They were only seen
     or counted crossing the road
     periodically during the remainder of
     the day.
  6) Data collection equipment was
     operating correctly at time of
     count.
  7) Counter took breaks from 10:00 ­
     10:15 AM and from 2:00 ­ 2:30 PM.
     Data for these periods was
     interpolated.
  8) Counter Notes: The majority of the
     pedestrians crossing Erwin Road in
     this zone crossed at the eastern end
     near Cone #3.

  Counter: Galo Biondi
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: NCDOT Count Assignments 12-07101 thru 12-07107 were counted on the same day,
  with one counter assigned to each zone (aka count assignment) of the NC 210 (Murchison Road) corridor.
  Counters used Jamar count boards to count pedestrians crossing east to west and west to east across NC 210
  within their zone. Each zone was marked in the field with traffic cones. See the map attached on page 3 for the
  complete study area map of the 7 zones counted.

  NOTES
  1) Fayetteville State University is located in the immediate vicinity
     of the studied corridor and was is session on the date of the
     count, as were all Cumberland County Schools.
  2) Of the pedestrians counted, none were disabled.
  3) All approach grades are 0%.
  4) Area lighting was present at the count location.
  5) No highway construction was observed that impacted normal
     traffic or pedestrian patterns.                                                                   VICINITY MAP
  6) Data collection equipment was operating correctly at time of
     count.
  7) Counter took breaks from 9:30 ­
     9:45 AM and from 1:30 ­ 2:00
     PM. Data for these periods was
     interpolated.
  8) The counter did not have any
     additional notes.

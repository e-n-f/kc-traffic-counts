            Count Day & Date              Count Time(s)        Weather Conditions (Chance of Precipitation)
       Thursday, September 19, 2013     6:00 AM ­ 7:00 PM                 Sunny & Clear (0%)

  Counter: Al Daniels
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: Jamar Count Board (Unit # D4-5826)

  NOTES
  1) Cape Fear Elementary & Middle Schools are located in the
     immediate vicinity of the studied intersection and were in
     session on the date of the count, as were all Pender County
     Schools.
  2) Pedestrians were observed and counted ­ none were disabled.
  3) All approach grades are 0%.
  4) Area lighting was not present at the count location.
  5) No highway construction was observed that impacted normal                                   VICINITY MAP
     traffic patterns.
  6) Data collection equipment was operating correctly at time of count.
  7) Counter took breaks from 9:15 ­ 9:30 AM and 1:30 ­ 2:00 PM. Data for these periods was interpolated.
  8) Counter Notes: From approximately
     7:15 ­ 7:45 AM, parents were dropping
     off their children at the Cape Fear
     Schools. On their way out, as they
     tried to exit from the Cape Fear School
     Driveway, most could not see the
     southbound thru traffic on NC 133
     because traffic in the southbound left
     turn lane, turning into the school,
     blocked their line of site. At any given
     time during this time frame there were
     25 to 40 vehicles queued on the
     school's driveway. Southbound left
     turns from NC 133 were often unable
     to turn into the school driveway until
     the westbound lefts out of the school
     cleared. The Pender County Schools
     Safety Director, Richard Dutka, came to
     the count location and discussed these
     issues with the counter during the
     turning movement count. He provided his contact information as follows, phone ­ (910) 259-0131, cell ­
     (910) 470-9986, fax ­ (910) 259-0132, & email ­ richard_dutka@pender.k12.nc.us.

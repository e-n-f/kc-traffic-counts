           Tuesday, April 23, 2012          6 AM ­ 7 PM                       Cloudy (20%)

  Counter: Maury Owens
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: NCDOT Count Assignments 13-07155 thru 13-07160 were counted over two days, with
  one counter assigned to each zone (aka count assignment) of the US 421 (East Cornelius Boulevard) corridor.
  Counters used Jamar count boards to count pedestrians crossing north to south and south to north US 421
  within their zone. Each zone was marked in the field with a traffic cone. See the map attached on page 3 for the
  complete study area map of the 6 zones counted.

  NOTES
  1) Campbell University is located in the immediate vicinity of the
     studied corridor and was is session on the date of the count, as
     were all Cumberland County Schools.
  2) Of the pedestrians counted, none were disabled.
  3) All approach grades are 0%.
  4) Area lighting was not present at the count location.
  5) No highway construction was observed that impacted normal
     traffic or pedestrian patterns.                                                                 VICINITY MAP
  6) Data collection equipment was operating correctly at time of
     count.
  7) Counter took breaks from
     10:30 ­ 10:45 AM and from
     2:30 ­ 2:45 PM. Data for
     these periods was
     interpolated.
  8) The counter did not have any
     additional notes.

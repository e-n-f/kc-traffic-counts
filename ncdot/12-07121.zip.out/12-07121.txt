                13 Hour Count Volume: 1,174 pedestrians (424 inside crosswalk & 750 outside crosswalk)

         Thursday, August 23, 2012          6 AM ­ 7 PM                   Partly Cloudy (30%)

  Counter: Blaine Rowland
  Data Processor: Shannon Grubbs, EI
  Data Collection Method: NCDOT Count Assignments 12-07119 thru 12-07121 were counted on the same day,
  with one counter assigned to each zone (aka count assignment) of the SR 1320 (Erwin Road) corridor. Counters
  used Jamar count boards to count pedestrians crossing north to south and south to north across Erwin Road
  within their zone. The pedestrians inside and outside the designated crosswalk were counted separately for
  Count Assignments 12-07119 & 12-07121. Each zone was marked in the field and divided by traffic cones. See
  the map attached on page 4 for the complete study area map of the 3 zones counted.

  NOTES
  1) Durham County Schools were not in session on that date of the
     count; nor was Duke University which is located in the immediate
     vicinity of the studied corridor.
  2) Of the pedestrians observed, none were disabled.
  3) The NB, WB, & EB approach grades are 0%, and SB is -1%.
  4) Area lighting was present at the count location.
  5) No highway construction was observed that impacted normal
     traffic or pedestrian patterns. However, the counter was in
     agreeance with the Count 12-07120 counter about the influx of                                    VICINITY MAP
     building construction workers crossing Erwin Road from 7:00 to
     8:00 AM at the western end of
     the zone, near Cone #3.
  6) Data collection equipment was
     operating correctly at time of
     count.
  7) Counter took breaks from 10:00
     ­ 10:15 AM and from 2:00 ­
     2:30 PM. Data for these periods
     was interpolated.
  8) Counter Notes: Almost all of
     the pedestrians counted outside
     the crosswalk within this zone,
     were within 10' of Cone #3 at
     the western end.

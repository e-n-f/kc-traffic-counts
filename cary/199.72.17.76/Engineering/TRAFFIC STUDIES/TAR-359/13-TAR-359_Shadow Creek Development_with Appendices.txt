EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location and Description
As a means of guiding future growth and development, the Town of Cary and Chatham County
have adopted a joint land use plan covering over 18,000 acres in eastern Chatham County. The
Shadow Creek Development is located within this area of joint land use and is proposed to be
developed on the south side of Lewter Shop Road in Chatham County, just west of the Wake
County line. This development is proposed to consist of 152 single family detached homes and
is located on Lewter Shop Road between NC 751 and Green Level Church Road. Trip
generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to determine the
amount of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is shown in Table 1.

A full movement access is proposed at the Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road
intersection. This intersection currently is a three-legged intersection and the proposed site
access will create a fourth leg to the south of Lewter Shop Road. This traffic study, 13-TAR-359,
analyzes the effects of the residential development on traffic operations in the study area.
Figure ES-1 shows the study area for 13-TAR-359 while Figure ES-2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
The number of trips generated by the proposed development will exceed the Town's 50 peak
hour trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4) and
therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Adequate Public Facilities
Ordinance (APFO). The projected build-out year for this development is 2015. This TAR
analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers
potential mitigation for those impacts.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections along with the proposed full
movement access on Lewter Shop Road (the Synchro intersection number is provided before the
intersection name):
   ·    9001 ­ NC 751 and Lewter Shop Road (unsignalized)
   ·    9002 ­ Lewter Shop Road and Green Level Road (unsignalized)
   ·    9003 ­ Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road (future proposed access) (unsignalized)

   ·   9005 ­ Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road (unsignalized)


Traffic analyses were performed for the proposed site entrance and the study area intersections
listed above for four scenarios, specifically:
   ·   Existing (2012) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts, aerial photography, and site visit).
   ·   Background (2015) ­ Estimates future (2015) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 3%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby developments that
       have not yet been constructed.
   ·   Combined (2015) ­ Adds the site generated traffic from the proposed single family
       homes to the Background (2015) volumes.
   ·   Combined and Improved (2015) ­ Analyzes potential mitigations to provide acceptable
       levels of service based on the Town's LDO.

Background (2015) Analysis
Future traffic estimates were made based on applying a 3% average annual growth rate (AAGR)
to the 2012 balanced counts. Also, traffic from the following approved developments was
considered and incorporated as appropriate:
          ·   12-TAR-337 ­ Weldon Ridge Development
          ·   12-TAR-352 ­ Holland Tract Development

APFO Required Mitigations
Two intersections fell below the APFO threshold with the additional site traffic. As such,
mitigation was recommended for these intersections. Additionally, since Lewter Shop Road is a
NCDOT facility, the site driveway was evaluated using NCDOT's nomograph as directed in
NCDOT's Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways. All proposed
mitigation is described below and shown in Figure ES-3.

   Intersection of Lewter Shop Road and NC 751
   This intersection has one movement, the shared left and right-turn, operating at LOS E in the
   PM peak period in the Combined (2015) conditions. This movement operates at LOS D in
   the PM peak period in the Background (2015) conditions. This intersection is located in
   Chatham County and is not within the Town of Cary's ETJ; however, to meet the APFO
   requirements, mitigation is proposed.

   The addition of a separate westbound left-turn lane was considered, which improved the level
   of service and delay for the right-turn movement, but the left-turning movement degraded to a
   LOS F. This result is consistent with information provided in Chapter 19 (Two-Way Stop-
   Controlled Intersections) of the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM) in its discussion of
   interpreting analysis results for unsignalized intersections. The Highway Capacity Manual
                                               ES-2
                                                                                     13-TAR-359
                                                                                          FINAL


2010 notes in Chapter 19 that "If left-turns are placed in a shared lane, the control delay for
vehicles in that lane may be less than the control delay for left-turns in a separate lane.
However, if delay for all vehicles on the approach or at the intersection is considered,
providing separate lanes will result in lower total delay." This indicates that analysis results of
the approach as a whole will experience lower delay with separate left and right-turn lanes,
even though the individual left-turn lane may have a poor or failing level of service. However,
this does not meet the APFO requirements that no movement operating at LOS D can
degrade to LOS E or worse. Therefore, additional geometric improvements were considered
in order to meet the LOS D requirements of the APFO. In order to meet the requirements of
the APFO, the following improvement is proposed:

   ·   Provide a northbound right turn lane with 50 feet of full storage and appropriate taper
       and deceleration distance. Since this movement is a free-flow movement, the
       proposed storage is based on NCDOT's nomograph criteria.

Intersection of Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road/Proposed Site Access
Even though all movements operate better than LOS D, because Lewter Shop Road is
maintained by NCDOT, warrants for left and right-turn lanes into the site were evaluated. The
following improvements are recommended based on NCDOT's nomograph criteria but not
part of the APFO requirements:

   ·   Provide an eastbound right-turn lane with 50 feet of storage and appropriate taper.
   ·   Provide a westbound left-turn lane with 50 feet of storage and appropriate taper.

Additionally, as shown in Figure ES-2, the site plan for the Shadow Creek Development
shows the proposed site access driveway offset from West Ferrell Road, rather than aligning
with it. The alignment as shown may result in poor operations for vehicles crossing Lewter
Shop Road, as well as potential driver confusion. Ideally, these drives should align with one
another. While the proposed access to the Shadow Creek Development is not a local road,
West Ferrell Road is, and Section 03000 (Streets) of the Town of Cary's Standard
Specifications states that "local streets shall not be offset less than 125' from their centerline".

While not a requirement of the APFO, NCDOT recommends in its Policy on Street and
Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways that "opposite side drives should be aligned
directly across from existing/proposed opposite side streets and driveways". Therefore it
should be noted that since this is a NCDOT facility, NCDOT may have a concern with the
offset driveway as well.

Intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road
This intersection has one movement, the eastbound left-turn, which experiences an increase
in delay and degradation of level of service from LOS D to LOS E in both the AM and PM
peak periods of the Combined (2015) conditions when compared to the Background (2015)
conditions.

                                             ES-3
                                                                                      13-TAR-359
                                                                                           FINAL


   In order to confirm the reliability of the Synchro results, a delay study (located in Appendix I)
   was performed for each peak period during times that corresponded with the peak periods
   identified in the traffic counts. The results of the delay studies were consistent with the
   Synchro results; therefore, possible improvements were investigated. Initially a peak hour
   signal warrant analysis was performed for both the AM and PM peak periods in the Combined
   (2015) conditions. Based on the Combined (2015) traffic volumes, a traffic signal is not
   warranted in either the AM or PM peak hour and therefore was not recommended.

   Next, additional turn lanes were investigated as potential mitigation. The addition of a
   southbound right-turn lane on Green Level Church Road will result in a decrease in delay for
   the movement in question, the eastbound left-turn, improving it to a LOS D, which will satisfy
   the requirements on the APFO. However, Green Level Church Road has a wide existing
   cross-section at this location which includes a landscaped median. The provision of a
   southbound right-turn will increase the width of the intersection. This mitigation would
   increase the distance the left-turns would have to traverse to perform their maneuver and
   may also increase the concerns regarding operations at this intersection, which is not
   reflected in the Synchro analysis.

   As previously mentioned, based on the Combined (2015) traffic volumes, a traffic signal is not
   warranted. However, based on discussions with Town of Cary staff, we recommend
   monitoring this intersection during development of Shadow Creek and performing a full signal
   warrant analysis upon build-out of the development. If a signal is warranted at that time, then
   the provision of a traffic signal is the proposed mitigation and will be the responsibility of the
   developer.

   Under signal control, the intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road is
   anticipated to operate within the Town's APFO criteria.

Table 2 provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersections in the 2015 Background, 2015
Combined, and 2015 Combined and Improved conditions. As indicated in Table 2, without
mitigation, the Lewter Shop Road and NC 751 intersection and the Morrisville Parkway and
Green Level Church Road intersection both do not meet the APFO requirements. With the
proposed mitigation all movements at the Lewter Shop Road and NC 751 intersection operate at
LOS D or better in the AM and PM peak periods. The results at the Morrisville Parkway and
Green Level Church Road intersection are identical in both the 2015 Combined and the 2015
Combined and Improved conditions. This is due to the fact that no geometric mitigation is
recommended at this time. It is our understanding that the Town of Cary has this intersection on
a watch list for potential signalization. Therefore, it is proposed that there be continued
monitoring of this intersection and full signal warrant analysis of the intersection performed by
build-out of the Shadow Creek Development. If a signal is warranted at that time, it would be the
responsibility of the developer. The intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church
Road is anticipated to operate within the APFO criteria under signal control. Table 2 also shows
that the proposed access driveway meets the APFO requirements in the 2015 Combined

1.       INTRODUCTION
As a means of guiding future growth and development, the Town of Cary and Chatham County
have adopted a joint land use plan covering over 18,000 acres in eastern Chatham County. The
Shadow Creek Development is located within this area of joint land use and is proposed to be
developed on the south side of Lewter Shop Road in Chatham County, just west of the Wake
County line. This development is proposed to consist of 152 single family detached homes and
is located on Lewter Shop Road between NC 751 and Green Level Church Road. The site plan
for this parcel proposes to provide one full movement access at the Lewter Shop Road and West
Ferrell Road intersection. Figure 1 provides the study area and site location. All figures are
located in Appendix A.

The number of trips generated by the proposed development will exceed the Town's 50 peak
hour trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.23.4) and
therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Adequate Public Facilities
Ordinance (APFO). The projected build-out year for this development is 2015. This TAR
analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers
potential mitigation for those impacts. The site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections along with the proposed full
movement access on Lewter Shop Road (the Synchro intersection number is provided before the
intersection name):
     ·   9001 ­ NC 751 and Lewter Shop Road (unsignalized)
     ·   9002 ­ Lewter Shop Road and Green Level Road (unsignalized)
     ·   9003 ­ Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road (future proposed Access)
         (unsignalized)
     ·   9004 ­ Morrisville Parkway and Weldon Ridge Boulevard (unsignalized)
     ·   9005 ­ Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road (unsignalized)


2.       EXISTING (2012) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.

         2.1.1. LEWTER SHOP ROAD (SR 1740)/MORRISVILLE PARKWAY (SR 1600)
         Lewter Shop Road is an east-west connector in Chatham County that has a posted speed
         limit of 45 mph from NC 751 to just west of Barbee Road and 55 mph west of Barbee
         Road to White Oak Church Road in Wake County where it changes names to Morrisville
         Parkway. The typical section of Lewter Shop Road in the study area is a rural, two-lane
                                                 1
                                                                            13-TAR-359
                                                                                 FINAL


undivided roadway and serves mostly residential homes. Lewter Shop Road had a 2011
AADT of 1,800 vehicles just east of NC 751 (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS
data).

Lewter Shop Road changes to Morrisville Parkway at the Wake County line. The
Morrisville Parkway section in Wake County is essentially the same type of facility as the
Lewter Shop Road section in Chatham County, but has a greater amount of residential
development to the east. Morrisville Parkway has a posted speed limit of 55 mph west of
White Oak Church Road and 45 mph east of White Oak Church Road. The typical
section of Morrisville Parkway in the study area is a two-lane undivided roadway west of
Weldon Ridge Boulevard, and widens to a four-lane median divided roadway east of
Weldon Ridge Boulevard. The Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP)
identifies the need to continue the four-lane divided cross-section west to just west of
Earnest Jones Road. The section of Morrisville Parkway in the study area currently ends
at Westfalen Drive. The CTP also identifies a proposed extension project that would
complete the connection of Morrisville Parkway between NC 55 and Green Level Church
Road with an interchange at NC 540.

2.1.2. NC 751
NC 751 is a major north-south collector road that runs from US 64 in eastern Chatham
County to US 70 in Durham. NC 751 does not have a speed limit posted in the vicinity of
the study area and therefore, was assumed to have a speed limit of 55 mph for analysis
purposes. The typical section of NC 751 in the study area is a two-lane undivided
roadway. NC 751 had a 2011 AADT of 7,800 vehicles just north of Lewter Shop Road
(based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

2.1.3. GREEN LEVEL ROAD (SR 1742)
Green Level Road is a generally east-west connector that runs from Lewter Shop Road in
Chatham County to NC 55 in Wake County where it becomes High House Road. The
typical section of Green Level Road is a two-lane undivided roadway in the study area.
Green Level Road has a posted speed limit of 45 mph in the study area and had a 2010
AADT of 1,200 vehicles just south of Lewter Shop Road (based on 2010 NCDOT traffic
volume GIS data).

2.1.4. WEST FERRELL ROAD (SR 1738)
West Ferrell Road is a north-south collector road in Chatham County that runs from
Lewter Shop Road to Mount Pisgah Church Road. West Ferrell Road does not have a
speed limit posted in the vicinity of the study area and therefore, was assumed to be 55
mph for analysis purposes. The typical section of West Ferrell Road in the study area is a
rural, two-lane undivided roadway.

   2.1.5. WELDON RIDGE BOULEVARD
   Weldon Ridge Boulevard is a north-south residential roadway that runs from Morrisville
   Parkway to Yates Store Road within the Weldon Ridge Development. Weldon Ridge
   Boulevard is posted at 45 mph and has a two-lane median divided typical section in the
   study area.

   2.1.6. GREEN LEVEL CHURCH ROAD (SR 1625)
   Green Level Church Road is a major north-south connector, is posted 45 mph in the
   study area, and runs from NC 55 north of the Wake/Durham County Line to US 64 in
   Apex. The typical section of Green Level Church Road within the study limits is a four-
   lane median-divided roadway. During a field investigation, it was noted that construction
   was recently completed to realign Green Level Church Road and extend the four-lane
   cross-section just south of Morrisville Parkway. Green Level Church Road had a 2011
   AADT of 7,900 vehicles per day just south of its intersection with Carpenter Fire Station
   Road, north of the study area (based on the 2011 NCDOT traffic volume map).

2.2.       Existing Intersections
All intersections within the study area that were analyzed are listed in Section 1 of this report.
The intersections of Lewter Shop Road and NC 751, Lewter Shop Road and Green Level
Road, and Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road/Proposed Site Access are all located in
Chatham County and are outside the Town of Cary's Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ). All
other intersections are within the Town Limits of Cary or within the Town of Cary's ETJ.
Intersection geometrics along with intersection operational controls are provided in Figure 3.
It should be noted that the westbound leg of the Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church
Road intersection is constructed with adequate pavement for an exclusive left-turn lane, a
through lane, and a shared right-turn and through lane; however, there are no pavement
markings. Based on pavement width and field observations, this leg was analyzed with an
exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through and right-turn lane. Vehicles were observed
moving left to take advantage of the constructed left-turn lane even though it is not currently
striped.

2.3.       Turning Movement Counts
Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
October and November 2012. All schools in the area were in session at the time of the
counts, and no counts were taken during the week of the Thanksgiving holiday. The count
data is located in Appendix B. These counts were taken to provide current volumes and
assist in determining the directional splits of existing traffic. The count volumes on Lewter
Shop Road were balanced between NC 751 and Green Level Road in the westbound
direction during the AM peak hour and in the eastbound direction during the PM peak hour.
All other imbalances were determined to be reasonable due to distances and the number of
driveways/intersecting roadways between intersections. The balanced volumes were then
grown three years at the determined growth rate (discussed in Section 3.1) to estimate 2015

2.4. Level of Service Criteria for Stop-controlled Intersections
Exhibit 19-1 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are provided in Table 2 below.


            Table 2: Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections
                    Level of Service Average Control Delay (s/veh)

                            A                        0-10

                            B                      >10-15

                            C                      >15-25
                            D                      >25-35

                            E                      >35-50

                            F                        >50


The proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone which is
described in Section 3.23.3 of the LDO. For areas located within the Base Benefit Zone, the
level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are based on achieving a
LOS D or better for all intersections located within the study area (measured by movement for
                                            4

                                                                                        FINAL


 unsignalized intersections) currently operating at LOS D or better or not increasing overall
 movement delay for those intersections (movements for unsignalized intersections) having a
 level of service worse than LOS D without the development in the build-out year (Background
 conditions).

 2.5.      Existing Level of Service Analysis
 The existing network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
 analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. The following Synchro coding
 assumptions were made for existing conditions and included in all future analyses unless
 otherwise noted:

    ·   A default value of four vehicles was input for movements where zero vehicles were
        counted based on NCDOT's Capacity Analysis Guidelines.
    ·   Traffic counts at the NC 751 and Lewter Shop Road and the Green Level Church
        Road and Morrisville Parkway intersections were provided by the Town of Cary in
        PDF format. Based on discussions with the counting company, trucks were not
        counted separately from regular vehicle traffic. Therefore, a default value of 2 percent
        trucks was used for all movements at these two intersections.
    ·   The westbound approach of the Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road
        intersection was found during a field investigation to be absent of pavement markings
        for laneage. However, as previously mentioned, based on field observations of
        existing operations, it appears that most drivers treat this intersection as having an
        exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through and right-turn lane. This laneage was
        coded into Synchro for all analysis scenarios.

 Levels of service and delay were reported for each yielding movement at the unsignalized
 intersections. The summary of the findings are located in Table 3 below.

     located in Appendix D.



3.      BACKGROUND (2015) CONDITIONS
     3.1.       Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information, land uses in the area, development trends, and
     information from adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth rate of 3% was
     chosen for the study area. This growth rate was applied to the existing 2012 volumes to
     determine the projected volumes for the Background (2015) analysis. There were also
     additional trips added to account for known approved developments that are not yet

constructed. These trips were based on other TARs provided by the Town of Cary. All
additional developments are described in the following sections. Previously analyzed
development trip generation information is located in Appendix E. The total approved
development site trips included in the 2015 analyses can be found on Figure 5. The total
2015 background traffic volumes, including the approved development trips are shown in
Figure 6. The following are the approved developments included in the background traffic for
this TAR:

       ·   12-TAR-337 ­ Weldon Ridge Development
       ·   12-TAR-352 ­ Holland Tract Development

   3.1.1. 12-TAR-337 ­ W ELDON RIDGE DEVELOPMENT
   This TAR was conducted for the parcel in the northwest quadrant of the Morrisville
   Parkway and Weldon Ridge Boulevard intersection. Development of this parcel is
   proposed to consist of 20 single-family homes as an addition to the existing development
   and is projected to be complete in 2014. Therefore, the proposed site trips from the
   Weldon Ridge Development will be added to the Morrisville Parkway and Weldon Ridge
   intersection as shown in 12-TAR-337 and distributed through the other study intersections
   as appropriate.

   3.1.2. 12-TAR-352 ­ HOLLAND TRACT DEVELOPMENT
   The Holland Tract Development TAR was conducted for a residential development
   located southwest of the Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road intersection.
   This development is proposed to consist of 102 single-family homes and is projected to
   be complete in 2015. Therefore, the proposed site trips from the Holland Tract
   Development will be added to the Morrisville Parkway and Weldon Ridge intersection and
   the Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road intersection as shown in 12-TAR-
   352. These site trips will be distributed through the other study intersections as
   appropriate.

3.2.       Level of Service Analysis
Level of service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2015) AM and PM peak periods which includes the approved development site
trips described in the above section along with the annual growth of existing traffic using the
3% annual growth rate. This analysis will be used as the base case to determine the traffic
operation impacts for the development of Shadow Creek.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2015) analysis are shown by Figure 6. The
summary of the level of service analysis for the Background (2015) conditions is reported in
Table 4.

4.      COMBINED (2015) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Zone and, therefore, recommendations will be based on a level of service standard of
"D". The Shadow Creek Development is proposed to consist of 152 single-family homes. A full
movement access is proposed at the Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road intersection.
This intersection currently is a three-legged intersection and the proposed site access will create
a fourth leg to the south of Lewter Shop Road.

All intersections except the Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road/Proposed Site Access
intersection are outside the one mile radius stated in the LDO for inclusion in the TAR and were
evaluated for the Town's 7% rule, meaning if the proposed site generated traffic is at least 7% of
any traffic movement approach volume, it must be included in the study area. Of those
intersections meeting the 7% rule, if the proposed site generated traffic exceeds 1% of the total
approach volume for any approach, then mitigation is required in accordance with the APFO.
Each intersection evaluated met the 7% rule and therefore was included in the traffic study. For
those intersections, each movement with site traffic met the 1% rule in either the AM or PM peak
period and therefore was considered for mitigation. These calculations are provided in
Appendix C.

     4.1.       Trip Generation
     Trip generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to
     determine the amount of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is shown
     in Table 5 below.

     4.2.       Trip Distribution
     Access to the development is proposed to be provided via a full movement driveway on
     Lewter Shop Road as described in section 4.1 above. Trip distribution was estimated based
     on count data from nearby intersections, and from knowledge of local trip attractions and
     destinations in the area. The site distribution percentages are shown on Figure 7 and the
     site trips are shown on Figure 8. The trip generation and distribution calculations are located
     in Appendix C.

  4.3.       Combined (2015) Level of Service Analysis
  The Combined (2015) scenario consists of the background with approved development traffic
  as discussed in Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed
  single-family homes in the Shadow Creek Development. The volumes that are used in the
  Combined (2015) analysis are shown in Figure 9. The laneage and traffic control used for
  the Combined (2015) scenario is based on the existing conditions provided by Figure 3 with
  the addition of driveways as shown on the site plan in Figure 2.

  Level of service analyses were performed for all existing intersections with the addition of the
  proposed Site Access as described in Section 4.1. A summary of the levels of service are
  found in Table 6 below.

   As shown in Table 6, most intersections experience little to no change between the
   Background (2015) and Combined (2015) scenarios.

   Based on the Combined (2015) analyses, two unsignalized intersections have movements
   that operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. The
   westbound shared left and right-turn at the Lewter Shop Road and NC 751 intersection
   operates at LOS E in the PM peak period and the eastbound left-turn at the Morrisville
   Parkway and Green Level Church Road intersection operates at LOS E in both the AM and
   PM peak periods. The results provided in Table 6 indicate that with the additional site traffic,
   these movements experience an increase in delay when compared to the background
   analyses, causing them to drop below LOS D. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, at
   unsignalized intersections, no movements are allowed to fall below the LOS D threshold or
   experience an increase in delay for movements that already operate below the LOS D
   threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, these intersections will
   require mitigation to meet the APFO. How each intersection relates to the APFO in the Build
   scenario is discussed below. The proposed mitigation is evaluated and described in Section
   4.4. The Combined (2015) analyses are located in Appendix G.

The following provides the results of the 2015 Combined analysis and how they relate to the
APFO requirements.

Intersection of NC 751 and Lewter Shop Road
This intersection has one movement operating at LOS D in the PM peak period of the
Background (2015) conditions that experiences an increase in delay and degradation of LOS
in the Combined (2015) conditions, operating at LOS E in the PM peak period. While this
intersection is located in Chatham County and is therefore not within the Town of Cary's ETJ,
mitigations to meet the APFO requirements will be evaluated and proposed.

Intersection of Lewter Shop Road and Green Level Road
Since all movements at this intersection operate at LOS B or better in both the AM and PM
peak periods, no mitigation is required.

Intersection of Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road/Proposed Site Access
Since all movements at this intersection operate at LOS B or better in both the AM and PM
peak periods, no mitigation is required. However; because Lewter Shop Road is maintained
by NCDOT, the NCDOT nomograph for turn lanes will be evaluated for the site driveway.

Intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Weldon Ridge Boulevard
Since all movements at this intersection operate at LOS B or better in both the AM and PM
peak periods, no mitigation is required.

Intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road
This intersection has one movement, the eastbound left-turn, operating at LOS D in both the
AM and PM peak periods of the Background (2015) conditions. The results provided in Table
7 show that this movement experiences an increase in delay and a degradation of LOS in
both the AM and PM peak periods of the Combined (2015) conditions, operating at LOS E.
Due to the degradation of this movement to LOS E, this intersection will require mitigation to
satisfy the requirements of the APFO.

4.4.       Combined (2015) Improved Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2015) Improved scenario consists of improvements identified as mitigations
that are proposed in order to meet the LOS D threshold or show no increase in overall
movement delay if any movement operates below LOS D in the background condition as
noted in Section 4.3. As noted in Section 4.3, two intersections meet these criteria in the
Combined (2015) conditions. The intersections requiring mitigation are listed below, along
with the proposed mitigation. Also as mentioned previously, since Lewter Shop Road is a
NCDOT facility, the site driveway will be evaluated using NCDOT's nomograph as directed in
NCDOT's Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways. The 2015
Combined with Improvements Synchro analyses are located in Appendix H.

                                                                                          FINAL


Intersection of Lewter Shop Road and NC 751
This intersection has one movement, the shared left and right-turn, operating at LOS E in the
PM peak period in the Combined (2015) conditions. This movement operates at LOS D in
the PM peak period in the Background (2015) conditions. As previously mentioned, this
intersection is located in Chatham County and is not within the Town of Cary's ETJ; however,
to meet the APFO requirements, mitigation is recommended.

The addition of a separate westbound left-turn lane was considered, which improved the level
of service and delay for the right-turn movement, but the left-turning movement degraded to a
LOS F. This result is consistent with information provided in Chapter 19 (Two-Way Stop-
Controlled Intersections) of the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM) in its discussion of
interpreting analysis results for unsignalized intersections. The Highway Capacity Manual
2010 notes in Chapter 19 that "If left-turns are placed in a shared lane, the control delay for
vehicles in that lane may be less than the control delay for left-turns in a separate lane.
However, if delay for all vehicles on the approach or at the intersection is considered,
providing separate lanes will result in lower total delay." This indicates that analysis results of
the approach as a whole will experience lower delay with separate left and right-turn lanes,
even though the individual left-turn lane may have a poor or failing level of service. However,
this does not meet the APFO requirements that no movement operating at LOS D can
degrade to LOS E. Therefore, additional geometric improvements were considered in order
to meet the LOS D requirements of the APFO. In order to meet the requirements of the
APFO, the following improvement is proposed:

   ·   Provide a northbound right turn lane with 50 feet of full storage and appropriate taper
       and deceleration distance. Since this movement is a free-flow movement, the
       proposed storage is based on NCDOT's nomograph criteria.

Intersection of Lewter Shop Road and West Ferrell Road/Proposed Site Access
Even though all movements operate better than LOS D, because Lewter Shop Road is
maintained by NCDOT, warrants for left and right-turn lanes into the site were evaluated. The
following improvements are recommended based on NCDOT's nomograph criteria but not the
APFO requirements:

   ·   Provide an eastbound right-turn lane with 50 feet of storage and appropriate taper.
   ·   Provide a westbound left-turn lane with 50 feet of storage and appropriate taper.

Additionally, as shown in Figure 2, the site plan for the Shadow Creek Development shows
the proposed site access driveway offset from West Ferrell Road, rather than aligning with it.
The alignment as shown may result in poor operations for vehicles crossing Lewter Shop
Road, as well as potential driver confusion. Ideally, these drives should align with one
another. While the proposed access to the Shadow Creek Development is not a local road,
West Ferrell Road is, and Section 03000 (Streets) of the Town of Cary's Standard
Specifications states that "local streets shall not be offset less than 125' from their centerline".

While not a requirement of the APFO, NCDOT recommends in its Policy on Street and
Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways that "opposite side drives should be aligned
directly across from existing/proposed opposite side streets and driveways". Therefore it
should be noted that since this is a NCDOT facility, NCDOT may have a concern with the
offset driveway as well.

Intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road
This intersection has one movement, the eastbound left-turn, which experiences an increase
in delay and degradation of level of service from LOS D to LOS E in both the AM and PM
peak periods of the Combined (2015) conditions when compared to the Background (2015)
conditions.

In order to confirm the reliability of the Synchro results, a delay study (located in Appendix I)
was performed for each peak period during times that corresponded with the peak periods
identified in the traffic counts. The results of the delay studies were consistent with the
Synchro results; therefore, possible improvements were investigated. Initially a peak hour
signal warrant analysis was performed for both the AM and PM peak periods in the Combined
(2015) conditions. Based on the Combined (2015) traffic volumes, a traffic signal is not
warranted in either the AM or PM peak hour and therefore was not recommended.

Next, additional turn lanes were investigated as potential mitigation. The addition of a
southbound right-turn lane on Green Level Church Road will result in a decrease in delay for
the movement question, the eastbound left-turn, improving it to a LOS D, which will satisfy the
requirements on the APFO. However, Green Level Church Road has a wide existing cross-
section at this location which includes a landscaped median. The provision of a southbound
right-turn will increase the width of the intersection. This mitigation would increase the
distance the left-turns would have to traverse to perform their maneuver and may also
increase the concerns regarding operations at this intersection, which is not reflected in the
Synchro analysis.

As previously mentioned, based on the Combined (2015) traffic volumes, a traffic signal is not
warranted. However, based on discussions with Town of Cary staff, we recommend
monitoring this intersection during development of Shadow Creek and performing a full signal
warrant analysis upon build-out of the development. If a signal is warranted at that time, then
the provision of a traffic signal is the proposed mitigation and will be the responsibility of the
developer.

Under signal control, the intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road is
anticipated to operate within the Town's APFO criteria.

A summary of the intersection levels of service with mitigation is found in Table 7.

  4.5.       Conclusions
  Table 8 provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersections in the 2015 Background,
  2015 Combined, and 2015 Combined and Improved conditions. As indicated in Table 8,
  without mitigation, the Lewter Shop Road and NC 751 intersection and the Morrisville
  Parkway and Green Level Church Road intersection both do not meet the APFO
  requirements.

  With the provision of a northbound right-turn lane on NC 751, all movements at the Lewter
  Shop Road and NC 751 intersection operate at LOS D or better in the AM and PM peak
  periods. This is an improvement compared to 2015 Background and 2015 Combined
  conditions and satisfies the requirements of the Town of Cary's APFO.

  The results at the Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road intersection are
  identical in both the 2015 Combined and the 2015 Combined and Improved conditions. This
  is due to the fact that no geometric mitigation is recommended at this time. It is our
  understanding that the Town of Cary has this intersection on a watch list for potential
  signalization. Therefore, it is proposed that there be continued monitoring of this intersection
  and full signal warrant analysis of the intersection performed by build-out of the Shadow
  Creek Development. If a signal is warranted at that time, it would be the responsibility of the
  developer. The intersection of Morrisville Parkway and Green Level Church Road is
  anticipated to operate within the APFO criteria under signal control. Table 8 also shows that
  the proposed access driveway meets the APFO requirements in the 2015 Combined

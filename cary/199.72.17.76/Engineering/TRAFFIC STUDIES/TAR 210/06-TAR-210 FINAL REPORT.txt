EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
Jerry Turner & Associates, Inc. is proposing to build Olde Maynard Subdivision, which
consists of 143 single family dwellings and 142 townhouses. The property is located
along Old Maynard Road in northern Cary (Figure 1). Since it is located within the Town
of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 01-012), a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) is required to be completed. The projected build-
out is to occur by 2010. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed
Olde Maynard Subdivision on the adjacent roadways.

Upon buildout, vehicular access to the Olde Maynard Subdivision is proposed via a
single full access driveway on Old Maynard Road (Figure 2); however a portion of the
planned McCrimmon Parkway extension will be constructed within its property limits.
This piece of the McCrimmon Parkway extension is planned to eventually connect to
McCrimmon Parkway at its current Koppers Road terminus, and ultimately extend west
to connect to NC 55. This study analyzes the single access option; however additional
access points will be created once this McCrimmon Parkway connection is made. The
following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and
were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:

Signalized
   · NC 55 at Carpenter Fire Station Road (SR 1624)
   · NC 55 at Indian Wells Road (SR 1623) / Morrisville-Carpenter Road (SR 3014)
   · Davis Drive (SR 1613) at McCrimmon Parkway (SR 1635)
   · Davis Drive (SR 1613) at Morrisville-Carpenter Road (SR 3014)

Unsignalized
   · Morrisville-Carpenter Road (SR 3014) at Koppers Road (SR 1635)
   · Old Maynard Road (SR 1632) at Future Site Driveway

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2006), Background (2010), Build
(2010), and Build With Improvements (2010). The Existing (2006) Scenario includes
A.M. and P.M. peak hour analyses based on turning movement count data collected in
January and February of 2006. The Background (2010) Scenario includes existing
traffic with multiple approved developments and projected background growth. The two
Build Scenarios include Background (2010) Scenario volumes with the addition of site
trips generated by the proposed development.

Existing (2006) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and
intersection turning movement counts. Note that the existing geometry and turning
movement counts were largely impacted by the ongoing construction projects along
Davis Drive and NC 55. As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on
page vi, multiple intersections included in the study area are currently operating at
unacceptable levels of service. Specifically, the NC 55 at Morrisville-Carpenter Road
intersection and Davis Drive at McCrimmon Parkway intersection are both operating at
LOS F during the A.M. peak and LOS D during the P.M. peak. The Davis Drive at
Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection is operating at LOS E during the P.M. peak hour.
Lastly, the stop-controlled southbound Koppers Road approach at Morrisville-Carpenter

                                            i
Road is operating at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour.

As indicated by the traffic operations analysis, the existing lane configurations and traffic
control are not sufficient to provide an acceptable level of service for existing traffic
volumes. However, note that the existing lane configurations are largely impacted by the
ongoing construction in the area, and an immediate improvement should be expected
once the construction is completed.

Background (2010) Conditions
The background volumes were determined by including the expected trips to be
generated by the multiple approved developments within the area and by applying a
background growth rate to some intersections. The specific approved developments
included are as follows:

Town of Cary
   · Old Maynard Property (05-TAR-178) ­ located along Old Maynard Road
   · Twin Lakes Property (03-TAR-145a) ­ located between McCrimmon Parkway
       and Morrisville-Carpenter Road east of Davis Drive.
   · Carpenter Village (North) PUD (03-TAR-147) ­ located on the north side of
       Morrisville-Carpenter Road opposite the existing Carpenter Village development
   · Carpenter Property (04-TAR-159) ­ located along Morrisville Parkway in the
       vicinity of Louis Stevens Drive and Carpenter Upchurch Road
   · Ferrel Hatcher Property ­ located along Louis Stevens Drive
Town of Morrisville
   · Morrisville Market ­ located at the southeast corner of the Davis Drive at
       Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection
   · Davis Commons ­ located at the northeast corner of the Davis Drive at
       Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection

The effect of including each of the above approved developments as individual, isolated
developments is a net increase in traffic growth equivalent to 10-20% growth per year
along Davis Drive and Morrisville-Carpenter Road.         As a result, no additional
background growth rates were applied to these intersections. A background growth rate
of 3% per year was applied uniformly to the two NC 55 intersections, however. As for
geometric changes, two Town of Cary widening projects and two North Carolina
Department of Transportation (NCDOT) widening projects are expected to be complete
by the 2010 buildout year. They are:

Town of Cary
   · Davis Drive Widening ­ Widening to a four-lane divided facility from just north of
       Morrisville-Carpenter Road to just south of Sherwood Forest Place
   · Louis Stevens Drive Extension ­ Extending Louis Stephens Drive north from
       Morrisville Parkway to Morrisville-Carpenter Road and signalize Morrisville-
       Carpenter Road at Louis Stephens Drive intersection




                                             ii
North Carolina Department of Transportation
   · Davis Drive Widening (TIP #U-4026) ­ Widening Davis Drive to four lanes with a
       median to the north of Morrisville-Carpenter Road
   · NC 55 Widening (TIP #R-2906) ­ Widening NC 55 to four lanes from US 64 to
       SR 1131 (Cornwallis Road) in Durham County

Despite the large increases in traffic volumes projected for this scenario, operations
improve at several intersections relative to the Existing (2006) scenario. The two NC 55
intersections studied are expected to improve to LOS C or better operations during both
peak periods. The Davis Drive at McCrimmon Parkway and Morrisville-Carpenter Road
at Koppers Road intersections are also expected to operate at acceptable levels. The
completion of the construction at these four intersections provides the necessary
capacity to meet traffic demand at these locations. The anticipated widening at the
Davis Drive at Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection, however is offset by the large
increase in traffic growth, and is projected to continue to operate at a LOS E during the
P.M. peak hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The Olde Maynard Subdivision includes 143 single family dwellings and 142
townhouses. Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip
Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the proposed development is projected to generate
2,310 daily site trips, 178 A.M. peak hour trips (39 inbound trips and 139 outbound trips),
and 228 P.M. peak hour site trips (147 inbound trips and 81 outbound trips).

The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns.
In all, roughly half of the site trips were distributed to the areas to the north and to the
west of the site, while the other half of traffic is projected to originate from and to the
areas to the south and to the east of the proposed site.

Build (2010) Conditions
The Build (2010) conditions account for both the background traffic and the site traffic
generated by the proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on page
vi, the addition of site trips will increase traffic delay slightly all study intersections, but
will not result in any significant traffic performance degradation (i.e., from acceptable
LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any existing intersections included in the study area.
Consequently, all the existing intersections included in the study area are projected to
remain operating at the same levels of service as the Background (2010) Scenario.

The newly added intersection, the stop-controlled Site Driveway at Old Maynard Road is
projected to operate at LOS A during both peak periods.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The traffic operations analyses show that the proposed Olde Maynard Subdivision has a
slight impact on multiple adjacent roadways, however most traffic congestion in the
study area will be remedied by the current roadway construction and other approved
geometric improvements planned to be completed by the project Build year (2010). In
summary, the following roadway improvements are recommended due to the proposed
development:


                                               iii
Old Maynard Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along the Old Maynard Road frontage, the Plan dictates an ultimate 78-foot four-lane
divided cross-section. The 78-foot cross-section includes an 18-foot median, 2 standard
12-foot lanes next to the median, 2 14-foot outside travel lanes next to the curb, and
sidewalks along both sides of the roadway.

In addition to paving/widening along its frontage, it is required that Old Maynard Road be
paved to the south a distance of approximately 400 feet, to connect to the future paved
section required in front of the 05-TAR-178 (Old Maynard Property) subdivision. The 05-
TAR-178 project (located south of the 06-TAR-210 site) is presently required to pave Old
Maynard Road from its property line south to McCrimmon Parkway. As a result, Old
Maynard Road would be fully paved from the study site south to McCrimmon Parkway.
Although not required, extending the Old Maynard Road paving north to Gray Marble
Road (~300 feet from property line) is recommended.

McCrimmon Parkway Extension (future Amberly Parkway)
The extension of McCrimmon Parkway west towards NC 55 and eventually as far west
as Green Level to Durham Road is included in the Cary Comprehensive Plan (Northwest
Area). The southern portion of this site's property is located within this planned corridor.
As a result, this roadway will become a frontage road and the development is required to
construct the half of the four-lane divided roadway that is contained within its property.
As is identified in the Plan, the full 78-foot cross-section includes an 18-foot median, 2
standard 12-foot lanes next to the median, 2 14-foot outside travel lanes next to the
curb, and sidewalks along both sides of the roadway. Once this roadway is connected
to existing McCrimmon Parkway, this roadway will provide the additional access points
that are typically required for residential developments of this magnitude. This roadway
is also identified as a future transit corridor requiring additional right-of-way to be
dedicated for future transit service. This development is responsible to provide this
necessary right-of-way and construct the portion of Amberly Parkway located within its
property.

NC 55 at Carpenter Fire Station Road Intersection (signalized)
With the improvements as part of the NC 55 widening project (TIP #R-2906), the
intersection is projected to operate at LOS B in the A.M. and LOS C in the P.M. peak
hours even after the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements are
recommended at this location.

NC 55 at Morrisville-Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road Intersection (signalized)
With the improvements as part of the NC 55 widening project (TIP #R-2906), the
intersection is projected to operate at LOS C during both peak hour periods even after
the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements are recommended
at this location.

Davis Drive at McCrimmon Parkway (signalized)
With the improvements as part of the Davis Drive widening project (TIP #U-4025), the
intersection is projected to operate at LOS D during both peak hour periods even after


                                             iv
the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements are recommended
at this location.

Davis Drive at Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
Although this intersection operates at congested LOS E levels during the P.M. peak
(LOS D in the A.M.), no improvements are required at this location since the intersection
is located with the Town of Morrisville and the site traffic creates relatively minor
increases in delay (less than 2 seconds/vehicle overall).

Morrisville-Carpenter Road at Koppers Road/Louis Stevens Drive extension
(future signalized)
With the new signal and geometric improvements as part of the Louis Stevens Drive
extension, the intersection is projected to operate at LOS C during both peak hour
periods even after the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements
are recommended at this location.

Old Maynard Road at Site Driveway (unsignalized)
As was mentioned previously, Old Maynard Road is required to be constructed to the full
four-lane median divided cross-section as detailed in the Cary Comprehensive Plan. In
addition, the following is required at the site driveway:
    · Construct a two-lane egress with a continuous right-turn lane and a left-turn lane
        with at least 150 feet of storage
    · Construct a westbound left-turn lane with at least 150 feet of full storage along
        Old Maynard Road

The level of service information for all of the studied intersections and scenarios is
included in a table on the following page.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Jerry Turner & Associates, Inc. is proposing to build Olde Maynard Subdivision, which
consists of 143 single family dwellings and 142 townhouses. The property is located
along Old Maynard Road in northern Cary (Figure 1). Since it is located within the Town
of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 01-012), a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) is required to be completed. The projected build-
out is to occur by 2010. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed
Olde Maynard Subdivision on the adjacent roadways.

Upon buildout, vehicular access to the Olde Maynard Subdivision is proposed via a
single full access driveway on Old Maynard Road (Figure 2); however a portion of the
planned McCrimmon Parkway extension will be constructed within its property limits.
This piece of the McCrimmon Parkway extension is planned to eventually connect to
McCrimmon Parkway at its current Koppers Road terminus, and ultimately extend west
to connect to NC 55. This study analyzes the single access option; however additional
access points will be created once this McCrimmon Parkway connection is made. The
following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and
were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:

Signalized
   · NC 55 at Carpenter Fire Station Road (SR 1624)
   · NC 55 at Indian Wells Road (SR 1623) / Morrisville-Carpenter Road (SR 3014)
   · Davis Drive (SR 1613) at McCrimmon Parkway (SR 1635)
   · Davis Drive (SR 1613) at Morrisville-Carpenter Road (SR 3014)

Unsignalized
   · Morrisville-Carpenter Road (SR 3014) at Koppers Road (SR 1635)
   · Old Maynard Road (SR 1632) at Future Site Driveway

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed Olde Maynard Subdivision and to identify any necessary
roadway improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation,
distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

2.2     EXISTING TURNING MOVEMENT DATA
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC, collected the A.M. and P.M. peak hour intersection turning
movement counts analyzed in this TAR. Table 1 summarizes the schedule used to
obtain the turning movement data. Note that these counts were very likely impacted by
the roadway construction taking place along Davis Drive and NC 55. A detailed
summary of traffic counts can be found in Appendix A.

The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

2.3     LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics
and traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay
experienced by vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control
delay represents the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g.,
signals or stop signs).

Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

          A               Little or no delay            <= 10 sec.         <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay           10-20 sec.          10-15 sec.
          C             Average traffic delay           20-35 sec.          15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay            35-55 sec.          25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay         55-80 sec.          35-50 sec.
          F              Unacceptable delay             > 80 sec.            > 50 sec.

The Olde Maynard Subdivision is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone".
Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak
hour (as defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, ITE) with LOS D
considered acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled
approaches. For signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a level
of service less than LOS D, then no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable
under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections, where the stop-controlled
approach is below a level of service LOS D under background conditions, then no drop
in level of service is acceptable.

2.4   LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and
P.M. peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity
Software (HCS 2000). A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis
can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, multiple intersections included in the study area are currently
operating at unacceptable levels of service. Specifically, the NC 55 at Morrisville-
Carpenter Road intersection and Davis Drive at McCrimmon Parkway intersection are
both operating at LOS F during the A.M. peak and LOS D during the P.M. peak. The
Davis Drive at Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection is operating at LOS E during the
P.M. peak hour. Lastly, the stop-controlled southbound Koppers Road approach at
Morrisville-Carpenter Road is operating at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour.

As indicated by the traffic operations analysis, the existing lane configurations and traffic
control are not sufficient to provide an acceptable level of service for existing traffic
volumes. However, note that the existing lane configurations are largely impacted by the
ongoing construction in the area, and an immediate improvement should be expected
once the construction is completed.

3.0 BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
3.1       BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Olde Maynard Subdivision is scheduled for completion in the year 2010. To
forecast 2010 volumes, both site trips from specific approved developments and a
general background growth rate were included.

Approved Developments
Multiple developments in the general area are expected to be completed prior to the
build-out of the Olde Maynard Subdivision. Traffic generated from these approved
projects was included in the future scenarios. These projects include:

Within Town of Cary Jurisdiction
Old Maynard Property (05-TAR-178) ­ This proposed development is located along Old
Maynard Road immediately to the south of the 06-TAR-210 project. This residential
development will consist of 106 single family units and 45 townhouses. A traffic analysis
report was prepared by HNTB and submitted to the Town of Cary in April 2005. The trip
generation indicated the proposed development will generate approximately 99 site trips
in the A.M. peak hour and 131 site trips in the P.M. peak hour. The build-out of the
entire planned unit development is scheduled for completion by 2006. These trips were
distributed to the Olde Maynard Subdivision study area intersections using the HNTB
study and an estimated distribution based on the existing turning movement counts. The
specific trips for this development are shown in Figure C-1 in Appendix C.

Twin Lakes Property (03-TAR-145a) ­ This proposed development is located between
McCrimmon Parkway and Morrisville-Carpenter Road east of Davis Drive. This multi-
phase project will consist of the following uses:

      ·   159 single family dwellings
      ·   662 townhomes
      ·   234 apartments
      ·   150 assisted living units
      ·   250,000 square feet of retail space
      ·   4 high turnover sit down restaurants
      ·   100,000 square feet of office space

A revised traffic analysis report was prepared by the Sear Brown Group and submitted to
the Town of Cary in February 2004. The trip generation indicated the proposed
development will generate approximately 1,176 site trips in the A.M. peak hour and
1,682 site trips in the P.M. peak hour. Construction has begun and build-out of the
entire planned development is scheduled for completion by 2011. For the purposes of
this study, it was assumed however that the project was fully built out by the 2010
analysis year. These trips were distributed to the Olde Maynard Subdivision study area
intersections using the Sear Brown study and an estimated distribution based on the
existing turning movement counts. The specific trips for this development are shown in
Figure C-2 in Appendix C.

Carpenter Village (North) PUD (03-TAR-147) ­ This proposed development is located on
the north side of Morrisville-Carpenter Road opposite the existing Carpenter Village
development. This residential development will consist of 79 single family units and 117
townhouses. A traffic analysis report was prepared by PBS&J and submitted to the
Town of Cary in December 2002. The trip generation indicated the proposed
development will generate approximately 117 site trips in the A.M. peak hour and 149
site trips in the P.M. peak hour. This development is partially built out. Based on a
conversation with the real estate office staff, 70 single family units and 8 townhomes are
presently occupied, which accounts for roughly half of the site generated traffic. Since
the trips for these units were presumably accounted for in the traffic counts, only 50% of
the total trips were counted as part of the approved development traffic. These trips
were distributed to the Olde Maynard Subdivision study area intersections using the
PBS&J study and an estimated distribution based on the existing turning movement
counts. The specific trips for this development are shown in Figure C-3 in Appendix C.

Carpenter Property (04-TAR-159) ­ This proposed development is located along
Morrisville Parkway in the vicinity of Louis Stevens Drive and Carpenter Upchurch Road.
This multi-phase project will consist of the following uses:

   ·   98 townhomes
   ·   33,000 square feet of office space
   ·   38,000 square feet of commercial space (drug store)
   ·   123,000 square feet of commercial space (grocery store, two restaurants)
   ·   16 single family dwellings

A traffic analysis report was prepared by HNTB and submitted to the Town of Cary in
May 2004. The trip generation indicated the proposed development will generate
approximately 534 site trips in the A.M. peak hour and 1,215 site trips in the P.M. peak
hour. The build-out of the entire planned unit development is scheduled for completion
by 2009. These trips were distributed to the Olde Maynard Subdivision study area
intersections based on the HNTB study and an estimated distribution based on the
existing turning movement counts. The specific trips for this development are shown in
Figure C-4 in Appendix C.

Ferrel Hatcher Property ­ This proposed development is located along Louis Stevens
Drive. This residential development will consist of 58 single family units. A traffic
analysis report was not required of the project. A field visit to the site revealed that the
development was under construction with multiple units fully constructed, however not
yet occupied. It was assumed that the development will be completely built out by 2010.
The trip generation indicated the proposed development will generate approximately 50
site trips in the A.M. peak hour and 64 site trips in the P.M. peak hour. These trips were
distributed to the Olde Maynard Subdivision study area intersections using the
assumption that the Louis Stevens Drive extension was in place. The specific trips for
this development are shown in Figure C-5 in Appendix C.

Within Town of Morrisville Jurisdiction
Morrisville Market ­ This proposed development is located at the southeast corner of the
Davis Drive and Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection. This multi-phase project will
consist of the following uses:

   ·   81,703 square feet of commercial space
   ·   A 8,000 square foot high turnover sit-down restaurant
   ·   Two 5,000 square foot fast food restaurants
   ·   A 4,000 square foot bank

A traffic analysis report was prepared by Ramey-Kemp and Associates and submitted to
the Town of Morrisville in September 2003. The trip generation indicated the proposed
development will generate approximately 1,191 site trips in the P.M. peak hour. No A.M.
peak hour trip generation or traffic analysis was conducted as part of this study.
Although several of the buildings on site are constructed, none are occupied and build-
out of the development is scheduled for completion by 2006. The P.M trips were
distributed to the Olde Maynard Subdivision study area intersections based on the
Ramey-Kemp study and an estimated distribution based on the existing turning
movement counts. The A.M peak hour trips were developed using the ITE trip
generation manual and assigned to the network based on the development P.M.
distribution and using existing turning volumes. The specific trips for this development
are shown in Figure C-6 in Appendix C.

Davis Commons ­ This proposed development is located at the northeast corner of the
Davis Drive and Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection. This multi-phase project will
consist of the following uses:

   ·   130,184 square feet of home improvement superstore
   ·   65,000 square feet of commercial space
   ·   Gasoline service station with 20 fueling positions
   ·   4,000 square feet of fast food restaurants
   ·   A drive in bank with 3 windows
   ·   A 7,200 square foot high turnover sit-down restaurant
   ·   30,000 square feet of general office
   ·   A quick lube vehicle stop with 3 bays
A traffic analysis report was prepared by Kimley-Horn and Associates and submitted to
the Town of Morrisville in November 2002. The TIA was not available from the Town;
however the uses and trip generation were determined from the Morrisville Market TIA.
The trip generation indicated the proposed development will generate approximately
1,458 site trips in the P.M. peak hour. No A.M. peak hour trip generation or traffic
analysis was conducted as part of this study. Although several of the buildings on site
are constructed, none appeared fully occupied and build-out of the development is
expected to be completed by 2006. The P.M trips were distributed to the Olde Maynard
Subdivision study area intersections based on the Kimley-Horn study and an estimated
distribution based on the existing turning movement counts. The A.M peak hour trips
were developed using the ITE trip generation manual and assigned to the network based
on the development P.M. distribution and using existing turning volumes. The specific
trips for this development are shown in Figure C-7 in Appendix C.

A total of all approved development traffic is included as Figure 5.

The sum of the seven approved developments as individual, isolated developments (no
development to development trip reductions assumed) represent an increase of greater
than 1,000 vph on Davis Drive and 700 vph on Morrisville-Carpenter Road in the vicinity
of their intersection. Over the four-year period from the existing counts to the 2010
future study year, this represents a greater than 50% total increase and 10-20%
annualized growth. As a result, no additional background growth rates were applied to
these intersections. A background growth rate of 3% per year was applied uniformly to
the two NC 55 intersections, however.

The Background (2010) Scenario volumes are a summation of the approved site trips
(Figure 5). No additional diversion of traffic onto the Louis Stephens Drive extension
and away from other intersections or special shifts in traffic as a result of construction
was assumed as part of this analysis. The turning movement volumes used in the
Background (2010) capacity analysis are shown in Figure 6.

3.2   FUTURE STUDY AREA IMPROVEMENTS
The Town of Cary and NCDOT are presently widening roadways within the study area of
this project. These projects are discussed below:

Davis Drive Widening ­ The Town of Cary is widening 3.5 miles of Davis Drive to four
lanes with a median from just south of Sherwood Forest Place to just north of Morrisville-
Carpenter Road. The widening of Morrisville-Carpenter Road and final connections to
Davis Drive are the responsibility of the Morrisville developments in the northeast and
southeast quadrants of that intersection. The construction is expected to be completed
in 2006.

Davis Drive Widening (TIP #U-4026) ­ NCDOT is widening Davis Drive to four lanes
with a median from just north of Morrisville-Carpenter Road north to NC 54. The Town
of Cary has an agreement with the state to provide right-of-way and easements, and to
pay for construction of the portion between Morrisville-Carpenter Road and McCrimmon
Parkway. This NCDOT project is scheduled to begin construction in July of 2006 and be
complete by the fall of 2008.

Louis Stevens Drive Extension ­ The Town of Cary is extending Louis Stephens Drive
north from Morrisville Parkway to Morrisville-Carpenter Road. As illustrated in Figure 7,
Louis Stephens Drive will eventually form the fourth leg opposite Koppers Road. This
intersection will be signalized as part of this project as well. The planned completion
date of this project is summer of 2006.




                    Figure 7       Louis Stevens Drive Extension

                                           19
NC 55 Widening (TIP #R-2906) ­ NCDOT is currently widening NC 55 to four lanes from
US 64 to SR 1131 (Cornwallis Road) in Durham County. The construction began in
2003 and is expected to be complete in 2006.

Each of the above mentioned projects are scheduled to be completed by 2010, and
therefore were included in the Background (2010) analysis. In addition to the basic
widening, signal timing adjustments are also planned. Future timing details as well as
lane configurations were obtained from NCDOT and/or Town of Cary signal plans.
Copies of these signal plans for the study intersections and relevant roadway
improvement plans for the above projects are included in Appendix D.

The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The site's access and frontage is along Old Maynard Road, which is eventually planned
to become part of a Louis Stevens Drive corridor that extends from the Research
Triangle Park south to Morrisville Parkway (Area Plan map shown in Figure 8).




                    Figure 8       Northwest Cary Area Plan Map

This would provide a major north-south route between NC 55 and Davis Drive. Although


                                          20
presently unpaved, this route is ultimately planned to become four-lane divided. The
cross-section detailed for Louis Stevens Drive from South Alston Avenue to Koppers
Road (incorporating Old Maynard Road) in the Cary Comprehensive Plan is illustrated in
Figure 9.

Another long-term project included in the Cary Comprehensive Plan is the extension of
McCrimmon Parkway west to Green Level Road. The completion of this connection
(listed as Amberly Parkway and formally "Panther Creek Parkway") would provide a
major east-west connector route north of Morrisville-Carpenter Road. This has also
been identified as a future transit corridor with a large right-of-way to support long-term
fixed-guideway, median-separated transit facilities, or on-road transit services. The
right-of-way specified in the Northwest Cary Area Plan was 124 to 150 feet for a 4-lane
landscaped road with reservation for dedicated transit lanes. This corridor is planned to
extend through the southern edge of the 06-TAR-210 property, and as a result, the
developer would also be required to construct a portion of this facility within its property.

area.

3.3   LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection level of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and
P.M. peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity
Software (HCS 2000). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as
part of the future year analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2010)
scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 5 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be
found in Appendix B.

Despite the large increases in traffic volumes projected for this scenario, operations
improve at several intersections relative to the Existing (2006) scenario. The two NC 55
intersections studied are expected to improve to LOS C or better operations during both
peak periods. The Davis Drive at McCrimmon Parkway and Morrisville-Carpenter Road
at Koppers Road intersections are also expected to operate at acceptable levels. The
completion of the construction at these four intersections provides the necessary
capacity to meet traffic demand at these locations. The anticipated widening at the
Davis Drive at Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection, however is offset by the large
increase in traffic growth, and is projected to continue to operate at a LOS E during the
P.M. peak hour.

4.0 BUILD ANALYSIS
Jerry Turner & Associates, Inc. is proposing to build Olde Maynard Subdivision, which
consists of 143 single family dwellings and 142 townhouses. The property is located
along Old Maynard Road in northern Cary (Figure 1), requiring a Transportation Analysis
Report (TAR) to be completed. The projected build-out is to occur by 2010. This section
details the trip generation and traffic impacts associated with this development.

4.1       TRIP GENERATION
The trip generation rates and equations utilized in this study were those published in the
ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, based on the proposed dwelling units. ITE
codes 210 and 230 are used for the corresponding land uses of the proposed Olde
Maynard Subdivision. Table 6 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the Olde
Maynard Subdivision for typical weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

4.2       TRIP DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
The site trips for the proposed Olde Maynard Subdivision were distributed as follows
based upon the existing traffic patterns:

      ·    15% from NC 55 to the north
      ·    10% from NC 55 to the south
      ·     5% from Carpenter Fire Station Road to the west
      ·    30% from Davis Drive to the north
      ·    10% from Davis Drive to the south
      ·    13% from Morrisville-Carpenter to the east
      ·    15% from McCrimmon Parkway to the east
      ·     2% from Louis Stevens Drive to the south

It is assumed that a paved connection will exist between the property and the
Breckenridge subdivision. Since traveling through this subdivision will provide the
shortest route to Davis Drive, it is assumed that some vehicles will use this connection to
access destinations north and south of the site. The site trip distribution percentages are
shown in more detail in Figure 10 and resulting site trips are shown in Figure 11.

4.3   LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2010) analysis scenario includes the background traffic as described in
Section 3.0 of this report as well as site generated trips from the proposed development
as described previously. Figure 12 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the
Build (2010) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M.
peak hour using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity
Software (HCS 2000). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as
part of the future year analysis. Table 7 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis
and Appendix B contains the full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in the table, the addition of site trips will increase traffic delay slightly all study
intersections, but will not result in any significant traffic performance degradation (i.e.,
from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any existing intersections included in the
study area. Consequently, all the existing intersections included in the study area are
projected to remain operating at the same levels of service as the Background (2010)
Scenario.

5.0     FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

5.1   ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The traffic operations analyses show that the proposed Olde Maynard Subdivision has a
slight impact on multiple adjacent roadways, however most traffic congestion in the
study area will be remedied by the current roadway construction and other approved
geometric improvements planned to be completed by the project Build year (2010). In
summary, the following roadway improvements are recommended due to the proposed
development:

Old Maynard Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along the Old Maynard Road frontage, the Plan dictates an ultimate 78-foot four-lane
divided cross-section. The 78-foot cross-section includes an 18-foot median, 2 standard
12-foot lanes next to the median, 2 14-foot outside travel lanes next to the curb, and
sidewalks along both sides of the roadway.

In addition to paving/widening along its frontage, it is required that Old Maynard Road be
paved to the south a distance of approximately 400 feet, to connect to the future paved
section required in front of the 05-TAR-178 (Old Maynard Property) subdivision. The 05-
TAR-178 project (located south of the 06-TAR-210 site) is presently required to pave Old
Maynard Road from its property line south to McCrimmon Parkway. As a result, Old
Maynard Road would be fully paved from the study site south to McCrimmon Parkway.
Although not required, extending the Old Maynard Road paving north to Gray Marble
Road (~300 feet from property line) is recommended.

McCrimmon Parkway Extension (future Amberly Parkway)
The extension of McCrimmon Parkway west towards NC 55 and eventually as far west
as Green Level to Durham Road is included in the Cary Comprehensive Plan (Northwest
Area). The southern portion of this site's property is located within this planned corridor.
As a result, this roadway will become a frontage road and the development is required to
construct the half of the four-lane divided roadway that is contained within its property.
As is identified in the Plan, the full 78-foot cross-section includes an 18-foot median, 2
standard 12-foot lanes next to the median, 2 14-foot outside travel lanes next to the
curb, and sidewalks along both sides of the roadway. Once this roadway is connected
to existing McCrimmon Parkway, this roadway will provide the additional access points
that are typically required for residential developments of this magnitude. This roadway
is also identified as a future transit corridor requiring additional right-of-way to be
dedicated for future transit service. This development is responsible to provide this
necessary right-of-way and construct the portion of Amberly Parkway located within its
property.

NC 55 at Carpenter Fire Station Road Intersection (signalized)
With the improvements as part of the NC 55 widening project (TIP #R-2906), the
intersection is projected to operate at LOS B in the A.M. and LOS C in the P.M. peak
hours even after the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements are


                                            29
recommended at this location.

NC 55 at Morrisville-Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road Intersection (signalized)
With the improvements as part of the NC 55 widening project (TIP #R-2906), the
intersection is projected to operate at LOS C during both peak hour periods even after
the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements are recommended
at this location.

Davis Drive at McCrimmon Parkway (signalized)
With the improvements as part of the Davis Drive widening project (TIP #U-4025), the
intersection is projected to operate at LOS D during both peak hour periods even after
the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements are recommended
at this location.

Davis Drive at Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
Although this intersection operates at congested LOS E levels during the P.M. peak
(LOS D in the A.M.), no improvements are required at this location since the intersection
is located with the Town of Morrisville and the site traffic creates relatively minor
increases in delay (less than 2 seconds/vehicle overall).

Morrisville-Carpenter Road at Koppers Road/Louis Stevens Drive extension
(future signalized)
With the new signal and geometric improvements as part of the Louis Stevens Drive
extension, the intersection is projected to operate at LOS C during both peak hour
periods even after the addition of site traffic. Thus, no further geometric improvements
are recommended at this location.

Old Maynard Road at Site Driveway (unsignalized)
As was mentioned previously, Old Maynard Road is required to be constructed to the full
four-lane median divided cross-section as detailed in the Cary Comprehensive Plan. In
addition, the following is required at the site driveway:
    · Construct a two-lane egress with a continuous right-turn lane and a left-turn lane
        with at least 150 feet of storage
    · Construct a westbound left-turn lane with at least 150 feet of full storage along
        Old Maynard Road

illustrates the future roadway configuration at the study intersections.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) proposes to expand the existing campus of
Green Hope High School located on Carpenter Upchurch Road to accommodate an
additional 480 students (Figure 1). The expansion is expected to be completed by 2013.

The proposed school expansion is to occur within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation
Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23,
requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the
potential traffic impact of the proposed school expansion on the adjacent roadways.

As shown on the Site Plan (Figure 2), access to the development will be provided via a total
of three existing access points along Carpenter Upchurch Road:
       Access #1: full access, approximately 750 feet south of Heritage Pines Drive
       Access #2: full access, approximately 450 feet south of Access #1
       Access #3: full access, approximately 600 feet south of Access #2

The Town of Cary requires inclusion of intersections within one (1) mile of the proposed
school expansion. In total, the following intersections meet the Town's requirements for
inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where
applicable:
       NC 55 and Indian Wells Road/Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
       NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
       NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
       Louis Stephens Drive and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
       Louis Stephens Drive and Heritage Pines Drive (unsignalized)
       Louis Stephens Drive and Upchurch Meadows Road (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Morrisville Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Morrisville Parkway (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Heritage Pines Drive (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #1 (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #2 (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #3 (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Louis Stephens Drive (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and High House Road (signalized)

Turning movement counts were also collected at the NC 55 and High House Road
intersection. Since site trips due to the proposed school expansion are projected not to
exceed seven percent (7%) of traffic volumes on any approach, traffic operational analysis is
not required at this intersection based on the Town of Cary LDO.

Traffic operations and capacity analysis were conducted for weekday AM peak period (7:00 ­
9:00 AM), school peak period (2:00 ­ 4:00 PM), and weekday PM peak period (4:00 ­ 6:00


                                              i
PM). In total, traffic analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2012),
Background (2013), Build (2013), and Build (2013) with Improvements. The Existing (2012)
scenario includes peak hour analysis based on turning movement counts collected in
November 2012. The Background (2013) scenario includes existing traffic with projected
annual growth and site traffic from four proposed developments in the vicinity. The Build
(2013) scenario includes Background (2013) volumes with the addition of net new site trips
generated by the proposed school expansion, based on existing school loading operations
and driveway geometrics. Revised school loading operations with traffic mitigations in place
were included in the Build (2013) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. For the signalized intersections, traffic signal plans and timings
were obtained from the Town of Cary and used for the Existing (2012) analysis.

As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vi, all the signalized
intersections and stop-controlled approaches included in the study area are currently
operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM, school PM, and PM peak hours with
two exceptions. Specifically, the two school driveways of Access #2 and Access #3 are
operating at LOS F in the AM peak hour.

Background (2013) Conditions
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) indicates steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. An annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2012) and the build year (2013). In addition, site traffic from four proposed/approved
developments in the vicinity of study area was aggregated and included in the analysis.
Traffic diversion due to the expected completion of NC 540 between US 64 in Apex and
NC 55 in Holly Springs was projected and also included in the Background (2013)
conditions.

Based on the Background (2013) analysis, the two failing school driveway approaches are
projected to continue to operate at failing levels of service in the AM peak hour. The
remaining signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to continue
operating at acceptable levels of service despite delay increases.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed Green Hope High School Expansion is to consist of the following land uses:
       480 students

Trip generation was performed using the NCDOT Municipal and School Transportation
Assistance (MSTA) School Calculator (the most recent version as 4/28/2008) based on the
existing and projected future student enrollment. Since the MSTA School Calculator does
not include weekday PM peak hour rates, the results were compared to traffic survey
conducted at the existing school driveways, and the combined results were used in this study.
In total, the proposed school expansion is projected to generate 362 additional AM peak

                                              ii
hour trips (247 entering, 115 exiting), 187 school PM peak hour trips (21 entering, 166
exiting), and 75 PM peak hour trips (33 entering, 42 exiting). The generated trips were
distributed to the study area intersections based on the existing traffic patterns and the most
recent student assignment plans developed by WCPSS.

Build (2013) Conditions
The Build (2013) conditions account for Background (2013) traffic and site traffic generated
by the proposed school expansion. Existing school loading patterns and geometrics were
used to evaluate site impact on the same basis between Background (2013) and Build (2013)
conditions.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page vi, the addition of site trips will incur delay
increases at signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches across the study area,
causing two additional unsignalized approaches to fail in the AM peak hour. Specifically,
westbound Heritage Pines Drive at Carpenter Upchurch Road is projected to operate at
LOS F, and Access #1 is projected to operate at LOS F in the AM peak hour. The already-
failing Accesses #2 and #3 are projected to worsen and operate at failing levels of service
during both the AM and school PM peak hours. The remaining signalized intersections and
unsignalized approaches are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during all the
AM, school PM, and PM peak hours.

Build Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed school expansion is projected to
have impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections within the
study area. In addition, the Town of Cary requires new developments widen the roads along
the frontage of their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). The following roadway improvements are recommended based
on the Town of Cary's CTP, Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO), and NCDOT
engineering guidance requirements:

Frontage Widening along Carpenter Upchurch Road
For the section of Carpenter Upchurch Road in front of Green Hope High School, the CTP
dictates a two-lane collector avenue cross-section with two travel lanes, with or without a
landscaped median, and bike lanes and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 70 or 58
feet of right-of-way. The existing roadway width and lane configurations are considered
equivalent to the ultimate cross-section requirements of alternative design. However, extra
widening will likely be needed to meet the CTP bike lane requirements.

Overall School Loading Operations
Traffic analyses indicate that the current school loading operations will result in failing
operations at two out of three driveways. Field observations indicate that the AM queuing
along Carpenter Upchurch Road currently exceeds 2,500 feet, essentially blocking both
directions of Carpenter Upchurch Road. Traffic operations will worsen with the proposed
school expansion if no improvements are made to the current school loading operations.

The Site Plan proposes new school loading operations by modifying driveway functions and

                                              iii
internal operating procedures. Under the new pattern, Access #3 will become the primary
driveway servicing student carpool traffic during the AM and school PM operations. This
change will increase stacking distance at the carpool lane to up to 3,100 feet, exceeding the
MSTA minimum stacking distance requirement of 1,500 feet and the field observed queue
length of 2,500 feet. Access #2 will become the primary driveway servicing student drivers
and staff traffic. Bus traffic will be assigned to Access #1.

Overall, the new layout will provide a longer stacking distance within the school site to better
alleviate traffic congestion and spillback onto Carpenter Upchurch Road during school
loading operations. In addition to the proposed changes by the Site Plan, it is also
recommended that the school develop a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) and
include car-pool procedures in the student handbook.

Access #1 and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this driveway will operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour with
the proposed traffic circulation plan. However, the congestion only occurs during a short
time period, and the projected left-turn traffic from this driveway is light and primarily
consists of buses. In addition, vehicular traffic will often yield to buses when there is a mass
exit of buses at the same time. Therefore, no additional improvements are recommended at
this driveway.

Access #2 and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this driveway will operate at LOS F in the school PM peak hour
with the proposed traffic circulation plan, and traffic queuing is projected to remain at this
intersection during both the AM and school PM peak hours. Peak hour traffic at this
intersection meets warrants for an exclusive right-turn lane along Carpenter Upchurch Road
at this intersection. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town APFO requirements:
        Widen the northbound Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to provide an exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 150 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Restripe the southbound left-turn lane on Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to
        provide at least 250 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Prohibit left-turn movement from Access #2 during the school AM loading time.

Access #3 and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that without traffic control assistance, this driveway will still operate
at a failing level of service in the AM peak hour even for right-turn only exiting movements.
Therefore, the following roadway improvements are recommended at this intersection to
meet the Town APFO requirements:
        Widen the northbound Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to provide an exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 250 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Restripe the southbound left-turn lane on Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to
        provide at least 350 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Widen Access #3 between Carpenter Upchurch Road and current bus parking lot to
        provide two inbound lanes.
        During the AM loading operations, place temporary traffic control devices (such as

                                                iv
       traffic cones) to allow for free-flow right-turn movement from Carpenter Upchurch
       Road onto Access #3.
       Implement a traffic control officer during the AM loading time to help direct traffic
       at this driveway.

Note that in the school PM peak hour when full movement is allowed at this intersection,
Site Access #3 is projected to operate at LOS F. Therefore, the existing practice of closing
student parking lot during school loading operations should remain at this driveway.

Heritage Pines Drive and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that under the exiting school plan, this driveway will worsen to
operate at LOS F in the AM peak hour after the proposed school expansion. Field
observations indicate that some school traffic is making u-turns at this intersection to travel
south on Carpenter Upchurch Road. This is attributed to the current restrictions of left-turn
movements from two out of three school driveways in the AM peak hour. With the
recommended traffic control officer enabling full movement at Access #3, this intersection
is expected to experience improved traffic operations with reduction in u-turn traffic.
Therefore, no additional improvements are recommended at this intersection.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2013) and Build (2013) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) proposes to expand the existing campus of
Green Hope High School located on Carpenter Upchurch Road to accommodate an
additional 480 students (Figure 1). The expansion is expected to be completed by 2013.

The proposed school expansion is to occur within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation
Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23,
requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the
potential traffic impact of the proposed school expansion on the adjacent roadways.

As shown on the Site Plan (Figure 2), access to the development will be provided via a total
of three existing access points along Carpenter Upchurch Road:
       Access #1: full access, approximately 750 feet south of Heritage Pines Drive
       Access #2: full access, approximately 450 feet south of Access #1
       Access #3: full access, approximately 600 feet south of Access #2

The Town of Cary requires inclusion of intersections within one (1) mile of the proposed
school expansion. In total, the following intersections meet the Town's requirements for
inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where
applicable:
       NC 55 and Indian Wells Road/Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
       NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
       NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
       Louis Stephens Drive and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
       Louis Stephens Drive and Heritage Pines Drive (unsignalized)
       Louis Stephens Drive and Upchurch Meadows Road (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Morrisville Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Morrisville Parkway (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Heritage Pines Drive (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #1 (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #2 (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #3 (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and Louis Stephens Drive (unsignalized)
       Carpenter Upchurch Road and High House Road (signalized)

Turning movement counts were also collected at the NC 55 and High House Road
intersection. Since site trips due to the proposed school expansion are projected not to
exceed seven percent (7%) of traffic volumes on any approach, traffic operational analysis is
not required at this intersection based on the Town of Cary LDO.

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed school expansion and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This TAR summarizes trip generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and
traffic analyses for the proposed school expansion.

2.2 EXISTING SCHOOL LOADING OPERATION OBSERVATIONS
On Tuesday, November 27, 2012, M/A/B observed morning and afternoon school traffic
operations at Green Hope High School. A quick summary of observations is provided
below, and the observation details can be found in Appendix G.

Morning Operations
The morning operations began at approximately 6:30 AM with staff and students starting to
arrive. Staff and special needs carpool utilized Access #1. Student carpool and visitors
utilized Access #2. Student drivers, buses, and deliveries utilized Access #3. At about 6:45
AM, outgoing movements at Access #2 and Access #3 were restricted to right-turn only via
traffic cones placed within the left-turn lanes. On-campus traffic operations went quick and
smooth. Student drivers have assigned parking, so there was no challenging for the closest
open space. The morning Student Unloading Zone started approximately 250 feet west of
the traffic circle and ended at the start of the traffic circle. Stationed along the Student
Unloading Zone were five (5) staff members and police officers that kept morning
operations flowing. An average of 22 vehicles was observed within the Student Loading
Zone. Additional staff members and officers were observed near the Student Parking Lot,
Bus Parking Lot, and driveways. However, no traffic control officers were present directing
traffic into and out of school driveways.

Traffic along Carpenter Upchurch Road was congested with traffic queues from each school
access location observed overlapping the adjacent school access location. The southbound
queue at Access #1 was observed extending approximately 400 feet and the northbound
queue at Access #3 extending more than 800 feet.

Afternoon Operations
Afternoon carpool operations started with carpool vehicles lining up along Access #2.
Vehicles started at the "Car Pool Starts Here" sign located approximately 450 feet west of
the traffic circle and continuing around the traffic circle then in along the Access #2. Traffic
spilled back onto Carpenter Upchurch Road with approximately 20 vehicles southbound and
12 vehicles northbound at the peak of traffic operations.

When the dismissal bell rang at approximately 2:18 PM, carpool vehicles, when loaded,
would bypass waiting vehicles. Vehicles would proceed forward when space would open up.
After the initial wave of loading, the 450-feet distance along the Access #2 egress was not
utilized again for loading. The main loading then occurred along the traffic circle. Carpool
Loading lasted approximately 15 minutes. The Student Parking Lot was closed to outgoing
vehicles while bus and carpool loading operations were active. After bus and carpool
loading operations were completed at approximately 2:30 PM, student drivers were released
from the Student Parking Lot. At approximately 2:45 PM, all significant traffic operations
were complete. Approximately five (5) staff members were present overseeing traffic
operations at the front of the school. However, no traffic control officers were present
directing traffic into and out of school driveways.

   2.3 EXISTING TURNING MOVEMENT DATA
   Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC collected the AM, school PM, and PM peak hour intersection
   turning movement counts analyzed in this TAR. In order to capture the complete traffic
   patterns, counts at school driveways started at 6:30 AM instead of 7:00 AM. Table 1
   summarizes the schedule used to obtain the turning movement data. A detailed summary of
   the traffic counts can be found in Appendix A.

Traffic volume balancing was applied along NC 55 and Carpenter Upchurch Road. The
existing peak hour turning movement volumes with traffic balancing are shown in Figure 4.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

          A                Little or no delay           <= 10 sec.            <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay            10-20 sec.            10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay           20-35 sec.            15-25 sec.
          D                Long traffic delay            35-55 sec.            25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay          55-80 sec.            35-50 sec.
          F               Unacceptable delay             > 80 sec.             > 50 sec.

The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities Planning
and Development for Roads (APFO). Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based
on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable for both
signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. Should the existing level of service fail
to meet the requirements of the peak period level of service, there cannot be an increase in
average delay for the affected intersection (measured in its entirety). No increase in delay
time will be allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the
requirement.


2.5 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing scenario analysis
utilized the existing signal plans and timings obtained from the Town of Cary, which are
included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis
can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all the signalized intersections and stop-controlled approaches

3.0 BACKGROUND (2013) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) indicates steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. An annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2012) and the build year (2013). In addition, site traffic from four proposed/approved
developments in the vicinity of study area was aggregated and included in the analysis. Since
school PM site trips were typically not included in the traffic analysis for these
developments, a discount ratio of 0.65 was applied to obtain the estimates of site trips during
the school PM hour.

Highcroft Village Phases 4 & 5 (11-TAR-323) ­ This residential development is being proposed
along Highcroft Drive between Green Hope School Road and future Morrisville Parkway
Extension west of NC 55. The development will include a total of 230 single family homes
and 62 townhomes. Phase 4 of Highcroft Village was expected to be completed by 2013,
and Phase 5 was expected to be completed by 2015. A traffic analysis report (11-TAR-323)
was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, P.C. and submitted to the Town of Cary in
September 2011. Site trips from Highcroft Village Phase 4 were included as depicted in
TAR-323 and applied at the remaining intersections in the study area. Based on TAR-323,
Phase 4 of the proposed Highcroft Village development is projected to generate a total of
1,173 daily site trips, with 90 trips (23 entering, 67 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour
and 118 site trips (74 entering, 44 exiting) occurring in PM peak hour.. Figure D-1 in
Appendix D depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Highcroft Village development.
Geometrically, there is no mitigation committed by this development at any study
intersections in this TAR.

Wake Memorial PDD (10-TAR-320) ­ This residential development is being proposed along
Green Hope School Road west of NC 55. The development will include 62 residential
homes. The project build-out year was scheduled for 2014. A traffic analysis report (10-
TAR-320) was prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary
in November 2010. Based on TAR-320, the development is projected to generate 670 daily
vehicle trips with 53 AM peak hour trips (13 incoming and 40 outgoing) and 68 PM peak
hour trips (43 incoming and 25 outgoing). Site trips from Wake Memorial PDD were
included as depicted in TAR-320 and applied at the remaining intersections in the study area.
Figure D-2 in Appendix D depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Wake Memorial
PDD development. There is no mitigation committed by this development at any study
intersections in this TAR.

Bradford Mixed-Use Phase 1 (07-TAR-231a) ­ The proposed mixed-use development,
previously called Cornerstone Mixed-Use, is to be located in the northeast quadrant of the
High House Road and Davis Drive intersection. The development, consisting of 200,000
square feet of shopping center, 50,000 square feet of office uses, and 450 residential
condominium units, was originally planned for completion by 2010. A traffic analysis report
was prepared by SEPI in March 2007 (07-TAR-231) and later revised in May 2007 (07-TAR-
231a). According to 07-TAR-231a, this development will generate 13,744 trips on a typical
weekday with 518 occurring in the AM peak hour (269 entering, 249 exiting) and 1,330

                                              16
occurring in the PM peak hour (636 entering, 694 exiting). The site trips were distributed to
the study area in accordance with the distribution used in 07-TAR-231a and applied at the
study intersections based on the existing traffic patterns if they were not included in 07-
TAR-231a. Figure D-3 in Appendix D depicts the resulting trip assignment. There are no
mitigation recommendations associated with the Bradford Mixed-Use Phase 1 at any study
intersections in this TAR.

Searstone Mixed-Use (07-TAR-236a) ­ The proposed mixed-use development is to be located
in the southeast quadrant of the High House Road and Davis Drive intersection. The
development was planned to include 135,000 square feet of shopping center, 50,000 square
feet of office uses, 377 residential dwelling units, one 100-room hotel, and a 155-bed
healthcare facility. It was scheduled to be fully built-out by 2013. A traffic analysis report
was prepared by SEPI in March 2007 (07-TAR-236) and later revised in May 2007 (07-TAR-
236a). According to 07-TAR-236a, this development will generate 10,970 trips on a typical
weekday with 532 occurring in the AM peak hour (300 entering, 232 exiting) and 1,003
occurring in the PM peak hour (474 entering, 529 exiting). The site trips were distributed to
the roadway network in accordance with the distribution used in 07-TAR-236a and applied
at the study intersections based on the existing traffic patterns if they were not included in
07-TAR-236a. Figure D-4 in Appendix D depicts the resulting trip assignment. Currently
Searstone Mixed-Use has been partially completed and occupied; based on the current
project status and the estimated completion ratio by 2013, fifty percent (50%) of originally
projected site trips from the Searstone Mixed-Use Development were included as
background traffic for this TAR. There are no mitigation recommendations associated with
the Searstone Mixed-Use at any study intersections in this TAR.


3.2 BACKGROUND ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
Two roadway improvement projects, NC 540 and Morrisville Parkway Extension, are
planned in the study area.

NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) ­ North Carolina Turnpike Authority is constructing NC 540
(Western Wake Freeway) in the study area. The proposed Western Wake Freeway, identified
in the NCDOT Transportation Improvement Program as Project R-2635, will provide a new
six-lane, controlled access freeway in western Wake County, west of NC 55. After
completion, this new roadway is expected to divert a significant portion of existing traffic on
NC 55, US 1, I-40, and NC 751, thereby relieving traffic congestion on these routes.
Currently, the project is partially completed to US 64 in Apex, and the remaining portion to
NC 55 Bypass in Holly Springs is under construction and is expected to open to traffic in
December 2012. For this study, traffic diversion was projected based on historical counts,
previous studies (11-TAR-323, 11-TAR-332, 13-TAR-350), and TRM results (Appendix E).
A comparison of the historical counts along NC 55 indicates that significant traffic diversion
has already occurred. TRM results indicate that more traffic diversion on NC 55 in the study
area is projected to occur with the remaining portion of NC 540, but in a much smaller scale
compared to the already completed portion of NC 540. Figure D-5 in Appendix D depicts
the projected traffic diversion due to the completion of NC 540 between US 64 in Apex and
NC 55 Bypass in Holly Springs.

Morrisville Parkway Extension (Phase III) ­ The Town of Cary is working with private
developers and the NC Turnpike Authority to complete the last 1.83-mile segment of the
Morrisville Parkway extension from NC 55 to Green Level Church Road with a planned
interchange at NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway). The Town has completed the preliminary
design and the draft Environmental Assessment document. However, there is no set date
for constructing the section of Morrisville Parkway or the interchange. Due to the timeline
and funding uncertainties in the Morrisville Parkway Extension project at this point, no
improvements were assumed in the Background (2013) analysis in this study.


3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The resulting Background (2013)
volumes are shown in Figure 4 and are used in the Background (2013) analyses. A summary
of the findings for the Background (2013) scenario LOS analyses can be found in Table 5
and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2013) analysis, the two failing school driveway approaches are
projected to continue to operate at failing levels of service in the AM peak hour. The
remaining signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to continue
operating at acceptable levels of service despite delay increases.

4.0 BUILD (2018) ANALYSIS
Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) proposes to expand the existing campus of
Green Hope High School located on Carpenter Upchurch Road to accommodate an
additional 480 students (Figure 1). The expansion is expected to be completed by 2013.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation was performed using the NCDOT Municipal and School Transportation
Assistance (MSTA) School Calculator (the most recent version as 4/28/2008) based on the
existing and projected future student enrollment. The MSTA School Calculator worksheets
are shown in Appendix F. Since the MSTA School Calculator does not include weekday PM
peak hour rates, the results were compared to traffic survey conducted at the existing school
driveways, and the combined results were used in this study.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed school expansion based
on the MSTA School Calculator and traffic survey. In total, the proposed school expansion
is projected to generate 362 additional AM peak hour trips (247 entering, 115 exiting), 187
school PM peak hour trips (21 entering, 166 exiting), and 75 PM peak hour trips (33
entering, 42 exiting).

Since the AM traffic incoming and outgoing patterns are significantly different from the
school PM and PM peak hours, traffic assignment was conducted separately for the AM
peak hour from the other two peak hours. The AM peak hour traffic assignment
percentages are shown in Figure 6, and the resulting AM peak hour site trips are shown in
Figure 7. School PM and PM traffic assignment percentages are shown in Figure 8, and the
resulting school PM and PM site trips are shown in Figure 9.

4.3 BUILD A LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2013) scenario includes Background (2013) volumes with the addition of net new
site trips generated by the proposed school expansion, based on existing school loading
operations and driveway geometrics. Figure 10 depicts the turning movement volumes used
in the Build (2013) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. Table 8 summarizes the findings of
the LOS analysis for Build (2018) analyses and Appendix B contains the full Synchro/HCS
reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 7, the addition of site trips will incur delay increases at signalized
intersections and unsignalized approaches across the study area, causing two additional
unsignalized approaches to fail in the AM peak hour. Specifically, westbound Heritage Pines
Drive at Carpenter Upchurch Road is projected to operate at LOS F, and Access #1 is
projected to operate at LOS F in the AM peak hour. The already-failing Accesses #2 and
#3 are projected to worsen and operate at failing levels of service during both the AM and
school PM peak hours. The remaining signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches
are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during all the AM, school PM, and
PM peak hours.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
5.1 BUILD ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed school expansion is projected to
have impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections within the
study area. In addition, the Town of Cary requires new developments widen the roads along
the frontage of their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). The following roadway improvements are recommended based
on the Town of Cary's CTP, Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO), and NCDOT
engineering guidance requirements:

Frontage Widening along Carpenter Upchurch Road
For the section of Carpenter Upchurch Road in front of Green Hope High School, the CTP
dictates a two-lane collector avenue cross-section with two travel lanes, with or without a
landscaped median, and bike lanes and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 70 or 58
feet of right-of-way. The existing roadway width and lane configurations are considered
equivalent to the ultimate cross-section requirements of alternative design. However, extra
widening will likely be needed to meet the CTP bike lane requirements.

Overall School Loading Operations
Traffic analyses indicate that the current school loading operations will result in failing
operations at two out of three driveways. Field observations indicate that the AM queuing
along Carpenter Upchurch Road currently exceeds 2,500 feet, essentially blocking both
directions of Carpenter Upchurch Road. Traffic operations will worsen with the proposed
school expansion if no improvements are made to the current school loading operations.

The Site Plan proposes new school loading operations by modifying driveway functions and
internal operating procedures. Under the new pattern, Access #3 will become the primary
driveway servicing student carpool traffic during the AM and school PM operations. This
change will increase stacking distance at the carpool lane to up to 3,100 feet, exceeding the
MSTA minimum stacking distance requirement of 1,500 feet and the field observed queue
length of 2,500 feet. Access #2 will become the primary driveway servicing student drivers
and staff traffic. Bus traffic will be assigned to Access #1.

Overall, the new layout will provide a longer stacking distance within the school site to better
alleviate traffic congestion and spillback onto Carpenter Upchurch Road during school
loading operations. In addition to the proposed changes by the Site Plan, it is also
recommended that the school develop a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) and
include car-pool procedures in the student handbook.

Access #1 and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this driveway will operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour with
the proposed traffic circulation plan. However, the congestion only occurs during a short
time period, and the projected left-turn traffic from this driveway is light and primarily
consists of buses. In addition, vehicular traffic will often yield to buses when there is a mass
exit of buses at the same time. Therefore, no additional improvements are recommended at

                                              30
this driveway.

Access #2 and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this driveway will operate at LOS F in the school PM peak hour
with the proposed traffic circulation plan, and traffic queuing is projected to remain at this
intersection during both the AM and school PM peak hours. Peak hour traffic at this
intersection meets warrants for an exclusive right-turn lane along Carpenter Upchurch Road
at this intersection. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town APFO requirements:
        Widen the northbound Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to provide an exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 150 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Restripe the southbound left-turn lane on Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to
        provide at least 250 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Prohibit left-turn movement from Access #2 during the school AM loading time.

Access #3 and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that without traffic control assistance, this driveway will still operate
at a failing level of service in the AM peak hour even for right-turn only exiting movements.
Therefore, the following roadway improvements are recommended at this intersection to
meet the Town APFO requirements:
        Widen the northbound Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to provide an exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 250 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Restripe the southbound left-turn lane on Carpenter Upchurch Road approach to
        provide at least 350 feet storage lane and appropriate taper.
        Widen Access #3 between Carpenter Upchurch Road and current bus parking lot to
        provide two inbound lanes.
        During the AM loading operations, place temporary traffic control devices (such as
        traffic cones) to allow for free-flow right-turn movement from Carpenter Upchurch
        Road onto Access #3.
        Implement a traffic control officer during the AM loading time to help direct traffic
        at this driveway.

Note that in the school PM peak hour when full movement is allowed at this intersection,
Site Access #3 is projected to operate at LOS F. Therefore, the existing practice of closing
student parking lot during school loading operations should remain at this driveway.

Heritage Pines Drive and Carpenter Upchurch Road (existing unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that under the exiting school plan, this driveway will worsen to
operate at LOS F in the AM peak hour after the proposed school expansion. Field
observations indicate that some school traffic is making u-turns at this intersection to travel
south on Carpenter Upchurch Road. This is attributed to the current restrictions of left-turn
movements from two out of three school driveways in the AM peak hour. With the
recommended traffic control officer enabling full movement at Access #3, this intersection
is expected to experience improved traffic operations with reduction in u-turn traffic.
Therefore, no additional improvements are recommended at this intersection.


                                                31
The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2013) and Build (2013) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

Revised school loading operations with traffic mitigations in place were included in the Build
(2013) with Improvements scenario. Figures 11 and 12 depict the projected traffic diversion
with the new school loading pattern, and Figure 13 depicting the resulting turning movement
volumes with the recommended school loading operations. The resulting future lane
configuration and traffic control for Build (2013) with Improvements conditions are
depicted in Figure 14.

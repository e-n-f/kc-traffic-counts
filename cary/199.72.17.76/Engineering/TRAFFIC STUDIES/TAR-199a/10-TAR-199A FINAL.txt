EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
A residential development is proposed to be constructed in the southeastern quadrant of the
Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway intersection, in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is
to be completed by 2012 and consists of 256 mid-rise apartments.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The Site Plan proposes two driveway openings on its frontages along Tryon Road and SE
Cary Parkway (Figure 2):
       Site Access #1: right-in/right-out driveway along Tryon Road approximately 650
       feet east of SE Cary Parkway; to be shared with an existing veterinary hospital.
       Site Access #2: full movement driveway on SE Cary Parkway approximately 550
       feet south of Tryon Road; aligned directly across from an existing driveway.
The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Piney Plains Road (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Drive/Colonial Baptist Church (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Keisler Drive/New Waverly Place (signalized)
       SE Cary Parkway and US 1 NB/US 64 EB Ramps (signalized)
       SE Cary Parkway and US 1 SB/US 64 WB Ramps (signalized)
       SE Cary Parkway and Lochmere Drive (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Wellingborough Drive (unsignalized)
       Tryon Road and Site Access #1 (right-in/right-out)
       SE Cary Parkway and Site Access #2 (unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2010), Background (2012), Build
(2012) and Build (2012) with Improvements. The Existing (2010) scenario includes AM and
PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in August,
September, and October 2010. The Background (2012) scenario includes existing traffic
along with site traffic from four approved developments within the study area. The Build
(2012) scenario includes Background (2012) volumes with the addition of site trips generated
by the proposed development. Future conditions with the proposed mitigation
improvements in place were analyzed in a Build (2012) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2010) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.


                                             i
As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page iv, all of the signalized
study area intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service. Among the
unsignalized intersections, the stop-controlled Wellingborough Drive at Tryon Road is
operating at LOS D in the AM peak hour and LOS E in the PM peak hour.

Background (2012) Conditions
In the Background (2012) conditions, an annual growth rate of one percent (2%) was applied
to the existing traffic to account for normal traffic growth between the base year (2010) and
the build year (2012). In addition, site traffic from four proposed/approved developments
in the vicinity of the study area was included in the background traffic for this study.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, all of the intersections are projected to continue
operating at acceptable levels of service as in the Existing (2010) analysis with the exception
of the Wellingborough Drive approach at Tryon Road, which is projected to continue to
operate at LOS D in the AM peak hour but degrade from LOS E to LOS F in the PM peak
hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The development is proposed to consist of 256 mid-rise apartments. Trip generation was
conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation code included in
ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's
"Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,689 daily site trips, 129 AM
peak hour site trips (26 entering, 103 exiting), and 158 PM peak hour site trips (103 entering,
55 exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing turning
movement counts and surrounding land uses.

Build (2012) Conditions
The Build (2012) conditions account for both the Background (2012) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on
page iv, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant level of service degradation
(i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area intersections. As a result,
all of the existing study area intersections are projected to continue operating acceptably as
in the Existing (2010) and Background (2012) scenarios with the exception of the
southbound Wellingborough Drive approach at Tryon Road, which is projected to continue
to operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour with increased traffic delay.

Both the shared Access #1 along Tryon Road and the newly constructed Access #2 along
SE Cary Parkway are projected to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak
hours. With the addition of opposing approach and site trips, the existing office driveway
across from Access #2 is projected to experience slight traffic delay increases and operate at
LOS B in the AM peak hour and LOS C in the PM peak hour.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a very minor impact on the roadways and intersections within the study area. The
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's APFO
and NCDOT requirements:
Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed development has frontages along Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway, both
having a four-lane median-divided cross-section with pedestrian sidewalks along both sides
under the existing conditions. The ultimate geometrics dictated by the Plan have already
been achieved. Thus, no further widening is needed.

Tryon Road and Wellingborough Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analyses indicate that the southbound Wellingborough Drive approach operates
at LOS F in the PM peak hour under the background and build conditions. However, traffic
simulation results using TSIS/CORSIM indicate that this intersection may perform better
with traffic platoons formed by the upstream and downstream signals. Field observations
indicate that many drivers utilize the rarely-used westbound left-turn lane to make two-stage
left-turn maneuvers. Since peak hour signal warrants are currently not met and turn lanes
already exist on the mainline and side street approaches, no geometric improvements or
signalization are recommended at this time. However, traffic conditions should be
monitored at this location.

Tryon Road and Access #1 (unsignalized ­ RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Access #1 approach is projected to
operate at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following are
recommended at this location:
     Construct the planned connection to Access #1 with one ingress lane and one egress
       lane as shown on the Site Plan.
     At the newly formed internal intersection, stop control should be installed on the
       planned approach to ensure free-flow conditions for the inbound traffic from Tryon
       Road.

SE Cary Parkway and Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the westbound Access #2 approach is projected to operate
at LOS B and LOS C in the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
     As shown on the Site Plan, construct the driveway with one ingress lane and one
       egress lane.

In addition, it is important to design internal circulation within the project site so that both
driveways are available for all future apartment residents to enter and exit the site.

The remaining intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours; thus, no further improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
A residential development is proposed to be constructed in the southeastern quadrant of the
Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway intersection, in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is
to be completed by 2012 and consists of 256 mid-rise apartments.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The Site Plan proposes two driveway openings on its frontages along Tryon Road and SE
Cary Parkway (Figure 2):
       Site Access #1: right-in/right-out driveway along Tryon Road approximately 650
       feet east of SE Cary Parkway; to be shared with an existing veterinary hospital.
       Site Access #2: full movement driveway on SE Cary Parkway approximately 550
       feet south of Tryon Road; aligned directly across from an existing driveway.
The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Piney Plains Road (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Drive/Colonial Baptist Church (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Keisler Drive/New Waverly Place (signalized)
       SE Cary Parkway and US 1 NB/US 64 EB Ramps (signalized)
       SE Cary Parkway and US 1 SB/US 64 WB Ramps (signalized)
       SE Cary Parkway and Lochmere Drive (signalized)
       Tryon Road and Wellingborough Drive (unsignalized)
       Tryon Road and Site Access #1 (right-in/right-out)
       SE Cary Parkway and Site Access #2 (unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

  2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
  Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
  traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
  Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
  vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
  the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
  Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
  ranges.

The planned Tryon Place at Cary Parkway is located within the Town of Cary's "Base
Benefit Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public
Facilities Planning and Development for Roads (APFR). Level of service in the "Base
Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered
acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service worse than LOS D, no
increase in overall intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections where the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under background
conditions, the installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the intersection
meets required warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay
in the surrounding roadway system.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans from the
Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the
Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all of the signalized study area intersections are operating at
acceptable levels of service. Among the unsignalized intersections, the stop-controlled
Wellingborough Drive at Tryon Road is operating at LOS D in the AM peak hour and LOS
E in the PM peak hour.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2012) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Based on AADT collected by the NCDOT in the vicinity of the proposed development for
the years between 2002 and 2009, a small background growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the study area roadways and intersections to account for normal traffic growth
between the existing and build years.

In addition, site trips from background developments were added to the background
conditions. There are four (4) developments in the study area expected to be partially or
fully constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed development.
These developments include:
           Parkway Professional Building (06-TAR-206)
           Tryon Village East (08-TAR-288)
           Tryon Village Mixed-Use Update (08-TAR-165A)
           Coorsdale Office Update (09-TAR-217A)

Parkway Professional Office (06-TAR-206) ­ This 135,000 square foot office development was
proposed on SE Cary Parkway south of the US 1/US 64 interchange and was expected to be
completed in 2008. A traffic analysis report (06-TAR-206) was prepared by HNTB and
submitted to the Town of Cary in April 2006. Figures C-1 in Appendix C depicts the
projected peak hour vehicle trips in the study network. Since to date the majority of this
development has been completed and occupied, 25% of the original projected trips were
included in this study. There is no mitigation associated with this development at any study
intersections in this TAR.

Tryon Village East (08-TAR-288) ­ This office and retail development is located in the
southeastern quadrant of the Walnut Street and Macedonia Road intersection. The
proposed project is to consist of two possible land use scenarios and was scheduled for
completion in 2009. A traffic analysis report (08-TAR-288) was prepared by M/A/B and
submitted to the Town of Cary in January 2009. TAR-288 did not include an AM peak hour
analysis. The AM peak hour trips at each study intersection were therefore projected based
on the rates included in the ITE Trip Generation, then by applying the AM/PM ratios to the
PM peak hour site trips as shown in the TAR-288. Figure C-2 in Appendix C depicts the
projected peak hour trips due to Tryon Village East. There is no mitigation committed by
this development at any study intersections in this TAR.

Tryon Village Mixed-Use Update (08-TAR-165A) ­ This office and retail development is
located on the north side of Tryon Road west of the Walnut Street intersection. The
proposed project is to consist of two possible land use scenarios and was scheduled for
completion in 2010. A traffic analysis report (08-TAR-165A) was prepared by M/A/B and
submitted to the Town of Cary in April 2009. Site trips based on the worse-case scenario
(Scenario B) were distributed to the study area network in accordance with the distribution
used in 08-TAR-165A. TAR-165A did not include an AM peak hour analysis. The AM
peak hour trips at each study intersection were therefore projected based on the rates

                                   13
included in the ITE Trip Generation, then by applying the AM/PM ratios to the PM peak
hour site trips as shown in the TAR-165A. To date one retail building has been completed
and occupied. Therefore, 75% of the originally projected site trips was included in the
background conditions for this study. There was mitigation recommended at the Walnut
Street and Meeting Street intersection, the Tryon Road and Tryon Village/Colonial Baptist
Church intersection, and the Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection, but
these improvements were not finally committed. Therefore, they were not included in the
background analyses. Figure C-3 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

Coorsdale II Office Update (09-TAR-217A) ­ This 55,910 square foot office development is
proposed on the southeastern corner of SE Cary Parkway and Coorsdale Drive near the US
1/US 64 interchange and was expected to be completed in 2009. A traffic analysis report
(10-TAR-217A) was prepared by M/A/B and submitted to the Town of Cary in January
2009. Figures C-4 in Appendix C depicts the projected site trips assigned thru the study
intersections in this TAR. To date one out of two planned office buildings has been
completed and occupied. Therefore, 50% of the originally projected site trips due to this
development were included in this study. There is no mitigation associated with this
development that overlap study intersections in this TAR.


3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background (2012) scenario
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2012) scenario LOS analyses can
be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, all of the intersections are projected to continue
operating at acceptable levels of service as in the Existing (2010) analysis with the exception
of the Wellingborough Drive approach at Tryon Road, which is projected to continue to
operate at LOS D in the AM peak hour but degrade from LOS E to LOS F in the PM peak
hour.

4.0 BUILD (2012) ANALYSIS
A residential development is proposed to be constructed in the southeastern quadrant of the
Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway intersection, in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is
to be completed by 2012 and consists of 256 mid-rise apartments.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The development is proposed to consist of 256 mid-rise apartments. Trip generation was
conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation code included in
ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's
"Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,689 daily site trips, 129 AM
peak hour site trips (26 entering, 103 exiting), and 158 PM peak hour site trips (103 entering,
55 exiting).

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2012) analysis scenario includes the Background (2012) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 8 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2012) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the build year analysis.
Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the full
Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant level of
service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area
intersections. As a result, all of the existing study area intersections are projected to continue
operating acceptably as in the Existing (2010) and Background (2012) scenarios with the
exception of the southbound Wellingborough Drive approach at Tryon Road, which is
projected to continue to operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour with increased traffic delay.

Both the shared Access #1 along Tryon Road and the newly constructed Access #2 along
SE Cary Parkway are projected to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak
hours. With the addition of opposing approach and site trips, the existing office driveway
across from Access #2 is projected to experience slight traffic delay increases and operate at
LOS B in the AM peak hour and LOS C in the PM peak hour.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a very minor impact on the roadways and intersections within the study area. The
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's APFO
and NCDOT requirements:
Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed development has frontages along Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway, both
having a four-lane median-divided cross-section with pedestrian sidewalks along both sides
under the existing conditions. The ultimate geometrics dictated by the Plan have already
been achieved. Thus, no further widening is needed.

Tryon Road and Wellingborough Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analyses indicate that the southbound Wellingborough Drive approach operates
at LOS F in the PM peak hour under the background and build conditions. However, traffic
simulation results using TSIS/CORSIM indicate that this intersection may perform better
with traffic platoons formed by the upstream and downstream signals. Field observations
indicate that many drivers utilize the rarely-used westbound left-turn lane to make two-stage
left-turn maneuvers. Since peak hour signal warrants are currently not met and turn lanes
already exist on the mainline and side street approaches, no geometric improvements or
signalization are recommended at this time. However, traffic conditions should be
monitored at this location.

Tryon Road and Access #1 (unsignalized ­ RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Access #1 approach is projected to
operate at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following are
recommended at this location:
     Construct the planned connection to Access #1 with one ingress lane and one egress
       lane as shown on the Site Plan.
     At the newly formed internal intersection, stop control should be installed on the
       planned approach to ensure free-flow conditions for the inbound traffic from Tryon
       Road.

SE Cary Parkway and Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the westbound Access #2 approach is projected to operate
at LOS B and LOS C in the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
     As shown on the Site Plan, construct the driveway with one ingress lane and one
       egress lane.

In addition, it is important to design internal circulation within the project site so that both
driveways are available for all future apartment residents to enter and exit the site.

The remaining intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours; thus, no further improvements are recommended.

                                    24
A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configuration and traffic control for 2012 are depicted in Figure 9.

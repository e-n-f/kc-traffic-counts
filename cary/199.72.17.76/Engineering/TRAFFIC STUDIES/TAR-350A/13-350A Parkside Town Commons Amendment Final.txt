EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
The Town of Cary has received a request to provide an amendment to Parkside Town
Commons, a mixed-use development in the northeast quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540
interchange in western Cary, NC (Figure 1). The original analysis (12-TAR-350) was
completed and submitted to the Town of Cary on June 27, 2012. This amendment reflects
an additional right-in only access on NC 55 north of O'Kelly Chapel Road. In addition, the
new program now contains only one hotel with up to 140 rooms, a reduction from two 140-
room hotels that were included in 12-TAR-350.

This amended development is still projected to be completed by 2016 and now consists of
the following land uses:
      300 Apartments
      One (1) 140-room Hotel
      One (1) 12-screen Movie Theater
      One (1) 16-lane Bowling Alley
      501,000 square feet of General Retail
      65,000 square feet of High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
      31,000 square feet of Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru Window

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" as defined in
the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the amended program on the adjacent roadways.

Per the site plan, access to the development is now proposed via nine access points
surrounding the site (Figure 2), as follows:
      Access #1 ­ full access along NC 55, at the north end of the project site,
       approximately 2,250 feet north of O'Kelly Chapel Road
      Access #2 ­ right-in/right-out (RIRO) access along NC 55 approximately 1,350 feet
       north of O'Kelly Chapel Road
      Access #3 ­ right-in (RI) only access along NC 55 approximately 600 feet south of
       O'Kelly Chapel Road
      Access #4 ­ RIRO access along O'Kelly Chapel Road approximately 550 feet east of
       NC 55
      Access #5 ­ RI only access along O'Kelly Chapel Road approximately 700 feet east
       of NC 55
      Access #6 ­ full access along O'Kelly Chapel Road approximately 1,200 feet east of
       NC 55
      Access #7 ­ RIRO access with left-over along the north side of O'Kelly Chapel
       Road approximately 1,750 feet east of NC 55
      Access #8 ­ RIRO access along the south side of O'Kelly Chapel Road
       approximately 1,700 feet east of NC 55



                                            i
     Access #9 ­ RI only access along NC 55 approximately 700 feet north of O'Kelly
     Chapel Road

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       NC 55 and Kit Creek Road (signalized)
       NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road (signalized)
       Northbound NC 55 and NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp (signalized)
       Northbound NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound On-Ramp (signalized)
       NC 55 and McCrimmon Parkway (signalized)
       Green Level Church Road and Kit Creek Road (signalized)
       Kit Creek Road and Louis Stephens Drive (signalized)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road (North Leg) (unsignalized)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road (South Leg) (unsignalized)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Alston Avenue (unsignalized)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Louis Stephens Drive (future unsignalized)
       Southbound NC 55 and NC 540 Westbound On-Ramp (future signalized)
       Southbound NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp (future signalized)
       NC 55 and Access #1 (future signalized)
       NC 55 and Access #2 (future RIRO)
       NC 55 and Access #3 (future RI Only)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Access #4 (future RIRO)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Access #5 (future RI Only)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Access #6 (future signalized)
       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Access #7/Access #8 (future RIRO with left-over)
       NC 55 and Access #9 (future RI Only)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2012), Background (2016), Build
(2016), and a Build (2016) with Improvements scenario. The Existing (2012) scenario
includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in
March and May 2012. The Background (2016) scenario includes existing traffic with
projected annual growth, site traffic from seven proposed developments in the vicinity, as
well as projected traffic diversion due to the future NC 540. The Build (2016) scenario
includes Background (2016) volumes with the addition of net new site trips generated by the
proposed development and the projected traffic diversion due to the future O'Kelly Chapel
Road extension. Additionally, future conditions with the proposed mitigation improvements
in place were analyzed in a Build (2016) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. For the signalized intersections, traffic signal plans and timings
were obtained from Town of Cary staff.

As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page xi, one signalized intersection

                                             ii
and one stop-controlled approach are currently operating at failing levels of service (LOS E
or F). Specifically, the signalized NC 55 and Kit Creek Road intersection is operating at
LOS E in the PM peak hour, and the stop-controlled northbound Green Level Church Road
at O'Kelly Chapel Road is operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours. The
remaining signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are operating at acceptable
levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Background (2016) Conditions
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2009 in the study area. An annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2012) and the build year (2016). In addition, site traffic from seven proposed/approved
developments in the vicinity of study area was individually included in the analysis.

When traffic data were collected, NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) was currently under
construction and to be completed in 2012. Traffic diversion from NC 55 to the future NC
540 was projected based on the most recent traffic forecast (prepared by HNTB, dated May
2011) at the NC 540/NC 55 interchange and then applied along NC 55 to other
intersections. Note that the HNTB forecast between the north leg of NC 55 and the east leg
of NC 540 was significantly lower than previous forecast and the existing traffic counts.
Therefore, traffic projections based on ambient traffic growth and background projects were
used as traffic diversion due to NC 540 was expected to be minimal between these two legs.

Geometrically, the completion of NC 540 will add two new signals along southbound NC 55
at the NC 540 and NC 55 interchange. The Town of Cary has approved plans to widen
northbound NC 55 at the NC 540 interchange to add a third through lane through the
interchange. In addition, the Town of Cary plans to widen southbound NC 55 from the
Wake/Durham County line to add a third southbound through lane to terminate at the NC
540 interchange.

Based on the Background (2016) analysis, the signalized NC 55 and Kit Creek Road
intersection and the stop-controlled northbound Green Level Church Road at O'Kelly
Chapel Road are projected to continue operating at failing levels of service as in the Existing
(2012) conditions with delay increases and levels of service decline. Besides, one additional
signalized intersection and two additional stop-controlled approaches along O'Kelly Chapel
Road are projected to decline to failing levels of service. Specifically, the NC 55 and O'Kelly
Chapel Road intersection is projected to decline from LOS D to LOS E in the PM peak
hour, and both southbound Alston Avenue and southbound Green Level Church Road at
O'Kelly Chapel Road are projected to degrade to operate at LOS F during both the AM and
PM peak hours. The remaining signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are
projected to remain operating at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM
peak hours.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The amended Parkside Town Commons development consists of mixed land uses with
apartments, a hotel, a movie theater, bowling alley, restaurants, and general retail. Trip
generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation

                                              iii
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. The project site will be divided into two
distinct portions by the future O'Kelly Chapel Road extension; therefore, trip generation was
conducted for the northern and southern parcels separately. Internal capture between
different types of land uses and pass-by trips for commercial uses were calculated based on
standard ITE procedures and NCDOT guidance.

In total, the amended program is projected to generate 53,933 external daily trips with 3,101
trips occurring in the AM peak hour (1,607 entering, 1,494 exiting) and 4,472 trips occurring
in the PM peak hour trips (2,312 entering, 2,160 exiting).

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing and future traffic patterns
and surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build (2016) Conditions
The Build (2016) conditions account for Background (2016) traffic, site traffic generated by
the amended program, and the projected traffic diversion due to the future O'Kelly Chapel
Road extension. Geometrically, the site plan proposes to construct O'Kelly Chapel Road
extension as a four-lane median-divided facility across the site and add a third northbound
through lane along NC 55 along the property frontage. Exclusive turn lanes are also planned
at all site accesses, and new traffic signals are proposed at the NC 55 and Access #1
intersection and the O'Kelly Chapel Road and Site Access #6 intersection.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page xi, the addition of site trips will incur delay
increases at intersections across the study area, causing delay increases and/or levels of
service degradation at the five already-failing intersections from the Background (2016)
conditions. Specifically, the signalized NC 55 and Kit Creek Road intersection is project to
decline to operate at LOS E in the AM and LOS F in the PM peak hour, the signalized NC
55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection is projected to decline to operate at LOS F in the
PM peak hour, and southbound Alston Avenue, northbound Green Level Church Road, and
southbound Green Level Church Road are projected to continue to operate at LOS F during
both the AM and PM peak hours with significant delay increases. Among the planned site
accesses, westbound Site Access #2 at NC 55 is projected to operate at LOS E in the AM
peak hour, and the O'Kelly Chapel Road and Site Access #6 intersection is projected to
operate at LOS C in the AM peak hour and LOS D in the PM peak hour with the proposed
geometrics and traffic control shown on the amended site plan.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the amended program is projected to have
considerable impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections within
the study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town
of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP), Adequate Public Facility Ordinances
(APFO), and NCDOT requirements:

Frontage Widening along NC 55
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). For the section of NC 55 in front of the development, the CTP

                                             iv
dictates a six-lane major arterial cross-section with four 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-
foot outside travel lanes, a landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within
124 feet of right-of-way. Therefore, the following improvements are required to meet the
CTP standards and the APFO requirements:
        Widen the section of northbound NC 55 along the property frontage to achieve half
        of the ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP;
        Stripe the section of northbound NC 55 to provide a continuous third through lane
        from the NC 540 interchange to at least 1,000 feet north of Site Access #1.

O'Kelly Chapel Road
The site plan proposes to construct O'Kelly Chapel Road as an east-west major
thoroughfare across the project site to be consistent with the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Plan. For the section of O'Kelly Chapel Road across the project site, the CTP dictates a six-
lane major arterial cross-section with four 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside
travel lanes, a landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 124 feet of
right-of-way. Traffic analysis indicates that a four-lane median-divided cross-section as
proposed by the site plan will provide sufficient capacity to meet the interim traffic needs
along this road between NC 55 and Louis Stephens Drive. Therefore, the following
improvement is required to partially meet the CTP standards:
        Construct the section of O'Kelly Chapel Road with a four-lane median-divided
        cross-section between NC 55 and Louis Stephens Drive.

Despite the reduced cross-section, right-of-way should be dedicated for this section of
roadway based on the ultimate cross-section requirements by the CTP. Additionally, the
traffic analysis indicates that a four-lane divided cross-section is needed along O'Kelly
Chapel Road between NC 55 and Green Level Church Road to provide necessary
mitigations at the failing intersections along it. Therefore, the following improvement is
required to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
        Widen the section of O'Kelly Chapel Road to a four-lane median-divided cross-
        section from NC 55 to at least 500 feet west of Green Level Church Road (North
        Leg).

NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road (future signal upgrade)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
PM peak hour with the planned lane geometrics and traffic control on the site plan.
Therefore, the following roadway improvements are recommended to meet the Town of
Cary APFO requirements:
        Construct the westbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide two through
        lanes, three exclusive left-turn lanes with an average of 500 feet of storage length,
        and an exclusive right-turn with at least 150 feet of storage length;
        Widen the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide two through
        lanes, an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 350 of storage length, and an exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 400 feet of storage length;
        Widen the northbound approach of NC 55 to provide three through lanes, two
        exclusive left-turn lanes with at least 450 feet of storage length, and an exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 250 feet of storage length;

                                               v
       Widen the southbound approach of NC 55 to provide three through lanes, two
       exclusive left-turn lanes with at least 250 feet of storage length, and an exclusive
       right-turn lane with at least 250 feet of storage length;
       Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate the geometric
       improvements.

NC 55 and Site Access #1 (future signalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #1 as a signalized site access point. Traffic
analyses indicate that this site access will operate at acceptable levels of service with the
planned lane geometrics and traffic control.            Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve traffic operations
and safety:
       Construct Site Access #1 at the planned location to consist of two inbound lanes
       and two outbound lanes including one exclusive right-turn lane and one exclusive
       left-turn lane with at least 250 feet of storage length;
       Widen the southbound approach of NC 55 to provide three through lanes and two
       exclusive left-turn lanes with at least 250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
       Widen the northbound approach of NC 55 to provide three through lanes, an
       exclusive left-turn/u-turn lane with at least 300 feet of storage length, and an
       exclusive right-turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
       Install a three-phase traffic signal at this intersection and provide coordination with
       the existing O'Kelly Chapel Road and Kit Creek Road signals.

NC 55 and Site Access #2 (future right-in/right-out)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #2 as a right-in/right-out access between
Site Access #1 and O'Kelly Chapel Road. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will
operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour with the planned lane geometrics. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve
traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Site Access #2 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and
       one outbound lane;
       Widen the northbound approach of NC 55 to provide an exclusive right-turn lane
       with at least 150 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

NC 55 and Site Access #9 (future right-in only)
The amended site plan proposes to construct Site Access #9 as a right-in only driveway
between O'Kelly Chapel Road and Site Access #2. Traffic analyses indicate that this site
access will operate acceptably with the planned lane geometrics. Therefore, the following
roadway improvements and driveway configuration are recommended for traffic operations
and safety:
       Construct Site Access #9 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane;
       Widen the northbound approach of NC 55 to provide a third through lane and an
       exclusive right-turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length.

NC 55 and Site Access #3 (future right-in only)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #3 as a right-in only driveway between

                                              vi
O'Kelly Chapel Road and NC 540 interchange. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access
will operate acceptably with the planned lane geometrics. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configuration are recommended for traffic operations and
safety:
        Construct Site Access #3 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane;
        Widen the northbound approach of NC 55 to provide a third through lane and an
        exclusive right-turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Site Access #4 (future right-in/right-out)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #4 as a right-in/right-out access
approximately 550 feet east of NC 55. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will
operate acceptably with the planned lane geometrics. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve traffic operations
and safety:
        Construct Site Access #4 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and
        one outbound lane;
        Widen the westbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide an exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

In addition, channelization between through lanes and left-turn lanes on O'Kelly Chapel
Road should be considered as a safety measure to prevent traffic using this driveway to
access the westbound left-turn lanes on O'Kelly Chapel Road at the NC 55 intersection.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Site Access #5 (future right-in only)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #5 as a right-in only driveway approximately
700 feet east of NC 55. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate acceptably
with the planned lane geometrics. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and
driveway configuration are recommended for traffic operations and safety:
        Construct Site Access #5 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane;
        Widen the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to an exclusive right-turn
        lane with at least 150 feet of storage length.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Site Access #6 (future signalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #6 as a primary site access point under
traffic signal control. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate at acceptable
levels of service with the planned lane geometrics and traffic control. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve
traffic operations and safety:
        Construct the south leg of Site Access #6 at the planned location to consist of two
        inbound lanes and four outbound lanes including one exclusive right-turn lane with
        at least 100 feet of storage length, one through lane with at least 200 feet of storage
        length, and two exclusive left-turn lanes with at least 450 feet of storage length;
        Construct the north leg of Site Access #6 at the planned location to consist of two
        inbound lanes and four outbound lanes including one through lane, two exclusive
        right-turn lane with at least 250 feet of storage length, and an exclusive left-turn lane
        with at least 250 feet of storage length;

                                               vii
       Construct the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide two through
       lanes, an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 200 feet of storage length, and two
       exclusive left-turn lanes with at least 250 feet of storage length;
       Construct the westbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide two through
       lanes, an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and an
       exclusive left-turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length;
       Install a traffic signal at this intersection and provide coordination with the existing
       NC 55 at O'Kelly Chapel Road signal.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Site Access #7/Site Access #8 (future right-in/right-out with left-over)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #7 as a right-in/right-out driveway with a
left-over and Site Access #8 as a right-in/right-out driveway. Traffic analyses indicate that
both site accesses will operate acceptably with the planned lane geometrics. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve
traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Site Access #7 and Site Access #8 at the planned location to consist of
       one inbound lane and one outbound lane each;
       Construct the eastbound and westbound approaches of O'Kelly Chapel Road to
       provide two through lanes and an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 150 feet of
       storage length and appropriate taper on both approaches;
       Construct the planned eastbound left-over lane with at least 150 feet of storage
       length and appropriate taper.

NC 55 and Kit Creek Road (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, this intersection will decline
from LOS D to LOS E in the AM peak hour with a delay increase of 11.8 seconds per
vehicle, and continue to operate LOS F in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 29.2
seconds per vehicle in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
       Widen the eastbound approach of Kit Creek Road to provide an additional shared
       through/right-turn lane with at least 300 feet of full storage length and lengthen the
       storage length of the existing exclusive left-turn lane to at least 450 feet.
       Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate the new lane geometrics.

Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Under Existing conditions, the Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersections consist of two T-intersections spaced approximately 250 feet from each other.
The necessity of realigning the two T-intersections to form a four-leg intersection has been
identified in the Town of Cary Northwest Area Plan, as well as several traffic studies in the
area, the last being the Alston Town Center (11-TAR-332). Plans to realign this intersection
have been submitted by the Amberly Town Center Townhomes Phases 1 & 2 (11-TAR-
326A). However, to date the re-alignment has not been funded.

Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, both the northbound and the
southbound approaches of Green Level Church Road are projected to operate at LOS F
with significant traffic delay increases compared to Background (2016) conditions.

                                              viii
Therefore, the following previously recommended roadway improvements in 11-TAR-326A
are recommended in this study to meet the APFO requirements if they are not committed
by the Amberly Town Center Townhomes before this project commences:
        Realign the south leg of Green Level Church Road to intersect O'Kelly Chapel Road
        directly across from the existing north leg of Green Level Church Road. The
        realigned northbound approach should consist of two approaching lanes with a
        shared through/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 200 feet
        of storage length and appropriate taper;
        Restripe the southbound approach of Green Level Church Road to include a
        through lane, an exclusive right-turn lane, and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least
        250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
        Widen the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide an exclusive left-
        turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
        Widen the westbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide an exclusive left-
        turn lane with at least 350 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
        Conduct a signal warrant analysis and install a three-phase traffic signal when
        warranted at this location.

The following additional roadway improvements are recommended to meet the APFO
requirements and to improve traffic operations and safety:
        Widen O'Kelly Chapel Road through this intersection to provide a second through
        lane on the eastbound and westbound approaches;
        Widen the realigned northbound approach to provide a right-turn lane with at least
        250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Alston Avenue (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service with
increases in traffic delay compared to the Background (2016) conditions. Projected traffic
volumes at this intersection do not warrant installation of a traffic signal. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to
improve traffic operations and safety:
        Widen O'Kelly Chapel Road through this intersection to provide a second through
        lane on the eastbound and westbound approaches;
        Restripe the southbound approach of Alston Avenue to provide a shared
        through/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of
        storage length.

In the long term, signalization or restricting driveway access at this intersection should be
considered when the vacant corners at this intersection are developed.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Louis Stephens Drive (future unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at acceptable levels of service with
the planned roadway extension. Projected traffic volumes at this intersection do not warrant
installation of a traffic signal at this time. Therefore, the following roadway improvement is
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:


                                                ix
       Install stop control along the southbound approach of Louis Stephens Drive before
       warrants for installing a traffic signal are met at the intersection.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2016) and Build (2016) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Town of Cary has received a request to provide an amendment to Parkside Town
Commons, a mixed-use development in the northeast quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540
interchange in western Cary, NC (Figure 1). The original analysis (12-TAR-350) was
completed and submitted to the Town of Cary on June 27, 2012. This amendment reflects
an additional right-in only access on NC 55 north of O'Kelly Chapel Road. In addition, the
new program now contains only one hotel with up to 140 rooms, a reduction from two 140-
room hotels that were included in 12-TAR-350.

This amended development is still projected to be completed by 2016 and now consists of
the following land uses:
      300 Apartments
      One (1) 140-room Hotel
      One (1) 12-screen Movie Theater
      One (1) 16-lane Bowling Alley
      501,000 square feet of General Retail
      65,000 square feet of High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
      31,000 square feet of Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru Window

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" as defined in
the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the amended program on the adjacent roadways.

Per the site plan, access to the development is now proposed via nine access points
surrounding the site (Figure 2), as follows:
      Access #1 ­ full access along NC 55, at the north end of the project site,
       approximately 2,250 feet north of O'Kelly Chapel Road
      Access #2 ­ right-in/right-out (RIRO) access along NC 55 approximately 1,350 feet
       north of O'Kelly Chapel Road
      Access #3 ­ right-in (RI) only access along NC 55 approximately 600 feet south of
       O'Kelly Chapel Road
      Access #4 ­ RIRO access along O'Kelly Chapel Road approximately 550 feet east of
       NC 55
      Access #5 ­ RI only access along O'Kelly Chapel Road approximately 700 feet east
       of NC 55
      Access #6 ­ full access along O'Kelly Chapel Road approximately 1,200 feet east of
       NC 55
      Access #7 ­ RIRO access with left-over along the north side of O'Kelly Chapel
       Road approximately 1,750 feet east of NC 55
      Access #8 ­ RIRO access along the south side of O'Kelly Chapel Road
       approximately 1,700 feet east of NC 55
      Access #9 ­ RI only access along NC 55 approximately 700 feet north of O'Kelly
       Chapel Road

       O'Kelly Chapel Road and Access #7/Access #8 (future RIRO with left-over)
       NC 55 and Access #9 (future RI Only)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the amended program and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This TAR summarizes trip generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and
traffic analyses for the amended program.

  Traffic volume balancing was applied along NC 55 and Kit Creek Road. The existing peak
  hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

  2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
  Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
  traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
  Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
  vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
  the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
  Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
  ranges.



                                                11
The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities Planning
and Development for Roads (APFO). Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based
on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable for both
signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For signalized intersections, when the
background analysis yields a level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall
intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where
the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the
installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the intersection meets required
warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the
surrounding roadway system.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing scenario analysis
utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the Town of Cary, which are included in
Appendix E. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be
found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, one signalized intersection and one stop-controlled approach are
currently operating at failing levels of service (LOS E or F). Specifically, the signalized NC
55 and Kit Creek Road intersection is operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour, and the
stop-controlled northbound Green Level Church Road at O'Kelly Chapel Road is operating
at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours. The remaining signalized intersections
and unsignalized approaches are operating at acceptable levels of service during both the
AM and PM peak hours.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2016) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) shows steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2009 in the study area. An annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2012) and the build year (2016). In addition, site trips from seven (7) proposed/approved
developments were included in the Background (2016) analysis, as follows:

Pittard Sears (09-TAR-314) ­ This age-restricted residential development is being proposed
along Pittard Sears Road near O'Kelly Chapel Road. The development will include 166 age-
restricted residential units. The project build-out year was scheduled for 2013. A traffic
analysis report (09-TAR-314) was prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to
the Town of Cary in May 2010. Based on TAR-314, the development is projected to
generate 1,692 daily vehicle trips with 85 AM peak hour trips (31 incoming and 54 outgoing)
and 149 PM peak hour trips (82 incoming and 67 outgoing). Site trips from Pittard Sears
were included as depicted in TAR-314 and carried through at the remaining intersections in
the study area. Figure C-1 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the
Pittard Sears development. There is no mitigation committed by this development at any
study intersections in this TAR.

Wake Memorial PDD (10-TAR-320) ­ This residential development is being proposed along
Green Hope School Road west of NC 55. The development will include 62 residential
homes. The project build-out year was scheduled for 2014. A traffic analysis report (10-
TAR-320) was prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary
in November 2010. Based on TAR-320, the development is projected to generate 670 daily
vehicle trips with 53 AM peak hour trips (13 incoming and 40 outgoing) and 68 PM peak
hour trips (43 incoming and 25 outgoing). Site trips from Wake Memorial PDD were
included as depicted in TAR-320 and carried through at the remaining intersections in the
study area. Figure C-2 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Wake
Memorial PDD development. There is no mitigation committed by this development at any
study intersections in this TAR.

Highcroft Village Phases 4 & 5 (11-TAR-323) ­ This residential development is being proposed
along Highcroft Drive between Green Hope School Road and future Morrisville Parkway
Extension west of NC 55. The development will include a total of 230 single family homes
and 62 townhomes. Phase 4 of Highcroft Village was expected to be completed by 2013,
and Phase 5 was expected to be completed by 2015. A traffic analysis report (11-TAR-323)
was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, P.C. and submitted to the Town of Cary in
September 2011. Based on TAR-323, the development is projected to generate a total of
2,783 daily vehicle trips with 216 AM peak hour trips (52 incoming and 164 outgoing) and
278 PM peak hour trips (177 incoming and 101 outgoing). Site trips from Highcroft Village
Phases 4 & 5 were included as depicted in TAR-323 and carried through at the remaining
intersections in the study area. Figure C-3 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour
trips due to the Highcroft Village development. Geometrically, there is no mitigation
committed by this development at any study intersections in this TAR.

Amberly Town Center Townhomes (11-TAR-326A) ­ This residential development is being
proposed south of O'Kelly Chapel Road between Yates Store Road and Green Level Church
Road. The development will include 184 residential homes. The project build-out year was
scheduled for 2013. A traffic analysis report (11-TAR-326A) was prepared by HNTB North
Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in December 2011. Based on TAR-326A,
the development is projected to generate 1,302 daily vehicle trips with 111 AM peak hour
trips (19 incoming and 92 outgoing) and 136 PM peak hour trips (95 incoming and 41
outgoing). Site trips from Amberly Town Center Townhomes were included as depicted in
TAR-326A and carried through at the remaining intersections in the study area. Figure C-4
in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Amberly Town Center
Townhomes development. Geometrically, TAR-326A recommends realigning Green Level
Church Road south of O'Kelly Chapel Road to form a four-leg intersection with the existing
segment north of O'Kelly Chapel Road, providing exclusive turn lanes and installing a traffic
signal at the new four-leg intersection. However, this mitigation has not been committed to
date, therefore the recommended roadway realignment and intersection improvement are
not included in the Background (2016) analysis.

Evans Farm Subdivision ­ This residential development is located between O'Kelly Chapel
Road and Horton's Creek Road east of Green Level Church Road. Phases 1, 2, and 3 of
Evans Farm Subdivision development are currently under construction and consist of a total
of 147 single family homes. A traffic analysis report (05-TAR-167) was prepared for the
entire Evans Farm mixed-use development including a 48,000 square foot shopping center,
101 single family homes, and 48 townhomes. Since TAR-167 was prepared when roadway
geometrics and traffic flow patterns were different from existing conditions, trip generation
for Phases 1, 2, and 3 of Evans Farm Subdivision was conducted based on the
corresponding rates published in Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation, 8th Edition,
and site trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed
distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-5 of Appendix C.

Alston Town Center (11-TAR-332) ­ This mixed-use development is being proposed in the
southwest quadrant of the NC 55/NC 540 interchange. The development will include
355,905 square feet of shopping center, 30,125 square feet of office development, a 150-
room hotel, a 5,255-square foot bank, a 7,398-square foot high turn-over/sit-down
restaurant, a 3,500-square foot fast-food restaurant, a gas station with 16 fueling positions
and convenience store, a 14,708-square foot pharmacy, 37 townhomes and 590 apartment
units.     The most recent traffic analysis report (11-TAR-332) was prepared by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in April 2012. The project
build-out year is scheduled for 2015. Based on TAR-332, the development is projected to
generate 25,435 daily vehicle trips with 1,298 AM peak hour trips (626 entering and 672
exiting) and 2,386 PM peak hour trips (1,233 entering and 1,153 exiting). Site trips from
Alston Town Center were included as depicted in TAR-332 and applied at the remaining
intersections in the study area. Figure C-6 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour
trips due to Alston Town Center.

Geometrically, TAR-332 proposed turn lane and traffic control improvements along O'Kelly
Chapel Road at the NC 55, Alston Avenue, and Green Level Church Road intersections.
However, these mitigations have not been committed by the development; therefore, they
are not included in this TAR.

                                                16
Village at the Park PUD Update (12-TAR-344) ­ This mixed-use development is being
proposed at the southwest corner of the NC 55 and Kit Creek Road intersection. Phase 4A
of the development will consist of a 14-fueling position gas station with convenience store,
and 10,000 square feet of retail or office space. Phase 4B will consist of 12,000 square feet
of general retail, a 56,000-square foot supermarket, a 4,000-square foot restaurant or a 150-
room hotel or 15,000 square feet of retail, and 38,000 square feet of office or retail space.
The most recent traffic analysis report (12-TAR-344) was prepared by Hatch Mott
MacDonald and submitted to the Town of Cary in June 2012. The project build-out year is
scheduled for 2013 for Phase 4A and 2014 for Phase 4B. Based on TAR-344, Phase 4A of
the development is projected to generate 126 AM peak hour trips (67 entering and 59
exiting) and 180 PM peak hour trips (89 entering and 91exiting), and Phase 4B is projected
to generate 577 AM peak hour trips (332 entering and 245 exiting) and 1,363 PM peak hour
trips (684 entering and 679 exiting). Site trips from Village at the Park PUD Update were
included as depicted in TAR-344 and applied at the remaining intersections in the study area.
Figure C-7 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to Village at the Park
PUD Update.

Geometrically, TAR-344 proposed turn lane and traffic control improvements at the NC 55
and Kit Creek Road intersection, the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection, and the
O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road intersections. However, these
mitigations have not been committed by the development; therefore, they are not included
in this TAR.

The total site trips from the approved developments are shown in Figure C-8 in Appendix
C. Traffic volumes due to the combination of ambient traffic growth and site trips from
proposed/approved background developments are shown in Figure C-9 in Appendix C.

3.2 BACKGROUND ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
Two roadway improvement projects, NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) and NC 55
Widening, are planned or currently under construction in the study area.

NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) ­ North Carolina Turnpike Authority is constructing NC 540
(Western Wake Freeway) in the study area. The proposed Western Wake Freeway, identified
in the NCDOT Transportation Improvement Program as Project R-2635, will provide a new
six-lane, controlled access freeway in western Wake County, west of NC 55. Currently, the
project is under construction and is expected to open to traffic in 2012. After completion,
this new roadway is expected to divert a significant portion of existing traffic on NC 55, US
1, I-40, and NC 751, thereby relieving traffic congestion on these routes. For this study,
traffic diversion wais projected using the NCDOT Intersection Analysis Utility (IAU)
Spreadsheets based on the most recent traffic forecast (NC 540 Western Wake
Freeway/Morrisville Parkway Interchange Final Traffic Forecast Technical Memorandum prepared by
HNTB North Carolina, PC, dated May 2011) at the NC 540 and NC 55 interchange with
one exception. The differences between the traffic forecast and the projected traffic
volumes before diversion (Figure C-8) were applied at the remaining NC 55 intersections.
Details of the HNTB traffic forecast and the NCDOT IAU Spreadsheets to convert daily
forecast into peak hour traffic volumes can be found in Appendix D.

                                              17
Regarding the new ramps to be constructed by the NC 540 project, this study assumes that
50% of traffic forecast volumes at the NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp toward northbound
NC 55 and the NC 540 Westbound On-Ramp from southbound NC 55 are traffic diversion
from traffic demand already on NC 55 south of the interchange, and the remaining 50%
traffic forecast volumes are new traffic demand to be added on NC 55 north of the
interchange. At the NC 540 Westbound On-Ramp from northbound NC 55 and the NC
540 Eastbound Off-Ramp toward southbound NC 55, 100% of traffic forecast are
considered new traffic demand and were added to NC 55 south of the interchange. For the
two existing ramps of the NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp toward southbound NC 55 and
the NC 540 Eastbound On-Ramp from northbound NC 55, 100% of the differences
between the traffic forecast and the projected traffic volumes before diversion are assumed
to be traffic diversion from NC 55 south of the interchange.

At the other two existing ramps, traffic forecast at the NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp
toward northbound NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound On-Ramp from southbound NC 55
were significantly lower than existing traffic turning movement counts and previous traffic
forecast. Since traffic diversion due to NC 540 was expected to have a minimal impact at
these two ramps, traffic volumes shown in Figure C-8, which represent a combination of
ambient traffic growth and site trips from background projects, were used for these two
movements.

Figure D-1 in Appendix D depicts the projected traffic diversion due to the expected
completion of NC 540. The method used to projected traffic diversion in this TAR is
consistent with Alston Town Center (11-TAR-332) that was prepared by M/A/B in April
2012.

Geometrically, two new traffic signals will be added along southbound NC 55 at the NC 540
Westbound On-Ramp and NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp. Future roadway geometrics from
traffic signal design documents obtained from the Town of Cary were assumed in the
Background (2016) conditions at the two new signalized intersections.

NC 55 Widening ­ the Town of Cary is planning to widen southbound NC 55 from the
Wake/Durham County line to NC 540 interchange to add a third southbound through lane.
The project is programmed to complete by the spring of 2013. This additional lane was
included in the Background (2016) conditions at the three affected intersections along NC
55. In addition, Wake County Public Schools System (WCPSS) plans to widen northbound
NC 55 through the NC 540 Interchange to add a third northbound through lane. The
widening will change intersection geometrics along northbound NC 55 at the NC 540
Eastbound On-Ramp and NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp. Future roadway geometrics at
these two intersections were based on the 100% Plans (October 2011) recently approved by
the Town of Cary.

Additionally, the Town of Cary has plans to extend Louis Stephens Drive from the current
terminus at Little Drive southward to connect to Old Maynard Road in Morrisville.
However, the project is not currently funded. Therefore, the roadway improvement was not
included in this TAR.


                                            18
The resulting Background (2016) volumes with NC 540 traffic diversion are shown in Figure
5 and are used in the Background (2016) analyses.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. A summary of the findings for the
Background (2016) scenario LOS analyses can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS
output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2016) analysis, the signalized NC 55 and Kit Creek Road
intersection and the stop-controlled northbound Green Level Church Road at O'Kelly
Chapel Road are projected to continue operating at failing levels of service as in the Existing
(2012) conditions with delay increases and levels of service decline. Besides, one additional
signalized intersection and two additional stop-controlled approaches along O'Kelly Chapel
Road are projected to decline to failing levels of service. Specifically, the NC 55 and O'Kelly
Chapel Road intersection is projected to decline from LOS D to LOS E in the PM peak
hour, and both southbound Alston Avenue and southbound Green Level Church Road at
O'Kelly Chapel Road are projected to degrade to operate at LOS F during both the AM and
PM peak hours. The remaining signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are
projected to remain operating at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM
peak hours.

4.0 BUILD (2016) ANALYSIS
The Town of Cary has received a request to provide an amendment to Parkside Town
Commons, a mixed-use development in the northeast quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540
interchange in western Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is projected to be completed
by 2016.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The proposed Parkside Town Commons development is to consist of the following land
uses.
       300 Apartments
       One (1) 140-room Hotels
       One (1) 12-screen Movie Theater
       One (1) 16-lane Bowling Alley
       501,000 square feet of Retail
       65,000 square feet of High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant
       31,000 square feet of Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru Window

The project site will be divided into two distinct portions by the future O'Kelly Chapel Road
extension; therefore, trip generation was conducted for the northern and southern parcels
separately. Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding
trip generation code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. Since the ITE manual does
not include AM peak hour rates for Multiplex Movie Theater (LUC 445), AM peak hour
trips for the proposed movie theater were projected based on the PM peak hour trips and an
AM/PM ratio derived from three other movie theater uses. Internal capture between
different types of land uses and pass-by trips for commercial uses were calculated based on
standard ITE procedures and NCDOT guidance.

Table 5 and Table 6 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the northern and southern
parcels of the amended program for typical weekday AM and PM peak hours, respectively.
In total, the amended program is projected to generate 53,933 external daily trips with 3,101
trips occurring in the AM peak hour (1,607 entering, 1,494 exiting) and 4,472 trips occurring
in the PM peak hour trips (2,312 entering, 2,160 exiting).

Site trips due to the northern and southern parcels of the amended program were projected
separately based on their proposed land uses and access layout. The trip distribution
percentages for residential site trips in the northern parcels are depicted in Figure 6, and the
resulting northern parcel residential site trips are shown in Figure 7. For the proposed
commercial uses in the northern parcels, non-pass-by site trip distribution percentages are
depicted in Figure 8 with the resulting non-pass-by site trips shown in Figure 9, while the
pass-by site trip distribution percentages are depicted in Figure 10 with the resulting pass-by
site trips shown in Figure 11. The total site trips due to the northern parcels of the amended
program are shown in Figure 12.

The southern parcels of the amended program consist of commercial uses only. Figure 13
depicts the projected non-pass-by site trip distribution percentages, Figure 14 depicts the
resulting non-pass-by commercial site trips, Figure 15 depicts the projected pass-by site trip
distribution percentages, and Figure 16 depicts the resulting pass-by site trips. The total site
trips due to the southern parcels of the amended program are shown in Figure 17.

The total site trips due to the entire development are shown in Figure 18.

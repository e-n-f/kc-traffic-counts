EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
American Asset Corporation has proposed a mixed-use retail development in the southwest
quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp intersection in northwest Cary,
NC (Figure 1). The development is projected to be completed by 2015 and consists of the
following land uses:
     Shopping Center ­ 355,905 square feet
     Office ­ 30,125 square feet
     Townhomes ­ 37 units
     Hotel ­ 150 rooms
     Bank ­ 5,255 square feet
     High Turn-Over/Sit Down Restaurant ­ 7,398 square feet
     Fast Food Restaurant ­ 3,500 square feet
     Gas Station with Convenience Store ­ 16 fuel pumps
     Pharmacy ­ 14,708 square feet
     Apartments ­ 590 units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined
in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Per the site plan, access to the development is proposed via six access points surrounding
the site (Figure 2), as follows:
     Access #1 (Amica Drive): right-in access driveway along NC 55 approximately 850
         feet south of the future NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp.
     Access #2 (Mahal Drive): full access driveway long NC 55 approximately 1,600 feet
         south of the future NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp, aligned across Petty Farm Road.
     Access #3 (Southern Drive): right-in/right-out access driveway along NC 55,
         approximately 2,600 feet south of the future NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp. This
         access, as shown on the site plan, is approved as a right-in/right-out only driveway.
         Due to the request of the developer, a northbound direction left-over will be
         assumed in the analysis and the southbound queuing along NC 55 will be evaluated.
     Access #4 (Amica Drive): full access driveway along the future Highcroft Drive
         Extension.
     Access #5 (Mahal Drive/Lot 12 Primary Access): full access driveway along the
         future Highcroft Drive Extension.
     Lot 12 Secondary Access: full access driveway along the future High Drive
         Extension, exact location not known at this time.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road ­ signalized
       Northbound NC 55 and NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp ­ signalized

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2012), Background (2015), Build
(2015), Build (2015), and a Build (2015) with Improvements scenario. The Existing (2012)
scenario includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data
collected in March 2012. The Background (2015) scenario includes existing traffic with
projected annual growth, as well as projected traffic from six approved developments in the
vicinity. The Build (2015) scenario includes Background (2015) volumes with the addition of
net new site trips generated by the proposed redevelopment. Additionally, future conditions
with the proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a Build (2015) with
Improvements scenario.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. For the signalized intersections, traffic signal plans and timings
were obtained from Town of Cary staff.

As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page x, two signalized intersections
and one stop-controlled approach along NC 55 are currently operating at failing levels of
service (LOS E or F). Specifically, the signalized NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road is
operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours, the signalized NC 55 and
Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road is operating at LOS F in the AM peak hour,
and the stop-controlled Petty Farm Road is operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM
peak hours. In addition, the northbound approach of Green Level Church Road at O'Kelly
Chapel Road is operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours with stop

                                             ii
control.

Background (2015) Conditions
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2009 in the study area. An annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2012) and the build year (2015). In addition, site traffic from six proposed/approved
developments in the vicinity of study area was aggregated and included in the analysis.

NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) is currently under construction and to be completed in
2012. Traffic diversion from NC 55 to the future NC 540 was projected based on the most
recent traffic forecast (prepared by HNTB, dated May 2011) at the NC 540/NC 55
interchange and then applied along NC 55. Compared to the projected traffic diversion
included in the Highcroft Village Phases 4 & 5 (11-TAR-323) study (prepared by M/A/B,
first drafted in January 2011), which was based on previous forecasts included in TIP No. U-
4763, Triangle Parkway (prepared by M/A/B, dated March 2007) along NC 55 near Green
Hope School Road, the projected diversion in the peak direction of travel increased due to
the new forecast, while diversion against the peak direction of travel remained about the
same as in 11-TAR-323. Note that the HNTB forecasts between the north leg of NC 55
and the east leg of NC 540 was significantly lower than previous forecasts and the existing
traffic counts. Therefore, traffic projections based on ambient traffic growth and
background projects were used since the diversion due to NC 540 was projected to be
minimal for this pair of traffic movements.

Geometrically, the completion of NC 540 project will add two new signals along
southbound NC 55 at the NC 540 and NC 55 interchange. The Town of Cary has approved
plans to widen northbound NC 55 at the NC 540 interchange to add a third through lane
through the interchange. In addition, the proposed Parkside Town Commons plans to
extend O'Kelly Chapel Road eastward from NC 55 to Louis Stephens Road with a four-lane
divided cross-section, resulting in a four-leg intersection with exclusive turn lanes on the new
approach. Roadway widening along NC 55 was planned and a third northbound through
lane along NC 55 was assumed to be completed by Parkside Town Commons as well as an
exclusive northbound right-turn lane at the revised NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersection. Lastly, Highcroft Village has committed funding for the construction of an
exclusive right-turn lane on the eastbound approach of Carpenter Fire Station Road at NC
55.

Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the signalized NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersection is projected to decline to operate at LOS D in the AM peak hour and LOS F in
the PM peak hour despite the assumed geometric improvements by Parkside Town
Commons. The stop-controlled Petty Farm Road at NC 55 is projected to operate at LOS F
during both the AM and PM peak hours with increased traffic delay. Three unsignalized
intersections along O'Kelly Chapel Road are projected to experience LOS decline and/or
traffic delay increases primarily due to site traffic from the proposed/approved
developments. As a result, the stop-controlled southbound approach of Alston Avenue is
projected to decline to operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak
hour, the southbound approach of Green Level Church Road is projected to degrade to

                                               iii
operate at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours, and the northbound approach of
Green Level Church Road is projected to remain operating at LOS F during both the AM
and PM peak hours with worse traffic delay. The remaining signalized intersections and
unsignalized approaches are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during the
AM and PM peak hours as well.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed Alston Town Center development is to consist of the following land uses.
    Shopping Center ­ 355,905 square feet
    Office ­ 30,125 square feet
    Townhomes ­ 37 units
    Hotel ­ 150 rooms
    Bank ­ 5,255 square feet
    High Turn-Over/Sit Down Restaurant ­ 7,398 square feet
    Fast Food Restaurant ­ 3,500 square feet
    Gas Station with Convenience Store ­ 16 fuel pumps
    Pharmacy ­ 14,708 square feet
    Apartments ­ 590 units

Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. Internal capture between land uses and
pass-by trips for commercial uses were calculated based on standard ITE procedures and
NCDOT guidance.

In total, the proposed development is projected to generate 25,435 external daily trips with
1,298 trips occurring in the AM peak hour (626 entering, 672 exiting) and 2,386 trips
occurring in the PM peak hour trips (1,233 entering, 1,153 exiting).

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing and future traffic patterns
and surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build (2015) Conditions
The Build (2015) conditions account for both the Background (2015) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. Geometrically, the site plan proposes to add
a third southbound through lane along NC 55 from the NC 540 interchange to McCrimmon
Parkway. Exclusive turn lanes are also planned at Accesses #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5, and a
new traffic signal is proposed to be installed on NC 55 at Access #2 (Mahal Drive)/Petty
Farm Road.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page x, the addition of site trips will incur delay
increases at intersections across the study area, causing two more intersections to operate at
failing levels of service. Specifically, the signalized NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
intersection is project to decline to operate at LOS E during both the AM and PM peak
hours, and the stop-controlled Highcroft Drive at McCrimmon Parkway is projected to
decline to operate at LOS F on both the northbound and southbound approaches during


                                              iv
both the AM and PM peak hours. The intersection of NC 55 and Petty Farm Road/Mahal
Drive (Site Access #2) is projected to improve to operate at LOS B or C during both the
AM and PM peak hours with the turn lane improvements and signalization. The NC 55 and
O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection is projected to remain operating at LOS F in the PM peak
hour with a delay increase of 32.2 seconds per vehicle. The three stop-controlled
approaches along O'Kelly Chapel Road are projected to remain operating at failing levels
service with various degrees of delay increases. All the planned stop-controlled site accesses
along NC 55 and Highcroft Drive Extension are projected to operate at LOS B or better
during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have considerable impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections
within the study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the
Town of Cary's Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) and NCDOT requirements:
Frontage Widening along NC 55
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). The proposed redevelopment has frontage along NC 55. For
the section of NC 55 in front of the development, the CTP dictates a six-lane major arterial
cross-section with four 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside travel lanes, a
landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 124 feet of right-of-way.
Therefore, the following improvements are required to meet the CTP standards:
       Widen the section of southbound NC 55 along the property frontage to achieve half
       of the ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP;
       Stripe the section of southbound NC 55 to provide a third through lane between NC
       540 interchange and McCrimmon Parkway that ends as an exclusive right-turn lane
       at McCrimmon Parkway.

Mahal Drive
The site plan proposes to build Mahal Drive as an east-west collector avenue across the
project site to be consistent with the Town of Cary Northwest Area Plan. Traffic analysis
indicates potential vehicle queuing of approximately 400 feet in the PM peak hour on the
eastbound approach of Mahal Drive at NC 55. Therefore, the following are recommended
to meet the CTP standards for a collector avenue and to improve traffic operations and
safety:
     Remove on-street parking along Mahal Drive shown on the current site plan;
     Restrict drive access along Mahal Drive between NC 55 and Highcroft Drive
        Extension to allow for one full access point only;
     Increase the spacing between NC 55 and the first full access point along Mahal Drive
        to at least 500 feet to avoid possible queuing from the NC 55 signalized intersection.

Highcroft Drive Extension
The site plan proposes to build a north-south collector avenue (Highcroft Drive Extension)
across the project site to be consistent with the Town of Cary Northwest Area Plan.
Therefore, the following are recommended to meet the CTP standards:

                                              v
        Construct the section of Highcroft Drive Extension with a three-lane cross-section
        between McCrimmon Parkway and the property line near the future NC 540
        underpass. Exclusive turn lanes should be provided at site accesses and at the
        McCrimmon Parkway intersection.

NC 55 and Site Access #1 (Amica Drive) (future right-in only)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #1 (Amica Drive) as a right-in only driveway.
Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate acceptably with the planned lane
geometrics. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configuration are
recommended for traffic operations and safety:
     Construct Site Access #1 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane;
     Widen the southbound approach of NC 55 to provide a continuous right-turn lane
        dropping into Site Access #1.

NC 55 and Petty Farm Road/Site Access #2 (Mahal Drive) (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #2 (Mahal Drive) as the primary site access
point under traffic signal control. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate at
acceptable levels of service with the planned lane geometrics and traffic control. Therefore,
the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to
improve traffic operations and safety:
     Construct Site Access #2 at the planned location to consist of two inbound lanes
        and four outbound lanes including one through lane, one exclusive right-turn lane
        with at least 200 feet of storage length, and two exclusive left-turn lanes with one
        extending back to the first full access driveway and the other with at least 350 feet of
        storage length;
     Widen the southbound approach of NC 55 to provide an exclusive right-turn lane
        with at least 200 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
     Widen the northbound approach of NC 55 to provide a second exclusive left-turn
        lane with at least 250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
     Install a traffic signal at this intersection and provide coordination with the existing
        McCrimmon Parkway and NC 540 interchange signals.

NC 55 and Site Access #3 (future right-in/right-out with left-over)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #3 as a right-in/right-out driveway with a
left-over. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate acceptably with the
planned lane geometrics, and there is no queuing issue from the McCrimmon Parkway
intersection. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations
are recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
      Construct Site Access #3 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and
        one outbound lane;
      Widen the southbound approach of NC 55 to provide an exclusive right-turn lane
        with at least 250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
      Construct the planned northbound left-over with at least 250 feet of storage length
        and appropriate taper.




                                                vi
Highcroft Drive Extension and Site Access #4 (Amica Drive) (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #4 (Amica Drive) as a full access driveway
on Highcroft Drive Extension. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate
acceptably with the planned lane geometrics.                Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configurations are recommended for traffic operations and
safety:
     Construct Site Access #4 (Amica Drive) at the planned location to consist of one
        inbound lane and one outbound lane;
     Widen the southbound approach of Highcroft Drive Extension to provide an
        exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

Highcroft Drive Extension and Site Access #5 (Mahal Drive)/Lot 12 Main Access (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #5 (Mahal Drive) and Lot 12 Main Access as
two opposing full access driveways on Highcroft Drive Extension. Traffic analyses indicate
that this site access will operate acceptably with the planned lane geometrics. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are recommended for traffic
operations and safety:
     Construct Site Access #5 (Mahal Drive) at the planned location to consist of one
         inbound lane and two outbound lanes including a shared through/right-turn lane
         and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length;
     Construct Lot 12 Main Access at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane
         and two outbound lanes including a shared through/right-turn lane and an exclusive
         left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length;
     Widen the southbound approach of Highcroft Drive Extension to provide an
         exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
     Widen the northbound approach of Highcroft Drive Extension to provide an
         exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper
         and an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 75 feet of storage length and
         appropriate taper.

Highcroft Drive Extension and Lot 12 Secondary Access (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Lot 12 Secondary Access as a full access driveway on
Highcroft Drive Extension. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate
acceptably with the planned lane geometrics.                 Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve traffic operations
and safety:
     Construct Lot 12 Secondary Access at the planned location to consist of one
        inbound lane and one outbound lane;
     Widen the northbound approach of Highcroft Drive Extension to provide an
        exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

Highcroft Drive and McCrimmon Parkway (future unsignalized)
Lane geometrics shown on 06-SP-064 were included in the Build (2015) analysis, and traffic
analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service with two
approaching lanes on both the northbound and southbound approaches. Traffic volumes at
this intersection do not warrant installation of a traffic signal. Therefore, the following


                                                vii
roadway improvements are recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
     Construct Highcroft Drive Extension with a standard collector avenue cross-section
      between McCrimmon Parkway and the project site;
     Widen the southbound approach of Highcroft Drive Extension to provide a through
      lane, a right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper,
      and a left-turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will decline to operate at failing levels of
service with the addition of site traffic. Therefore, in addition to the exclusive right-turn lane
on the eastbound approach that has been included in the Background (2015) conditions, the
following improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
APFO requirements:
     Widen the westbound approach of Carpenter Fire Station Road to provide an
        exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of full storage length.
     Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate the new turn lane.

Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Under Existing conditions, the Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersections consist of two T-intersections spaced at approximately 250 feet from each
other. Realigning the two T-intersections to form a new four-leg intersection is shown in
the Town of Cary Northwest Area Plan. The necessity of the roadway re-alignment has
been identified in several traffic studies in the area, the last being the Amberly Town Center
Townhomes Phases 1 & 2 (11-TAR-326A), which has submitted plans to realign this
intersection. However, to date the re-alignment has not been funded.

Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, both the northbound and the
southbound approaches of Green Level Church Road are projected to operate at LOS F
with increased traffic delay compared to Background (2015) conditions. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements have been recommended in 11-TAR-326A and are
recommended in this study to meet the APFO requirements if they are not committed by
the Amberly Town Center Townhomes before this project commences:
     Realign the south leg of Green Level Church Road to intersect O'Kelly Chapel Road
        directly across from the existing north leg of Green Level Church Road. The
        realigned northbound approach should consist of two approaching lanes with a
        shared through/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 200 feet
        of storage length and appropriate taper;
     Restripe the southbound approach of Green Level Church Road to include a
        through lane, an exclusive right-turn lane, and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least
        250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
     Widen the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide an exclusive left-
        turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
     Widen the westbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide an exclusive left-
        turn lane with at least 350 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
     Conduct a signal warrant analysis and install a three-phase traffic signal when
        warranted at this location.


                                               viii
The following additional roadway improvements are recommended to improve traffic
operations and safety:
    Widen the realigned northbound approach to provide a right-turn lane with at least
        250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Alston Avenue (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service with
increases in traffic delay compared to the Background (2015) conditions. Traffic volumes at
this intersection do not warrant installation of a traffic signal. Therefore, the following
roadway improvements are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve
traffic operations and safety:
     Restripe the southbound approach of Alston Avenue to provide a shared
         through/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of
         storage length.

In the long term, restricting driveway access at this intersection should be considered when
O'Kelly Chapel Road is widened to a four-lane median divided facility.

NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road (signalized)
This intersection is a T-intersection operating at acceptable levels of service under Existing
conditions. Under the Background (2015) conditions, the proposed Parkside Town
Commons will significantly change lane geometrics and traffic flow patterns at this
intersection by extending O'Kelly Chapel Road eastward from NC 55 to Louis Stephens
Drive. Despite the uncertainties in developing Parkside Town Commons, it is assumed in
this TAR that Parkside Town Commons will at a minimum construct a third northbound
through lane along NC 55 with an exclusive right-turn lane at the O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersection, build the segment of O'Kelly Chapel Road to a standard four-lane divided
cross-section with dual westbound left-turn lanes at NC 55, and widen the eastbound
approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide separate through, left-turn, and right-turn lanes.
With these assumed lane geometrics, traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will
operate at LOS D in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. The addition of
site traffic will result in maintaining a LOS F in the PM peak hour with 32.2 seconds per
vehicle delay increase. Therefore, the following roadway improvements are recommended
to meet the APFO requirements and to improve traffic operations and safety:
      Widen northbound NC 55 to provide for a second exclusive left-turn lane with at
         least 275 feet of storage length and appropriate taper. This improvement also
         requires widening of the west leg of O'Kelly Chapel Road to provide a second
         receiving lane with at least 1,000 feet of full-width length and appropriate taper.
      Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate the new turn left-turn lane.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2015) and Build (2015) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
American Asset Corporation has proposed a mixed-use retail development in the southwest
quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp intersection in northwest Cary,
NC (Figure 1). The development is projected to be completed by 2015 and consists of the
following land uses:
     Shopping Center ­ 355,905 square feet
     Office ­ 30,125 square feet
     Townhomes ­ 37 units
     Hotel ­ 150 rooms
     Bank ­ 5,255 square feet
     High Turn-Over/Sit Down Restaurant ­ 7,398 square feet
     Fast Food Restaurant ­ 3,500 square feet
     Gas Station with Convenience Store ­ 16 fuel pumps
     Pharmacy ­ 14,708 square feet
     Apartments ­ 590 units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined
in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Per the site plan, access to the development is proposed via six access points surrounding
the site (Figure 2), as follows:
     Access #1 (Amica Drive): right-in access driveway along NC 55 approximately 850
         feet south of the future NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp.
     Access #2 (Mahal Drive): full access driveway long NC 55 approximately 1,600 feet
         south of the future NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp, aligned across Petty Farm Road.
     Access #3 (Southern Drive): right-in/right-out access driveway along NC 55,
         approximately 2,600 feet south of the future NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp. This
         access, as shown on the site plan, is approved as a right-in/right-out only driveway.
         Due to the request of the developer, a northbound direction left-over will be
         assumed in the analysis and the southbound queuing along NC 55 will be evaluated.
     Access #4 (Amica Drive): full access driveway along the future Highcroft Drive
         Extension.
     Access #5 (Mahal Drive/Lot 12 Primary Access): full access driveway along the
         future Highcroft Drive Extension.
     Lot 12 Secondary Access: full access driveway along the future High Drive
         Extension, exact location not known at this time.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road ­ signalized
       Northbound NC 55 and NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp ­ signalized
       Northbound NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound On-Ramp ­ signalized

  Traffic volume balancing was applied along NC 55 and McCrimmon Parkway. The existing
  peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities Planning
and Development for Roads (APFR). Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based
on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable for both
signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For signalized intersections, when the
background analysis yields a level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall
intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where
the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the
installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the intersection meets required
warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the
surrounding roadway system.

          A               Little or no delay           <= 10 sec.            <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.             10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay         20-35 sec.             15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay           35-55 sec.             25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.             35-50 sec.
          F              Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.              > 50 sec.


2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing scenario analysis
utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the Town of Cary, which are included in
Appendix D. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be
found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, two signalized intersections and one stop-controlled approach along
NC 55 are currently operating at failing levels of service (LOS E or F). Specifically, the
signalized NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road is operating at LOS F during both the
AM and PM peak hours, the signalized NC 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells
Road is operating at LOS F in the AM peak hour, and the stop-controlled Petty Farm Road

                                                 14
is operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours. In addition, the northbound
approach of Green Level Church Road at O'Kelly Chapel Road is operating at LOS F
during both the AM and PM peak hours with a stop control.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2015) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) shows steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2009 in the study area. An annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2012) and the build year (2015). In addition, site trips from six (6) proposed/approved
developments were included in the Background (2015) analysis, as follows:

Parkside Town Commons (07-TAR-225) ­ This mixed-use development is being proposed in
the northeast quadrant of the NC 55/NC 540 interchange. The development will include
740,000 square feet of shopping center, 230,000 square feet of office development, and 450
residential units. A traffic analysis report (07-TAR-225) was prepared by SEPI Engineering
Group, Inc. and submitted to the Town of Cary in December 2006. The project build-out
year was originally scheduled for 2009. However, to date no construction has taken place.
Based on TAR-225, the development is projected to generate 30,372 daily vehicle trips with
1,112 AM peak hour trips (682 incoming and 430 outgoing) and 2,952 PM peak hour trips
(1,360 incoming and 1,492 outgoing). Site trips from Parkside Town Commons were
included as depicted in TAR-225 and carried through at the remaining intersections in the
study area. Figure C-1 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to Parkside
Town Commons.

Geometrically, TAR-225 assumed O'Kelly Chapel Road to be extended by the Town of Cary
O'Kelly Chapel Road Widening project, and the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersection to consist of two through lanes, an exclusive left-turn lane, and an exclusive
right-turn lane on all four approaches. In addition, TAR-225 recommends adding a third
northbound through lane along NC 55 across the property frontage to meet the CTP
requirement, and adding a second exclusive left-turn lane on three out of four approaches.
Due to the uncertainty in the O'Kelly Chapel Road Widening and Parkside Town Commons
projects, however, only the minimum geometrics at the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersection with developing the Parkside Town Commons are assumed in this TAR. These
assumed geometrics include:
     Construct O'Kelly Chapel Road extension as a four-lane divided roadway to become
        the fourth leg of the NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection;
     Construct a third northbound through lane along NC 55 across the property
        frontage;
     Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane along NC 55 at O'Kelly Chapel
        Road;
     Construct two exclusive left-turn lanes on the westbound approach of O'Kelly
        Chapel Road at NC 55;
     Widen the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to add an exclusive through
        lane at NC 55.

Pittard Sears (09-TAR-314) ­ This age-restricted residential development is being proposed
along Pittard Sears Road near O'Kelly Chapel Road. The development will include 166 age-
restricted residential units. The project build-out year was scheduled for 2013. A traffic


                                            18
analysis report (09-TAR-314) was prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to
the Town of Cary in May 2010. Based on TAR-314, the development is projected to
generate 1,692 daily vehicle trips with 85 AM peak hour trips (31 incoming and 54 outgoing)
and 149 PM peak hour trips (82 incoming and 67 outgoing). Site trips from Pittard Sears
were included as depicted in TAR-314 and carried through at the remaining intersections in
the study area. Figure C-2 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the
Pittard Sears development. There is no mitigation committed by this development at any
study intersections in this TAR.

Wake Memorial PDD (10-TAR-320) ­ This residential development is being proposed along
Green Hope School Road west of NC 55. The development will include 62 residential
homes. The project build-out year was scheduled for 2014. A traffic analysis report (10-
TAR-320) was prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary
in November 2010. Based on TAR-320, the development is projected to generate 670 daily
vehicle trips with 53 AM peak hour trips (13 incoming and 40 outgoing) and 68 PM peak
hour trips (43 incoming and 25 outgoing). Site trips from Wake Memorial PDD were
included as depicted in TAR-320 and carried through at the remaining intersections in the
study area. Figure C-3 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Wake
Memorial PDD development. There is no mitigation committed by this development at any
study intersections in this TAR.

Highcroft Village Phases 4 & 5 (11-TAR-323) ­ This residential development is being proposed
along Highcroft Drive between Green Hope School Road and future Morrisville Parkway
Extension west of NC 55. The development will include a total of 230 single family homes
and 62 townhomes. Phase 4 of Highcroft Village was expected to be completed by 2013,
and Phase 5 was expected to be completed by 2015. A traffic analysis report (11-TAR-323)
was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, P.C. and submitted to the Town of Cary in
September 2011. Based on TAR-323, the development is projected to generate a total of
2,783 daily vehicle trips with 216 AM peak hour trips (52 incoming and 164 outgoing) and
278 PM peak hour trips (177 incoming and 101 outgoing). Site trips from Highcroft Village
Phases 4 & 5 were included as depicted in TAR-323 and carried through at the remaining
intersections in the study area. Figure C-4 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour
trips due to the Highcroft Village development. Geometrically, TAR-323 recommends
constructing an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane on Carpenter Fire Station Road at NC 55
to meet the Town of Cary APFO standards. This mitigation has been financially committed;
therefore, the recommended right-turn lane improvement was included in the Background
(2015) analysis.

Amberly Town Center Townhomes (11-TAR-326A) ­ This residential development is being
proposed south of O'Kelly Chapel Road between Yates Store Road and Green Level Church
Road. The development will include 184 residential homes. The project build-out year was
scheduled for 2013. A traffic analysis report (11-TAR-326A) was prepared by HNTB North
Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in December 2011. Based on TAR-326A,
the development is projected to generate 1,302 daily vehicle trips with 111 AM peak hour
trips (19 incoming and 92 outgoing) and 136 PM peak hour trips (95 incoming and 41
outgoing). Site trips from Amberly Town Center Townhomes were included as depicted in
TAR-326A and carried through at the remaining intersections in the study area. Figure C-5
in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Amberly Town Center

                                            19
Townhomes development. Geometrically, TAR-326A recommends realigning Green Level
Church Road south of O'Kelly Chapel Road to form a four-leg intersection with the existing
segment north of O'Kelly Chapel Road, providing exclusive turn lanes and installing a traffic
signal at the new four-leg intersection. However, this mitigation has not been committed to
date, therefore the recommended roadway realignment and intersection improvement are
not included in the Background (2015) analysis.

Evans Farm Subdivision ­ This residential development is located between O'Kelly Chapel
Road and Horton's Creek Road east of Green Level Church Road. Phases 1, 2, and 3 of
Evans Farm Subdivision development are currently under construction and consist of a total
of 147 single family homes. A traffic analysis report (05-TAR-167) was prepared for the
entire Evans Farm mixed-use development including a 48,000 square foot shopping center,
101 single family homes, and 48 townhomes. Since TAR-167 was prepared when roadway
geometrics and traffic flow patterns were different from existing conditions, trip generation
for Phases 1, 2, and 3 of Evans Farm Subdivision was conducted based on the
corresponding rates published in Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation, 8th Edition,
and site trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed
distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-6 of Appendix C.

The total site trips from the approved developments are shown in Figure C-7 in Appendix
C. Traffic volumes due to the combination of ambient traffic growth and site trips from
proposed/approved background developments are shown in Figure C-8 in Appendix C.

3.2 BACKGROUND ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
Two roadway improvement projects, NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) and NC 55
Widening, are planned or currently under construction in the study area.

NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) ­ North Carolina Turnpike Authority is constructing NC 540
(Western Wake Freeway) in the study area. The proposed Western Wake Freeway, identified
in the NCDOT Transportation Improvement Program as Project R-2635, will provide a new
six-lane, controlled access freeway in western Wake County, west of NC 55. Currently, the
project is under construction and is expected to open to traffic in 2012. After completion,
this new roadway is expected to divert a significant portion of existing traffic on NC 55, US
1, I-40, and NC 751, thereby relieving traffic congestion on these routes. For this study,
traffic diversion wais projected using the NCDOT Intersection Analysis Utility (IAU)
Spreadsheets based on the most recent traffic forecast (NC 540 Western Wake
Freeway/Morrisville Parkway Interchange Final Traffic Forecast Technical Memorandum prepared by
HNTB North Carolina, PC, dated May 2011) at the NC 540 and NC 55 interchange with
one exception. The differences between the traffic forecasts and the projected traffic
volumes before diversion (Figure C-8) were applied at the remaining NC 55 intersections.
Details of the HNTB traffic forecasts and the NCDOT IAU Spreadsheets to convert daily
forecasts into peak hour traffic volumes can be found in Appendix D.

Regarding the new ramps to be constructed by the NC 540 project, this study assumes that
50% of traffic forecast volumes at the NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp toward northbound
NC 55 and the NC 540 Westbound On-Ramp from southbound NC 55 are traffic diversion
from traffic demand already on NC 55 south of the interchange, and the remaining 50%

                                                20
traffic forecast volumes are new traffic demand to be added on NC 55 north of the
interchange. At the NC 540 Westbound On-Ramp from northbound NC 55 and the NC
540 Eastbound Off-Ramp toward southbound NC 55, 100% of traffic forecast are
considered new traffic demand and were added to NC 55 south of the interchange. For the
two existing ramps of the NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp toward southbound NC 55 and
the NC 540 Eastbound On-Ramp from northbound NC 55, 100% of the differences
between the traffic forecasts and the projected traffic volumes before diversion are assumed
to be traffic diversion from NC 55 south of the interchange.

At the other two existing ramps, traffic forecasts at the NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp
toward northbound NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound On-Ramp from southbound NC 55
were significantly lower than existing traffic turning movement counts and previous traffic
forecasts. Since traffic diversion due to NC 540 was projected to have a minimal impact on
these two movements, traffic volumes shown in Figure C-8, which represent a combination
of ambient traffic growth and site trips from background projects, were used for these two
movements.

C-9 in Appendix C depicts the projected traffic diversion due to the expected completion of
NC 540. Compared to the projected traffic diversion included in the Highcroft Village
Phases 4 & 5 (11-TAR-323) study (prepared by M/A/B, first drafted in January 2011), which
was based on previous forecasts included in TIP No. U-4763, Triangle Parkway (prepared by
M/A/B, dated March 2007) along NC 55 near Green Hope School Road, the projected
diversion in the peak direction of travel increased with the new forecasts along NC 55 south
of the NC 540 interchange, while diversion against the peak direction of travel is about the
same as included in 11-TAR-323.

Geometrically, two new traffic signals will be added along southbound NC 55 at the NC 540
Westbound On-Ramp and NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp. Future roadway geometrics from
traffic signal design documents obtained from the Town of Cary were assumed in the
Background (2015) conditions at the two new signalized intersections.

NC 55 Widening (03-SP-104-C) ­ Wake County Public Schools System (WCPSS) plans to
widen northbound NC 55 through the NC 540 Interchange to add a third northbound
through lane. The widening will change intersection geometrics along northbound NC 55 at
the NC 540 Eastbound On-Ramp and NC 540 Westbound Off-Ramp. Future roadway
geometrics at these two intersections were based on the 100% Plans (October 2011) recently
approved by the Town of Cary.

The resulting Background (2015) volumes with NC 540 traffic diversion are shown in Figure
6 and are used in the Background (2015) analyses.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. A summary of the findings for the
Background (2015) scenario LOS analyses can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS
output can be found in Appendix B.


                                             21
Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the signalized NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road
intersection is projected to decline to operate at LOS D in the AM peak hour and LOS F in
the PM peak hour despite the assumed geometric improvements by Parkside Town
Commons. The stop-controlled Petty Farm Road at NC 55 is projected to operate at LOS F
during both the AM and PM peak hours with increased traffic delay. Three unsignalized
intersections along O'Kelly Chapel Road are projected to experience LOS decline and/or
traffic delay increases primarily due to site traffic from the proposed/approved
developments. As a result, the stop-controlled southbound approach of Alston Avenue is
projected to decline to operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak
hour, the southbound approach of Green Level Church Road is projected to degrade to
operate at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours, and the northbound approach of
Green Level Church Road is projected to remain operating at LOS F during both the AM
and PM peak hours with worse traffic delay. The remaining signalized intersections and
unsignalized approaches are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during the
AM and PM peak hours as well.

    Fast Food Restaurant ­ 3,500 square feet
    Gas Station with Convenience Store ­ 16 fuel pumps
    Pharmacy ­ 14,708 square feet

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. Internal capture between land uses and
pass-by trips for commercial uses were calculated based on the standard ITE procedure and
NCDOT guidance.

In total, the proposed development is projected to generate 25,435 external daily trips with
1,298 trips occurring in the AM peak hour (626 entering, 672 exiting) and 2,386 trips
occurring in the PM peak hour trips (1,233 entering, 1,153 exiting).

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

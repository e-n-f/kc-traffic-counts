EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
A new office building is proposed to be constructed on the north side of SAS Campus
Drive, just east of the existing Building T, on the SAS Campus in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development consists of a 220,004-square foot office building (Building Q) and is projected
to be completed by 2014.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The Site Plan (Figure 2) proposes two new full access driveways along SAS Campus Drive:
    Site Access #1: approximately 450 feet east of the Building T driveway
    Site Access #2: across from the Building C driveway, approximately 1,050 feet east
        of Site Access #1

In addition, a connection will be made between the parking lots of Building T and Building
Q. Hence, the existing Building T driveway will become a shared access point to the project
site.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       N. Harrison Avenue and SAS Campus Drive (signalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Research Drive/Building V Driveway (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Building T Driveway (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Building C Driveway/Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Trenton Road (unsignalized)
       Trenton Road and Trinity Road (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)

Turning movement counts were also collected at the N. Harrison Avenue and Research
Drive intersection. Since the site trips due to Building Q are projected not to exceed seven
percent (7%) of traffic volumes on any approach, traffic operational analysis is not required
at this intersection based on the Town of Cary LDO.

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2011), Background (2014), Build
(2014), and Build (2014) with Improvements. The Existing (2011) scenario includes AM and
PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in
November/December 2011 and January 2012. The Background (2014) scenario includes
existing traffic with projected annual growth. The Build (2014) scenario includes
Background (2014) volumes with the addition of site trips generated by the proposed
development. Future conditions with the recommended improvements in place were
analyzed in a Build (2014) with Improvements scenario.


                                              i
Existing (2011) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.

As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page v, all of the study area
intersections are currently operating at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and
PM peak hours. Specifically, the signalized N. Harrison Avenue and SAS Campus Drive
intersection operates at LOS B in the AM peak hour and LOS C in the PM peak hour. All
the stop-controlled approaches at the unsignalized intersections included in the study area
operate at LOS C or better during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Background (2014) Conditions
Historical traffic data obtained from the NCDOT suggests flat or negative traffic growth in
the area in recent years. Nevertheless, to account for a worse-case scenario, an annual
growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient
traffic growth between the base year (2011) and the build year (2014) in the Background
(2014) scenario.

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, the addition of background traffic will incur slight
delay increases, causing approach LOS degradation at three study intersections. However, all
the intersections are projected to remain operating at acceptable levels of service during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The development is proposed to consist of a 220,004-square foot office building. Trip
generation was first conducted based on the standard rates for land use code 710 (General
Office) included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition. The results were then compared
to rates derived from traffic counts collected at the existing Building T driveway. The
comparison indicates that the collected traffic counts are approximately twenty-three percent
(23%) lower than ITE Manual rates. Therefore, a twenty percent (20%) reduction factor was
applied to the standard ITE trip generation rates to account for SAS Campus site-specific
characteristics in this project.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,958 daily site trips with 282
AM peak hour trips (248 entering, 34 exiting) and 277 PM peak hour trips (47 entering, 230
exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing traffic patterns and
surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build (2014) Conditions
The Build (2014) conditions account for both the Background (2014) traffic and site traffic
generated by the proposed development.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page v, the addition of site trips will not result in
any significant level of service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS)
at any of the study area intersections. The signalized N. Harrison Avenue and SAS Campus

                                               ii
Drive is projected to operate at LOS C during both the AM and PM peak hours. All the
stop-controlled approaches are projected to remain operating acceptable levels of service
despite some delay increases. With the planned geometrics as shown on the Site Plan, both
the two newly constructed site accesses and the shared access at the existing Building T
driveway along SAS Campus Drive are projected to operate at LOS C or better during the
AM and PM peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a minor impact on the adjacent roadways and intersections within the study area. The
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Adequate
Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) and NCDOT requirements:

SAS Campus Drive
The Town of Cary requires new developments widen the roads along the frontage of their
property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan
(CTP). The proposed Building Q has frontage along SAS Campus Drive, which is a four-
lane undivided, private roadway in the Existing (2011) conditions. For the section of SAS
Campus Drive, the CTP dictates it to be a collector avenue, which typically includes two
travel lanes, striped bike lanes, an 11-foot landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on
both sides within 70 feet of right-of-way. The existing four-lane cross-section is considered
equivalent to or exceeding the CTP requirements. Therefore, no further widening is
recommended.

SAS Campus Drive and Trenton Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled eastbound SAS Campus Drive is
projected to operate at LOS C in the AM peak hour and LOS B in the PM peak hour.
Existing and future turning movement volumes on SAS Campus Drive meet warrants for
providing deceleration lanes based on the Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North
Carolina Highways (NCDOT, July 2003). Nevertheless, as the conflicting traffic volumes
are light and the stop-controlled approach is projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service after the project build-out, exclusive turn lanes are not required by the Town of Cary
and NCDOT at this time. Revisiting this intersection is recommended with the next parcel
development on the SAS Campus.

SAS Campus Drive and Site Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that with the planned geometrics shown on the Site Plan, the
stop-controlled Access #1 along SAS Campus Drive is projected to operate at LOS B or
better during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configurations are recommended to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site:
     Construct the planned Site Access #1 approach as shown on the site plan to provide
       for one ingress lane and one egress lane as shown on the Site Plan.

SAS Campus Drive and Building C Driveway/Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that after completion, both the northbound Building C
driveway and the southbound Access #2 are projected to operate at LOS C or better during
both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configurations are

                                              iii
recommended to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site:
     Construct the planned Site Access #2 approach at the location shown on the site
      plan to provide for one ingress lane and two egress lanes including an exclusive
      right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2014) and Build (2014) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are required.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
A new office building is proposed to be constructed on the north side of SAS Campus
Drive, just east of the existing Building T, on the SAS Campus in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development consists of a 220,004-square foot office building (Building Q) and is projected
to be completed by 2014.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The Site Plan (Figure 2) proposes two new full access driveways along SAS Campus Drive:
    Site Access #1: approximately 450 feet east of the Building T driveway
    Site Access #2: across from the Building C driveway, approximately 1,050 feet east
        of Site Access #1

In addition, a connection will be made between the parking lots of Building T and Building
Q. Hence, the existing Building T driveway will become a shared access point to the project
site.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       N. Harrison Avenue and SAS Campus Drive (signalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Research Drive/Building V Driveway (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Building T Driveway (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Building C Driveway/Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Trenton Road (unsignalized)
       Trenton Road and Trinity Road (unsignalized)
       SAS Campus Drive and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)

Turning movement counts were also collected at the N. Harrison Avenue and Research
Drive intersection. Since the site trips due to Building Q are projected not to exceed seven
percent (7%) of traffic volumes on any approach, traffic operational analysis is not required
at this intersection based on the Town of Cary LDO.

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC (M/A/B) was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the
potential traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This TAR summarizes trip generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and
traffic analyses for the proposed development.

The collected intersection turning movement volumes were adjusted in the Existing (2011)
scenario, where appropriate, to ensure balancing along Trenton/Trinity Road. It should be
noted that traffic turning movement counts were also collected at the N. Harrison Avenue
and Research Drive intersection. Since site trips due to the proposed Building Q are
projected not to exceed seven percent (7%) of traffic volumes on any approach, traffic
operational analysis is not required at this intersection based on the Town of Cary LDO.
The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
defined in the Town of Cary Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, Adequate
Public Facilities Planning and Development for Roads (APFR). Level of service in the

                                              8
"Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D
considered acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For
signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service worse than
LOS D, no increase in overall intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For
unsignalized intersections where the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under
background conditions, the installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the
intersection meets required warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an
undesirable delay in the surrounding roadway system.

          E                Very long traffic delay         55-80 sec.         35-50 sec.
          F                  Unacceptable delay             > 80 sec.          > 50 sec.


2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the
Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the
Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all of the study area intersections are currently operating at
acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Specifically, the
signalized N. Harrison Avenue and SAS Campus Drive intersection operates at LOS B in the
AM peak hour and LOS C in the PM peak hour. All the stop-controlled approaches at the
unsignalized intersections included in the study area operate at LOS C or better during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2014) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Historical traffic data obtained from the NCDOT suggests flat or negative traffic growth in
the area in recent years. Nevertheless, to account for a worst-case scenario, an annual
growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient
traffic growth between the base year (2011) and the build year (2014) in the Background
(2014) scenario.

3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background (2014)
scenario analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2014) scenario LOS
analyses can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix
B.

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, the addition of background traffic will incur slight
delay increases, causing approach LOS degradation at three study intersections. However, all
the intersections are projected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours.

   4.0 BUILD (2014) ANALYSIS
   A new office building is proposed to be constructed on the north side of SAS Campus
   Drive, just east of the existing Building T, on the SAS Campus in Cary, NC (Figure 1).

   4.1 TRIP GENERATION
   The development is proposed to consist of a 220,004-square foot office building. Trip
   generation was first conducted based on the standard rates for land use code 710 (General
   Office) included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition. The results were then compared to
   rates derived from traffic counts collected at the existing Building T driveway. The
   comparison indicates that the collected traffic counts are approximately twenty-three percent
   (23%) lower than ITE Manual rates, therefore, a twenty percent (20%) reduction factor was
   applied to the standard ITE trip generation rates. This adjustment factor accounts for SAS
   Campus site-specific characteristics in this project.

   Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
   weekday AM and PM peak hours. As shown in Table 5, the proposed development is
   projected to generate 1,958 daily site trips with 282 AM peak hour trips (248 entering, 34
   exiting) and 277 PM peak hour trips (47 entering, 230 exiting).

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and
the land uses in the vicinity of study area as follows:
       30% from N. Harrison Avenue to the north
       17% from N. Harrison Avenue to the south
       18% from Research Drive to the south
       10% from Trenton Road to the north
       5% from Trinity Road to the east
       20% from Trinity Road to the south

The site distribution percentages are depicted in Figure 6, with the resulting site trips shown
in Figure 7.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2014) analysis scenario includes the Background (2014) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 8 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2014) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the
full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant level of
service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any of the study area
intersections. The signalized N. Harrison Avenue and SAS Campus Drive is projected to
operate at LOS C during both the AM and PM peak hours. All the stop-controlled
approaches are projected to remain operating acceptable levels of service despite some delay
increases. With the planned geometrics as shown on the Site Plan, both the two newly
constructed site accesses and the shared access at the existing Building T driveway along SAS
Campus Drive are projected to operate at LOS C or better during the AM and PM peak
hours.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a minor impact on the adjacent roadways and intersections within the study area. The
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Adequate
Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) and NCDOT requirements:

SAS Campus Drive
The Town of Cary requires new developments widen the roads along the frontage of their
property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan
(CTP). The proposed Building Q has frontage along SAS Campus Drive, which is a four-
lane undivided, private roadway under the Existing (2011) conditions. For the section of
SAS Campus Drive, the CTP dictates it to be a collector avenue, which typically includes two
travel lanes, striped bike lanes, an 11-foot landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on
both sides within 70 feet of right-of-way. The existing four-lane cross-section is considered
equivalent to or exceeding the CTP requirements. Therefore, no further widening is
recommended.

SAS Campus Drive and Trenton Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled eastbound SAS Campus Drive is
projected to operate at LOS C in the AM peak hour and LOS B in the PM peak hour.
Existing and future turning movement volumes on SAS Campus Drive meet warrants for
providing deceleration lanes based on the Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North
Carolina Highways (NCDOT, July 2003). Nevertheless, as the conflicting traffic volumes
are light and the stop-controlled approach is projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service after the project build-out, exclusive turn lanes are not required by the Town of Cary
and NCDOT at this time. Revisiting this intersection is recommended with the next parcel
development on the SAS Campus.

SAS Campus Drive and Site Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that with the planned geometrics shown on the Site Plan, the
stop-controlled Access #1 along SAS Campus Drive is projected to operate at LOS B or
better during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configurations are recommended to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site:
     Construct the planned Site Access #1 approach as shown on the site plan to provide
       for one ingress lane and one egress lane as shown on the Site Plan.

SAS Campus Drive and Building C Driveway/Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that after completion, both the northbound Building C
driveway and the southbound Access #2 are projected to operate at LOS C or better during
both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configurations are
recommended to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site:
     Construct the planned Site Access #2 approach at the location shown on the site
       plan to provide for one ingress lane and two egress lanes including an exclusive
       right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2014) and Build (2014) conditions. Therefore, no further

                                              22
improvements are required.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configuration and traffic control for 2014 are depicted in Figure 9.

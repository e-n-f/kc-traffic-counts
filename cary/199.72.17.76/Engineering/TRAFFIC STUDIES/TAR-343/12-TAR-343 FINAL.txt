EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
A mixed-use development is proposed to be constructed in the northeast corner of the Old
Apex Road and W Chatham Street intersection in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is
projected to be completed by 2014 and consists of the following land uses:
   ·   Retail ­ 11,000 square feet
   ·   Apartments ­ 59 units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined
in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Access to the development is proposed provided via one cross-access (Maroubra Loop)
within the adjacent apartment community, one full movement access along Old Apex Road,
and one right-in/right-out (RIRO) access along W Chatham Street, as follows:
    · Access #1 (Old Apex Road): full access, approximately 325 feet north of W
        Chatham Street
    · Access #2 (W Chatham Street): RIRO access, approximately 225 feet east of Old
        Apex Road
    · Access #3 (Maroubra Loop): full cross-access between the proposed development
        and the existing adjacent apartment community

Note, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has concerns with the
access along Old Apex Road (Access #1) operating as a full access. Therefore, the NCDOT
has stipulated that if the left-turn queue length along Old Apex Road spills back to this
access, it will be restricted to a RIRO access. The analysis will be undertaken with Access
#1 being a full movement; however restricting access will be noted in the report if the left-
turn queuing along Old Apex Road becomes problematic at this location.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   Old Apex Road and High House Road (signalized)
   ·   Old Apex Road and Swift Commons Lane (unsignalized)
   ·   Old Apex Road and W Chatham Street (signalized)
   ·   NW Maynard Road and Maynard Crossing Court/Dogwood Forest Drive
       (signalized)
   ·   NW Maynard Road and High House Road (signalized)
   ·   SW Maynard Road and Old Apex Road (signalized)
   ·   SW Maynard Road and W Chatham Street (signalized)
   ·   SW Maynard Road and Wicklow Drive/Griffs Street (signalized)
   ·   Old Apex Road and Access #1 (unsignalized, restricted access)
   ·   W Chatham Street and Access #2 (unsignalized, RIRO)


                                              i
   ·   Maroubra Loop and Access #1 (unsignalized, full access)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2012), Background (2014), and
Build (2014), and a Build (2014) with Improvements scenario. The Existing (2012) scenario
includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC in August 2012 with the exception of the NW Maynard Road
and Maynard Crossing Court/Dogwood Forest Drive intersection, which was collected by
the Town of Cary in March 2012. The Background (2014) scenario includes existing traffic
with projected annual growth of two percent (2%) between the existing and future years.
The Build (2014) scenario includes Background (2014) volumes with the addition of the site
trips generated by the proposed redevelopment. In addition, future conditions with
proposed mitigations in place were analyzed in a Build (2014) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.

As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vi, all of the study area
intersections are currently operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better).

Access to transit is available within the project's study limits. There are multiple Town of
Cary transit service (C-Tran) bus stop locations along SE/NW Maynard Road and High
House Road within the study area. Specifically, the Town of Cary serves this area via Routes
1, 2 and 4. Routes 1 and 2 run approximately every 60 minutes from 6:00 AM to 7:30 PM;
Route 4 runs approximately 30 minutes from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, every 60 minutes from 9
AM to 3:00 PM, and every 30 minutes from 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM.

Background (2014) Conditions
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes indicated that traffic
in the study area has been steadily declining between 2003 and 2011. Despite the negative
historic growth in the area over the past decade, an annual growth rate of two percent (2%)
was applied to the existing traffic in the Background (2014) scenario to account for
conservative traffic growth between the base year (2012) and the build year (2014). This is
consistent with the previous TARs completed in the area.

Currently, there is an adjacent apartment community north of the proposed development:

Old Apex Apartments (07-TAR-221, 08-TAR-221A/B) ­ Now called Phillips Swift Creek
Apartments, this 196-unit apartment community is located on the east side of Old Apex
Road, directly north of the proposed development (with a proposed cross-access to the
proposed development).       Three TARs related to this site were completed by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town with 07-TAR-221 being submitted
on February 7, 2007, 08-TAR-221A submitted on January 17, 2008, and 08-TAR-221B
submitted on June 9, 2008. The land use described in the latest TAR (08-TAR-221B), a 196
dwelling unit apartment complex, was projected to be completed in 2009 and result in 1,328
daily trips, 100 AM peak hour trips (20 entering, 80 exiting) and 125 PM peak hour trips (81

                                             ii
entering, 22 exiting). It was observed during field visits that this development is fully built
and occupied. Therefore, no additional trips associated with this development were included
in the Background (2014) analysis.

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, all of the study area intersections are projected to
continue operating at acceptable levels of service. The signalized intersections within the
study area generally have a similar or better level of service in the Background (2014) when
compared to the Existing (2012) scenario due to the optimizations of signal cycle lengths
and splits.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed development is projected to consist of 11,000 square feet of retail space and a
59-unit apartment community.

Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. As a result, the proposed development is
projected to generate 953 daily trips with 44 AM peak hour trips (14 entering, 30 exiting) and
91 PM peak hour trips (53 entering, 38 exiting). Additionally, daily and PM peak hour
internal capture between the land uses and PM peak hour pass-by rates were accounted for
based on the ITE standards and NCDOT guidance.

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing traffic patterns and
surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build (2014) Conditions
The Build (2014) conditions account for both the Background (2014) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. In addition, a small percentage of traffic
from the existing Phillips Swift Creek Apartments was assumed to access the retail portion
of this new development. The trips are shown at the internal access (Maroubra Loop and
Access #1).

As shown in the summary LOS table on page vi, all of the study area intersections, including
the newly constructed site accesses, are projected to operate acceptably despite the addition
of site trips.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a very minor impact on the roadways and intersections within the study area. The
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Adequate
Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) and NCDOT requirements:

Old Apex Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of Old Apex Road, the plan dictates a 69-foot five-lane cross-section (91-
foot right-of-way) with a two-way center left-turn lane and wide outside travel lanes along

                                              iii
curbs and sidewalks on both sides. Thus, the following is recommended along Old Apex
Road:
   ·   Widen Old Apex Road along the entire frontage of the proposed development to
       half (1/2) of the ultimate cross-section as defined in the Town's Comprehensive
       Transportation Plan.

W Chatham Street
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of W Chatham Street, two separate cross-sections are defined, with the
proposed right-in/right-out (Access #2) appearing to be the proximity of the transition
between the two cross-sections. West of the transition point, the plan dictates a 56-foot
two-lane cross-section (78-foot right-of-way) with two travel lanes and a landscaped median
along bike lanes, curbs and sidewalks on both sides. East of the transition point, the plan
dictates a 45-foot three-lane cross-section (70-foot right-of-way) with wide outside travel
lanes and a two-way center left-turn lane along curbs and sidewalks on both sides. The
Town should be conferred with in order to determine the precise location where the two
cross-sections meet (transition).
   ·   West of the transition point, widen W Chatham Street along the entire frontage of
       the proposed development to half (1/2) of the 56-foot cross-section as defined in
       the Town's Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
   ·   East of the transition point, widen W Chatham Street along the entire frontage of the
       proposed development to half (1/2) of the 45-foot cross-section as defined in the
       Town's Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

Old Apex Road and Access #1 (unsignalized, restricted access)
The traffic analysis indicates that, assuming a full-movement approach, the westbound
Access #1 approach along Old Apex Road is projected to operate at an acceptable level of
services in the AM and PM peak hours. However, the Synchro analysis indicates that the
southbound queues at the adjacent W Chatham Street intersection queue back nearly 400
feet in the PM peak hour, which would block Access #1. Therefore, since the southbound
queues at the adjacent intersection are projected to queue back to this intersection, the
following driveway configuration is recommended at this location (these recommendations
are not consistent with the provided site plan):
    · Construct the westbound stop-controlled Access #1 approach to provide for one
         ingress and one egress (right-out only) lane.
    · Construct an additional northbound lane to be striped as an exclusive right-turn lane
         into the site. This lane would be 14 feet wide, as per the requirements of the cross-
         section as per the CTP.
    · Restripe the southbound approach to provide for an exclusive left-turn lane that
         provides for 125 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper and an exclusive
         through lane.
    · Proper channelization should be implemented to restrict the right-in/right-out with
         left-in per the Town of Cary and NCDOT standards.




                                              iv
W Chatham Street and Access #2 (unsignalized, right-in/right-out)
The traffic analysis indicates that the southbound Access #2 approach along W Chatham
Street is projected to operate at an acceptable level of service during the AM and PM peak
hours. However, the analysis does indicate that the westbound approach queues at the Old
Apex Road and W Chatham Street intersection may block this access. Therefore, the
following driveway configuration is recommended at this location: (these recommendations
are not consistent with the provided site plan):
   ·   Access #2 should be relocated further east (approximately 50-100 feet) along W
       Chatham Street so as to add space between Access #2 and the adjacent signalized
       Old Apex Road and W Chatham Street intersection.
   ·   Sight distance requirements should be verified to ensure that Town of Cary
       standards are met.
   ·   Construct the southbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
       one right-out only egress lane.
   ·   With the widening of W Chatham Street per CTP, provide a short right-turn (around
       50 feet) and appropriate taper for Access #2.
   ·   With the widening of W Chatham Street, ensure that the storage length on the
       exclusive westbound right-turn lane at the Old Apex Road intersection is maintained.

In addition to creating space, locating Access #2 further east will provide an internal parking
lot/site plan design that will flow better than the current layout. If Access #2 is relocated,
the full storage and taper on the eastbound right-turn lane should be extended as far as
possible.

Maroubra Loop and Access #1 (unsignalized, internal access)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably during
the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration is
recommended at this location (these recommendations should be consistent with the
provided site plan):
   ·   Construct all approaches of this internal intersection to provide for one ingress lane
       and one egress lane. For the analysis, it was assumed that the eastbound (Access #1)
       and northbound (Maroubra Loop) movement would flow continuously, while the
       westbound and southbound approach would operate under stop-control. Regardless
       of the intersection traffic control specifics, the intersection is projected to operate
       acceptably.

Site Layout
There are a number of concerns regarding the layout of the site, as follows:
     · Access #1: Ensure that the internal throat distance meets NCDOT and Town
        standards.




                                              v
   ·   Access #2: The internal throat distance at this intersection does not meet NCDOT
       and Town standards. Furthermore, the parking located at the driveway poses a
       problem for those vehicles backing out (pulling out) of those parking spots.
       Relocating this driveway further east (75 ­ 100 feet) along W Chatham Street will
       provide an internal parking lot/site plan design that will flow better than the current
       layout. Access #3: This internal cross-access is a skewed intersection. It may be
       beneficial to restrict access to the parking lot to the west, and only have the west
       (eastbound), south (northbound) and north (southbound) legs, forming a T-
       intersection, rather than a skewed four-leg intersection.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
across all scenarios. Thus, no further improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
A mixed-use development is proposed to be constructed in the northeast corner of the Old
Apex Road and W Chatham Street intersection in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is
projected to be completed by 2014 and consists of the following land uses:
   ·   Retail ­ 11,000 square feet
   ·   Apartments ­ 59 units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined
in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Access to the development is proposed provided via one cross-access (Maroubra Loop)
within the adjacent apartment community, one full movement access along Old Apex Road,
and one right-in/right-out (RIRO) access along W Chatham Street, as follows:
    · Access #1 (Old Apex Road): full access, approximately 325 feet north of W
        Chatham Street
    · Access #2 (W Chatham Street): RIRO access, approximately 225 feet east of Old
        Apex Road
    · Access #3 (Maroubra Loop): full cross-access between the proposed development
        and the existing adjacent apartment community

Note, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has concerns with the
access along Old Apex Road (Access #1) operating as a full access. Therefore, the NCDOT
has stipulated that if the left-turn queue length along Old Apex Road spills back to this
access, it will be restricted to a RIRO access. The analysis will be undertaken with Access
#1 being a full movement; however restricting access will be noted in the report if the left-
turn queuing along Old Apex Road becomes problematic at this location.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   Old Apex Road and High House Road (signalized)
   ·   Old Apex Road and Swift Commons Lane (unsignalized)
   ·   Old Apex Road and W Chatham Street (signalized)
   ·   NW Maynard Road and Maynard Crossing Court/Dogwood Forest Drive
       (signalized)
   ·   NW Maynard Road and High House Road (signalized)
   ·   SW Maynard Road and Old Apex Road (signalized)
   ·   SW Maynard Road and W Chatham Street (signalized)
   ·   SW Maynard Road and Wicklow Drive/Griffs Street (signalized)
   ·   Old Apex Road and Access #1 (unsignalized, restricted access)
   ·   W Chatham Street and Access #2 (unsignalized, RIRO)
   ·   Maroubra Loop and Access #1 (unsignalized, full access)


                                             1
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed redevelopment and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This TAR summarizes trip generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and
traffic analyses for the proposed redevelopment.

  Access to transit is available within the project's study limits. There are multiple Town of
  Cary transit service (C-Tran) bus stop locations along SE/NW Maynard Road and High
  House Road within the study area. Specifically, the Town of Cary serves this area via Routes
  1, 2 and 4. Routes 1 and 2 run approximately every 60 minutes from 6:00 AM to 7:30 PM;
  Route 4 runs approximately 30 minutes from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, every 60 minutes from 9
  AM to 3:00 PM, and every 30 minutes from 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM.

  The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                     CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

The development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone." Level of
service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of average peak hour (as defined
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) with LOS D considered acceptable for both
signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service less than LOS D, then
no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections, where the stop controlled approach is below an LOS D under background
conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the
Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the
Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all of the study area intersections are currently operating at
acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better).

3.0 BACKGROUND (2014)
                2014) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND
                      AND DEVELOPMENT
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes indicated that traffic
in the study area has been steadily declining between 2003 and 2011. Despite the negative
historic growth in the area over the past decade, an annual growth rate of two percent (2%)
was applied to the existing traffic in the Background (2014) scenario to account for
conservative traffic growth between the base year (2012) and the build year (2014). This is
consistent with the previous TARs completed in the area.

Currently, there is an adjacent apartment community north of the proposed development:

Old Apex Apartments (07-TAR-221, 08-TAR-221A/B) ­ Now called Phillips Swift Creek
Apartments, this 196-unit apartment community is located on the east side of Old Apex
Road, directly north of the proposed development (with a proposed cross-access to the
proposed development).         Three TARs related to this site were completed by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town with 07-TAR-221 being submitted
on February 7, 2007, 08-TAR-221A submitted on January 17, 2008, and 08-TAR-221B
submitted on June 9, 2008. The land use described in the latest TAR (08-TAR-221B), a 196
dwelling unit apartment complex, was projected to be completed in 2009 and result in 1,328
daily trips, 100 AM peak hour trips (20 entering, 80 exiting) and 125 PM peak hour trips (81
entering, 22 exiting). It was observed during field visits that this development is fully built
and occupied. Therefore, no additional trips associated with this development were included
in the Background (2014) analysis.

The resulting Background (2014) volumes are shown in Figure 5.

3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background (2014)
scenario analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2014) scenario LOS
analyses can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix
B.

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, all of the study area intersections are projected to
continue operating at acceptable levels of service. The signalized intersections within the
study area generally have a similar or better level of service in the Background (2014) when
compared to the Existing (2012) scenario due to the optimizations of signal cycle lengths
and splits.

4.0 BUILD (2014) CONDITIONS
A mixed-use development is proposed to be constructed in the northeast corner of the Old
Apex Road and W Chatham Street intersection in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is
projected to be completed by 2014 and consists of the following land uses:
   ·   Retail ­ 11,000 square feet
   ·   Apartments ­ 59 units


4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. As a result, the proposed development is
projected to generate 953 daily trips with 44 AM peak hour trips (14 entering, 30 exiting) and
91 PM peak hour trips (53 entering, 38 exiting). Additionally, daily and PM peak hour
internal capture between the land uses and PM peak hour pass-by rates were accounted for
based on the ITE standards and NCDOT guidance.

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing traffic patterns and
surrounding land uses in the study area

Table 5 summarizes the net new trips generated by the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
The Build (2014) scenario includes the Background (2014) traffic as well as site generated
trips from the proposed development. In addition, a small percentage of traffic from the
existing Phillips Swift Creek Apartments was assumed to access the retail portion of this new
development. The trips are shown at the internal access (Maroubra Loop and Access #1).
Figure 13 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2014) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis for the Build (2014) analysis and
Appendix B contains the full Synchro/HCS reports of the analysis.

As shown in Table 6, all of the study area intersections, including the newly constructed site
accesses, are projected to operate acceptably despite the addition of site trips.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
                 CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a very minor impact on the roadways and intersections within the study area. The
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Adequate
Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) and NCDOT requirements:

Old Apex Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of Old Apex Road, the plan dictates a 69-foot five-lane cross-section (91-
foot right-of-way) with a two-way center left-turn lane and wide outside travel lanes along
curbs and sidewalks on both sides. Thus, the following is recommended along Old Apex
Road:
   ·   Widen Old Apex Road along the entire frontage of the proposed development to
       half (1/2) of the ultimate cross-section as defined in the Town's Comprehensive
       Transportation Plan.

W Chatham Street
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of W Chatham Street, two separate cross-sections are defined, with the
proposed right-in/right-out (Access #2) appearing to be the proximity of the transition
between the two cross-sections. West of the transition point, the plan dictates a 56-foot
two-lane cross-section (78-foot right-of-way) with two travel lanes and a landscaped median
along bike lanes, curbs and sidewalks on both sides. East of the transition point, the plan
dictates a 45-foot three-lane cross-section (70-foot right-of-way) with wide outside travel
lanes and a two-way center left-turn lane along curbs and sidewalks on both sides. The
Town should be conferred with in order to determine the precise location where the two
cross-sections meet (transition).
   ·   West of the transition point, widen W Chatham Street along the entire frontage of
       the proposed development to half (1/2) of the 56-foot cross-section as defined in
       the Town's Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
   ·   East of the transition point, widen W Chatham Street along the entire frontage of the
       proposed development to half (1/2) of the 45-foot cross-section as defined in the
       Town's Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

Old Apex Road and Access #1 (unsignalized, restricted access)
The traffic analysis indicates that, assuming a full-movement approach, the westbound
Access #1 approach along Old Apex Road is projected to operate at an acceptable level of
services in the AM and PM peak hours. However, the Synchro analysis indicates that the
southbound queues at the adjacent W Chatham Street intersection queue back nearly 400
feet in the PM peak hour, which would block Access #1. Therefore, since the southbound
queues at the adjacent intersection are projected to queue back to this intersection, the
following driveway configuration is recommended at this location (these recommendations
are not consistent with the provided site plan):
    · Construct the westbound stop-controlled Access #1 approach to provide for one
         ingress and one egress (right-out only) lane.
    · Construct an additional northbound lane to be striped as an exclusive right-turn lane
         into the site. This lane would be 14 feet wide, as per the requirements of the cross-
         section as per the CTP.
    · Restripe the southbound approach to provide for an exclusive left-turn lane that
         provides for 125 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper and an exclusive
         through lane.
    · Proper channelization should be implemented to restrict the right-in/right-out with
         left-in per the Town of Cary and NCDOT standards.

W Chatham Street and Access #2 (unsignalized, right-in/right-out)
The traffic analysis indicates that the southbound Access #2 approach along W Chatham
Street is projected to operate at an acceptable level of service during the AM and PM peak
hours. However, the analysis does indicate that the westbound approach queues at the Old
Apex Road and W Chatham Street intersection may block this access. Therefore, the
following driveway configuration is recommended at this location: (these recommendations
are not consistent with the provided site plan):
   ·   Access #2 should be relocated further east (approximately 50-100 feet) along W
       Chatham Street so as to add space between Access #2 and the adjacent signalized
       Old Apex Road and W Chatham Street intersection.
   ·   Sight distance requirements should be verified to ensure that Town of Cary
       standards are met.
   ·   Construct the southbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
       one right-out only egress lane.
   ·   With the widening of W Chatham Street per CTP, provide a short right-turn (around
       50 feet) and appropriate taper for Access #2.
   ·   With the widening of W Chatham Street, ensure that the storage length on the
       exclusive westbound right-turn lane at the Old Apex Road intersection is maintained.

In addition to creating space, locating Access #2 further east will provide an internal parking
lot/site plan design that will flow better than the current layout. If Access #2 is relocated,
the full storage and taper on the eastbound right-turn lane should be extended as far as
possible.

Maroubra Loop and Access #1 (unsignalized, internal access)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably during

                                              31
the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration is
recommended at this location (these recommendations should be consistent with the
provided site plan):
   ·   Construct all approaches of this internal intersection to provide for one ingress lane
       and one egress lane. For the analysis, it was assumed that the eastbound (Access #1)
       and northbound (Maroubra Loop) movement would flow continuously, while the
       westbound and southbound approach would operate under stop-control. Regardless
       of the intersection traffic control specifics, the intersection is projected to operate
       acceptably.

Site Layout
There are a number of concerns regarding the layout of the site, as follows:
     · Access #1: Ensure that the internal throat distance meets NCDOT and Town
        standards.
     · Access #2: The internal throat distance at this intersection does not meet NCDOT
        and Town standards. Furthermore, the parking located at the driveway poses a
        problem for those vehicles backing out (pulling out) of those parking spots.
        Relocating this driveway further east (75 ­ 100 feet) along W Chatham Street will
        provide an internal parking lot/site plan design that will flow better than the current
        layout. Access #3: This internal cross-access is a skewed intersection. It may be
        beneficial to restrict access to the parking lot to the west, and only have the west
        (eastbound), south (northbound) and north (southbound) legs, forming a T-
        intersection, rather than a skewed four-leg intersection.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
across all scenarios. Thus, no further improvements are recommended.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configurations and traffic control for the Build (2014) scenario is depicted in Figure 14.

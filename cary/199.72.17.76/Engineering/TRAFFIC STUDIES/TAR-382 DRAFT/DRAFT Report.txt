                                                    Executive Summary


Project Background
                 A residential development is being proposed in the Waverly Place Shopping Center
                 on the corner of Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
                 development is expected to be completed by 2015 and consists of the following land
                 use:
                       Apartments ­ 221 units

                 Vehicular access to the development is proposed via two existing unsignalized
                 driveways and one future unsignalized driveway along New Waverly Place (Figure
                 2), as follows:
                        Access #1 ­ existing full-movement access, approximately 650 feet east of
                            Advent Court
                        Access #2 ­ existing full-movement access, approximately 650 feet south of
                            Colonades Way
                        Access #3 ­ future full-movement access, approximately 200 feet north of
                            Access #1

                 The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study
                 area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
                       Tryon Road and US 1/64 NB Ramp (signalized)
                       Tryon Road and Regency Parkway (signalized)
                       Tryon Road and Crescent Green Drive (signalized)
                       Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road (signalized)
                       Tryon Road and New Waverly Place (signalized)
                       Kildaire Farm Road and WakeMed Drive (signalized)
                       Kildaire Farm Road and New Waverly Place (signalized)
                       Kildaire Farm Road and Colonades Way (unsignalized)
                       Colonades Way and New Waverly Place (unsignalized)

                   Analysis was performed under four (4) scenarios: Existing (2013), Background
                   (2015), Build (2015), and Build (2015) with Improvements. The Existing (2013)
                   scenario includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count
                   data collected in December 2013. Background (2015) scenario includes existing traffic
                   with four (4) approved developments and projected annual growth. The Build (2015)
                   scenario includes Background (2015) volumes with the addition of site trips
                   generated by the proposed development and planned roadway geometrics. Future
                   conditions with the recommended improvements in place were analyzed in a Build
                   (2015) with Improvements scenario.



Existing (2013) Conditions
                   Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and
                   intersection turning movement counts.

                   As reported in the Summary Level of Service (LOS) table on page vi, all of the study
                   intersections are operating at acceptable overall levels of service during the AM and
                   PM peak hours, with the exception of the signalized Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm
                   Road intersection, which is currently operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour.

                   Cary Transit (C-Tran) provides one service route (Route 5) that runs along Kildaire
                   Farm Road and in the Crescent Commons Shopping Center, as shown below
                   (orange). In addition, Triangle Transit provides service via Route 305, which runs
                   along Tryon Road, and within the Waverly Place Shopping Center.

Background (2015) Conditions
                   In the Background (2015) scenario, an annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
                   applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year
                   (2013) and the build year (2015). Furthermore, there are four (4) approved
                   developments in the vicinity projected to be constructed prior to, or at the same time
                   as the build-out of the proposed development. Site traffic associated with these
                   approved developments was individually included in the Background (2015)
                   analysis.

                   Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the study area intersections are projected to
                   continue operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours,
                   with one exception. As in the Existing (2013) scenario, the signalized Tryon Road
                   and Kildaire Farm Road intersection is projected to continue operating at an overall
                   LOS E during the PM peak hour.



Trip Generation and Assignment
                   The development is proposed to consist of the following land use:
                         Apartments ­ 221 units

                   Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
                   generation code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and the
                   suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

                   As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,463 daily site trips
                   with 112 trips (22 entering, 90 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 139 trips
                   (90 entering, 49 exiting) in the PM peak hour. The generated site trips were
                   distributed in accordance with the existing turning movement counts and land uses.



Build (2015) Conditions
                   The Build (2015) conditions account for both the Background (2015) traffic and the
                   site traffic generated by the proposed development.

                   As shown on the Summary LOS table on page vi, the addition of site trips and traffic
                   diversion will lead to traffic delay and queue increases at several study area
                   intersections. All of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable
                   overall levels of service, with the exception of the Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm
                   Road intersection, which is projected to experience a 1.9-second delay increase in the
                   PM peak hour, while remaining at LOS E.




                                                iii
Roadway Improvement Recommendations
                As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed rezoning is projected to
                have a moderate impact on the traffic operations of the surrounding roadway
                network and intersections. The following roadway improvements are recommended
                based on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP), the Town of
                Cary's transportation adequacy ordinance, and NCDOT requirements.

                Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road (signalized)
                The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in
                the PM peak hour, with a delay increase of 1.9 seconds, when compared to the
                Background (2015) PM scenario. Therefore the following improvements are
                recommended meet the transportation adequacy requirements:
                      Restripe the exclusive westbound right-turn lane along Tryon Road to a
                          shared westbound thru/right-turn lane.

                With this improvement in place, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E
                with a delay of 71.7 seconds/vehicle in the PM peak hour (0.3 seconds/vehicle less
                than in the Background (2015) PM peak hour).

                Kildaire Farm Road and New Waverly Place (signalized)
                The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                during the AM and PM peak hours. However, due to projected excessive queuing in
                the southbound left-turn lane along Kildaire Farm Road, the following improvement
                is recommended:
                       Extend the existing southbound left-turn lane storage along Kildaire Farm
                          Road to provide at least 325 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.

                New Waverly Place and Access #3 (unsignalized)
                The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
                is recommended:
                       Restripe the inside northbound New Waverly Place thru lane to a shared
                          thru/left-turn lane.
                       Restripe the outside southbound New Waverly Place thru lane to a shared
                          thru/right-turn lane.
                       Construct the eastbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane
                          and one egress lane.

                The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of
                service under both the Background (2015) and Build (2015) conditions. Therefore, no
                further improvements are recommended.

A residential development is being proposed in the Waverly Place Shopping Center
on the corner of Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development is expected to be completed by 2015 and consists of the following land
use:
      Apartments ­ 221 units

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via two existing unsignalized
driveways and one future unsignalized driveway along New Waverly Place (Figure
2), as follows:
       Access #1 ­ existing full-movement access, approximately 650 feet east of
           Advent Court
       Access #2 ­ existing full-movement access, approximately 650 feet south of
           Colonades Way
       Access #3 ­ future full-movement access, approximately 200 feet north of
           Access #1

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study
area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
      Tryon Road and US 1/64 NB Ramp (signalized)
      Tryon Road and Regency Parkway (signalized)
      Tryon Road and Crescent Green Drive (signalized)
      Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road (signalized)
      Tryon Road and New Waverly Place (signalized)
      Kildaire Farm Road and WakeMed Drive (signalized)
      Kildaire Farm Road and New Waverly Place (signalized)
      Kildaire Farm Road and Colonades Way (unsignalized)
      Colonades Way and New Waverly Place (unsignalized)
      Colonades Way and Advent Court (unsignalized)
      New Waverly Place and Advent Court (unsignalized)
      New Waverly Place and Access #1 (unsignalized)
      New Waverly Place and Access #2 (unsignalized)
      New Waverly Place and Access #3 (future unsignalized)

VHB Engineering NC, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation,
distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

Existing Transit Operations
                    Cary Transit (C-Tran) provides one service route (Route 5) that runs along Kildaire
                    Farm Road and in the Crescent Commons Shopping Center, as shown below
                    (orange). In addition, Triangle Transit provides service via Route 305, which runs
                    along Tryon Road, and within the Waverly Place Shopping Center.

Level of Service Criteria
                    Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection
                    geometrics and traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given
                    turning volumes. Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average
                    control delay experienced by vehicles traveling through the intersection during the
                    peak hour. Control delay represents the portion of total delay attributed to traffic
                    control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs). Table 2 provides a general description of
                    various levels of service categories and delay ranges.

                    The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone"
                    as defined in the Town of Cary Land Development Ordinance (LDO). Level of
                    service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour
                    with LOS D considered acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized
                    approaches. For signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a
                    level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall intersection delay is allowed
                    under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where the stop-controlled
                    approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the installation of a traffic
                    signal shall only be required when the intersection meets required warrants for a

                       signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the surrounding
                       roadway system.

Level of Service Analysis
                       Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                       and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing
                       (2013) scenario analysis utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the Town
                       of Cary, which are included in Appendix B. A summary of the findings for the
                       Existing (2013) scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full
                       Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix C.

                       As reported in Table 3, all of the study intersections are operating at acceptable
                       overall levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours, with the exception of the
                       signalized Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road intersection, which is currently
                       operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour.

                           Background (2015) Conditions


Background Growth and Development
                 To account for ambient growth in the area, a three-percent (3%) growth rate was
                 applied to the study area roadways intersections. In addition, four (4) approved
                 developments in the vicinity are expected to be completed prior to, or at the same
                 time as the build-out of the proposed development. Therefore, traffic generated from
                 those approved or planned projects was individually included in the Background
                 (2015) scenario, where appropriate. These projects include:

                 Keisler Property (12-TAR-338): Located on the west side of Kildaire Farm Road, north
                 of the US 1/64 overpass, this development is to consist of a 50,000-square foot office
                 building and be constructed by 2014. A traffic analysis report was prepared by
                 Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town in August 2012. As detailed
                 in the report, the development is projected to generate 782 daily site trips, 108 AM
                 peak hour site trips (95 entering, 13 exiting) and 140 PM peak hour site trips (24
                 entering, 116 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area intersections
                 based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Field visits indicate that
                 this development has not been constructed; therefore, 100% of the traffic associated
                 with the Keisler Property development was included in the Background (2015)
                 analysis. Figure D-1 depicts the assigned trips.

                 Spring Arbor PDD (13-REZ-16): Located on approximately 32.68 acres on the east
                 side of Kildaire Farm Road, north of the US 1/64 overpass, this rezoning case
                 proposes to rezone the existing land use in order to allow for a life care community
                 (maximum of 90,000-square feet/80 beds) and up to 34 detached residential units. A
                 rezoning packet was prepared by Glenda S. Toppe & Associates, William G. Daniels
                 & Associates and Jerry Turner & Associates and submitted to the Town of Cary on
                 August 22, 2013 with a revised document submitted on November 7, 2013. Based on
                 the land uses and densities detailed in the document, the development is projected to
                 generate 613 daily site trips, 48 AM peak hour site trips (18 entering, 30 exiting) and
                 69 PM peak hour site trips (39 entering, 30 exiting). These trips were distributed to
                 the study area based on existing land uses and traffic patterns. The Spring Arbor
                 development has not been constructed and there is no construction date at this time;




                                              15
                   therefore 100% of the traffic associated with the Spring Arbor PDD was included in
                   the Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-2 depicts the assigned trips.

                   Tryon Place at Cary Parkway (10-TAR-199A): Located in the southeastern quadrant of
                   the Tryon Road and SE Cary Parkway intersection, this development is proposed to
                   consist of 256 mid-rise apartments. A traffic analysis report was prepared by
                   Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town in September 2011. In the
                   document, the original build date was 2012; however the development still has not
                   been fully constructed. As detailed in the report, the development is projected to
                   generate 1,689 daily site trips, 129 AM peak hour site trips (26 entering, 103 exiting)
                   and 158 PM peak hour site trips (103 entering, 55 exiting). These trips were
                   distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns
                   in the report. Field visits indicate that this development has not been fully
                   constructed; therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with the Tryon Place at Cary
                   Parkway development was included in the Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-3
                   depicts the assigned trips.

                   Walgreens at Waverly Place (11-SP-051): Located within the Waverly Shopping Center,
                   in the southeastern quadrant of the Kildaire Farm Road and Colonades Way
                   intersection, this development is proposed to consist of 13,760-square foot pharmacy.
                   No traffic analysis report was prepared; therefore trip generation/distribution was
                   estimated. Based on the most appropriate ITE land use, the proposed development
                   is projected to generate 1,333 daily site trips, 47 AM peak hour site trips (24 entering,
                   23 exiting) and 136 PM peak hour site trips (68 entering, 68 exiting). These trips were
                   distributed to the study area intersections based on assumed distribution. Field
                   visits indicate that this development has not been fully constructed; therefore, 100%
                   of the traffic associated with the Walgreens at Waverly Place development was
                   included in the Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-4 depicts the assigned trips.

                   The Background (2015) peak hour trips are shown in Figure 5.




Level of Service Analysis
                   Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                   and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. Signal cycle
                   lengths and splits were optimized with Synchro as part of the future year analysis. A
                   summary of the findings for the Background (2015) scenario LOS analysis can be
                   found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix C.

                   As reported in Table 4, the study area intersections are projected to continue
                   operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours, with one
                   exception. As in the Existing (2013) scenario, the signalized Tryon Road and Kildaire
                   Farm Road intersection is projected to continue operating at an overall LOS E during
                   the PM peak hour.

                  A residential development is being proposed in the Waverly Place Shopping Center
                  on the corner of Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road in Cary, NC (Figure 1).



Trip Generation
                  The development is proposed to consist of the following land use:
                        Apartments ­ 221 units

                  Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
                  generation code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and the
                  suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

                  As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,463 daily site trips
                  with 112 trips (22 entering, 90 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 139 trips
                  (90 entering, 49 exiting) in the PM peak hour. The generated site trips were
                  distributed in accordance with the existing turning movement counts and land uses.

                  Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for
                  typical weekday AM and PM peak hours.

Level of Service Analysis
                   The Build (2015) analysis scenario includes the Background (2015) traffic as well as
                   site generated trips from the proposed development as described previously. Figure
                   9 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2015) scenario analysis.

                   Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                   and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway
                   Capacity Software (HCS 2010). Signal cycles lengths and splits were optimized within
                   Synchro/SimTraffic as part of the build year analysis.

                   Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix C contains the
                   full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

                   As reported in Table 6, the addition of site trips and traffic diversion will lead to
                   traffic delay and queue increases at several study area intersections. All of the study
                   intersections are projected to operate at acceptable overall levels of service, with the
                   exception of the Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road intersection, which is projected
                   to experience a 1.9-second delay increase in the PM peak hour, while remaining at
                   LOS E.

                     Findings and Conclusions


As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed rezoning is projected to
have a moderate impact on the traffic operations of the surrounding roadway
network and intersections. The following roadway improvements are recommended
based on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP), the Town of
Cary's transportation adequacy ordinance, and NCDOT requirements.

Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in
the PM peak hour, with a delay increase of 1.9 seconds, when compared to the
Background (2015) PM scenario. Therefore the following improvements are
recommended meet the transportation adequacy requirements:
      Restripe the exclusive westbound right-turn lane along Tryon Road to a
          shared westbound thru/right-turn lane.

With this improvement in place, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E
with a delay of 71.7 seconds/vehicle in the PM peak hour (0.3 seconds/vehicle less
than in the Background (2015) PM peak hour).

Kildaire Farm Road and New Waverly Place (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. However, due to projected excessive queuing in
the southbound left-turn lane along Kildaire Farm Road, the following improvement
is recommended:
       Extend the existing southbound left-turn lane storage along Kildaire Farm
          Road to provide at least 325 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.

New Waverly Place and Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended:
       Restripe the inside northbound New Waverly Place thru lane to a shared
          thru/left-turn lane.
       Restripe the outside southbound New Waverly Place thru lane to a shared
          thru/right-turn lane.




                              26
         Construct the eastbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane
         and one egress lane.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service under both the Background (2015) and Build (2015) conditions. Therefore, no
further improvements are recommended.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting
future lane configurations and traffic control for 2015 are shown in Figure 10.

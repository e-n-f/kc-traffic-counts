EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location and Description
The existing McDonald's in the northwest quadrant of Walnut Street and Meeting Street in the
Town of Cary is proposing to expand. The expansion of the McDonald's restaurant is proposed
to increase the existing facility by 1,917 square feet from 4,369 square feet to 6,286 square feet
and provide an additional drive-thru window. The number of net new trips generated by this
expansion was estimated by calculating the trip generation for the existing 4,369 square feet and
subtracting that from the calculated trips generated by the expanded 6,286 square foot facility.
Trip generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to determine
the amount of trips the site would generate. Because of the nature of this land use, a portion of
the trips generated will be pass-by trips and will be drawn from traffic already on the network.
The pass-by trips were calculated based on the standard ITE procedure and the percentages
used were based on the latest ITE data and guidance provided by NCDOT. The trip generation
summary is shown in Table 1.

The site plan for this expansion proposes to maintain the full movement access with Meeting
Street (Access 3). It also proposes to maintain the existing full movement access on the private
drive that borders the north side of the restaurant (Access 2). The existing full movement access
(Access 1) on the private drive closest to Walnut Street is proposed to be converted to a left-in
and right-out configuration. This traffic study, 12-TAR-345, analyzes the effects of the site

expansion on traffic operations in the study area. Figure ES-1 shows the study area for 12-TAR-
345 while Figure ES-2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
The net new trips generated by the expansion above what the current facility generates will
exceed the Town's 50 peak hour trip threshold for redevelopment (Land Development Ordinance,
Section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also
located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the APFO.
The projected build-out year for this expansion is 2013. This TAR analyzes the potential impacts
of the proposed redevelopment on the adjacent roadways and offers potential mitigation for those
impacts. The site plan is shown in Figure ES-2.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
   ·   05-1939 ­ Walnut Street and US1 SB ramps/Donaldson Drive (signalized)
   ·   05-0221 ­ Walnut Street and Buck Jones Road (signalized)
   ·   05-0270 ­ Walnut Street and US 1 NB ramps/Red Lobster Entrance (signalized)
   ·   9001 ­ Walnut Street and Piney Plains Road (unsignalized)
   ·   9002 ­ Walnut Street and Private Drive (McDonald's) (unsignalized)
   ·   9003 ­ Private Drive and McDonald's Access 1 (unsignalized)
   ·   9004 ­ Private Drive and McDonald's Access 2 (unsignalized)
   ·   05-1689 ­ Meeting Street and Caitboo Avenue (signalized)
   ·   05-1558 ­ Walnut Street and Meeting Street (signalized)
   ·   9005 ­ Meeting Street and McDonald's Access 3/Lowe's Access (unsignalized)
   ·   05-1732 ­ Walnut Street and Dillard Drive (signalized)
   ·   05-2198 ­ Meeting Street and Dillard Drive (signalized)
   ·   9006 ­ Dillard Drive and Piney Plains Road (unsignalized)
   ·   05-2273 ­ Walnut Street and Crossroads Ford/Centrum Shopping Center (signalized)


Traffic analyses were performed for the proposed site entrances and the study area intersections
listed above for four scenarios, specifically:
   ·   Existing (2012) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts, aerial photography, site visit, and existing signal and timing data).
   ·   Background (2013) ­ Estimates future (2013) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 1%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby developments that
       have not yet been constructed.
   ·   Combined (2013) ­ Adds the site generated traffic from the McDonald's to the
       Background (2013) volumes.
   ·   Combined and Improved (2013) ­ Analyzes potential mitigations to site traffic to provide
       acceptable levels of service based on the Town's UDO.

Background (2013) Analysis
Future traffic estimates were made based on applying a 1% average annual growth rate (AAGR)
to the 2012 balanced counts. Also, traffic from the following approved developments was
considered and incorporated as appropriate:
          ·   08-TAR-288 ­ Tryon Village East
          ·   08-TAR-292 ­ Tryon Village Subdivision
          ·   09-TAR-307 ­ Epic Games Offices
          ·   10-TAR-199a ­ Tryon Place at Cary Parkway
          ·   12-TAR-336 ­ Tryon Village Daycare Proposal

Recommendations

Two intersections fell below the APFO threshold with the additional site traffic. As such,
mitigation was recommended for these intersections which are described below and shown in
Figure ES-3 and ES-4.

   Intersection of Walnut Street and US 1 Northbound Ramps / Red Lobster Driveway
   Walnut Street and US 1 Northbound Ramps / Red Lobster Driveway operates at LOS E in the
   PM peak period. The results indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in delay
   when compared to the background analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no
   increase in delay time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the
   LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore the following mitigation
   is recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

      ·   Provide a 225' eastbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper
      ·   Restripe the eastbound approach to show two exclusive left-turn lanes and two
          exclusive right-turn lanes
      ·   Provide for both eastbound right-turn lanes to operate under protected plus permitted
          conditions

   With this mitigation, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS D, in the
   PM peak period and with less intersection delay than experienced in the 2013 Background
   scenario.

   Intersection of Meeting Street and McDonald's Access 3 / Lowe's Access:
   This intersection has one movement, the southbound shared left-turn, through and right-turn
   lane, operating at LOS E in the 2013 PM Combined conditions. This movement operates at
   LOS D in the 2013 PM Background conditions. A delay study was performed at the
   intersection of Meeting Street and McDonald's Access 3 / Lowe's Access. This study was
   conducted from 5:00 ­ 6:00 PM (which corresponds with the peak hour of the intersection
   from the previous count) on Monday, June 11. This study identifies the average time in
   queue for vehicles on the southbound approach as 8.39 seconds. Based on the delay
   methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual, this value should be adjusted by a

                                              ES-3
                                                                                  12-TAR-345
                                                                                       FINAL


   factor of 0.9 (recommended adjustment value for field delay studies), then increased by 5
   seconds (based on free flow speed of the facility and vehicles in the queue) to account for
   delay due to deceleration. Using this guidance, the field data would equate to a calculated
   delay of 12.6 seconds per vehicle.

   The Synchro-calculated delay for this movement in the 2012 PM Existing analysis was 28.8
   seconds per vehicle. Given that the total number of vehicles in our delay study was less than
   the total vehicles in the counts, an adjustment was made utilizing the same left, through and
   right-turning movement ratio from the counts. With this adjustment, Synchro reports an
   existing delay of 25.2 seconds per vehicle. This value is about 12.6 seconds per vehicle
   higher than the comparable field value. The 2013 PM Combined scenario delay at this
   location was 36.3 seconds per vehicle (based on the analysis), resulting in LOS E, and
   exceeds LOS D criteria by one second per vehicle. Based on the comparison of field data to
   analysis data in 2012, it would seem reasonable to assume that the 2013 delay should be
   adjusted by 12.6 seconds, yielding a delay of 23.7 seconds per vehicle. This value falls well
   below the threshold for LOS E (35 seconds per vehicle), resulting in LOS C. As such, it is
   believed that the operation for the southbound movement in the 2013 Combined scenario will
   be comparable to LOS C conditions.

   Based on the delay study results and given that there are alternative egress options from the
   site; no mitigation is recommended for this intersection. The delay study is located in
   Appendix J.

   Tables 2a and 2b provide a comparison of these two intersections in the 2013 Background
   and 2013 Combined and Improved conditions and shows that with the proposed mitigations
   they meet the APFO requirements.

1.       INTRODUCTION
The McDonald's Restaurant, located in the northwest quadrant of the Walnut Street and Meeting
Street intersection in Cary, is proposing to expand its current facility. The restaurant proposes to
increase its square footage by 1,917 feet from 4,369 square feet to 6,286 square feet. The site
plan for this expansion proposes to maintain the full movement access with Meeting Street
(Access 3). It also proposes to maintain the existing full movement access on the private drive
that borders the north side of the restaurant (Access 2). The existing full movement access
(Access 1) on the private drive closest to Walnut Street is proposed to be converted to a left-in
and right-out configuration. Figure 1 provides the study area and site location. All figures are
located in Appendix A.

The net new trips generated by the expansion above what the current facility generates will
exceed the Town's 50 peak hour trip threshold for redevelopment (Land Development Ordinance,
Section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also
located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as indentified in the APFO.
The projected build-out year for this expansion is 2013. This TAR analyzes the potential impacts
of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers potential mitigation for those
impacts. The site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
     ·   05-1939 ­ Walnut Street and US1 SB ramps/Donaldson Drive (signalized)
     ·   05-0221 ­ Walnut Street and Buck Jones Road (signalized)
     ·   05-0270 ­ Walnut Street and US 1 NB ramps/Red Lobster Entrance (signalized)
     ·   9001 ­ Walnut Street and Piney Plains Road (unsignalized)
     ·   9002 ­ Walnut Street and Private Drive (McDonald's) (unsignalized)
     ·   9003 ­ Private Drive and McDonald's Access 1 (unsignalized)
     ·   9004 ­ Private Drive and McDonald's Access 2 (unsignalized)
     ·   05-1689 ­ Meeting Street and Caitboo Avenue (signalized)
     ·   05-1558 ­ Walnut Street and Meeting Street (signalized)
     ·   9005 ­ Meeting Street and McDonald's Access 3/Lowe's Access (unsignalized)
     ·   05-1732 ­ Walnut Street and Dillard Drive (signalized)
     ·   05-2198 ­ Meeting Street and Dillard Drive (signalized)
     ·   9006 ­ Dillard Drive and Piney Plains Road (unsignalized)
     ·   05-2273 ­ Walnut Street and Crossroads Ford/Centrum Shopping Center (signalized)

Existing signal plans and signal timing plans were obtained from NCDOT and the Town of Cary,
as available and used in the analysis. They are located in Appendix B.

2.      EXISTING (2012) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.


        2.1.1. WALNUT STREET (SR 1313)
        Walnut Street is a major north-south thoroughfare that runs from Kildaire Farm Road in
        downtown Cary to Tryon Road to the south where it becomes Holly Springs Road.
        Walnut Street provides access to US 1 in southwestern Wake County. The typical
        section of Walnut Street within the study area limits is a median-divided six-lane roadway
        and is posted at 45 mph. Walnut Street had a 2009 AADT (annual average daily traffic)
        ranging from 29,000 vehicles per day in between Meeting Street and Dillard Drive to
        36,000 vehicles per day between the US 1 northbound ramps and Piney Plains Road
        (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).


        2.1.2. US 1 / US 64
        US 1 / US 64 is a major east-west highway that is fully access controlled within the study
        area. The typical section of US 1 / US 64 within the study limits is an eight-lane median
        divided highway south of Walnut Street. The US 1 / US 64 typical section narrows to a
        four-lane median divided highway northeast of the study area. US1 / US 64 had a 2009
        (annual average daily traffic) from 113,000 vehicles per day south of Walnut Street to
        126,000 vehicles per day just north of Walnut Street (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic
        volume map).


        2.1.3. DONALDSON DRIVE
        Donaldson Drive is a local north-south facility that connects Walnut Street and
        Nottingham Drive. Donaldson Drive serves residential development and had direct
        access across from the US 1 southbound ramps. Donaldson Drive is not a state-
        maintained roadway, so AADT data was not available for this facility.


        2.1.4. BUCK JONES ROAD (SR 1315)
        Buck Jones Road is an east-west connector that runs from Walnut Street in the Town of
        Cary to Jones Franklin Road just south of Western Boulevard in the City of Raleigh. Buck
        Jones Road has a posted speed of 45 mph and a five lane typical section within the study
        limits. Buck Jones Road had a 2009 AADT of 17,000 vehicles per day just northeast of
        its intersection with Walnut Street (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).


                                                 2
                                                                                  12-TAR-345
                                                                                       FINAL


   2.1.5. PINEY PLAINS ROAD (SR 1423)
   Piney Plains Road is a north-south collector road that runs from Walnut Street to Tryon
   Road where it becomes Lochmere Drive and continues to Kildaire Farm Road. The
   typical section within the study limits is a two-lane roadway from Walnut Street to Dillard
   Drive, where it becomes a five-lane roadway. The Town of Cary's Comprehensive
   Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies the vision to widen Piney Plains Road from a 2-lane
   facility to a 4-lane median-divided or five-lane facility in the future. Piney Plains Road had
   a 2009 AADT of 8,300 vehicles per day just north of its intersection with Tryon Road
   (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).


   2.1.6. MEETING STREET
   Meeting Street is a local north-south road that runs from Caitboo Avenue in the
   Crossroads Shopping Center southwest to Dillard Drive. The typical section of Meeting
   Street within the study limits is a two-lane roadway. Meeting Street is not a state-
   maintained roadway, so AADT data was not available for this facility.


   2.1.7. CAITBOO AVENUE
   Caitboo Avenue is a local road that runs from Crossroads Boulevard just east of US 1 /
   US 64 to Crossroads Boulevard just west of Jones Franklin Road. Caitboo Avenue
   serves as a connection to residences, a hotel, retail, and offices in the southern portion of
   the Crossroads Shopping Center. The typical section of Caitboo Avenue within the study
   limits is a four-lane, undivided roadway. Caitboo Avenue is not a state-maintained
   roadway, so AADT data was not available for this facility.


   2.1.8. DILLARD DRIVE
   Dillard Drive is an east-west connector road that runs from Tryon Road in the City of
   Raleigh to Piney Plains Road in the Town of Cary. The typical section of Dillard Drive
   within the study limits is a four-lane, median-divided roadway. Dillard Drive had a 2009
   AADT of 11,000 vehicles per day just west of its intersection with Walnut Street and
   13,000 vehicles per day just east of its intersection with Walnut Street (based on the 2009
   NCDOT traffic volume map).


2.2.       Existing Intersections
This section of the TAR describes the existing intersections within the study area. Walnut
Street was considered to run north/south except at its intersections with the US 1 Southbound
Ramps/Donaldson Drive and Buck Jones Road intersections, where it was considered an
east/west facility. All intersections are within the Town Limits of Cary. Intersection
geometrics are provided in Figures 3.1 and 3.2.

                                                                             12-TAR-345
                                                                                  FINAL


·   Northbound: One exclusive left-turn lane with 440 feet of storage, two through lanes
    and one full right turn-lane

·   Southbound: Two through lanes and one shared through and right-turn lane (which
    operates under yield control)


2.2.4. WALNUT STREET AND PINEY PLAINS ROAD (UNSIGNALIZED) (9001)
This intersection is currently unsignalized with the eastbound approach stop controlled.
The current laneage is as follows (and is shown on Figure 3.1):

·   Eastbound: One full right-turn lane (stop-controlled)

·   Northbound: Four through lanes (two of these are extensions of the right-turn and left-
    turn lanes from the downstream intersection)

·   Southbound: Three through lanes (one lane is an extension of a left-turn lane at the
    Walnut Street and Meeting Street intersection) and one shared through and right-turn
    lane


2.2.5. WALNUT STREET AND PRIVATE DRIVE (MCDONALD 'S ACCESS)
    (UNSIGNALIZED) (9002)
This intersection is currently unsignalized with the eastbound approach stop-controlled.
The current laneage is as follows (and is shown on Figure 3.2):

·   Eastbound: One full right-turn lane (stop-controlled)

·   Northbound: Three through lanes (one of these is an extension of the northbound
    right-turn lane at the Walnut Street US 1 / Red Lobster intersection)

·   Southbound: Five through lanes (two of these are extensions of left-turn lanes at the
    downstream intersection) and one shared through and right-turn lane which develops
    at this intersection


2.2.6. PRIVATE DRIVE AND MCDONALD 'S ACCESS 1 (UNSIGNALIZED) (9003)
This intersection is currently unsignalized with the northbound approach stop-controlled.
A field investigation revealed that the signing and pavement marking at this intersection
designates the northbound approach as an egress only movement. However, the counts
conducted at this intersection showed that vehicles are making movements that are
restricted. The laneage coded into Synchro is as follows (and is shown on Figure 3.2):

·   Eastbound: A shared through and right-turn lane

                                                                                    FINAL


·   Westbound: A shared through and left-turn lane

·   Northbound: A shared left and right-turn lane (stop-controlled)


2.2.7. PRIVATE DRIVE AND MCDONALD 'S ACCESS 2 (UNSIGNALIZED) (9004)
This intersection is currently unsignalized. A field investigation revealed that there are no
stop signs in place at any approach and only a pavement marking for a stop bar on the
eastbound approach. Because Synchro will not provide level of service (LOS) or delay
for this type of configuration, the intersection control for the site used was stop control on
the northbound and southbound approaches. The laneage configuration coded into
Synchro is as follows (and is shown on Figure 3.2):

·   Eastbound: A shared left, through and right-turn lane

·   Westbound: A shared left, through and right-turn lane

·   Northbound: A shared left, through and right-turn lane (stop-controlled)

·   Southbound: A shared left, through and right-turn lane (stop controlled)


2.2.8. MEETING STREET AND CAITBOO AVENUE (05-1689)
This intersection is currently signalized. The current laneage is as follows (and is shown
on Figure 3.2):

·   Eastbound: One full left-turn lane, a shared through and left-turn lane and one full
    right-turn lane

·   Westbound: This leg is a single lane egress

·   Northbound: Two exclusive left-turn lanes (one full lane and one with 270 feet of
    storage) and a shared through and right-turn lane

·   Southbound: An exclusive left-turn lane with 80 feet of storage, one shared through
    and right-turn lane and one full right-turn lane


2.2.9. WALNUT STREET AND MEETING STREET (05-1558)
This intersection is currently signalized. The current laneage is as follows (and is shown
on Figure 3.2):

·   Eastbound: Two exclusive left-turn lanes (one full left-turn lane and one with 160 feet
    of storage), one through lane and one exclusive right-turn lane with 160 feet of
    storage

    (UNSIGNALIZED) (9005)
This intersection is currently unsignalized with the northbound and southbound
approaches stop-controlled. The current laneage is as follows (and is shown on Figure
3.2):

·   Eastbound: A shared left, through and right-turn lane

·   Westbound: An exclusive left-turn lane with 70 feet of storage, one through lane and
    one full right-turn lane

·   Northbound: A shared left, through and right-turn lane. (stop-controlled)

·   Southbound: A shared left, through and right-turn lane. (stop-controlled)


2.2.11.        WALNUT STREET AND DILLARD DRIVE (05-1732)

  2.3.        Turning Movement Counts
  Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
  May 2012. The count data is located in Appendix C. These counts were taken to provide
  current volumes and assist in determining the directional splits of existing traffic. The count
  volumes were balanced in areas where appropriate and grown one year to estimate 2013
  volumes. Counts taken in April 2012 for two intersections in the study area were used to
  supplement the May 2012 counts in order to make balancing decisions for the PM peak
  period. The volumes that were used in the analyses are shown on Figures 4.1 and 4.2 and
  the volume calculations are located in Appendix D. The following table, Table 1, lists the
  time and place counts were conducted.

2.4. Level of Service Criteria for Stop-controlled and Signalized
     Intersections
The criteria for level of service of a signalized intersection is provided in Table 2 below.

Exhibit 17-2 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are provided in Table 3 below.

The proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone which is
described in Section 3.23.3 of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO). For areas located
within the Base Benefit Zone, the level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from
this TAR are based on achieving a LOS D or better for all intersections located within the
study area (measured overall for signalized intersections and by movement for unsignalized
intersections) currently operating at LOS D or better or not increasing overall intersection

delay for those intersections having a level of service worse than LOS D without the
development in the buildout year.


2.5.       Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing laneage network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. The following Synchro coding
assumptions were made for existing conditions and included in all future analyses unless
otherwise noted:

   ·   A default value of four vehicles was input for movements where zero vehicles were
       counted based on NCDOT's Capacity Analysis Guidelines. The only exceptions to
       this were site access locations. In these locations, movements that had zero count
       volumes were left at zero.
   ·   The Red Lobster Driveway directly opposite the US 1 northbound ramps intersection
       at Walnut Street operates as a right-in/right-out only with the westbound right-turn
       stop-controlled rather than included in the signal phasing. In order to obtain
       appropriate signalized intersection results from Synchro that represented actual
       conditions, the northbound and westbound right-turning movements at the Walnut
       Street and US 1 northbound ramps/Red Lobster Entrance were coded separately from
       the signal. However, the level of service and delay reported for the westbound right-
       turn will not exactly replicate field conditions due to this adjustment in coding and the
       fact its operations rely so heavily on the signal operations. However given the minor
       volume and the fact it is a right-turn only, the results of the TAR are not expected to
       be affected by this coding modification.
   ·   At the intersection of Walnut Street and Private Drive (McDonald's Access), the
       number of southbound lanes on Walnut Street exceeds the allowable amount that
       HCM procedures allow for unsignalized analysis. To provide analysis results, the
       number of lanes was reduced to the maximum allowed for unsignalized analysis and
       that level of service and delay was reported. In all instances, the level of service and
       delay were better than the LOS D threshold described in Section 2.4 above. It is
       assumed that if the intersection operates acceptably with the reduced laneage, then it
       should perform acceptably with the actual laneage.

Levels of service and delay were reported for each yielding movement at unsignalized
intersections. For signalized intersections, levels of service and delay were reported for the
signal as a whole. The summary of the findings are located in Tables 4a and 4b below.

3.      BACKGROUND (2013) CONDITIONS
     3.1.       Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information, developing land uses in the area, and information in
     adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth rate of 1% was assumed for the study
     area. This growth rate was applied to the existing volumes (2012) to determine the projected
     volumes for the Background (2013) analysis. . There were also additional trips added to
     account for approved developments that are not yet constructed. These trips were based on
     other TARs provided by the Town of Cary. All additional developments are as follows and
     described in the sections below.         Previously analyzed development trip generation
     information is located in Appendix F. The approved development trips included in the
     background traffic volumes are shown in Figures 5.1 and 5.2. The total approved
     development site trips included in the 2013 analyses can be found on Figures 6.1 and 6.2.

        3.1.1. 08-TAR-288 ­ TRYON VILLAGE EAST
        This TAR was conducted for the parcel in the southeast quadrant of the Walnut Street
        and Macedonia Road intersection. At the time that 08-TAR-288 was completed, the
        development was to be a mixed use development. Based on information provided by the
        Town of Cary's planning department, the Town never received a site plan for the Tryon
        Village East parcel. Therefore, the site traffic from this TAR will not be included in
        background traffic.


        3.1.2. 08-TAR-292 ­ TRYON VILLAGE SUBDIVISION
        The TAR for this development was conducted for the townhome community that is
        located west of Walnut Street between Tryon Road and Macedonia Road. It was
        determined, in the site visit taken for this TAR, that the townhome community has been
        built out and it appeared to be fully occupied. Therefore, due to the traffic generated by
        this development being accounted for in the traffic counts performed, the site traffic from
        this TAR will not be added to the background traffic.

   3.1.3. 09-TAR-307 ­ EPIC GAMES OFFICES
   Epic Games' offices are a development in the southeastern quadrant of the intersection of
   Crossroads Boulevard and Caitboo Avenue. The proposed development included three
   phases of office buildings. It appears that two out of the three phases have been built.
   Based on information provided by the Town of Cary's planning department, approval of
   the site plan for the third phase will not expire until 2017. Therefore, site trips from Phase
   3 of this development will be added to the background traffic and included in this analysis.


   3.1.4. 10-TAR-199A ­ TRYON PLACE AT CARY PARKWAY
   Tryon Place at Cary Parkway is a planned apartment complex located in the southeast
   quadrant of Tryon Road and Cary Parkway south and west of the study area. The TAR
   for this development states that it is to be completed by 2012 and is planned to consist of
   256 mid-rise apartments. The only site trips from this development that may affect this
   network are distributed to/from Piney Plains Road at Tryon Road. These trips are
   relatively low (a maximum of ten vehicles) and are assumed to be distributed among the
   retail or office land uses in the Crossroads Shopping Center and vicinity. However, given
   the very low volume of traffic anticipated to reach this study area, these site trips are
   assumed to be accounted for in the background growth rate and were not added to the
   background traffic.


   3.1.5. 12-TAR-336 ­ TRYON VILLAGE DAYCARE PROPOSAL
   This proposed daycare is located within the Tryon Village development located south of
   our study area. The daycare is proposed to be completed in 2012. Although there are no
   common intersections between 12-TAR-336 and our study area, a portion of the site trips
   from 12-TAR-336 are utilizing Walnut Street. Therefore, the site trips from this adjacent
   development will be distributed as through trips through the network. These trips are
   added to the background traffic and included in this analysis.


3.2.       Level of Service Analysis
Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2013) AM and PM peak hours which includes the approved development site
trips described in the above section along with the annual growth of existing traffic using the
1% annual growth rate. This analysis will be used as the base case to determine the impacts
for the expansion of the McDonald's development.

Based on guidance from the Town of Cary, the signal splits were optimized in Synchro where
it seemed appropriate based on operations and evaluated for reasonableness. The existing
cycle length and offsets were maintained in order to maintain coordination. Based upon the
analysis and operations, this optimization in Synchro was only performed for the intersection

of Walnut Street and US 1 NB Ramps / Red Lobster Driveway which operated at LOS E in
the 2012 AM and PM peak periods with considerable queuing predicted by Synchro.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2013) analysis are shown by Figures 6.1
and 6.2. The summary of the level of service analysis for the Background (2013) conditions
is reported in Tables 5a and Table 5b.

     splits, all signalized intersections except one operate at or above the LOS D threshold for the
     Base Benefit Transportation Zone. As in the 2012 Existing analysis, the intersection of
     Walnut Street and US 1 NB Ramps/Red Lobster Entrance operates at LOS E. However, with
     the optimized signal splits, the AM peak period operations improve to LOS D from LOS E.
     Only during the PM peak period does it fall below the LOS D threshold, operating at LOS E.
     The 2013 Background Synchro analyses are located in Appendix G.




4.      COMBINED (2013) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Zone and therefore recommendations will be based on a level of service standard of "D".


     4.1.       Trip Generation
     The expansion of the McDonald's restaurant is proposed to increase the existing facility by
     1,917 square feet from 4,369 square feet to 6,286 square feet and provide an additional drive
     thru window. The number of net new trips generated by this expansion was estimated by
     calculating the trip generation for the existing 4,369 square feet and subtracting that from the
     calculated trips generated by the expanded 6,286 square foot facility. Trip generation rates
     were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to determine the amount of trips
     the site would generate. Because of the nature of this land use, a portion of the trips
     generated will be pass-by trips and will be drawn from traffic already on the network. The
     pass-by trips were calculated based on the standard ITE procedure and the percentages
     used were based on the latest ITE data and guidance provided by NCDOT. The trip
     generation summary is shown in Table 6 below.

4.2.       Trip Distribution
Access to the McDonald's Restaurant is proposed to remain at its current driveways, however
changes are proposed to site traffic flow. One full-movement driveway is provided on the
Private Drive (Access 2) and one full-movement driveway is provided on Meeting Street
(Access 3). One existing driveway on the Private Drive (Access 1) is proposed to be
converted to a left-in and right-out configuration. Northbound left-turning vehicles were
rerouted to reflect this restriction. Trip distribution was estimated based on count data from
nearby intersections, and from knowledge of local trip attractions and destinations in the area.
The primary site distribution percentages are shown on Figures 7.1 and 7.2 and the primary
site trips are shown on Figures 8.1 and 8.2. Figures 9.1 and 9.2 provide the pass-by trip
distributions while Figures 10.1 and 10.2 provide the pass-by site trips. Figures 11.1 and
11.2 provide the summation of the primary site trips and the pass-by trips which results in the
net volume change at the network intersections. The trip generation and distribution
calculations are located in Appendix D.


4.3.       Combined (2013) Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2013) scenario consists of the background with approved development traffic
as determined in Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the net new site generated trips from the
expansion of the McDonald's restaurant. The volumes that are used in the Combined (2013)
analysis are shown in Figures 12.1 and 12.2. The laneage used for the 2013 Combined
scenario is based on the existing laneage provided by Figures 3.1 and 3.2 with the addition
of driveway modifications provided by the site plan, which is shown in Figure 2.

As in the Background (2013) scenario, the signal splits at the intersection of Walnut Street
and US 1 NB Ramps / Red Lobster Driveway were optimized as described in Section 3.2
above.

Since there are no new intersections provided by the expansion of the McDonald's, level of
service analyses were performed for all existing intersections with the modifications as noted
above. A summary of the levels of service are found in Tables 7a and 7b below.

   As seen in Table 7a and 7b, most intersections experience little to no change between the
   2013 Background and 2013 Combined scenarios. However, as with the 2012 Existing and
   2013 Background analyses, one signalized intersection operates at LOS E in the PM Peak
   period. The results provided in Table 7a indicate that this intersection shows an overall

increase in delay of 0.9 seconds per vehicle when compared to the 2013 Background
analyses. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for
signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit
Transportation Zone. Therefore, additional improvements will be required at this intersection
in order to mitigate the increase in delay. The proposed improvements are described in
Section 4.4.

Based on the 2013 Combined analyses, one unsignalized intersection has a movement that
operates below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. The
southbound movement for the Meeting Street and Access 3/Lowe's Access intersection
operates at LOS E in the PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7b above indicate
that the failing movement at this intersection experiences an increase in LOS and delay when
compared to the background analyses. As noted above, this intersection will require
additional mitigation which is described in Section 4.4. The 2013 Combined Synchro
analyses are located in Appendix H.

The following provides the results of the 2013 Combined analysis and how they relate to the
APFO requirements.

Intersection of Walnut Street and US 1 SB Ramps / Donaldson Drive
This intersection operates at LOS C in the AM and PM peak periods.             Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Walnut Street and Buck Jones Road
This intersection operates at LOS A in the AM peak period and LOS C in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Walnut Street and US 1 NB Ramps / Red Lobster Driveway
This intersection operates at LOS E in the PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7a,
above, indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in delay when compared to
the background analysis. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is
allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the
Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, mitigation is required at this intersection in
order to meet the APFO requirements. These improvements are described in Section 4.4.
Also, since the stop controlled westbound right-turn is anticipated to operate at LOS A, no
mitigation beyond that mentioned above is required to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Walnut Street and Piney Plains Road
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS B, this intersection does not require
mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Walnut Street and Private Drive (McDonald's Access)
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better, this intersection does not
require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Private Drive and McDonald's Access 1
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS A, this intersection does not require
mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Although the Synchro results indicate this intersection should operate acceptably with
minimal queuing, it should be noted that the distance to the intersection of the Private Drive
and Walnut Street is approximately 100 feet, which is the minimum required by NCDOT
before crossing or left-turning conflicts are allowed.

Intersection of Private Drive and McDonald's Access 2
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS B or better, this intersection does not
require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Meeting Street and Caitboo Avenue
This intersection operates at LOS B in the AM peak period and LOS C in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Walnut Street and Meeting Street
This intersection operates at LOS C in the AM peak period and LOS D in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Meeting Street and McDonald's Access 3 / Lowe's Access
This intersection has one movement, the southbound shared left-turn, through and right-turn
lane, which operates at LOS E with the addition of site trips in the PM peak period. A delay
study was performed to estimate the actual delay for this movement to help determine if
mitigation was required. This is detailed in Section 4.4.

Intersection of Walnut Street and Dillard Drive
This intersection operates at LOS C in the AM and PM peak periods.            Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Meeting Street and Dillard Drive
This intersection operates at LOS A in the AM peak period and LOS C in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Dillard Drive and Piney Plains Road
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS C or better, this intersection does not
require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

Intersection of Walnut Street and Crossroads Ford / Centrum Shopping Center
This intersection operates at LOS A in the AM peak period and LOS B in the PM peak period.
Therefore, this intersection does not require mitigation to meet APFO requirements.

In summary, as with the 2013 Background analysis, one unsignalized intersection operates at
LOS E in the PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7a indicate that this intersection

shows an overall increase in delay when compared to the 2013 Background analyses. Based
on Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for signalized intersections
with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone.
Therefore, mitigation will be required at this intersection in order to meet the APFO
requirements. This mitigation is described Section 4.4 below.

One unsignalized intersection has a movement that operates at LOS E. The Meeting Street
and McDonald's Access 3 / Lowe's Access southbound shared left-turn, thorough and right-
turn movement operations degrade from LOS D to LOS E with the addition of site trips.
Therefore, this intersection will require mitigation in order to meet the LOS D threshold and/or
delay requirements. The 2013 Combined Synchro analyses are located in Appendix H.


4.4.       Combined (2013) Improved Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2013) Improved scenario consists of improvements shown on the site plan
(Figure 2) as well as additional mitigations that are proposed in order to meet the LOS D
threshold or show no increase in overall intersection delay if the intersection operates below
LOS D in the background condition as noted in Section 4.3. The intersections requiring
mitigation are listed below, along with the proposed mitigation. The 2013 Combined with
Improvements Synchro analyses are located in Appendix I.

Intersection of Walnut Street and US 1 Northbound Ramps / Red Lobster Driveway
Walnut Street and US 1 Northbound Ramps / Red Lobster Driveway operates at LOS E in the
PM peak period. The results provided in Table 7a, above, indicate that this intersection
shows an overall increase in delay when compared to the background analysis. Based on
Section 3.23.3 of the LDO, no increase in delay time is allowed for signalized intersections
with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone.
Therefore the following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's APFO:

   ·   Provide a 225' eastbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper
   ·   Restripe the eastbound approach to show two exclusive left-turn lanes and two
       exclusive right-turn lanes
   ·   Provide for both eastbound right-turn lanes to operate under protected plus permitted
       conditions

With this mitigation, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS D, in the
PM peak period and with less intersection delay than experienced in the 2013 Background
scenario.

Intersection of Meeting Street and McDonald's Access 3 / Lowe's Access:
This intersection has one movement, the southbound shared left-turn, through and right-turn
lane, operating at LOS E in the 2013 PM Combined conditions. This movement operates at
LOS D in the 2013 PM Background conditions. A delay study was performed at the
intersection of Meeting Street and McDonald's Access 3 / Lowe's Access. This study was

conducted from 5:00 ­ 6:00 PM (which corresponds with the peak hour of the intersection
from the previous count) on Monday, June 11. This study identifies the average time in
queue for vehicles on the southbound approach as 8.39 seconds. Based on the delay
methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual, this value should be adjusted by a
factor of 0.9 (recommended adjustment value for field delay studies), then increased by 5
seconds (based on free flow speed of the facility and vehicles in the queue) to account for
delay due to deceleration. Using this guidance, the field data would equate to a calculated
delay of 12.6 seconds per vehicle.

The Synchro-calculated delay for this movement in the 2012 PM Existing analysis was 28.8
seconds per vehicle. Given that the total number of vehicles in our delay study was less than
the total vehicles in the counts, an adjustment was made utilizing the same left, through and
right-turning movement ratio from the counts. With this adjustment, Synchro reports an
existing delay of 25.2 seconds per vehicle. This value is about 12.6 seconds per vehicle
higher than the comparable field value. The 2013 PM Combined scenario delay at this
location was 36.3 seconds per vehicle (based on the analysis), resulting in LOS E, and
exceeds LOS D criteria by one second per vehicle. Based on the comparison of field data to
analysis data in 2012, it would seem reasonable to assume that the 2013 delay should be
adjusted by 12.6 seconds, yielding a delay of 23.7 seconds per vehicle. This value falls well
below the threshold for LOS E (35 seconds per vehicle), resulting in LOS C. As such, it is
believed that the operation for the southbound movement in the 2013 Combined scenario will
be comparable to LOS C conditions.

Based on the delay study results and given that there are alternative egress options from the
site; no mitigation is recommended for this intersection. The delay study is located in
Appendix J.

A summary of the intersection levels of service with mitigation is found in Table 8a and 8b
below.

   intersections operates at an overall LOS D in the AM and PM peak periods and show
   improved operations when compared to 2013 Background conditions. Table 8b also
   indicates all unsignalized intersection movements for the Meeting Street and McDonald's
   Access 3 / Lowe's Access operate at LOS D or better. This is accounting for the delay
   adjustment for the southbound shared left-turn, through, and right-turn lane at Meeting Street
   and McDonald's Access 3 / Lowe's Access, which was described in Section 4.4. The
   recommended build laneage in 2013 for the proposed McDonald's restaurant expansion is
   shown on Figures 13.1 and 13.2.

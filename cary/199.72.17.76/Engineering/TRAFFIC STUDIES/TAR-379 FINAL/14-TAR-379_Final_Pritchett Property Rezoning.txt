EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location and Description
The Town of Cary has received a proposal for rezoning a parcel located on the eastern side of
Holly Springs Road across from the Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway intersection. The
parcel is currently zoned residential (R-40) and is proposed to be rezoned to a mix of transitional
residential (TR-CU) and a higher density residential use (R-12-CU). The proposed land use is to
provide 123 single family homes on this parcel. Trip generation rates were used from the ITE
Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition to determine the number of trips the site would generate.
The trip generation summary is shown in Table 1.

The site plan for this parcel proposes one full-movement access and one right-in/right-out access
on Holly Springs Road. The proposed full-movement access will provide a fourth leg to the Holly
Springs Road and Cary Parkway intersection. This traffic study, 14-TAR-379, analyzes the
effects of the proposed Pritchett Property development on traffic operations in the study area.
Figure ES-1 shows the study area for 14-TAR-379 while Figure ES-2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
The number of trips generated by the Pritchett Property development will exceed the Town's 100
peak hour trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.4.1)
and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Town's LDO Section
7.11.6. The projected build-out year for this development is 2017. This TAR analyzes the
potential impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers potential
improvements for those impacts as necessary.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
       05-2269 ­ Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Road (signalized)
       05-2100 ­ Tryon Road and Holly Springs Road/Walnut Street (signalized)
       05-2178 ­ Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
       05-0127 ­ Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
       05-1793 ­ Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Access 1 (signalized)
       9001 ­ Holly Springs Road and Proposed Access 2 (Combined scenarios only)
                                           ES-1
                                                                                     14-TAR-379



Traffic analyses were performed for the study area intersections listed above for four scenarios,
specifically:
       Existing (2013) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts, aerial photography, site visit, and existing signal and timing data).
       Background (2017) ­ Estimates future (2017) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 1.5%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby developments that
       have not yet been constructed.
       Combined (2017) ­ Adds the site generated traffic from the proposed development to the
       Background (2017) volumes.
       Combined and Improved (2017) ­ If necessary, analyzes potential improvements to
       provide acceptable levels of service based on the Town's LDO.

Background (2017) Analysis
Future year traffic estimates were made based on applying an overall average annual growth
rate (AAGR) to the 2013 balanced counts. An AAGR of 1.5% was assumed for the study area.
Also, traffic from the following approved developments was considered and incorporated as
appropriate:
              09-TAR-307 Epic Games Offices
              10-TAR-199a Tryon Place at Cary Parkway
              12-TAR-345 Walnut McDonald's
              13-TAR-362 Franklin Apartments
              13-TAR-371 SECU Rezoning

Findings Based on LDO Requirements
All signalized intersections operate at or better than the LDO threshold with the additional site
traffic. However; the Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies Holly
Springs Road as a four-lane divided facility with a landscaped median. Therefore, meeting CTP
requirements should be considered and are described below. The unsignalized site drive
intersection was evaluated with both Synchro and SimTraffic. The proposed Build laneage is
shown in Figure ES-3.

   Intersection of Holly Springs Road and Proposed Access 2
   Based on the Town's CTP, Holly Springs Road is to be widened from a two-lane undivided
   facility to a four-lane median-divided facility with 100 feet of right-of-way in this area. Since
   the frontage of the Pritchett Property development is located on this section of Holly Springs
   Road, the Town of Cary requires that the development provide right-of-way and pavement for
   half of the ultimate four-lane median-divided roadway along the frontage of the property to
   conform to the CTP. The pavement along the property frontage should be striped so as to
   maintain a single through lane along Holly Springs Road and the additional lane provided per
   the CTP should not be marked for use. The following improvement is required to meet the
   Town's CTP:
                                              ES-2
                                                                                     14-TAR-379



          Provide additional pavement to accommodate a future northbound through lane on
          Holly Springs Road along the property frontage in accordance with the Town's
          Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

   In addition to the Town of Cary's LDO and CTP requirements, because Holly Springs Road is
   maintained by NCDOT, the NCDOT nomograph for turn lanes was evaluated for this access.
   Based on this evaluation, no additional turn lanes are required for Proposed Access 2 to
   satisfy NCDOT requirements.

   Intersection of Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Access 1
   This intersection does not require improvements to meet the LDO requirements; however,
   according to the Town's CTP, Holly Springs Road is to be widened from a two -lane undivided
   facility to a four-lane median-divided facility with 100 feet of right-of-way in this area. Since
   the frontage of the Pritchett Property development is located on this section of Holly Springs
   Road, the Town of Cary requires that the development provide right-of-way and pavement for
   half of the ultimate four-lane median-divided roadway along the frontage of the property to
   conform to the CTP.

   Given additional pavement is required to meet the Town's CTP requirements , it is
   recommended the additional pavement on the northbound approach of this intersection be
   striped as a right-turn lane. The findings indicate the following improvement will meet the
   Town's CTP.

          Provide a northbound right-turn lane on Holly Springs Road along the property
          frontage.

Table 2a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the Background (2017),
Combined (2017), and Combined Improved (2017) conditions. The results provided in Table 2a
show that all signalized intersections operate at or better than the LOS D threshold in the
Combined (2017) conditions and do not require improvements to meet LDO requirements.

Table 2b provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersection in the Combined (2017) and
Combined Improved (2017) conditions. As indicated in Table 2b, based on SimTraffic
observations and Synchro and SimTraffic results, no improvements were proposed for the Holly
Springs Road and Proposed Access 2 intersection.

1.      INTRODUCTION
The Town of Cary has received a proposal for rezoning a parcel located on the eastern side of
Holly Springs Road across from the Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway intersection. The
parcel is currently zoned residential (R-40) and is proposed to be rezoned to a mix of transitional
residential (TR-CU) and a higher density residential use (R-12-CU). The proposed land use is to
provide 123 single family homes on this parcel. The site plan for this parcel proposes one full-
movement access and one right-in/right-out access on Holly Springs Road. The proposed full-
movement access will provide a fourth leg to the Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway
intersection. Figure 1 provides the study area and site location. All figures are located in
Appendix A.

The number of trips generated by the Pritchett Property development will exceed the Town's 100
peak hour trip threshold for development (Land Development Ordinance (LDO), Section 3.4.1)
and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" as identified in the Town's LDO Section
7.11.6. The projected build-out year for this development is 2017. This TAR analyzes the
potential impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers potential
improvements for those impacts as necessary. The site plan for the Pritchett Property is shown
in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number
is provided before the intersection name):
        05-2269 ­ Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Road (signalized)
        05-2100 ­ Tryon Road and Holly Springs Road/Walnut Street (signalized)
        05-2178 ­ Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
        05-0127 ­ Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
        05-1793 ­ Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Access 1 (signalized)
        9001 ­ Holly Springs Road and Proposed Access 2 (Combined scenarios only)

Existing signal plans and signal timing plans were obtained from NCDOT and the Town of Cary,
as available, and used in the analysis. The signal plans and signal timing plans are located in
Appendix B.



2.      EXISTING (2013) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.



                                                 1
                                                                            14-TAR-379



2.1.1. WALNUT STREET (SR 1313)
Walnut Street is a major north-south thoroughfare that serves numerous land uses in the
Town of Cary. Walnut Street runs from Kildaire Farm Road in downtown Cary on the
north end to Tryon Road on the south end where it becomes Holly Springs Road. Walnut
Street provides access to US 1/US 64 in southwestern Wake County as well as the
Crossroads and Centrum shopping centers, multiple residences, Cary Towne Center, and
downtown Cary. The typical section of Walnut Street within the study area is a median-
divided six-lane roadway and has a posted speed limit of 45 mph. Walnut Street had a
2011 AADT (annual average daily traffic) ranging from 19,000 vehicles per day in
between Macedonia Road and Dillard Drive to 29,000 vehicles per day just north of
Dillard Drive (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

2.1.2. HOLLY SPRINGS ROAD (SR 1152)
Walnut Street changes names to Holly Springs Road south of its intersection with Tryon
Road. Holly Springs Road continues as a north-south connector that runs from the Tryon
Road intersection to NC 55 in Holly Springs. The typical section of Holly Springs Road
within the study area is a two-lane undivided roadway south of Jones Franklin Road that
widens to a divided roadway with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes
between Jones Franklin Road and Tryon Road. The Town of Cary's Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies the vision to widen Holly Springs Road to a four-lane
median-divided facility in the future. Holly Springs Road has a posted speed limit of 45
mph within the study limits. Holly Springs Road had a 2011 AADT ranging from 14,000
vehicles per day in between Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road to 21,000 vehicles per
day south of Jones Franklin Road (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

2.1.3. TRYON ROAD (SR 1009)
Tryon Road is a major east-west connector that serves numerous land uses from
business to retail to residential. Tryon Road begins at the US 1 and US 64 interchange
and ends in Garner, NC at Garner Road. The typical section of Tryon Road within the
study area limits is a median-divided four-lane roadway and it has a posted speed limit of
45 mph. Tryon Road had a 2011 AADT ranging from 17,000 vehicles per day just west of
the study limits to 28,000 vehicles per day just east of the study limits (based on 2011
NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

2.1.4. JONES FRANKLIN ROAD (SR 1319)
Jones Franklin Road is a major north-south connector that runs from Hillsborough Street
in Raleigh to Holly Springs Road in Cary. Jones Franklin Road also forms a partial
cloverleaf interchange with I-440 and US 1 north of the study area. The typical section of
Jones Franklin Road within the study limits is a two-lane undivided roadway. Jones
Franklin Road had 2011 AADTs of 8,100 vehicles per day between Holly Springs Road
and Tryon Road, 11,000 vehicles per day between Tryon Road and Macedonia Road,


                                        2

   and 9,800 vehicles per day north of Macedonia Road (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic
   volume GIS data).

   2.1.5. CARY PARKWAY (SR 3977)
   Cary Parkway is a major connector that runs from Harrison Avenue in northern Cary to
   Holly Springs Road in southeastern Cary, providing a partial loop around western Cary
   and serving multiple land uses. The typical section of Cary Parkway in the study area is a
   four-lane median-divided roadway. Cary Parkway has a posted speed limit of 45 mph.
   Cary Parkway had a 2011 AADT of 9,400 vehicles per day just west of the study limits
   (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic volume GIS data).

2.2.       Existing Intersections
All intersections within the study area that were analyzed are listed in Section 1 of this report
and are within the Town Limits of Cary, except the Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway
intersection, which is within the Town of Cary's ETJ. Intersection geometrics along with
intersection operation controls are provided in Figure 3.

2.3.       Turning Movement Counts
Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
February and September 2013 for all intersections. The count data is located in Appendix C.
These counts were taken to provide current volumes and assist in determining the directional
splits of existing traffic. The count volumes were balanced in areas where appropriate based
on access points between count locations and grown four years at the determined growth
rate (discussed in Section 3.1) to estimate 2017 volumes. The volumes that were used in the
2013 Existing analyses are shown on Figure 4 and the volume calculations are located in
Appendix D. Table 1 lists the time and place counts were conducted.

2.4. Level of Service Criteria for Stop-controlled and Signalized
     Intersections
Exhibit 18-4 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
signalized intersections. The criteria for level of service of a signalized intersection are
provided in Table 2 below.

            Table 2: Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections
                   Level of Service Average Control Delay (sec/veh)

                          F                       >50


The proposed Pritchett Property development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Zone, which is described in Section 7.11.6 of the LDO. For areas located within the
Base Benefit Zone, the level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are
based on achieving a LOS D or better for all intersections located within the study area
(measured overall for signalized intersections and by movement for unsignalized
intersections) currently operating at LOS D or better or not increasing delay (overall
intersection delay for signalized and movement for unsignalized) for those
intersections/movements having a level of service worse than LOS D without the Pritchett
Property development in the build-out year.

2.5.      Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions.

All of the existing analyzed intersections are currently signalized. For the signalized
intersections, levels of service and delay were reported for the signal as a whole. The
summary of the findings are located in Table 4 below.

     As shown by Table 4, all signalized intersections currently operate at or better than the LOS
     D threshold for the Base Benefit Zone in both the AM and PM peak periods.

     The 2013 Existing analysis results are located in Appendix E.



3.      BACKGROUND (2017) CONDITIONS
     3.1.       Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information from NCDOT and the Town of Cary, developing land
     uses in the area, and information from adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth
     rate of 1.5% was assumed for the study area. This growth rate was applied to the existing
     2013 volumes to determine the projected volumes for the Background (2017) analysis. There
     were also additional trips added to account for known approved developments that are not
     yet constructed. These trips were based on other TARs provided by the Town of Cary. All
     additional developments are described in the following sections. Previously analyzed
     development trip generation information as well as the total approved development site trips
     added to the network are located in Appendix F. The total 2017 Background traffic volumes,
     including the approved development trips are shown in Figure 5. The following are the
     approved developments considered as background traffic for this TAR:

   o   13-TAR-371 SECU Rezoning

3.1.1. 09-TAR-307 ­ EPIC GAMES OFFICES
Epic Games' offices are a development in the southeastern quadrant of the intersection of
Crossroads Boulevard and Caitboo Avenue. The proposed development included three
phases of office buildings. It appears that two out of the three phases have been built.
Based on information provided by the Town of Cary's planning department, approval of
the site plan for the third phase will not expire until 2017. Therefore, site trips from Phase
3 of this development will be added to the background traffic and included in this analysis.

3.1.2. 10-TAR-199A ­ TRYON PLACE AT CARY PARKWAY
Tryon Place at Cary Parkway is a planned apartment complex located in the southeast
quadrant of Tryon Road and Cary Parkway south and west of the study area. The TAR
for this development states that it was to be completed by 2012 and is planned to consist
of 256 mid-rise apartments. Based on observations during a field visit, this development
is currently under construction. Therefore, site trips from this development will be added
to the background traffic and included in this analysis.

3.1.3. 12-TAR-345 ­ W ALNUT MCDONALD 'S
The Walnut McDonald's TAR was conducted for the proposed redevelopment of the
existing McDonald's restaurant located in the northwest quadrant of the Walnut Street
and Meeting Street intersection. The proposed expansion is planned to increase the
existing facility by 1,917 square feet and provide an additional drive-thru lane. This
expansion is currently under construction and is planned for completion in 2013.
Therefore, site trips from this development will be added to the background traffic and
included in this analysis.

3.1.4. 13-TAR-362 ­ FRANKLIN APARTMENTS
The Franklin Apartments is a proposed apartment complex located north of the Jones
Franklin Road and Macedonia Road intersection and is planned to consist of 198
apartments. This development is planned for completion in 2017. Therefore, site trips
from this development will be added to the background traffic and included in this
analysis.

3.1.5. 13-TAR-371 ­ SECU REZONING
The SECU Rezoning TAR was conducted for the proposed State Employees' Credit
Union (SECU) branch office located in the southeast quadrant of the Walnut Street and
Macedonia Road intersection. The proposed SECU is planned to consist of 6,658 square
feet of office space, 3 drive-thru lanes and one ATM lane. This development is planned

     for completion in 2014. Therefore, site trips from this development will be added to the
     background traffic and included in this analysis.

  3.2.       Level of Service Analysis
  Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
  Background (2017) AM and PM peak hours which includes the approved development site
  trips described in the above section along with the annual growth of existing traffic to 2017
  using the 1.5% annual growth rate.

  The volumes that were used in the Background (2017) analysis are shown by Figure 5. The
  existing laneage was also used and is shown in Figure 3. The summary of the level of
  service analysis for the Background (2017) conditions is reported in Table 5.

4.      COMBINED (2017) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Transportation Zone and therefore recommendations will be based on a level of service
standard of "D". The proposed Pritchett Property development is planned to consist of 123 single
family homes. The site plan for this parcel proposes to provide one full-movement access at the
Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway intersection by adding a fourth leg to the intersection. The
site plan also proposes to provide one right-in/right-out access on Holly Springs Road
approximately 1,150 feet north of the Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway intersection.

The site plan also indicates that the site's internal circulation system will connect to Fordland
Drive which currently ends just south of the site's property line. Fordland Drive does not connect
to Holly Springs Road but does provide an indirect connection to Holly Springs Road via
Campbell Road. Since this is an indirect connection, site traffic is not anticipated to use Fordland
Drive to access Holly Springs Road. Campbell Road also connects to Tryon Road. However,
accessing Tryon Road by way of Holly Springs Road would be a much shorter trip for site traffic.
Therefore, this TAR has no site traffic routed along Fordland Drive.

It is anticipated that some existing traffic may use Fordland Drive to access the signalized
intersection of Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Access 1 and vice-versa;
therefore, the number of existing trips originating along Fordland Drive and Campbell Road was
estimated based upon aerial photography and ITE Trip Generation. It was assumed that these
estimated trips currently access Holly Springs Road via the unsignalized intersection of Campbell
Road and Holly Springs Road. For the Background (2017) and Combined (2017) analyses, a
portion of these estimated trips were rerouted to Fordland Drive, resulting in volume
modifications at the Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Access 1 intersection. This
traffic volume estimation and corresponding distribution calculations are located in Appendix D.

     4.1.        Trip Generation
     Trip generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition to
     determine the number of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is
     shown in Table 6.

4.2.       Trip Distribution
Access to the development is proposed to be provided via one full-movement driveway at the
intersection of Cary Parkway and Holly Springs Road and one right-in/right-out driveway on
Holly Springs Road. Trip distribution was estimated based on count data from nearby
intersections, the existing roadway network, and from knowledge of local trip attractions and
destinations in the area. The AM and PM peak hour primary site trip distribution percentages
are shown on Figures 6.1 and 6.2, respectively. Figure 7 provides the total AM and PM
peak hour site trips, while the trip generation and distribution calculations are located in
Appendix D.

4.3.       Combined (2017) Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2017) scenario consists of the Background (2017) traffic as discussed in
Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed development. The
volumes that are used in the Combined (2017) analysis are shown in Figure 8. The laneage
and traffic control used for the Combined (2017) scenario is based on the existing conditions
provided by Figure 3 as well as the site plan, provided by Figure 2. Because specific
laneage for the proposed access driveways was not provided on the site plan, Proposed
Access 2 was analyzed under stop control with one ingress lane and one egress lane.
Additionally, the Town of Cary was consulted regarding Proposed Access 1 because adding
the fourth leg at this intersection will result in signal design and signal timing changes, as well
as lane configuration changes. As a result of the discussions with town staff, the following
Synchro coding assumptions were made for the Combined (2017) conditions at the Holly
Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Access 1 intersection:

       The eastbound approach of Cary Parkway was analyzed with one exclusive left-turn
       lane, one through lane and one exclusive right-turn lane.
       The westbound approach of Proposed Access 1 was analyzed initially with one
       ingress lane and two egress lanes consisting of an exclusive left-turn lane with 100
       feet of storage and a shared through and right-turn lane to evaluate level of service.
       Any changes to this configuration are described in Section 4.4.
       Regardless of the laneage used for the Proposed Access 1, the design should align
       properly with Cary Parkway and provide adequate right-of-way to do so.
       In order to aid in progression and provide protected signal phasing when needed, the
       new eastbound left-turn and southbound left-turn movements were analyzed with
       protected plus permitted phasing.
       Since the intersection geometry will change with the provision of a new leg, the yellow
       and all-red times were coded as 5 seconds and 2 seconds, respectively, based on
       NCDOT Congestion Management Analysis Guidelines.
       Since the development will provide a new leg to the Cary Parkway and Holly Springs
       Road intersection, the existing cycle length was maintained while the splits and offset
       were optimized.

                                                                                  14-TAR-379



 Level of service analyses were performed for all existing intersections as well as the two
 proposed site accesses.

 It should be noted that the initial Synchro analyses for the Combined (2017) scenario resulted
 all signalized intersections operating at LOS D or better in the AM and PM peak periods;
 however, the westbound right-turn at Proposed Access 2 operates at LOS F with
 unreasonably high delay, indicating congestion along northbound Holly Springs Road. Given
 these results, the SimTraffic simulation was observed in order to verify and observe this
 congestion. During the simulation of the AM peak period, northbound queues on Jones
 Franklin Road extended from the Tryon Road intersection south beyond the Holly Springs
 Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection. It is reasonable to assume that if northbound
 queues on Jones Franklin road reach the Holly Springs Road intersection, a portion of that
 traffic may choose to continue straight on Holly Springs Road and make a right-turn at the
 Holly Springs Road and Tryon Road intersection to reach the intersection of Tryon Road and
 Jones Franklin Road. Using this rationale, a portion of the northbound trips on Holly Springs
 Road destined for eastbound Tryon Road and northbound Jones Franklin Road were
 rerouted to the intersection of Holly Springs Road and Tryon Road based on engineering
 judgment. The simulation was then observed again and found to be more reasonable with
 the rerouted traffic. In order to estimate the average delay for the westbound right-turns at
 Proposed Access 2 during the AM peak period, ten simulation runs were performed. After
 compiling ten simulation runs with this rerouted traffic in the Combined (2017) AM peak
 scenario, SimTraffic indicates that the average delay will be below the threshold for LOS D. It
 should also be noted that the average delay reported in SimTraffic does not directly coincide
 with the control delay as described in the Highway Capacity Manual for determining level of
 service because it is calculated over the entire 60 minute analysis period, rather than the
 peak 15 minutes. The Jones Franklin Road volume reroute calculations are provided in
 Appendix D. The Synchro results and SimTraffic results without the Jones Franklin Road
 traffic reroutes are provided in Appendix H.

 A summary of the levels of service including the traffic reroutes noted above is found in
 Tables 7a and 7b below.

* AM results of maximum queue (feet) and average approach delay (sec/veh) taken from an

   As shown by Tables 5 and 7a, most signalized intersections experience little to no change
   between the Background (2017) and Combined (2017) scenarios. As with the Background
   (2017) analyses, all signalized intersections operate at or better than the LOS D threshold for
   the Base Benefit Transportation Zone.

   As shown by Table 7b, the westbound right-turn movement at the new intersection of Holly
   Springs Road and Proposed Site Access 2 operates at LOS F in the AM peak period based
   on the Synchro analysis. Given the inordinate estimate of delay, as previously mentioned,
   ten SimTraffic runs were performed to provide another estimate of delay. Based on those ten
   runs, the westbound right-turns are anticipated to have an average of 27.6 seconds of delay
   per vehicle and a maximum queue of 67 feet in the AM peak period. Table 7b also shows
   that the westbound right-turn movement at this intersection operates at LOS C in the PM
   peak. Based on the results of the SimTraffic simulation in the AM peak period and the

Synchro results for the PM peak period, no improvements were proposed for this intersection.
The Combined (2017) analyses are located in Appendix I.

The following provides the results of the Combined (2017) analyses and how they relate to
the LDO requirements.

Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Road
This intersection operates at LOS B in the Combined (2017) AM peak period and LOS C in
the Combined (2017) PM peak period. Therefore, the findings indicate that this intersection
does not require improvements to meet LDO requirements.

Tryon Road and Holly Springs Road/Walnut Street
This intersection operates at LOS C in the Combined (2017) AM peak period and LOS D in
the Combined (2017) PM peak period. Therefore, the findings indicate that this intersection
does not require improvements to meet LDO requirements.

Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road
This intersection operates at LOS C in the Combined (2017) AM peak period and LOS B in
the Combined (2017) PM peak periods. Therefore, the findings indicate that this intersection
does not require improvements to meet LDO requirements.

Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road
This intersection operates at LOS D in both the Combined (2017) AM and PM peak periods.
Therefore, the findings indicate that this intersection does not require improvements to meet
LDO requirements.

Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Site Access 1
This intersection operates at LOS D in the Combined (2017) AM peak period and LOS C in
the Combined (2017) PM peak period. Therefore, the findings indicate that this intersection
does not require improvements to meet LDO requirements.

The Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies Holly Springs Road
as being improved to a four-lane divided facility with a landscaped median. Therefore,
meeting CTP requirements should be considered and is described in Section 4.4.

Holly Springs Road and Proposed Site Access 2
Based on SimTraffic observations and Synchro and SimTraffic results, no improvements
were proposed to meet LDO requirements. In addition to the Town's requirements, because
Holly Springs Road is maintained by NCDOT, the NCDOT nomograph for turn lanes will be
evaluated for this access.

The Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies Holly Springs Road
as a four-lane divided facility with a landscaped median. Therefore, meeting CTP
requirements should be considered and is described in Section 4.4.

4.4.       Combined Improved (2017) Level of Service Analysis
The Combined Improved (2017) scenario consists of improvements that are proposed in
order to meet the LOS D threshold as noted in Section 2.4 or are proposed in order to meet
CTP requirements. As noted in Section 4.3, one signalized intersection and one unsignalized
intersection meet these criteria in the Combined (2017) conditions. The intersections
requiring improvements based on the Town's LDO are listed below, along with the proposed
improvement.

Intersection of Holly Springs Road and Proposed Access 2
Based on the Town's CTP, Holly Springs Road is to be widened from a two-lane undivided
facility to a four-lane median-divided facility with 100 feet of right-of-way in this area. Since
the frontage of the Pritchett Property development is located on this section of Holly Springs
Road, the Town of Cary requires that the development provide right-of-way and pavement for
half of the ultimate four-lane median-divided roadway along the frontage of the property to
conform to the CTP. The pavement along the property frontage should be striped so as to
maintain a single through lane along Holly Springs Road and the additional lane provided per
the CTP should not be marked for use. The following improvement is required to meet the
Town's CTP:

       Provide additional pavement to accommodate a future northbound through lane on
       Holly Springs Road along the property frontage in accordance with the Town's
       Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

In addition to the Town of Cary's LDO and CTP requirements, because Holly Springs Road is
maintained by NCDOT, the NCDOT nomograph for turn lanes was evaluated for this access.
Based on this evaluation, no additional turn lanes are required for Proposed Access 2 to
satisfy NCDOT requirements.

Intersection of Holly Springs Road and Cary Parkway/Proposed Access 1
This intersection does not require improvements to meet the LDO requirements; however,
according to the Town's CTP, Holly Springs Road is to be widened from a two-lane undivided
facility to a four-lane median-divided facility with 100 feet of right-of-way in this area. Since
the frontage of the Pritchett Property development is located on this section of Holly Springs
Road, the Town of Cary requires that the development provide right-of-way and pavement for
half of the ultimate four-lane median-divided roadway along the frontage of the property to
conform to the CTP.

Given additional pavement is required to meet the Town's CTP requirements, it is
recommended the additional pavement on the northbound approach of this intersection be
striped as a right-turn lane. The findings indicate the following improvement will meet the
Town's CTP.

       Provide a northbound right-turn lane on Holly Springs Road along the property
       frontage.

Tables 8a and 8b provide a summary of the intersection levels of service with improvements.

   4.5.       Conclusions
   Table 9a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the Background (2017),
   Combined (2017), and Combined Improved (2017) conditions. The results provided in Table
   9a show that all signalized intersections operate at or better than the LOS D threshold in the
   Combined (2017) conditions and do not require improvements to meet LDO requirements.

Table 9b provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersection in the Combined (2017) and
Combined Improved (2017) conditions. As indicated in Table 9b, based on SimTraffic
observations and Synchro and SimTraffic results, no improvements were proposed to meet
LDO requirements. The proposed build laneage in 2017 for the proposed Pritchett Property
development is shown on Figure 9.

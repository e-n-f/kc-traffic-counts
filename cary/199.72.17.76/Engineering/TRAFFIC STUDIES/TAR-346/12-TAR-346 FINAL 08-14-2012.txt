EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
ForeverHome LLC proposes to construct Cary Glen Townhomes on the east side of Cary
Glen Boulevard in western Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is expected to be
completed by 2016 and consists of the following land use:
       Residential Townhomes ­ 152 dwelling units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined
in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Per the site plan, access to the development is proposed via one full movement access on
Cary Glen Boulevard across from Cary Reserve Drive (Figure 2):
       Access #1: full movement access driveway on Cary Glen Boulevard, approximately
       800 feet south of Carpenter Fire Station Road.

In addition, a connection to the adjacent Grove at Cary Park Apartments will be
constructed. Therefore, part of the project traffic may use existing Pony Club Circle to
access Cary Glen Boulevard.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       Green Level Church Road and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
       Green Level Church Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (signalized)
       Green Level Church Road and Courtland View Lane/Mills Park Drive (signalized)
       Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (unsignalized)
       Cary Glen Boulevard and Cary Reserve Drive/Access #1 (unsignalized)
       Cary Glen Boulevard and Pony Club Circle (unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2012), Background (2016), Build
(2016), Build (2016), and a Build (2016) with Improvements scenario. The Existing (2012)
scenario includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data
collected in May 2012. The Background (2016) scenario includes existing traffic with
projected annual growth, as well as projected traffic from two approved developments in the
vicinity. The Build (2016) scenario includes Background (2016) volumes with the addition of
site trips generated by the proposed redevelopment. Additionally, future conditions with the
proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a Build (2016) with
Improvements scenario.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. Signal operations at the signalized intersections were modeled
based on traffic signal plans and timings obtained from Town of Cary staff.

                                             i
As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page v, all the intersections
included in the study area are currently operating under acceptable levels of service (LOS D
or better). All three signalized study intersections are operating at LOS C or better. Among
the stop-controlled approaches, northbound and southbound Cary Glen Boulevard at
Carpenter Fire Station Road are currently operating at LOS B and C during the AM peak
hour and LOS C and D during the PM peak hour. The eastbound Cary Reserve Drive at
Cary Glen Boulevard is currently operating at LOS B in the AM peak hour and LOS A in
the PM peak hour. The westbound Pony Club Circle is operating at LOS A during both AM
and PM peak hours.

Background (2016) Conditions
Historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) was not available for the roadways within
the study area. Therefore, the growth rate for the intersections within the study area was
determined by comparing traffic volume data collected in 2010 to the existing (2012) traffic
volume data. An annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was applied to the existing traffic
to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year (2012) and the build year (2016).
In addition, site traffic from two (2) proposed/approved developments in the vicinity of
study area was aggregated and included in the analysis.

Based on the Background (2016) analysis, all the signalized intersections in the study area
will remain under acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) despite some increases in
delay. The stop-controlled southbound Cary Glen Boulevard approach at Carpenter Fire
Station Road is predicted to decline from LOS C to LOS E in the AM peak hour and from
LOS D to LOS F in the PM peak hour. The eastbound stop-controlled Cary Reserve Drive
at Cary Glen Boulevard is predicted to continue operating at the same LOS as in the
Existing (2012) conditions. The westbound Pony Club Circle at Cary Glen Boulevard is
predicted to continue operating at the same LOS as in the Existing (2012) conditions as well.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed Cary Glen Townhomes development is to consist of the following land use:
       Residential Townhomes ­ 152 dwelling units

Trip generation was conducted based on Land Use Code (LUC) 230, Residential
Condominium/Townhouse included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. The proposed
development is projected to generate 926 external daily trips with 72 trips occurring in the
AM peak hour (12 entering, 60 exiting) and 85 trips occurring in the PM peak hour trips (57
entering, 28 exiting).

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing and future traffic patterns
and surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build (2016) Conditions
The Build (2016) conditions account for both the Background (2016) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. Geometrically, the site plan proposes to add
a fourth leg to the Cary Glen Boulevard and Cary Reserve Drive intersection. In addition, a

                                              ii
connection to the adjacent Grove at Cary Park Apartments will be constructed. Therefore,
part of the project traffic may use existing Pony Club Circle to access Cary Glen Boulevard.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page v, all the signalized intersections in the study
area are projected to continue to operate under acceptable levels of service (LOS D or
better). The stop-controlled southbound Cary Glen Boulevard approach at Carpenter Fire
Station Road is predicted to continue operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F
in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 5.6 seconds in the AM peak hour and 18.5
seconds in the PM peak hour. The stop-controlled westbound Access #1 approach at Cary
Glen Boulevard is predicted to operate at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have minimal impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections within
the study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town
of Cary's Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) and NCDOT requirements:
Cary Glen Boulevard and Cary Reserve Drive/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #1 as the primary access point under stop-
control. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate acceptably with the
planned lane geometrics and traffic control.              Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve traffic operations
and safety:
     Construct Site Access #1 at the planned location, across from Cary Reserve Drive,
        to consist of one inbound lane and one outbound lane.

Cary Glen Boulevard and Pony Club Circle (unsignalized)
The site plan also proposes to construct a connection to existing roadway stub at the
adjacent Grove at Cary Park Apartments. Therefore, part of the project traffic may use
existing Pony Club Circle to access Cary Glen Boulevard. Traffic analyses indicate that this
stop-controlled intersection will operate under acceptable levels of service with the existing
lane geometrics and traffic control. No improvements are needed at this intersection to
accommodate future traffic volumes.

Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled southbound approach of Cary Glen
Boulevard will operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour
under both Background and Build conditions with a delay increase of 5.6 seconds in the AM
peak hour and 18.5 seconds in the PM peak hour due to site trips. Geometric improvements
or traffic control changes are therefore required to meet the Town of Cary APFO
regulations.

Traffic volumes at this location meet peak hour warrants for a traffic signal during the PM
peak hour under the Existing conditions and during both the AM and PM peak hours under
the Background and Build scenarios as shown in Appendix E. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO regulations:
       Conduct a full traffic signal warrant analysis after the project built-out and install a

                                              iii
       two-phase traffic signal if warranted.
       With the installation of a traffic signal, restripe the existing northbound Cary Glen
       Boulevard approach to provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared
       through/right-turn lane.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2016) and Build (2016) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

A summary of the level of service across all scenarios and an illustration of the
recommended future lane configurations are included on the following pages.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
ForeverHome LLC proposes to construct Cary Glen Townhomes on the east side of Cary
Glen Boulevard in western Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is expected to be
completed by 2016 and consists of the following land use:
       Residential Townhomes ­ 152 dwelling units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined
in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Per the site plan, access to the development is proposed via one full movement access on
Cary Glen Boulevard across from Cary Reserve Drive (Figure 2):
       Access #1: full movement access driveway on Cary Glen Boulevard, approximately
       800 feet south of Carpenter Fire Station Road.

In addition, a connection to the adjacent Grove at Cary Park Apartments will be
constructed. Therefore, part of the project traffic may use existing Pony Club Circle to
access Cary Glen Boulevard.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       Green Level Church Road and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
       Green Level Church Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (signalized)
       Green Level Church Road and Courtland View Lane/Mills Park Drive (signalized)
       Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (unsignalized)
       Cary Glen Boulevard and Cary Reserve Drive/Access #1 (unsignalized)
       Cary Glen Boulevard and Pony Club Circle (unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This TAR summarizes trip generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and
traffic analyses for the proposed development.

 Due to the close proximity of the proposed development to many schools, the turning
 movement volumes were collected when the schools were in session. The existing peak
 hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

 2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
 Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
 traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
 Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
 vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
 the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
 Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
 ranges.

 The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
 defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities
 Ordinance (APFO). Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of
 the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable for both signalized intersections
 and unsignalized approaches. For signalized intersections, when the background analysis
 yields a level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall intersection delay is

                                               9
allowed under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where the stop-controlled
approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the installation of a traffic signal
shall only be required when the intersection meets required warrants for a signal, and the
new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the surrounding roadway system.

          A                Little or no delay          <= 10 sec.             <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.              10-15 sec.

          E             Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.              35-50 sec.
           F             Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.               > 50 sec.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing scenario analysis
utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the Town of Cary, which are included in
Appendix D. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be
found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all the intersections included in the study area are currently operating
under acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better). All three signalized study intersections
are operating at LOS C or better. Among the stop-controlled approaches, northbound and
southbound Cary Glen Boulevard at Carpenter Fire Station Road are currently operating at
LOS B and C during the AM peak hour and LOS C and D during the PM peak hour. The
eastbound Cary Reserve Drive at Cary Glen Boulevard is currently operating at LOS B in the
AM peak hour and LOS A in the PM peak hour. The westbound Pony Club Circle is
operating at LOS A during both AM and PM peak hours.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2016) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) was not available for the roadways within
the study area. Therefore, the growth rate for the intersections within the study area was
determined by comparing traffic volume data collected in 2010 to the existing (2012) traffic
volume data. An annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was applied to the existing traffic
to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year (2012) and the build year (2016).
In addition, site traffic from two (2) proposed/approved developments in the vicinity of
study area was aggregated and included in the analysis.

Camden Pond Phase 5 (09-TAR-149a) ­ This residential development is being proposed along
Carpenter Fire Station Road near its future intersection with Highcroft Drive. The proposed
phase of development will include 15 single family homes. The traffic analysis report (09-
TAR-149a) was prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary
in January 2009. The project build-out year was originally scheduled for 2011. However, to
date no construction has taken place. Based on TAR-149a, the development is projected to
generate 182 daily vehicle trips with 20 AM peak hour trips (5 entering, 15 exiting) and 19
PM peak hour trips (12 entering, 7 exiting). Site trips from the Camden Pond development
were included as depicted in TAR-149a and carried through at the remaining intersections in
the study area. Figure C-1 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to
Camden Pond Phase 5.

Alston Town Center (11-TAR-332) ­ This mixed-use development is being proposed in the
southwest quadrant of the NC 55/NC 540 interchange. The development will include
355,905 square feet of shopping center, 30,125 square feet of office development, a 150-
room hotel, a 5,255-square foot bank, a 7,398-square foot high turn-over/sit-down
restaurant, 3,500-square foot fast-food restaurant, a gas station with 16 fueling positions and
convenience store, a 14,708-square foot pharmacy, 37 townhomes and 590 apartment units.
The most recent traffic analysis report (11-TAR-332) was prepared by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in April 2012. The project
build-out year is scheduled for 2015. Based on TAR-332, the development is projected to
generate 25,435 daily vehicle trips with 1,298 AM peak hour trips (626 entering and 672
exiting) and 2,386 PM peak hour trips (1,233 entering and 1,153 exiting). Site trips from
Alston Town Center were included as depicted in TAR-332 and carried through at the
remaining intersections in the study area. Figure C-2 in Appendix C depicts the projected
peak hour trips due to Alston Town Center.

The total site trips from the approved developments are shown in Figure C-3 in Appendix
C. Traffic volumes due to the combination of ambient traffic growth and site trips from
proposed/approved background developments are shown in Figure 5 in Appendix C.

3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. A summary of the findings for the
Background (2016) scenario LOS analyses can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS
output can be found in Appendix B.

                                              13
Based on the Background (2016) analysis, all the signalized intersections in the study area
will remain under acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) despite some increases in
delay. The stop-controlled southbound Cary Glen Boulevard approach at Carpenter Fire
Station Road is predicted to operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM
peak hour. The eastbound stop-controlled Cary Reserve Drive at Cary Glen Boulevard is
predicted to continue operating at the same LOS as in the Existing (2012) conditions. The
westbound Pony Club Circle at Cary Glen Boulevard is predicted to continue operating at
the same LOS as in the Existing (2012) conditions as well.

4.0 BUILD (2016) ANALYSIS
ForeverHome LLC proposes to construct Cary Glen Townhomes on the east side of Cary
Glen Boulevard in western Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is expected to be
completed by 2016 and consists of the following land use:
            Residential Townhomes ­ 152 dwelling units

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation was conducted based on Land Use Code (LUC) 230, Residential
Condominium/Townhouse included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. The proposed
development is projected to generate 926 external daily trips with 72 trips occurring in the
AM peak hour (12 entering, 60 exiting) and 85 trips occurring in the PM peak hour trips (57
entering, 28 exiting).

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
Vehicular access to the proposed Cary Glen Townhomes is proposed via one driveway along
Cary Glen Boulevard across from Cary Reserve Drive, as shown in Figure 2. In addition, a
connection to existing roadway stub at the adjacent Grove at Cary Park Apartments will be
constructed. Therefore, part of the project traffic may use existing Pony Club Circle to
access Cary Glen Boulevard.

The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and
the land uses in the vicinity of study area as follows:

       20% from Green Level Church Road to the north
       5% from Cary Glen Boulevard to the north
       15% from Green Level Church Road to the south
       40% from Carpenter Fire Station Road to the east
       5% from Mills Park Drive to the east
       5% from Carpenter Fire Station Road to the west
       5% from Cary Glen Boulevard to the west
       5% from Cary Reserve Drive to the west

The site trip directional distribution percentages at each study intersection are illustrated in
Figure 6. The total number of site trips generated by the proposed Cary Glen Townhomes
was calculated at each study area intersection and is shown in Figure 7.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2016) analysis scenario includes the Background (2016) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed redevelopment. Figure 8 depicts the turning movement
volumes used in the Build (2016) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. Table 6 summarizes the findings of
the LOS analysis for Build (2016) analyses and Appendix B contains the full Synchro/HCS
reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, all the signalized intersections in the study area are projected to
continue to operate under acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better). The stop-
controlled southbound Cary Glen Boulevard approach at Carpenter Fire Station Road is
predicted to operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour with a
delay increase of 5.6 seconds in the AM peak hour and 18.5 seconds in the PM peak hour.
The stop-controlled westbound Access #1 approach at Cary Glen Boulevard is predicted to
operate at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak hours.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have minimal impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections within
the study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town
of Cary's Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) and NCDOT requirements:
Cary Glen Boulevard and Cary Reserve Drive/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #1 as the primary access point under stop-
control. Traffic analyses indicate that this site access will operate acceptably with the
planned lane geometrics and traffic control.              Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to improve traffic operations
and safety:
     Construct Site Access #1 at the planned location, across from Cary Reserve Drive,
        to consist of one inbound lane and one outbound lane.

Cary Glen Boulevard and Pony Club Circle (unsignalized)
The site plan also proposes to construct a connection to existing roadway stub at the
adjacent Grove at Cary Park Apartments. Therefore, part of the project traffic may use
existing Pony Club Circle to access Cary Glen Boulevard. Traffic analyses indicate that this
stop-controlled intersection will operate under acceptable levels of service with the existing
lane geometrics and traffic control. No improvements are needed at this intersection to
accommodate future traffic volumes.

Carpenter Fire Station Road and Cary Glen Boulevard (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled southbound approach of Cary Glen
Boulevard will operate at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour
under both Background and Build conditions with a delay increase of 5.6 seconds in the AM
peak hour and 18.5 seconds in the PM peak hour due to site trips. Geometric improvements
or traffic control changes are therefore required to meet the Town of Cary APFO
regulations.

Traffic volumes at this location meet peak hour warrants for a traffic signal during the PM
peak hour under the Existing conditions and during both the AM and PM peak hours under
the Background and Build scenarios as shown in Appendix E. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO regulations:
       Conduct a full traffic signal warrant analysis after the project built-out and install a
       two-phase traffic signal if warranted.
       With the installation of a traffic signal, restripe the existing northbound Cary Glen
       Boulevard approach to provide an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared
       through/right-turn lane.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2016) and Build (2016) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configuration and traffic control for 2016 are depicted in Figure 9.

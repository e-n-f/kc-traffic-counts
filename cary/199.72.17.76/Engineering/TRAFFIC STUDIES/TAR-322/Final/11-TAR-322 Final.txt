EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
A residential development is proposed to be constructed at the current dead end of
Winstead Drive in northern Cary, NC (Figure 1). The property is located within the Town
of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary's Land Development
Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be
completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed development
on its adjacent roadways.

The development is to consist of 240 apartments and is expected to be completed during
2012. The site plan proposes two access points, one along Winstead Drive and the second
along Old Reedy Creek Road (Figure 2):
       Site Access #1: full movement driveway to be added as the third (north) leg of the
       Winstead Drive and Lakeside View Court intersection
       Site Access #2: full movement driveway on Old Reedy Creek Road approximately
       1,300 feet north of Weston Parkway
The site plan also shows the realignment of Old Reedy Creek Road into Winstead Drive,
which intersects with Weston Parkway approximate 650 feet west of Old Reedy Creek Road.
A traffic signal is proposed at the Winstead Drive and Weston Parkway intersection in
conjunction with the proposed roadway realignment.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
           Weston Parkway and Winstead Drive (unsignalized/future signal)
           Weston Parkway and Old Reedy Creek Road (unsignalized)
           Old Reedy Creek Road and Winstead Drive (future unsignalized)
           Winstead Drive and Lakeside View Court/ Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)
           Old Reedy Creek Road and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2010), Background (2012), Build
(2012), Build (2012) with Improvements. The Existing (2010) scenario includes AM and PM
peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in November 2010.
The Background (2012) scenario includes existing traffic with projected annual traffic
growth. The Build (2012) scenario includes Background (2012) volumes with the addition of
site trips generated by the proposed development. Future conditions with the proposed
mitigations in place were analyzed in Build (2012) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2010) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page
vi, all stop-controlled approaches at the unsignalized intersections in the study area are
currently operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) with the exception of
southbound Winstead Drive at Weston Parkway, which is operating at LOS E in the AM
peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Specifically, at the two unsignalized

                                             ii
intersections along Weston Parkway, the northbound Office Driveway approach across
Winstead Drive is operating at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours, the
northbound Office Driveway approach across Old Reedy Creek Road is operating at LOS C
in the AM peak hour and LOS D in the PM peak hour, and the southbound Old Reedy
Creek Road approach is operating at LOS D in the AM peak hour and LOS C in the PM
peak hour. Off Weston Parkway, the stop-controlled eastbound approach of Office
Driveway at Winstead Drive is operating at a LOS A during both the AM and PM peak
hours.

Background (2012) Conditions
An annual growth rate of two percent (2%), derived from NCDOT counts and previous
studies in the area, was applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth
between the base year (2010) and the project build-out year (2012). There are no approved
projects in the vicinity that studied any intersections overlapping with the study area of this
TAR. Additionally, no transportation improvements are programmed at any study
intersections before the project build-out.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, traffic conditions in the study area are projected to
worsen slightly due to the addition of background traffic. All of the study intersections are
projected to experience slight increases in traffic delay, but no level of service changes are
expected in either the AM or the PM peak hour at any study area intersections.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside development is proposed to consist of 240
apartments. As requested by the developer, trip generation was conducted based on an
adjacent apartment complex (the Apartments at Weston Lakeside) instead of using the
standard trip generation rates included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition. The traffic survey
data and trip generation details were documented in Task 1, Initial Roundabout Analysis of
this TAR (submitted to the Town by M/A/B on December 7, 2010).

In total, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,129 daily trips, with 109
projected trips occurring in the AM peak hour (16 entering, 93 exiting), and 117 PM peak
hour trips (85 entering, 32 exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with
the existing turning movement counts and surrounding land uses.

Build (2012) Conditions
The Build (2012) conditions account for the Background (2012) traffic, site traffic generated
by the proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside development, as well as projected traffic
diversion due to the proposed realignment of Old Reedy Creek Road into Winstead Drive.
As shown in the summary LOS table on page vi, the proposed project will not result in any
significant level of service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at
any study area intersections. The only LOS change occurs at the southbound Winstead
Drive at Weston Parkway, which is projected to decline from LOS E to LOS F in the AM
peak hour with the projected site trips and traffic diversion. The remaining study area
intersections are projected to experience traffic delay increases, but will continue operating at
the same levels of service as in the Background (2012) conditions. The proposed project will

                                               iii
add four new stop-controlled approaches due to the construction of the site accesses and the
proposed roadway realignment. All of the stop-controlled approaches at the realigned Old
Reedy Creek Road and Winstead Drive intersection, the Winstead Drive and Lakeside View
Court/Site Access #1 intersection, and the Old Reedy Creek Road and Site Access #2
intersection are projected to operate at a LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside
development is projected to have an impact on the roadways and intersections within the
study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of
Cary's Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) requirements and NCDOT engineering
guidance:
Widening of Frontage along Old Reedy Creek Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen roadways along their frontage to
the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP).
The proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside has frontage along Old Reedy Creek Road, which
has a two-lane undivided cross-section under the existing conditions. For this section of
Old Reedy Creek Road, the CTP dictates a two-lane collector avenue cross-section with two
travel lanes, bicycle lanes, a landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides
within 120 feet of right-of-way. However, per the Town of Cary approved rezoning case 10-
REZ-05 Weston PDD Amendment, the developer requested and was granted a waiver from
the LDO requirements of street frontage improvements along this property's frontage.

In lieu of making the required CTP roadway improvements, the applicant is committed to
the following roadway improvements with the development of this site:

   1. Winstead Drive will be re-aligned and merged with the northern portion of Old
      Reedy Creek Road to form one continuous roadway segment.
   2. On the southern end of the subject property, the southern portion of Old Reedy
      Creek Road will connect with the realigned segment of Winstead Drive.
   3. The newly realigned portion of Winstead Drive will be constructed to 65 feet back-
      to-back, median divided street section from Weston Parkway to the southernmost
      private drive serving the subject property and the existing Weston Lakeside
      Apartments.
   4. A second driveway connecting the subject property to the newly realigned Winstead
      Drive will be provided. In addition, the applicant proposes to stub an internal
      private street to the Weston Lakeside development that will be interconnected
      whenever development changes or requests are made by the Weston Lakeside
      development.
   5. A traffic signal and the associated improvements will be provided at the intersection
      of Weston Parkway and Winstead Drive. (Note: installation of signal will be subject
      to satisfying signal warrants as outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
      Devices).
   6. An additional 30' of right-of-way will be dedicated along the site's frontage on Old
      Reedy Creek Road in accordance with the Town's CTP.
   7. A sidewalk connection will be constructed along Winstead Drive from the subject
      property's southernmost driveway connection to Weston Parkway.

                                             iv
   8. 4' bike lanes will be striped along Winstead Drive from the subject property's
      southernmost driveway connection to Weston Parkway.
   9. A private sidewalk connection will be made internally to the subject property's
      southernmost private driveway connection to realigned Winstead Drive.

Old Reedy Creek Road and Winstead Drive (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to realign Old Reedy Creek Road into Winstead Drive to create a
new four-leg intersection, with stop control placed at the realigned southbound (eastbound)
Winstead Drive and northbound (westbound) Old Reedy Creek Road approaches while
allowing free flow on the northbound Winstead Drive and southbound Old Reedy Creek
Road approaches. Traffic analyses indicate that with the planned roadway geometrics and
traffic control, both the southbound (eastbound) Winstead Drive and the northbound
(westbound) Old Reedy Creek Road approaches will operate at a LOS A during both the
AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan standards for
the new roadways, and to improve traffic operations and safety at this location based on
NCDOT's engineering guidance:
     Construct the planned roadway realignment of Old Reedy Creek Road and Winstead
        Drive as shown on the site plan;
     Construct the northbound Winstead Drive approach to provide for an exclusive left-
        turn lane and a shared thru/right-turn lane;
     Construct the southbound Old Reedy Creek Road approach to provide for a shared
        thru/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 125 feet of full
        storage and appropriate taper;
     Construct the northbound (westbound) Old Reedy Creek Road approach to provide
        for an all-purpose lane under a stop control;
     Construct the southbound (eastbound) Winstead Drive approach to provide for an
        all-purpose lane under a stop control.

Weston Parkway Road and Winstead Drive (unsignalized/future signalized)
The site plan proposes installation of a traffic signal at the Winstead Drive and Weston
Parkway intersection. The traffic analyses indicate that under the existing stop control, the
southbound Winstead Drive approach is projected to decline to operate at a LOS F during
both the AM and PM peak hours, with 36.8 seconds of delay increases in the AM peak hour
and 52.7 seconds of delay increases in the PM peak hour. Peak hour traffic volumes at this
intersection meet warrants for a traffic signal as specified in the Manual of Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD), 2009 Edition. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended
based on the site plan and also required in order to meet the Town of Cary APFO
requirements:
     Conduct a full signal warrant analysis per MUTCD guidelines and install a traffic
         signal when warranted at this intersection that provides coordination with the
         adjacent Harrison Oaks Boulevard and Norwell Boulevard traffic signals along
         Weston Parkway;

If the northbound approach is to remain right-in/right-out, the signal will operate at LOS B.
However, if the Town of Cary decides to open the northbound office driveway approach to
full access under signal control, the signal is projected to still operate at LOS B or better.

                                              v
Coordination with the existing offices across Weston Parkway will be required to convert the
northbound approach to full movement, including removal of concrete median, signal pole
placement, lane striping, and loop installation.

Winstead Drive and Lakeside View Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled eastbound approach of Lakeside View
Court is projected to operate at LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore,
to provide safe ingress/egress to the site, the following driveway configurations and
geometric improvements are recommended based on the proposed site plan:
    Construct the planned Access #1 with one ingress lane and one egress lane;
    Restripe the northbound Access #1 (originally Winstead Drive) to provide a thru
        lane and an exclusive left-turn lane;
    Install stop control on the eastbound Lakeside View Court approach.

Old Reedy Creek Road and Access #2 (future unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled eastbound approach of Site Access #2
is projected to operate at LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, to
provide safe ingress/egress to the site, the following driveway configuration is recommended
at this location per the proposed site plan:
      Construct the planned Access #2 with one ingress lane and one egress lane.

The remaining intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours; thus, no further improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
A residential development is proposed to be constructed at the current dead end of
Winstead Drive in northern Cary, NC (Figure 1). The property is located within the Town
of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary's Land Development
Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be
completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed development
on its adjacent roadways.

The development is to consist of 240 apartments and is expected to be completed during
2012. The site plan proposes two access points, one along Winstead Drive and the second
along Old Reedy Creek Road (Figure 2):
       Site Access #1: full movement driveway to be added as the third (north) leg of the
       Winstead Drive and Lakeside View Court intersection
       Site Access #2: full movement driveway on Old Reedy Creek Road approximately
       1,300 feet north of Weston Parkway
The site plan also shows the realignment of Old Reedy Creek Road into Winstead Drive,
which intersects with Weston Parkway approximate 650 feet west of Old Reedy Creek Road.
A traffic signal is proposed at the Winstead Drive and Weston Parkway intersection in
conjunction with the proposed roadway realignment.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
           Weston Parkway and Winstead Drive (unsignalized/future signal)
           Weston Parkway and Old Reedy Creek Road (unsignalized)
           Old Reedy Creek Road and Winstead Drive (future unsignalized)
           Winstead Drive and Lakeside View Court/ Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)
           Old Reedy Creek Road and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

2.0 EXISTING (2010) CONDITIONS
2.1 EXISTING ROADWAY CONDITIONS
This section describes the existing streets in the vicinity of the proposed development.
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) data for the surrounding network of roads were
obtained from the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT). The most
recent AADT counts from the NCDOT are for 2009 on the study area roadways.

Weston Parkway
   Weston Parkway is a four-lane divided, Town of Cary roadway with a posted speed
      limit of 45 miles per hour (mph).
   The land uses along Weston Parkway are primarily office uses.
   According to the NCDOT, the AADT on Weston Parkway was 17,000 vehicles per
      day (vpd) in 2009 to the east of the study area near Harrison Oaks Boulevard and
      11,000 vpd to the west near Evans Road.

Old Reedy Creek Road
    Old Reedy Creek Road is a two-lane undivided, Town of Cary collector street with a
      posted speed limit of 25 mph.
    The land uses along Old Reedy Creek Road are primarily open land and recreational,
      with some residential and office uses spotted along the east side of the road.
    There is no AADT from NCDOT for this roadway. The traffic counts conducted
      by M/A/B indicated an ADT of approximately 470 vpd in front of the property
      frontage in 2010.

    Winstead Drive is a four-lane divided, Town of Cary local street with no posted
      speed limit in the field.
    The land uses along Winstead Drive are primarily office use on the western side and
      open land on the east side. Currently, Winstead Drive is a cul-de-sac connecting to
      Lakeside View Court on the north end with a future connection planned by the
      proposed development.
    There is no AADT from NCDOT for this roadway.

The resulting peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Although other measurements may be considered, the primary measurement of adequate
public facilities for roads is the levels of service (LOS) during peak hours. Peak hour level of
service measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and traffic controls of a
particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes. Levels of service range
from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by vehicles traveling
through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents the portion of total
delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs). The LOS criteria for
unsignalized intersections are somewhat different from the criteria for signalized
intersections primarily because different transportation facilities create different driver
perceptions. Table 2 provides a summary of the levels of service categories for signalized
and unsignalized intersections and the corresponding delay ranges as defined in the most
current edition of Highway Capacity Manual (HCM).

              B                         10-20 sec.                      10-15 sec.
              C                         20-35 sec.                      15-25 sec.
              D                         35-55 sec.                      25-35 sec.
              E                         55-80 sec.                      35-50 sec.
              F                         > 80 sec.                       > 50 sec.

The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance (LDO) 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities
Planning and Development for Roads (APFR). Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone"
is based on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable for both
signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For signalized intersections, when the
background analysis yields a level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall
intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where
the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the
installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the intersection meets required
warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the
surrounding roadway system.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3
and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all stop-controlled approaches at the unsignalized intersections in the
study area are currently operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS D or better) with the
exception of southbound Winstead Drive at Weston Parkway, which is operating at LOS E
in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Specifically, at the two unsignalized
intersections along Weston Parkway, the northbound Office Driveway approach across
Winstead Drive is operating at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours, the
northbound Office Driveway approach across Old Reedy Creek Road is operating at LOS C
in the AM peak hour and LOS D in the PM peak hour, and the southbound Old Reedy
Creek Road approach is operating at LOS D in the AM peak hour and LOS C in the PM
peak hour. Off Weston Parkway, the stop-controlled eastbound approach of Office
Driveway at Winstead Drive is operating at a LOS A during both the AM and PM peak
hours.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2012) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Historical AADT along Weston Parkway indicate a steady increase in traffic volumes from
2005 to 2007, then a drop in traffic volumes between 2007 and 2009. Overall, the historical
traffic volumes along Weston Parkway suggest a flat or negative growth over the past five
years. To be consistent with several other previous traffic studies in the area, a typical
annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied between the Existing year (2010) and
Build year (2012) to account for background traffic growth. There are no approved projects
in the vicinity that studied any intersections overlapping with the study area of this TAR.
Additionally, no transportation improvements are programmed at any study intersections
before project build-out.


3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background (2012) scenario
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2012) scenario LOS analyses can
be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, traffic conditions in the study area are projected to
worsen slightly due to the addition of background traffic. All of the study intersections are
projected to experience slight increases in traffic delay, but no level of service changes are
expected in either the AM or the PM peak hour at any study area intersections.

4.0 BUILD (2012) ANALYSIS
The proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside development will consist of 240 apartment dwelling
units.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Instead of using the national average rates published in the ITE Trip Generation, a trip
generation study was requested by the developer as part of this traffic study by counting the
existing apartment complex (the Apartments at Weston Lakeside) and developing proposed
trips for this adjacent development using the existing use. Traffic data from two surveys are
used in this analysis: the 1st survey was conducted by Traffic Survey Services, Inc. in April
2010, and the 2nd survey was using the peak period intersection turning movement counts
conducted by M/A/B in November 2010. The average traffic survey rate was used for the
subsequent trip generation for the proposed development.

Field investigation indicated that currently the Apartments at Weston Lakeside have 332
apartment dwelling units with a mix of 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom apartments, and these
apartments were approximately 90% occupied when traffic survey were conducted.
Therefore, a 0.9 occupancy factor was used in the calculation of average trip rates in the
traffic survey. The average survey rates were then multiplied by the number of planned
dwelling units to project the number of vehicle trips due to the Lofts at Weston Lakeside
project.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours. In total, the proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside
development is projected to generate 1,129 daily trips, with 109 projected trips occurring in
the AM peak hour (16 entering, 93 exiting), and 117 PM peak hour trips (85 entering, 32
exiting).

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
The generated site trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the existing
and future traffic patterns. In all, about 53% of site traffic was projected to access the site
via Weston Parkway to the east, 45% were projected via Weston Parkway to the west, and
2% were projected to occur between the project site and the office buildings in front of
Weston Parkway. Between the two planned site accesses, 75% of project traffic was
projected to access the site via Site Access #1 and 25% via Site Access #2.

The site distribution percentages are depicted in Figure 6, with the resulting site trips shown
in Figure 7.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2012) analysis scenario includes the Background (2012) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. In addition, as
this site plan also proposes to realign Old Reedy Creek Road into Winstead Drive, traffic
diversion was projected for the existing traffic on Winstead Drive and Old Reedy Creek
Road. Figure 8 depicts the projected traffic diversion due to the planned roadway
realignment, and Figure 9 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2012)
scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the full
Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the proposed project will not result in any significant level of service
degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area intersections.
The only LOS change occurs at the southbound Winstead Drive at Weston Parkway, which
is projected to decline from LOS E to LOS F in the AM peak hour with the projected site
trips and traffic diversion. The remaining study area intersections are projected to
experience traffic delay increases, but will continue operating at the same levels of service as
in the Background (2012) conditions. The proposed project will add four new stop-
controlled approaches due to the construction of the site accesses and the proposed roadway
realignment. All of the stop-controlled approaches at the realigned Old Reedy Creek Road
and Winstead Drive intersection, the Winstead Drive and Lakeside View Court/Site Access
#1 intersection, and the Old Reedy Creek Road and Site Access #2 intersection are
projected to operate at a LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside
development is projected to have an impact on the roadways and intersections within the
study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of
Cary's Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) requirements and NCDOT engineering
guidance:
Widening of Frontage along Old Reedy Creek Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen roadways along their frontage to
the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP).
The proposed Lofts at Weston Lakeside has frontage along Old Reedy Creek Road, which
has a two-lane undivided cross-section under the existing conditions. For this section of
Old Reedy Creek Road, the CTP dictates a two-lane collector avenue cross-section with two
travel lanes, bicycle lanes, a landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides
within 120 feet of right-of-way. However, per the Town of Cary approved rezoning case 10-
REZ-05 Weston PDD Amendment, the developer requested and was granted a waiver from
the LDO requirements of street frontage improvements along this property's frontage.

In lieu of making the required CTP roadway improvements, the applicant is committed to
the following roadway improvements with the development of this site:

   1. Winstead Drive will be re-aligned and merged with the northern portion of Old
      Reedy Creek Road to form one continuous roadway segment.
   2. On the southern end of the subject property, the southern portion of Old Reedy
      Creek Road will connect with the realigned segment of Winstead Drive.
   3. The newly realigned portion of Winstead Drive will be constructed to 65 feet back-
      to-back, median divided street section from Weston Parkway to the southernmost
      private drive serving the subject property and the existing Weston Lakeside
      Apartments.
   4. A second driveway connecting the subject property to the newly realigned Winstead
      Drive will be provided. In addition, the applicant proposes to stub an internal
      private street to the Weston Lakeside development that will be interconnected
      whenever development changes or requests are made by the Weston Lakeside
      development.
   5. A traffic signal and the associated improvements will be provided at the intersection
      of Weston Parkway and Winstead Drive. (Note: installation of signal will be subject
      to satisfying signal warrants as outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
      Devices).
   6. An additional 30' of right-of-way will be dedicated along the site's frontage on Old
      Reedy Creek Road in accordance with the Town's CTP.
   7. A sidewalk connection will be constructed along Winstead Drive from the subject
      property's southernmost driveway connection to Weston Parkway.
   8. 4' bike lanes will be striped along Winstead Drive from the subject property's
      southernmost driveway connection to Weston Parkway.
   9. A private sidewalk connection will be made internally to the subject property's
      southernmost private driveway connection to realigned Winstead Drive.

Old Reedy Creek Road and Winstead Drive (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to realign Old Reedy Creek Road into Winstead Drive to create a
new four-leg intersection, with stop control placed at the realigned southbound (eastbound)
Winstead Drive and northbound (westbound) Old Reedy Creek Road approaches while
allowing free flow on the northbound Winstead Drive and southbound Old Reedy Creek
Road approaches. Traffic analyses indicate that with the planned roadway geometrics and
traffic control, both the southbound (eastbound) Winstead Drive and the northbound
(westbound) Old Reedy Creek Road approaches will operate at a LOS A during both the
AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan standards for
the new roadways, and to improve traffic operations and safety at this location based on
NCDOT's engineering guidance:
     Construct the planned roadway realignment of Old Reedy Creek Road and Winstead
        Drive as shown on the site plan;
     Construct the northbound Winstead Drive approach to provide for an exclusive left-
        turn lane and a shared thru/right-turn lane;
     Construct the southbound Old Reedy Creek Road approach to provide for a shared
        thru/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 125 feet of full
        storage and appropriate taper;
     Construct the northbound (westbound) Old Reedy Creek Road approach to provide
        for an all-purpose lane under a stop control;
     Construct the southbound (eastbound) Winstead Drive approach to provide for an
        all-purpose lane under a stop control.

Weston Parkway Road and Winstead Drive (unsignalized/future signalized)
The site plan proposes installation of a traffic signal at the Winstead Drive and Weston
Parkway intersection. The traffic analyses indicate that under the existing stop control, the
southbound Winstead Drive approach is projected to decline to operate at a LOS F during
both the AM and PM peak hours, with 36.8 seconds of delay increases in the AM peak hour
and 52.7 seconds of delay increases in the PM peak hour. Peak hour traffic volumes at this
intersection meet warrants for a traffic signal as specified in the Manual of Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD), 2009 Edition. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended
based on the site plan and also required in order to meet the Town of Cary APFO
requirements:
     Conduct a full signal warrant analysis per MUTCD guidelines and install a traffic
         signal when warranted at this intersection that provides coordination with the
         adjacent Harrison Oaks Boulevard and Norwell Boulevard traffic signals along
         Weston Parkway;

If the northbound approach is to remain right-in/right-out, the signal will operate at LOS B.
However, if the Town of Cary decides to open the northbound office driveway approach to
full access under signal control, the signal is projected to still operate at LOS B or better.
Coordination with the existing offices across Weston Parkway will be required to convert the
northbound approach to full movement, including removal of concrete median, signal pole
placement, lane striping, and loop installation.

Winstead Drive and Lakeside View Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled eastbound approach of Lakeside View
Court is projected to operate at LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore,
to provide safe ingress/egress to the site, the following driveway configurations and
geometric improvements are recommended based on the proposed site plan:
    Construct the planned Access #1 with one ingress lane and one egress lane;
    Restripe the northbound Access #1 (originally Winstead Drive) to provide a thru
        lane and an exclusive left-turn lane;
    Install stop control on the eastbound Lakeside View Court approach.

Old Reedy Creek Road and Access #2 (future unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled eastbound approach of Site Access #2
is projected to operate at LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, to
provide safe ingress/egress to the site, the following driveway configuration is recommended
at this location per the proposed site plan:
      Construct the planned Access #2 with one ingress lane and one egress lane.

The remaining intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours; thus, no further improvements are recommended.

A summary of LOS results across Existing, Background and Build scenarios is shown in
Table 7, and the resulting future lane configuration and traffic control for 2012 are depicted
in Figure 10.

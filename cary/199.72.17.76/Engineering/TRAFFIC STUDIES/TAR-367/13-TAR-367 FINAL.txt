EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
There are plans to construct the second phase of the Bradford Mixed-Use development in
the northeastern quadrant of the High House Road and Davis Drive intersection in Cary,
NC (Figure 1). The development is proposed to be constructed by 2015 and consists of the
following uses:
   ·   Supermarket ­ 49,098 square feet
   ·   2 Banks ­ 4 drive-thru lanes each (8 total)
   ·   Gas Station/Convenience Market ­ 16 fueling positions
   ·   General Retail ­ 22,000 square feet
   ·   High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant ­ 6,000 square feet
   ·   Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru Window ­ 4,500 square feet

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four driveways ­ two full accesses
(future signalized) along Davis Drive, one full access (future signalized) along High House
Road and one restricted (right-in/right-out, RIRO) access along High House Road (Figure
2). The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   Davis Drive and Preston Village Way/Hogan's Valley Way (signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and High House Road (signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and Cornerstone Drive/Searstone Drive (signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and Waldo Rood Boulevard (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Waldo Rood Boulevard/Bebington Drive (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Towne Village Drive/Huntsmoor Lane (signalized)
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Carpenter Upchurch Road (unsignalized)
   ·   High House Road and Jenks Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
   ·   High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road (signalized)
   ·   High House Road and Cornerstone Drive (signalized)
   ·   High House Road and Prestonwood Parkway/Legaut Drive (signalized)
   ·   High House Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and Riggsbee Farm Drive/Access #1 ­ Magness Drive (existing
       unsignalized, future signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and Valleystone Drive/Access #2 ­ Bradford Green Square (existing
       unsignalized, future signalized)
   ·   High House Road and Access #3 ­ Bradford Plaza Way (future unsignalized, RIRO)
   ·   High House Road and Lilly Ridge Road/Access #4 ­ Magness Drive (future
       signalized)


                                             i
Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2012), Background (2015), Build
(2015), and Build (2015) with Improvements. The Existing (2012) scenario includes AM and
PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in August,
November and December 2012. The Background (2015) scenario includes existing traffic
with four approved developments, two of which are in the Draft report stage, and projected
annual growth. The Build (2015) scenario includes Background (2015) volumes with the
addition of site trips generated by the proposed development. In addition, future conditions
with required mitigations in place were analyzed in a Build (2015) with Improvements
scenario.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.

As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vii, the majority of the
study area intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service, LOS D or better, with a
few exceptions. The signalized High House Road and Davis Drive intersection is currently
operating at LOS F during the PM peak hour, while the High House Road and Cary
Parkway intersection is currently operating at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS F
during the PM peak hour. Additionally, the eastbound stop-controlled Riggsbee Farm Drive
approach along Davis Drive is currently operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM
peak hours, while the northbound stop-controlled Jenks Carpenter Road approach along
High House Road operates at LOS F during the PM peak hour. The stop-controlled
eastbound Valleystone Drive approach along Davis Drive is also operating at LOS F during
the PM peak hour.

As for transit operations, the area is directly served by C-Tran Route 4, with multiple bus
stops located along High House Road within the study area. C-Tran Route 4 offers riders
the opportunity to use Triangle Transit's Route 311 by way of a transfer point west of the
study area (along NC 55).

Background (2015) Conditions
In the Background (2015) conditions, an annual growth rate of one percent (1%) was applied
to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year (2012) and the
build year (2015). Furthermore, there are four other developments in the vicinity projected
to be constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
development. Site traffic associated with these approved developments was individually
included in the Background (2015) analysis; however, based on Town of Cary guidance,
none of the off-site improvements associated with these developments were included in the
analysis, with the exception of the site driveways and associated signalization for this
development, as they are currently under construction.

Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the study area intersections are projected to
degrade in general; however there are some intersections that operate better than in the
Existing scenario due to optimized signal timings.



                                              ii
The signalized High House Road and Davis Drive intersection is projected to degrade from
LOS D to LOS E in the AM peak hour, while continuing to operate at LOS F during the
PM peak hour. The signalized High House Road and Cary Parkway intersection is projected
to continue operating at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS F during the PM peak
hour with increased traffic delay. The stop-controlled northbound Jenks Carpenter Road
approach along High House Road is projected to degrade from LOS C to LOS E during the
AM peak hour, while continuing to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour.

Three of the existing unsignalized intersections ­ High House Road and Lilly Ridge Road,
Davis Drive and Riggsbee Farm Drive, and Davis Drive and Valleystone Drive ­ are
projected to operate at acceptable levels of service after being converted to signalized
intersections in conjunction with the construction of fourth legs that will serve Phase 1 of
the Bradford Development (as well as Phase 2). Only on-site improvements, those at the
site driveways, were assumed in this scenario.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The development is proposed to consist of the following uses:
   · Supermarket ­ 49,098 square feet
   · 2 Banks ­ 4 drive-thru lanes each (8 total)
   · Gas Station/Convenience Market ­ 16 fueling positions
   · General Retail ­ 22,000 square feet
   · High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant ­ 6,000 square feet
   · Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru Window ­ 4,500 square feet

Trip generation was conducted for each category based on the most appropriate
corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and
the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet. Internal
capture and pass-by trips were calculated based on standard ITE rates. No transit reduction
was applied due to area characteristics.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 12,332 daily site trips, 709
AM peak hour site trips (389 entering, 320 exiting), and 1,282 PM peak hour site trips (648
entering, 634 exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing
turning movement counts and land uses.

Build (2015) Conditions
The Build (2015) conditions account for both the Background (2015) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on
page vii, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase traffic delay for all study area
intersections.

The signalized High House Road and Davis Drive intersection is projected to continue
operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F during the PM peak hour. The
signalized High House Road and Cary Parkway intersection is projected to continue
operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour while continuing to operate at LOS F during the
PM peak hour. The stop-controlled northbound Jenks Carpenter Road approach along

                                              iii
High House Road is projected to continue operating at LOS E during the AM peak hour
and LOS F during the PM peak hour.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have an impact on several of the study area intersections. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's APFO and
NCDOT requirements:

Frontage Widening
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed development has frontage along both High House Road and Davis Drive.
However, these two roadways are currently at their ultimate cross-sections. Therefore, no
frontage widening is required as part of this proposed development.

Davis Drive and High House Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in the AM
peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are
required at this location to meet the Town of Cary's APFO:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along High House Road that
        provides at least 300 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared westbound thru/right-turn lane to an exclusive thru lane.
    · Modify the signal phasing to accommodate the geometric improvements.

With the improvements, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS D in the AM peak
hour, while continuing to operate LOS F in the PM peak hour. However, the Build (2015)
with Improvements PM peak hour delay is 4.6 seconds/vehicle less than the PM peak hour
delay in the Background (2015) scenario.

High House Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an LOS E in the
AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are
required at this location to meet the Town of Cary's APFO:
    · Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane that provides at least 300 feet of
        full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared southbound thru/right-turn lane to an exclusive thru
        lane.
    · Modify the signal phasing to accommodate the geometric modifications.

With the improvements, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in the AM peak
hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. However, both the Build (2015) with Improvements
AM and PM peak hour delays are less than the Background (2015) AM and PM peak hour
delays by 2.0 seconds/vehicle and 26.4 seconds/vehicle, respectively.




                                              iv
High House Road and Jenks Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection currently operates at a poor LOS F in the
PM peak hour and is projected to operate at an LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in
the PM peak hour in the future. There are no geometric improvements that would alleviate
the projected delay at this intersection, and signalization is not warranted and would also not
be ideal due the close proximity to the adjacent High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch
signalized intersection.

Therefore, to meet Town of Cary APFO requirements, it is recommended that the
northbound left-turns from Jenks Carpenter Road be restricted so that this intersection
becomes a right-in/right-out with a westbound left-over. The restricted left-turning traffic
would either find alternative routes to their destinations or make a right-turn onto High
House Road, and then make a u-turn at Carpenter Upchurch Road to continue westbound
along High House Road.

Davis Drive and Riggsbee Farm Road/Magness Drive-Access #1 (future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed in the Background (2015) analysis based on the site plan and are
required to meet the APFO if not constructed by Bradford Phase I:
    · Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides
        at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper. This improvement is under
        construction now as part of Phase 1.
    · Construct the westbound Magness Drive (Access #1) approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ a shared thru/right lane and an exclusive left-turn
        lane that provides at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Install the signal as per the signal plan dated January 25, 2012.

Davis Drive and Valleystone Drive/Bradford Green Square-Access #2 (future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed in the Background (2015) analysis based on the site plan and are
required to meet the APFO if not constructed by Bradford Phase I:
    · Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides
        at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper. This improvement is under
        construction now. This improvement is under construction now as part of Phase 1.
    · Construct an exclusive southbound left-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides at
        least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Construct the westbound Bradford Green Square (Access #2) approach to provide
        for one ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ a shared thru/right lane and an exclusive
        left-turn lane.
    · Install the signal as per the signal plan dated January 25, 2012.




                                              v
High House Road and Bradford Plaza Way ­ Access #3 (unsignalized, right-in/right-out)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed based on the site plan for this analysis:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along High House Road that
        provides at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Construct the southbound Bradford Plaza Way (Access #3) approach to provide for
        one ingress lane and one right-turn-only egress lane.

High House Road and /Lilly Ridge Road/Magness Drive-Access #4 (future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed in the Background (2015) based on the site plan and are required
to meet the APFO if not constructed by Bradford Phase I:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along High House Road that
        provides at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Construct the southbound Magness Drive (Access #4) approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ a shared thru/right lane and an exclusive left-turn
        lane that extends to the adjacent internal intersection.
    · Install the signal as per the signal plan dated October 23, 2012.

The remaining study area intersections are projected to operate acceptably in the future year
with no improvements required.

Site Plan Comments
Due to the short throat distance at the Bradford Green Square ­ Access #2 queuing could
be a potential issue at the internal cross-access particularly during the PM peak hour.
Therefore, it is recommended that a stopbar and stop sign be installed on the westbound
approach at the internal intersection (Bradford View Drive and Bradford Green Square) in
order to accommodate ingressing traffic into the site and not allow for any queuing back to
the signal along Davis Drive.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in the table on page vii, and the
resulting future lane configurations and traffic control for 2015 are shown in Figure ES-1 on
page viii.

1.0    INTRODUCTION
There are plans to construct the second phase of the Bradford Mixed-Use development in
the northeastern quadrant of the High House Road and Davis Drive intersection in Cary,
NC (Figure 1). The development is proposed to be constructed by 2015 and consists of the
following uses:
   ·   Supermarket ­ 49,098 square feet
   ·   2 Banks ­ 4 drive-thru lanes each (8 total)
   ·   Gas Station/Convenience Market ­ 16 fueling positions
   ·   General Retail ­ 22,000 square feet
   ·   High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant ­ 6,000 square feet
   ·   Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru Window ­ 4,500 square feet

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four driveways ­ two full accesses
(future signalized) along Davis Drive, one full access (future signalized) along High House
Road and one restricted (right-in/right-out, RIRO) access along High House Road (Figure
2). The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   Davis Drive and Preston Village Way/Hogan's Valley Way (signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and High House Road (signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and Cornerstone Drive/Searstone Drive (signalized)
   ·   Davis Drive and Waldo Rood Boulevard (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Waldo Rood Boulevard/Bebington Drive (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Towne Village Drive/Huntsmoor Lane (signalized)
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Carpenter Upchurch Road (unsignalized)
   ·   High House Road and Jenks Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
   ·   High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road (signalized)
   ·   High House Road and Cornerstone Drive (signalized)
   ·   High House Road and Prestonwood Parkway/Legaut Drive (signalized)
   ·   High House Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

were adjusted to ensure proper balancing throughout the study area.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                     CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

The development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone." Level of
service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour (as
defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) with LOS D considered acceptable for
both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service less than LOS D, then
no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections, where the stop controlled approach is below an LOS D under background
conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans
from the Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for
the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output
can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, the majority of the study area intersections are operating at
acceptable levels of service, LOS D or better, with a few exceptions. The signalized High
House Road and Davis Drive intersection is currently operating at LOS F during the PM
peak hour, while the High House Road and Cary Parkway intersection is currently operating
at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS F during the PM peak hour. Additionally, the

                                                 14
eastbound stop-controlled Riggsbee Farm Drive approach along Davis Drive is currently
operating at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours, while the northbound stop-
controlled Jenks Carpenter Road approach along High House Road operates at LOS F
during the PM peak hour. The stop-controlled eastbound Valleystone Drive approach along
Davis Drive is also operating at LOS F during the PM peak hour.

3.0    BACKGROUND (2015) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH
               GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Based on Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) collected by the NCDOT over the past
half-decade, annual traffic growth in the area has been approximately one percent 1%. In
addition, four developments in the vicinity are expected to be completed prior to, or at the
same time as the build-out of the proposed development. Therefore, traffic generated from
these approved or planned projects was included, partially or wholly, in the Background
(2015) scenario where appropriate. These projects include:

Bradford Mixed-Use Development ­ (07-TAR-231A): Located in the northeast corner of the
Davis Drive and High House Road intersection (on the same site as this proposed
development, 13-TAR-367), the overall development is to consist of 200,000 square feet of
shopping center, 50,000 square feet of office development, and 450 condominium units and
be constructed by 2010. A traffic analysis report was prepared by SEPI Engineering Group,
Inc and submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2007. As detailed in the report, the
development is projected to generate 13,744 daily site trips, 518 AM peak hour site trips (269
entering, 249 exiting) and 1,330 PM peak hour site trips (636 entering, 694 exiting).
However, the site plan submitted as part of this project (13-TAR-367) indicates that only 370
apartment/condominiums and 20 townhomes are being constructed in Phase 1. Therefore,
trip generation using ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition for the corresponding land uses,
and was distributed throughout the study area in order to estimate of the actual traffic being
generated by Phase 1 of the development. Field visits indicate that Phase 1 is being
constructed and is expected to be completed by the build year of the proposed development.
Therefore 100% of the newly calculated traffic associated with the 390 residential units in
the Bradford Mixed-Use Development ­ Phase 1 was included in the Background (2015)
analysis. Figure D-1 in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

Searstone (07-TAR-236A): Located in the southeast corner of the Davis Drive and High
House Road intersection, the development is to consist of a 135,000 square-foot shopping
center, 50,000 square feet of office development, 200 1-bedroom residential units, 409 age-
restricted apartment units, a 100-room hotel, and a 155-bed healthcare facility. The
development is scheduled for completions by 2013. A traffic analysis report was prepared
by SEPI Engineering Group, Inc and submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2007 As
detailed in the report, the development is projected to generate 12,232 daily site trips, 476
AM peak hour site trips (266 entering, 210 exiting) and 1,123 PM peak hour site trips (527
entering, 596 exiting. These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on
the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Field visits indicate that this development is
partially constructed and occupied, with the remaining development expected to be fully
constructed and occupied by the build year of the proposed development. Therefore 75%
of the traffic associated with the Searstone Development was included in the Background
(2015) analysis. Figure D-2 in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

Collins Grove Development (12-TAR-347): Located in the southwest corner of the Waldo Rood
Boulevard and Collins Road intersection, the development is to consist of 114 townhome
units and be constructed by 2015. A Draft traffic analysis report was prepared by Ramey
Kemp & Associates, Inc and submitted to the Town of Cary in August 2012. As shown in

                                              18
the report, the development is projected to generate 721 daily site trips, 58 AM peak hour
site trips (10 entering, 48 exiting) and 67 PM peak hour site trips (45 entering, 22 exiting).
These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed
distribution patterns in the report. Note, this development is currently in the Draft TAR
phase. Therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with the Collins Grove Development was
included in the Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-3 in Appendix D depicts the assigned
trips.

Singh Residential (13-TAR-357A): Located in the southwest corner of the Cary Parkway and
Evans Road intersection, the development is to consist of 216 apartment dwelling units and
be constructed by 2015. A Draft traffic analysis report was prepared by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in October 2012. As
detailed in the report, the development is projected to generate 1,433 daily site trips, 110 AM
peak hour site trips (22 entering, 88 exiting) and 136 PM peak hour site trips (88 entering, 48
exiting. These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed
distribution patterns in the report. Note, this development is currently in the Draft TAR
phase. Therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with the Singh Residential development
was included in the Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-4 in Appendix D depicts the
assigned trips.

The total site trips from the approved developments included in the Background (2015)
analysis are included in Figure D-5 in Appendix D. The Background (2015) peak hour trips
are shown in Figure 5.

3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANAL
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2015) scenario LOS analysis can
be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the study area intersections are projected to
degrade in general; however there are some intersections that operate better than in the
Existing scenario due to optimized signal timings.

The signalized High House Road and Davis Drive intersection is projected to degrade from
LOS D to LOS E in the AM peak hour, while continuing to operate at LOS F during the
PM peak hour. The signalized High House Road and Cary Parkway intersection is projected
to continue operating at LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS F during the PM peak
hour with increased traffic delay. The stop-controlled northbound Jenks Carpenter Road
approach along High House Road is projected to degrade from LOS C to LOS E during the
AM peak hour, while continuing to operate at LOS F during the PM peak hour.

Three of the existing unsignalized intersections ­ High House Road and Lilly Ridge Road,
Davis Drive and Riggsbee Farm Drive, and Davis Drive and Valleystone Drive ­ are
projected to operate at acceptable levels of service after being converted to signalized
intersections in conjunction with the construction of fourth legs that will serve Phase 1 of
the Bradford Development (as well as Phase 2). Only on-site improvements, those at the
site driveways, were assumed in this scenario.

4.0    BUILD (2015) ANALYSIS
There are plans to construct the second phase of the Bradford Mixed-Use development in
the northeastern quadrant of the High House Road and Davis Drive intersection in Cary,
NC (Figure 1).

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The development is proposed to consist of the following uses:
   · Supermarket ­ 49,098 square feet
   · 2 Banks ­ 4 drive-thru lanes each (8 total)
   · Gas Station/Convenience Market ­ 16 fueling positions
   · General Retail ­ 22,000 square feet
   · High-Turnover (Sit-Down) Restaurant ­ 6,000 square feet
   · Fast-Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru Window ­ 4,500 square feet

Trip generation was conducted for each category based on the most appropriate
corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and
the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet. Internal
capture and pass-by trips were calculated based on standard ITE rates.

Additionally, there is a transit route that directly serves the proposed development along
High House Road. However, while the existing and proposed facilities are viable alternatives
to single-occupancy vehicles, these reductions are deemed to be negligible, and therefore no
multi-modal reductions were taken.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 12,332 daily site trips, 709
AM peak hour site trips (389 entering, 320 exiting), and 1,282 PM peak hour site trips (648
entering, 634 exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing
turning movement counts and land uses.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation of the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
                             ASSIGNMENT
The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and
the land uses in the vicinity of study area as follows:
    · 12% to/from Davis Drive to the north
    · 24% to/from Davis Drive to the south
    · 17% to/from High House Road to the west
    · 14% to/from High House Road to the east
    · 5% to/from Cary Parkway to the north
    · 7% to/from Cary Parkway to the south
    · 2% to/from Waldo Rood Boulevard to the west

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
The Build (2015) analysis scenario includes the Background (2015) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 11 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2015) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the build year
analysis. Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the
full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase traffic delay for all
study area intersections.

The signalized High House Road and Davis Drive intersection is projected to continue
operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F during the PM peak hour. The
signalized High House Road and Cary Parkway intersection is projected to continue
operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour while continuing to operate at LOS F during the
PM peak hour. The stop-controlled northbound Jenks Carpenter Road approach along
High House Road is projected to continue operating at LOS E during the AM peak hour
and LOS F during the PM peak hour.

5.0     FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
                     CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have an impact on several of the study area intersections. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's APFO and
NCDOT requirements:

Frontage Widening
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed development has frontage along both High House Road and Davis Drive.
However, these two roadways are currently at their ultimate cross-sections. Therefore, no
frontage widening is required as part of this proposed development.

Davis Drive and High House Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in the AM
peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are
required at this location to meet the Town of Cary's APFO:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along High House Road that
        provides at least 300 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared westbound thru/right-turn lane to an exclusive thru lane.
    · Modify the signal phasing to accommodate the geometric improvements.

With the improvements, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS D in the AM peak
hour, while continuing to operate LOS F in the PM peak hour. However, the Build (2015)
with Improvements PM peak hour delay is 4.6 seconds/vehicle less than the PM peak hour
delay in the Background (2015) scenario.

High House Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an LOS E in the
AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are
required at this location to meet the Town of Cary's APFO:
    · Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane that provides at least 300 feet of
        full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared southbound thru/right-turn lane to an exclusive thru
        lane.
    · Modify the signal phasing to accommodate the geometric modifications.

With the improvements, this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in the AM peak
hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. However, both the Build (2015) with Improvements
AM and PM peak hour delays are less than the Background (2015) AM and PM peak hour
delays by 2.0 seconds/vehicle and 26.4 seconds/vehicle, respectively.




                                              34
High House Road and Jenks Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection currently operates at a poor LOS F in the
PM peak hour and is projected to operate at an LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in
the PM peak hour in the future. There are no geometric improvements that would alleviate
the projected delay at this intersection, and signalization is not warranted and would also not
be ideal due the close proximity to the adjacent High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch
signalized intersection.

Therefore, to meet Town of Cary APFO requirements, it is recommended that the
northbound left-turns from Jenks Carpenter Road be restricted so that this intersection
becomes a right-in/right-out with a westbound left-over. The restricted left-turning traffic
would either find alternative routes to their destinations or make a right-turn onto High
House Road, and then make a u-turn at Carpenter Upchurch Road to continue westbound
along High House Road.

Davis Drive and Riggsbee Farm Road/Magness Drive-Access #1 (future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed in the Background (2015) analysis based on the site plan and are
required to meet the APFO if not constructed by Bradford Phase I:
    · Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides
        at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper. This improvement is under
        construction now as part of Phase 1.
    · Construct the westbound Magness Drive (Access #1) approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ a shared thru/right lane and an exclusive left-turn
        lane that provides at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Install the signal as per the signal plan dated January 25, 2012.

Davis Drive and Valleystone Drive/Bradford Green Square-Access #2 (future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed in the Background (2015) analysis based on the site plan and are
required to meet the APFO if not constructed by Bradford Phase I:
    · Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides
        at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper. This improvement is under
        construction now. This improvement is under construction now as part of Phase 1.
    · Construct an exclusive southbound left-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides at
        least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Construct the westbound Bradford Green Square (Access #2) approach to provide
        for one ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ a shared thru/right lane and an exclusive
        left-turn lane.
    · Install the signal as per the signal plan dated January 25, 2012.




                                              35
High House Road and Bradford Plaza Way ­ Access #3 (unsignalized, right-in/right-out)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed based on the site plan for this analysis:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along High House Road that
        provides at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Construct the southbound Bradford Plaza Way (Access #3) approach to provide for
        one ingress lane and one right-turn-only egress lane.

High House Road and /Lilly Ridge Road/Magness Drive-Access #4 (future signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during the AM and PM peak hours based on the geometrics shown in the
proposed development's conceptual site plan (dated November 5, 2012). The following
geometrics were assumed in the Background (2015) based on the site plan and are required
to meet the APFO if not constructed by Bradford Phase I:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along High House Road that
        provides at least 150 feet of full storage with an appropriate taper.
    · Construct the southbound Magness Drive (Access #4) approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ a shared thru/right lane and an exclusive left-turn
        lane that extends to the adjacent internal intersection.
    · Install the signal as per the signal plan dated October 23, 2012.

The remaining study area intersections are projected to operate acceptably in the future year
with no improvements required.

Site Plan Comments
Due to the short throat distance at the Bradford Green Square ­ Access #2 queuing could
be a potential issue at the internal cross-access particularly during the PM peak hour.
Therefore, it is recommended that a stopbar and stop sign be installed on the westbound
approach at the internal intersection (Bradford View Drive and Bradford Green Square) in
order to accommodate ingressing traffic into the site and not allow for any queuing back to
the signal along Davis Drive.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configurations and traffic control for 2015 are shown in Figure 12.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
Lennar Carolinas, LLC proposes to construct a mixed-use development, Cary Towne
Boulevard Property, immediately north of Cary Towne Boulevard at Trinity Road in eastern
Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is expected to be completed by 2018. The
development consists of a mixture of residential and commercial uses as follows:
    200 Townhomes
    200 Single-Family Detached Homes
    200,000 Square Feet of Retail
The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" as defined in
the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

As shown on the Site Plan (Figure 2), access to the development will be provided via a total
of six access points along Cary Towne Boulevard, Trinity Road, and a future Collector
Avenue to be constructed on the project site:
       Access A: Cary Towne Boulevard ­ right-in/right-out (RIRO) access, approximately
       750 feet west of Trinity Road
       Access B & Access C: Trinity Road ­ temporary full movement, ultimate RIRO
       with left-in access, approximately 650 feet north of Cary Towne Boulevard
       Access D: Trinity Road ­ full movement access across from future Collector
       Avenue, approximately 1,150 feet north of Cary Towne Boulevard
       Access E: Collector Avenue ­ full movement access, approximately 600 feet
       north/west of Trinity Road
       Access F: Collector Avenue ­ full movement access, approximately 2,000 feet
       north/west of Trinity Road

The Town of Cary requires inclusion of intersections within one (1) mile of the proposed
development. The site is located in the Base Transportation Zone; however, several
intersections within the study area are located in the Central Transportation Zone. In total,
the following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and
were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       S.E. Maynard Road at Walnut Street (signalized)*
       S.E. Maynard Road at Cary Towne Boulevard (signalized)*
       S.E. Maynard Road at Village Greenway/East Cary M.S. (signalized) *
       N.E. Maynard Road at E. Chatham Street (signalized)*
       N.E. Maynard Road at Chapel Hill Road (signalized)*
       Cary Towne Boulevard at Walnut Street/Village Square Shopping Center
       (signalized)*
       Walnut Street at Ryan Road/Tanglewood Drive (unsignalized)*
       Cary Towne Boulevard at Convention Drive/Principal Lane (signalized)
       Cary Towne Boulevard at I-40 Eastbound Ramps (unsignalized)

       Collector Avenue at Access E (unsignalized)
       Collector Avenue at Access F (unsignalized)
* Intersections located in the Central Transportation Zone

As requested by the Town, four access scenarios were included in the study to account for
different access plans at Accesses B & C and roadway width on Trinity Road. In total,
analysis was performed under ten scenarios: Existing (2012), Background (2018), Build A
(2018), Build A (2018) with Improvements, Build B (2018), Build B (2018) with
Improvements, Build C (2018), Build C (2018) with Improvements, Build D (2018), and
Build D (2018) with Improvements. The Existing (2012) scenario includes AM and PM
peak hour analysis based on turning movement counts collected in 2012. The Background
(2018) scenario includes existing traffic with projected annual growth and site traffic from
one proposed development in the vicinity. The Build A (2018) scenario includes
Background (2018) volumes with the addition of net new site trips generated by the
proposed development, assuming full movement access at Accesses B & C and a two-lane
roadway for Trinity Road. The Build B (2018) scenario includes the same access plans and
volume projections as Build A, but assuming a four-lane roadway for Trinity Road. The
Build C (2018) scenario includes traffic reassignment assuming restricted access at Accesses
B & C, assuming a two-lane roadway for Trinity Road. The Build D (2018) scenario includes
the same access plans and traffic volume projections as Build C, but assumes a four-lane
roadway for Trinity Road. Additionally, future conditions with the proposed mitigation
improvements in place for each Build scenario were analyzed in Build A (2018) with
Improvements, Build B (2018) with Improvements, Build C (2018) with Improvements, and
Build D (2018) with Improvements scenarios.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. For the signalized intersections, traffic signal plans and timings
were obtained from the Town of Cary and used for the Existing (2012) analysis.

As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page xii, all but one of the
signalized intersections and stop-controlled approaches included in the study area are
currently operating at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Specifically, the stop-controlled I-40 Eastbound Off-Ramp at Cary Towne Boulevard is
operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour.



                                             ii
Background (2018) Conditions
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed minimal or negative
traffic growth between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. To provide a conservative analysis,
an annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to existing traffic at the Base Zone
intersections and one percent (1%) to the Central Zone intersections to account for ambient
traffic growth between the base year (2012) and the build year (2018). In addition, site traffic
from one proposed development, Village Square Redevelopment, in the vicinity of study
area was included in the analysis.

Based on the Background (2018) analysis, the stop-controlled I-40 Eastbound Off-Ramp at
Cary Towne Boulevard is projected to continue operating at a failing level of service in the
PM peak hour with increased traffic delay. In addition, two stop-controlled approaches are
projected to decline to failing levels of service in the PM peak hour. Specifically, the I-40
Westbound Off-Ramp at Cary Towne Boulevard is projected to decline from LOS C to LOS
E in the PM peak hour, and the southbound Trinity Road at E. Chatham Street is projected
to degrade from LOS D to LOS F in the PM peak hour. The remaining signalized
intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to continue operating at acceptable
levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed Cary Towne Boulevard Property development is to consist of the following
land uses:
       200 Townhomes
       200 Single-Family Detached Homes
       200,000 Square Feet of Retail

Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition. Internal capture between different types of
land uses and pass-by trips for commercial uses were calculated based on standard ITE
procedures and NCDOT guidance.

In total, the proposed development is projected to generate 11,817 external daily trips with
478 trips occurring in the AM peak hour (201 entering, 277 exiting) and 1,053 trips occurring
in the PM peak hour trips (550 entering, 503 exiting).

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing and future traffic patterns
and surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build A (2018) Conditions
The Build A (2018) conditions account for Background (2018) traffic and site traffic
generated by the proposed development. Full movement accesses at Accesses B & C and a
two-lane roadway for Trinity Road are assumed under the Build A conditions.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page xii, the addition of site trips will incur delay
increases at signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches across the study area. As a


                                               iii
result, both the I-40 Eastbound and Westbound Off-Ramps at Cary Towne Boulevard are
projected to decline to operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak
hour, while the southbound Trinity Road at E. Chatham Street is projected to continue to
operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour with increased traffic delay. The remaining off-site
signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to remain operating at
acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

As for the on-site intersections, the southbound Trinity Road at Cary Towne Boulevard is
projected to operate at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours under stop control.
The westbound Access C on Trinity Road is projected to operate at LOS F in the PM peak
hour. The remaining site accesses are projected to operate at LOS C or better during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

Build A Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections within the
study area, causing traffic delay increases and failing levels of service at three off-site and two
on-site intersections. In addition, the Town of Cary requires new developments widen the
roads along the frontage of their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary
Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP). The following roadway improvements are
recommended based on the Town of Cary's CTP, Adequate Public Facility Ordinances
(APFO), and NCDOT engineering guidance requirements:
Frontage Widening along Cary Towne Boulevard
For the section of Cary Towne Boulevard in front of the development, the CTP dictates a
six-lane major arterial cross-section with four 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside
travel lanes, a landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 124 feet of
right-of-way. Therefore, the following improvements are required to meet the CTP
standards:
        Widen the section of both sides of Cary Towne Boulevard along the property
        frontage to achieve the ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP.

Trinity Road
For the section of Trinity Road within the project site, the CTP dictates a four-lane arterial
cross-section with two 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside travel lanes, a
landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides. As requested by the Town, a
two-lane roadway in its present condition is assumed on Trinity Road under Build A.
Despite the reduced cross-section assumption, right-of-way should be dedicated for this
section of roadway based on the ultimate cross-section requirements by the CTP.

Collector Avenue
The site plan proposes to build a collector avenue on the project site to be consistent with
the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan. Therefore, the following is
recommended to meet the CTP standards:
     Construct the section of roadway with a standard collector avenue cross-section
         between Trinity Road and the western property line.


                                                iv
Cary Towne Boulevard and I-40 Eastbound Ramps (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that after the project build-out, this intersection will operate at
failing levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours with the current lane
geometrics and traffic control. This intersection is also operating at failing LOS in the PM
peak hour under the Existing and Background conditions. Existing peak hour traffic
volumes warrant installation of a traffic signal at this intersection. Therefore, the following
roadway improvements are recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis, and install a traffic signal when warranted at
       this intersection.

Cary Towne Boulevard and I-40 Westbound Ramps (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that after the project build-out, this intersection will operate at
failing levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours with the current lane
geometrics and traffic control. This intersection is operating at failing LOS in the PM peak
hour under Background conditions; however, existing peak hour traffic volumes at this
intersection do not warrant installation of a traffic signal at this time. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements are recommended to meet the Town APFO requirements:
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis after the project build-out, and install a traffic
       signal when warranted at this intersection.

Trinity Road and E. Chatham Street (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the southbound Trinity Road at E. Chatham Street will
operate at failing conditions in the PM peak hour. The following roadway improvements are
recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an exclusive right-turn
       lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and taper.

It should be noted that this improvement will require widening along the section of Trinity
Road across the CSX Railroad Crossing. The close spacing between E. Chatham Street and
CSX Railroad Crossing presents a constructability issue to this improvement. Alternatively,
a traffic signal is warranted based on peak hour traffic volumes, and installation of a traffic
signal would meet the Town APFO requirements if a traffic signal agreement can be reached
with NCDOT, the Town and CSX at this intersection.

In the long term, the Town of Cary CTP ultimately calls for widening and extending Trinity
Road to a four-lane, median divided roadway between Cary Towne Boulevard and Chapel
Hill Road. Different widening and extension alternatives have been investigated by
NCDOT and the Town of Cary; as a result, Trinity Road may be realigned to cross CSX
Railroad and E. Chatham Street at a different location. Nevertheless, the proposed turning
lane or signalization improvement should be considered as an interim solution at this
intersection at this time.

Trinity Road and Cary Towne Boulevard (future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that southbound Trinity Road will operate at failing levels of service
with the planned lane geometrics and stop control. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve traffic
operations and safety:

                                               v
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide a continuous exclusive
       right-turn lane;
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis after the project build-out, and install a three-
       phase traffic signal when warranted at this intersection.

Cary Towne Boulevard and Access A (future right-in/right-out)
The site plan proposes to construct Access A as a right-in/right-out access on Cary Towne
Boulevard. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations
are recommended to provide access and to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access A at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Widen the westbound approach of Cary Towne Boulevard to provide an exclusive
       right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

Trinity Road and Access B/Access C (future unsignalized)
Build A assumes Accesses B and C as full movement access points at the planned location.
Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access C will operate at failing levels of service
in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and temporary
driveway configurations are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve
traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access B at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Construct Access C at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including an exclusive right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane
       with at least 100 feet of storage length;
       Widen the northbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an exclusive left-turn
       lane with at least of 100 feet of storage length and an exclusive right-turn lane with at
       least 200 feet of storage length;
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through
       lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length.

The additional southbound through lane on Trinity Road should form a continuous travel
lane extending back to Collector Avenue/Access D, and terminate as a continuous right-turn
lane at Cary Towne Boulevard.

Trinity Road and Collector Avenue/Access D (future unsignalized)
Access D is planned as a full movement access point across from the planned Collector
Avenue in all traffic scenarios. Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access D will
operate at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Nevertheless, traffic operations will deteriorate if Trinity Road is extended northward in the
future. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access D at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including a through lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least
       150 feet of storage length;
       Widen the northbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an exclusive left-turn

                                              vi
       lane with at least of 150 feet of storage length.

Collector Avenue and Access E (future unsignalized)
Access E is planned as a full movement access point across all traffic scenarios. Traffic
analyses indicate that the northbound Access E will operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM and PM peak hours. Nevertheless, traffic operations may deteriorate
when Collector Avenue is extended westward to connect to Maynard Road in the future.
Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access E at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Widen the westbound approach of Collector Avenue to provide an exclusive left-
       turn lane with at least of 100 feet of storage length.

Collector Avenue and Access F (future unsignalized)
Access F is planned as a full movement access point across all traffic scenarios. Traffic
analyses indicate that the northbound Access F will operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM and PM peak hours. Nevertheless, traffic operations may deteriorate
when Collector Avenue is extended westward to connect to Maynard Road in the future.
Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access F at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound;
       Widen the westbound approach of Collector Avenue to provide an exclusive left-
       turn lane with at least of 100 feet of storage length.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2018) and Build A (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

Build B (2018) Conditions
The Build B (2018) conditions include the same access plans and volume projections as
Build A. However, a four-lane roadway is now assumed for Trinity Road.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page xii, traffic operations are identical at the off-
site intersections and very similar at the on-site intersections between Build A and Build B.
As a result, the failing unsignalized approaches in Build A remain operating at failing levels
of service in Build B, while the non-failing signalized intersections and unsignalized
approaches remain operate at acceptable levels of service in Build B.

Build B Roadway Improvement Recommendations
Since traffic operations are identical or very similar between Build A and Build B, the same
roadway improvements in Build A are recommended in Build B based on the Town of
Cary's CTP, Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO), and NCDOT engineering
guidance requirements with a few exceptions:


                                               vii
Trinity Road
For the section of Trinity Road within the project site, the CTP dictates a four-lane arterial
cross-section with two 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside travel lanes, a
landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides. Therefore, the following
improvements are required to meet the CTP standards:
       Widen the section of Trinity Road along both directions to achieve the ultimate
       cross-section as required by the CTP.

Trinity Road and Cary Towne Boulevard (future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that southbound Trinity Road will operate at failing levels of service
with the planned lane geometrics and stop control. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve traffic
operations and safety:
       Stripe the southbound approach of Trinity Road to consist of a continuous left-turn
       and a continuous right-turn lane;
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis after the project build-out, and install a three-
       phase traffic signal when warranted at this intersection.

Trinity Road and Access B/Access C (future unsignalized)
Build B assumes Accesses B and C as full movement access points at the planned location.
Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access C will operate at failing levels of service
in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and temporary
driveway configurations are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve
traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access B at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Construct Access C at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including an exclusive right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane
       with at least 100 feet of storage length;
       Widen the northbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through
       lane, an exclusive left-turn lane with at least of 100 feet of storage length, and an
       exclusive right-turn lane with at least 200 feet of storage length;
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through
       lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length.

Trinity Road and Collector Avenue/Access D (future unsignalized)
Access D is planned as a full movement access point across from the planned Collector
Avenue in all traffic scenarios. Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access D will
operate at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Nevertheless, traffic operations will deteriorate when Trinity Road is extended northward in
the future. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access D at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including a through lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least
       150 feet of storage length;


                                              viii
       Stripe the northbound approach of Trinity Road to consist of a continuous left-turn
       and a continuous right-turn lane.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2018) and Build B (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

Build C (2018) Conditions
The Build C (2018) conditions include traffic reassignment assuming restricted access at
Accesses B & C and a two-lane roadway for Trinity Road.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page xii, traffic operations are identical at the off-
site intersections between Build A and Build C. As a result, the failing off-site unsignalized
approaches in Build A remain operating at failing levels of service in Build C. As for the on-
site intersections, Access C is projected to improve to operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM and PM peak hours. Access D is projected to experience traffic volume
and delay increases, but still operate acceptably during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Build C Roadway Improvement Recommendations
Traffic operations are identical or very similar between Build A and Build C at off-site
intersections, Access A, Access E, and Access F. Therefore, the same roadway
improvements are recommended in Build C based on the Town of Cary's CTP, Adequate
Public Facility Ordinances (APFO), and NCDOT engineering guidance requirements with a
few exceptions along Trinity Road:

Trinity Road and Cary Towne Boulevard (future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that southbound Trinity Road will operate at failing levels of service
with the planned lane geometrics and stop control. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve traffic
operations and safety:
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an exclusive right-turn
       lane with at least 250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper;
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis after the project build-out, and install a three-
       phase traffic signal when warranted at this intersection.

Trinity Road and Access B/Access C (future unsignalized)
Build C assumes Accesses B and C as right-in/right-out access points at the planned location.
Traffic analyses indicate that both site accesses will operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following roadway improvements
and driveway configurations are recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access B at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Construct Access C at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Widen the northbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through

                                               ix
       lane, an exclusive left-turn lane with at least of 100 feet of storage length and an
       exclusive right-turn lane with at least 200 feet of storage length;
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through
       lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length.

Trinity Road and Collector Avenue/Access D (future unsignalized)
Access D is planned as a full movement access point across from the planned Collector
Avenue in all traffic scenarios. Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access D will
operate at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Nevertheless, traffic operations will deteriorate when Trinity Road is extended northward in
the future. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access D at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including a through lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least
       250 feet of storage length;
       Widen the northbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an exclusive left-turn
       lane with at least of 150 feet of storage length.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2018) and Build C (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

Build D (2018) Conditions
The Build D (2018) conditions include the same access plans and volume projections as
Build C. However, a four-lane roadway is now assumed for Trinity Road.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page xii, traffic operations are identical at the off-
site intersections and very similar at the on-site intersections between Build C and Build D.
As a result, the failing unsignalized approaches in Build C remain operating at failing levels
of service in Build D, while the non-failing signalized intersections and unsignalized
approaches remain operate at acceptable levels of service in Build D.

Build D Roadway Improvement Recommendations
Since traffic operations are identical or very similar between Build C and Build D, the same
roadway improvements are recommended in Build D based on the Town of Cary's CTP,
Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO), and NCDOT engineering guidance
requirements with a few exceptions:

Trinity Road
For the section of Trinity Road within the project site, the CTP dictates a four-lane arterial
cross-section with two 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside travel lanes, a
landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides. Therefore, the following
improvements are required to meet the CTP standards:
       Widen the section of Trinity Road along both directions to achieve the ultimate
       cross-section as required by the CTP.

operations and safety:
       Stripe the southbound approach of Trinity Road to consist of a continuous left-turn
       and a continuous right-turn lane;
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis after the project build-out, and install a three-
       phase traffic signal when warranted at this intersection.

Trinity Road and Access B/Access C (future unsignalized)
Build D assumes Accesses B and C as right-in/right-out access points at the planned
location. Traffic analyses indicate that both site accesses will operate at acceptable levels of
service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements and driveway configurations are recommended to meet the APFO
requirements and to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access B at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Construct Access C at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Widen the northbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through
       lane, an exclusive left-turn lane with at least of 100 feet of storage length, and an
       exclusive right-turn lane with at least 200 feet of storage length;
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through
       lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length.

Trinity Road and Collector Avenue/Access D (future unsignalized)
Access D is planned as a full movement access point across from the planned collector
avenue in all traffic scenarios. Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access D will
operate at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Nevertheless, traffic operations will deteriorate when Trinity Road is extended northward in
the future. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access D at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including a through lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least
       250 feet of storage length;
       Stripe the northbound approach of Trinity Road to consist of a continuous left-turn
       and a continuous right-turn lane.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2018) and Build D (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Lennar Carolinas, LLC proposes to construct a mixed-use development, Cary Towne
Boulevard Property, immediately north of Cary Towne Boulevard at Trinity Road in eastern
Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is expected to be completed by 2018. The
development consists of a mixture of residential and commercial uses as follows:
    200 Townhomes
    200 Single-Family Detached Homes
    200,000 Square Feet of Retail
The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" as defined in
the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

As shown on the Site Plan (Figure 2), access to the development will be provided via a total
of six access points along Cary Towne Boulevard, Trinity Road, and a future Collector
Avenue to be constructed on the project site:
       Access A: Cary Towne Boulevard ­ right-in/right-out (RIRO) access, approximately
       750 feet west of Trinity Road
       Access B & Access C: Trinity Road ­ temporary full movement, ultimate RIRO
       with left-in access, approximately 650 feet north of Cary Towne Boulevard
       Access D: Trinity Road ­ full movement access across from future Collector
       Avenue, approximately 1,150 feet north of Cary Towne Boulevard
       Access E: Collector Avenue ­ full movement access, approximately 600 feet
       north/west of Trinity Road
       Access F: Collector Avenue ­ full movement access, approximately 2,000 feet
       north/west of Trinity Road

The Town of Cary requires inclusion of intersections within one (1) mile of the proposed
development. The site is located in the Base Transportation Zone; however, several
intersections within the study area are located in the Central Transportation Zone. In total,
the following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and
were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       S.E. Maynard Road at Walnut Street (signalized)*
       S.E. Maynard Road at Cary Towne Boulevard (signalized)*
       S.E. Maynard Road at Village Greenway/East Cary M.S. (signalized) *
       N.E. Maynard Road at E. Chatham Street (signalized)*
       N.E. Maynard Road at Chapel Hill Road (signalized)*
       Cary Towne Boulevard at Walnut Street/Village Square Shopping Center
       (signalized)*

       Collector Avenue at Access E (unsignalized)
       Collector Avenue at Access F (unsignalized)
* Intersections located in the Central Transportation Zone

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This TAR summarizes trip generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and
traffic analyses for the proposed development.

   Traffic volume balancing was applied along Cary Towne Boulevard between SE Maynard
   Road and the I-40 Interchange. The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are
   shown in Figure 4.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

          A                Little or no delay           <= 10 sec.            <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay            10-20 sec.            10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay           20-35 sec.            15-25 sec.
          D                Long traffic delay            35-55 sec.            25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay          55-80 sec.            35-50 sec.
          F               Unacceptable delay             > 80 sec.             > 50 sec.

The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities Planning
and Development for Roads (APFO); however, several intersections within the study area
are located in the "Central Transportation Zone". Level of service in the "Base Benefit
Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable
for both signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For the "Central Benefit
Zone" intersections, the level of service standard is "F" for both signalized and unsignalized
intersections with a traffic analysis based upon a 90-minute average peak period and a
roadway volume-to-capacity ratio not to exceed 1.25. Should the existing level of service
fail to meet the requirements of the peak period level of service, there cannot be an increase
in average delay for the affected intersection (measured in its entirety). No increase in delay
time will be allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the
requirement.

In addition to each intersection's level of service, this analysis also looks at the volume-to-
capacity (v/c) ratio, which typically measure congestion at intersections where the level of
service is failing (i.e., LOS E or F). As defined by the Highway Capacity Manual 2010, "the
volume-to-capacity ratio is a special-case service measure. In the Federal Highway
Administration's (FHWA) Signalized Intersections: Informational Guide, the v/c ratio is broken
down into the following categories as listed in Table 3:

                                  Intersection is operating under capacity. Excessive delays

                                                     are not experienced.
                                  Intersection is operating near its capacity. Higher delays
          0.85 ­ 0.95               may be expected, but continuously increasing queues
                                                      should not occur.
                                 Unstable flow results in a wide range of delay. Intersection
           0.95 ­ 1.0              improvements will be required soon to avoid excessive
                                                            delays.
                                      The demand exceeds the available capacity of the
             > 1.0
                                 intersection. Excessive delays and queuing are anticipated.


2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing scenario analysis
utilized the existing signal plans and timings obtained from the Town of Cary, which are
included in Appendix F. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis
can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 4, all but one of the signalized intersections and stop-controlled
approaches included in the study area are currently operating at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM and PM peak hours. Specifically, the stop-controlled I-40 Eastbound
Off-Ramp at Cary Towne Boulevard is operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2018) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed minimal or negative
traffic growth between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. To provide a conservative analysis,
an annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to existing traffic at the Base Zone
intersections and one percent (1%) to the Central Zone intersections to account for ambient
traffic growth between the base year (2012) and the build year (2018). In addition, site traffic
from one proposed development, Village Square Redevelopment, in the vicinity of study
area was included in the analysis.

Village Square Redevelopment (12-TAR-342) ­ This proposed mixed-use redevelopment is
bounded by Walnut Street, Cary Towne Boulevard and SE Maynard Road. After
redevelopment, the proposed will consist of a 53,000-square foot grocery store, a 11,000-
square foot restaurant, 13,000 square feet of general retail uses, and 21,000 square feet of
office uses. The project build-out year was scheduled for 2014. A traffic analysis report (12-
TAR-342) was prepared by M/A/B and submitted to the Town of Cary in August 2012.
Based on TAR-342, the redevelopment is projected to generate 4,386 new daily vehicle trips
with 234 new AM peak hour trips (109 entering, 125 exiting) and 499 new PM peak hour
trips (305 entering, 194 exiting). Site trips from Village Square Redevelopment were
included as depicted in TAR-342 and applied at the remaining intersections in the study area.
Figure C-1 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Village Square
Redevelopment. There is no mitigation committed by this development at any study
intersections in this TAR.

3.2 BACKGROUND ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
One roadway improvement project, Trinity Road Extension, is planned in the study area.

Trinity Road Extension ­ The Town of Cary is proposing to extend Trinity Road from its
current terminus, approximately 1,300 feet north of Cary Towne Boulevard, to parking lot
"E" at WakeMed Soccer Park. The connection will improve traffic operations and access
during large events at WakeMed Soccer Park by providing a secondary access point to/from
I-40. Currently the project is in the design stage, and future funding will be necessary for
any right-of-way, easement acquisition, and construction cost. To date, there are no right-
of-way or construction funds appropriated to this project.

The Town of Cary CTP ultimately calls for widening and extending Trinity Road to a four-
lane, median divided roadway between Cary Towne Boulevard and Chapel Hill Road (NC
54). NCDOT and the Town of Cary have evaluated different options for widening and
extending Trinity Road; alignment alternatives included different ways to cross E. Chatham
Street and the railroad tracks beside it. Due to the uncertainty in funding and controversies
about at-grade crossing, the project was scaled back and resulted to build a 1,200 feet
segment south of the WakeMed Soccer Park and E. Chatham Street (known as DOT
Alternative 3). Right-of-way will be protected for future extension.

Due to the funding and timeline uncertainties in the Trinity Road Extension project at this
point, no improvements were assumed in the background analysis in this study.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The resulting Background (2018)
volumes are shown in Figure 5 and are used in the Background (2018) analyses. A summary
of the findings for the Background (2018) scenario LOS analyses can be found in Table 5
and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2018) analysis, the stop-controlled I-40 Eastbound Off-Ramp at
Cary Towne Boulevard is projected to continue operating at a failing level of service in the
PM peak hour with increased traffic delay. In addition, two stop-controlled approaches are
projected to decline to failing levels of service in the PM peak hour. Specifically, the I-40
Westbound Off-Ramp at Cary Towne Boulevard is projected to decline from LOS C to LOS
E in the PM peak hour, and the southbound Trinity Road at E. Chatham Street is projected
to degrade from LOS D to LOS F in the PM peak hour. The remaining signalized
intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to continue operating at acceptable
levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

land uses and pass-by trips for commercial uses were calculated based on standard ITE
procedures and NCDOT guidance.

In total, the proposed development is projected to generate 11,817 external daily trips with
478 trips occurring in the AM peak hour (201 entering, 277 exiting) and 1,053 trips occurring
in the PM peak hour trips (550 entering, 503 exiting).

Table 6 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours, respectively.

Due to the proximity of the closest proposed site access on Trinity Road to Cary Towne
Boulevard, separate access scenarios will be evaluated:
           o Full movement median opening at proposed Accesses B & C
                  Trinity Road as a two-lane roadway as Existing (Build A)
                  Trinity Road as a 4-lane median-divided roadway per CTP (Build B)
           o Accesses B & C limited to right-in, right-out with left-turn ingress provision
             only (restricted left turn egress)
                  Trinity Road as a two-lane roadway as Existing (Build A)
                  Trinity Road as a 4-lane median-divided roadway per CTP (Build B)

It should be noted that the Town of Cary is planning to extend Trinity Road from its current
terminus northward to connect to parking lot "E" at WakeMed Soccer Park. This
connection will provide indirect access to the proposed development from E. Chatham
Street. However, currently the WakeMed Soccer Park driveway on E. Chatham Street across
from Trinity Road is gated, and it is unknown if the future extension of Trinity Road will be
used for large events at WakeMed Soccer Park only. To provide a conservative analysis, this
indirect connection is not assumed in the current analysis.

Site trips from the development were distributed based on the access layout for each
scenario. The same traffic distributions were projected between Build A and Build B and
between Build C and Build D. The traffic assignment details for residential and commercial
site trips under each Build scenario are shown in Appendix D.

The peak hour total site trips assuming full access points at Accesses B & C are shown in
Figure 6, and the resulting Build A and B peak hour turning movement volumes are shown
in Figure 7. The peak hour total site trips assuming restricted access points at Accesses B &
C are shown in Figure 8, and the resulting Build C and D peak hour turning movement
volumes are shown in Figure 9.

4.3 BUILD A LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build A (2018) conditions account for Background (2018) traffic and site traffic
generated by the proposed development. Full movement accesses at Accesses B & C and a
two-lane roadway for Trinity Road are assumed under the Build A conditions. Figure 7
depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build A and B (2018) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. Table 8 summarizes the findings of
the LOS analysis for Build (2018) analyses and Appendix B contains the full Synchro/HCS
reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 8, the addition of site trips will incur delay increases at signalized
intersections and unsignalized approaches across the study area. As a result, both the I-40
Eastbound and Westbound Off-Ramps at Cary Towne Boulevard are projected to decline to
operate at LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour, while the
southbound Trinity Road at E. Chatham Street is projected to continue to operate at LOS F
in the PM peak hour with increased traffic delay. The remaining off-site signalized
intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to remain operating at acceptable
levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

As for the on-site intersections, the southbound Trinity Road at Cary Towne Boulevard is
projected to operate at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak hours under stop control.
The westbound Access C on Trinity Road is projected to operate at LOS F in the PM peak
hour. The remaining site accesses are projected to operate at LOS C or better during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

4.4 BUILD B LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build B (2018) conditions include the same access plans and volume projections as
Build A. However, a four-lane roadway is now assumed for Trinity Road. Table 8
summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis for Build B (2018) analyses and Appendix B
contains the full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 8, traffic operations are identical at the off-site intersections and very
similar at the on-site intersections between Build A and Build B. As a result, the failing
unsignalized approaches in Build A remain operating at failing levels of service in Build B,
while the non-failing signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches remain operate at
acceptable levels of service in Build B.


4.5 BUILD C LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build C (2018) conditions include traffic reassignment assuming restricted access at
Accesses B & C and a two-lane roadway for Trinity Road. Figure 9 depicts the turning
movement volumes used in the Build C and D (2018) scenario analysis. Table 8 summarizes
the findings of the LOS analysis for Build C (2018) analyses and Appendix B contains the
full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 8, traffic operations are identical at the off-site intersections between
Build A and Build C. As a result, the failing off-site unsignalized approaches in Build A
remain operating at failing levels of service in Build C. As for the on-site intersections,
Access C is projected to improve to operate at acceptable levels of service during both the
AM and PM peak hours. Access D is projected to experience traffic volume and delay
increases, but still operate acceptably during both the AM and PM peak hours.


4.6 BUILD D LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build D (2018) conditions include the same access plans and volume projections as
Build C. However, a four-lane roadway is now assumed for Trinity Road. Table 8
summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis for Build D (2018) analyses and Appendix B
contains the full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 8, traffic operations are identical at the off-site intersections and very
similar at the on-site intersections between Build C and Build D. As a result, the failing
unsignalized approaches in Build C remain operating at failing levels of service in Build D,
while the non-failing signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches remain operate at
acceptable levels of service in Build D.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
5.1 BUILD A ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have impact on traffic operations along the roadways and at the intersections within the
study area, causing traffic delay increases and failing levels of service at three off-site and two
on-site intersections. In addition, the Town of Cary requires new developments widen the
roads along the frontage of their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary
Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP). The following roadway improvements are
recommended based on the Town of Cary's CTP, Adequate Public Facility Ordinances
(APFO), and NCDOT engineering guidance requirements:
Frontage Widening along Cary Towne Boulevard
For the section of Cary Towne Boulevard in front of the development, the CTP dictates a
six-lane major arterial cross-section with four 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside
travel lanes, a landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 124 feet of
right-of-way. Therefore, the following improvements are required to meet the CTP
standards:
        Widen the section of both sides of Cary Towne Boulevard along the property
        frontage to achieve the ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP.

Trinity Road
For the section of Trinity Road within the project site, the CTP dictates a four-lane arterial
cross-section with two 12-foot inner travel lanes, two 14-foot outside travel lanes, a
landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides. As requested by the Town, a
two-lane roadway in its present condition is assumed on Trinity Road under Build A.
Despite the reduced cross-section assumption, right-of-way should be dedicated for this
section of roadway based on the ultimate cross-section requirements by the CTP.

Collector Avenue
The site plan proposes to build a collector avenue on the project site to be consistent with
the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan. Therefore, the following is
recommended to meet the CTP standards:
     Construct the section of roadway with a standard collector avenue cross-section
         between Trinity Road and the western property line.

Cary Towne Boulevard and I-40 Eastbound Ramps (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that after the project build-out, this intersection will operate at
failing levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours with the current lane
geometrics and traffic control. This intersection is also operating at failing LOS in the PM
peak hour under the Existing and Background conditions. Existing peak hour traffic
volumes warrant installation of a traffic signal at this intersection. Therefore, the following
roadway improvements are recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
        Conduct a full signal warrant analysis, and install a traffic signal when warranted at
        this intersection.

Cary Towne Boulevard and I-40 Westbound Ramps (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that after the project build-out, this intersection will operate at
failing levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours with the current lane
geometrics and traffic control. This intersection is operating at failing LOS in the PM peak
hour under Background conditions; however, existing peak hour traffic volumes at this
intersection do not warrant installation of a traffic signal at this time. Therefore, the
following roadway improvements are recommended to meet the Town APFO requirements:
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis after the project build-out, and install a traffic
       signal when warranted at this intersection.

Trinity Road and E. Chatham Street (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the southbound Trinity Road at E. Chatham Street will
operate at failing conditions in the PM peak hour. The following roadway improvements are
recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an exclusive right-turn
       lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and taper.

It should be noted that this improvement will require widening along the section of Trinity
Road across the CSX Railroad Crossing. The close spacing between E. Chatham Street and
CSX Railroad Crossing presents a constructability issue to this improvement. Alternatively,
a traffic signal is warranted based on peak hour traffic volumes, and installation of a traffic
signal would meet the Town APFO requirements if a traffic signal agreement can be reached
with NCDOT, the Town and CSX at this intersection.

In the long term, the Town of Cary CTP ultimately calls for widening and extending Trinity
Road to a four-lane, median divided roadway between Cary Towne Boulevard and Chapel
Hill Road. Different widening and extension alternatives have been investigated by
NCDOT and the Town of Cary; as a result, Trinity Road may be realigned to cross CSX
Railroad and E. Chatham Street at a different location. Nevertheless, the proposed turning
lane or signalization improvement should be considered as an interim solution at this
intersection at this time.

Trinity Road and Cary Towne Boulevard (future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that southbound Trinity Road will operate at failing levels of service
with the planned lane geometrics and stop control. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve traffic
operations and safety:
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide a continuous exclusive
       right-turn lane;
       Conduct a full signal warrant analysis after the project build-out, and install a three-
       phase traffic signal when warranted at this intersection.

Cary Towne Boulevard and Access A (future right-in/right-out)
The site plan proposes to construct Access A as a right-in/right-out access on Cary Towne
Boulevard. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations
are recommended to provide access and to improve traffic operations and safety:


                                              33
       Construct Access A at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Widen the westbound approach of Cary Towne Boulevard to provide an exclusive
       right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

Trinity Road and Access B/Access C (future unsignalized)
Build A assumes Accesses B and C as full movement access points at the planned location.
Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access C will operate at failing levels of service
in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and temporary
driveway configurations are recommended to meet the APFO requirements and to improve
traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access B at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane;
       Construct Access C at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including an exclusive right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane
       with at least 100 feet of storage length;
       Widen the northbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an exclusive left-turn
       lane with at least of 100 feet of storage length and an exclusive right-turn lane with at
       least 200 feet of storage length;
       Widen the southbound approach of Trinity Road to provide an additional through
       lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length.

The additional southbound through lane on Trinity Road should form a continuous travel
lane extending back to Collector Avenue/Access D, and terminate as a continuous right-turn
lane at Cary Towne Boulevard.

Trinity Road and Collector Avenue/Access D (future unsignalized)
Access D is planned as a full movement access point across from the planned Collector
Avenue in all traffic scenarios. Traffic analyses indicate that the westbound Access D will
operate at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.
Nevertheless, traffic operations will deteriorate if Trinity Road is extended northward in the
future. Therefore, the following roadway improvements and driveway configurations are
recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access D at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and two
       outbound lanes including a through lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least

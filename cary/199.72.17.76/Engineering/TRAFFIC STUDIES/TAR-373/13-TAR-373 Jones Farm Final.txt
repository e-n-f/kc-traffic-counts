EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
The Town of Cary has received a request from Ashton Woods Homes to provide a traffic
analysis report (13-TAR-373) for a single-family detached residential development (Jones
Farm Rezoning) located off of Arthur Pierce Road in southern Cary (Figure 1). The
proposed rezoning is projected to be completed by 2018 and consists of the following land
use:
         134 Single-Family Detached Dwelling Units

Note that this traffic study is prepared for a rezoning application that assumes the above
land use as the worst-case for trip generation purposes. A revised traffic study will be
required should any higher density land uses occur on the project site.

The site plan (Figure 2) proposes to construct a new full movement access along Arthur
Pierce Road:
     Access #1 ­ full access along Arthur Pierce Road, approximately 1,700 feet east of
     Kildaire Farm Road.

In addition, the development will construct connections to the existing stub outs of Rosiere
Drive, Chaumont Drive, and Belnap Drive. As a result, portions of project traffic may use
these existing streets to access Ten Ten Road and Arthur Pierce Road.

The Town of Cary is in the process of repealing the APFO (LDO Chapter 3.23) and
implementing a new transportation adequacy process. A TAR is not required by the APFO
since the proposed development is not projected to generate 50 or more trips greater than
the existing zoning. However, at the request of the applicant, the TAR is prepared to meet
the requirements for the new process since the rezoning is projected to generate a total of
100 or more peak hour trips.

Based on the Town of Cary LDO requirements, the following intersections meet the Town's
requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future
conditions, where applicable:
         Kildaire Farm Road and Ten Ten Road (signalized)
         Ten Ten Road and Chaumont Drive (unsignalized)
         Ten Ten Road and Megwood Court (unsignalized)
         Kildaire Farm Road and Arthur Pierce Road (unsignalized)
         Holly Springs Road and Arthur Pierce Road (unsignalized)
         Holly Springs Road and Pierce Olive Road (unsignalized)
         Arthur Pierce Road and Belnap Drive (unsignalized)
         Arthur Pierce Road and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)

Turning movement counts were also collected at the Ten Ten Road and Holly Springs Road
intersection. Since site trips due to the proposed rezoning are not projected to exceed seven
percent (7%) of the traffic volumes on any approach, traffic operational analysis is not

                                              i
required at this intersection based on the Town of Cary LDO.

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2013), Background (2018), Build
(2018), and a Build (2018) with Improvements scenario. The Existing (2013) scenario
includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in
January 2013. The Background (2018) scenario includes existing traffic with projected
annual growth. The Build (2018) scenario includes Background (2018) volumes with the
addition of site trips generated by the proposed rezoning. Additionally, future conditions
with the proposed mitigations in place were analyzed in a Build (2018) with Improvements
scenario.

Existing (2013) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. For the signalized Ten Ten Road and Kildaire Farm Road
intersection, traffic signal plans and timings were obtained from Town of Cary staff.

As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vi, one signalized intersection
and three stop-controlled approaches are currently operating at failing levels of service (LOS
E or F). Specifically, the signalized Ten Ten Road and Kildare Farm Road intersection is
operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour, the stop-controlled westbound approach of
Arthur Pierce Road at Kildaire Farm Road is operating at LOS F in the AM peak hour, the
stop-controlled eastbound approach of Arthur Pierce Road at Holly Springs Road is
operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour, and the stop-controlled westbound approach of
Pierce Olive Road at Holly Springs Road is operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour. The
remaining unsignalized approaches are operating at acceptable levels of service during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

Background (2018) Conditions
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. An annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2013) and the build year (2018).

Based on the Background (2018) analysis, all but one of the study intersections will operate
at failing levels of service during at least one of the peak hours. Among the already-failing
intersections, the Ten Ten Road and Kildare Farm Road intersection will decline to operate
at LOS E during both the AM and PM peak hours, westbound Arthur Pierce Road at
Kildaire Farm Road will decline to operate at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak
hours, westbound Pierce Olive Road at Holly Springs Road will decline to operate at LOS F
in the AM peak hour, and eastbound Arthur Pierce Road at Holly Springs Road is projected
to remain operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour with delay increases. In addition, the
northbound approach of Chaumont Drive at Ten Ten Road will degrade to operate at LOS
E during both the AM and PM peak hours, and the northbound approach of Megwood
Court at Ten Ten Road will operate at LOS F in the AM peak hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed Jones Farm Rezoning consists of 134 single-family detached dwelling units.
Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.

In total, the proposed rezoning is projected to generate 1,361 external daily trips with 104
trips occurring in the AM peak hour (26 entering, 78 exiting) and 137 trips occurring in the
PM peak hour (86 entering, 51 exiting).

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing and future traffic patterns
and surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build (2018) Conditions
The Build (2018) conditions account for Background (2018) traffic and site traffic generated
by the proposed rezoning.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page vi, the addition of site trips will incur delay
increases at intersections across the study area. As a result, all of the already-failing
intersections are projected to continue to operate at failing levels of service with increased
traffic delay, but the southbound Belnap Drive at Arthur Pierce Road will remain operating
at acceptable levels of service despite site trip addition and traffic delay increases. The
planned Access #1 at Arthur Pierce Road is projected to operate at LOS B during both the
AM and PM peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed rezoning is projected to have
impact on traffic operations at six intersections within the study area. The following
roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP), the Town of Cary transportation adequacy ordinance, and
NCDOT requirements:

Frontage Widening along Arthur Pierce Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). For the section of Arthur Pierce Road in front of the
development, the CTP dictates a three-lane minor thoroughfare cross-section with two travel
lanes, a center turn lane, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 70 feet of right-of-
way. Under Existing (2013) conditions, Arthur Pierce Road is a two-lane roadway without
sidewalks. Therefore, the following improvements are required to meet the CTP standards:
        Widen the section of Arthur Pierce Road along the property frontage to achieve the
        ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP.

Ten Ten Road and Kildaire Farm Road (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, this intersection will continue to
operate at LOS E during both peak hours with a delay increase of 1.4 seconds per vehicle in
the AM peak hour and 4.8 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the

                                                 iii
following improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements:
        Widen the eastbound Ten Ten Road approach to provide an exclusive right-turn lane
        with a minimum of 350 feet of storage length and appropriate taper. This
        improvement will also modify the existing shared through/right-turn lane to become
        a second through lane with a minimum of 350 feet of storage length.
        Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town including revised
        signal phasing and timing plans to accommodate the new lane geometrics.
The proposed mitigations are expected to improve this intersection to better-than-
background conditions, meeting the transportation adequacy ordinance requirements. In the
long term, constructing an exclusive right-turn lane on the westbound and southbound
approaches should be considered to improve this intersection to acceptable levels of service
(i.e., LOS D or better).

Arthur Pierce Road and Kildaire Farm Road (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and the addition of site trips will incur further delay increases
on the westbound Arthur Pierce Road approach. AM peak hour traffic volumes meet
warrants for a traffic signal at this location. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary transportation adequacy
ordinance requirements:
        Install a three-phase traffic signal at this intersection.
        Restripe the existing right-turn lane on the northbound Kildaire Farm Road
        approach to a shared through/right-turn lane.

Arthur Pierce Road and Holly Springs Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and traffic operations will deteriorate with the addition of site
trips on the eastbound Arthur Pierce Road approach. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements:
        Widen the eastbound Arthur Pierce Road approach to provide an exclusive left-turn
        lane with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

Pierce Olive Road and Holly Springs Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and traffic operations will deteriorate with the addition of site
trips on the westbound Pierce Olive Road approach.                   Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements and to improve traffic operations and
safety:
        Widen the northbound Holly Springs Road approach to provide an exclusive right-
        turn lane with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
        Widen the westbound Pierce Olive Road approach to extend the existing right-turn
        taper with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

                                               iv
The proposed turn lane improvements are expected to improve this intersection to better-
than-background conditions, meeting the transportation adequacy ordinance requirements.
In the long term, realigning Pierce Olive Road with Arthur Pierce Road to form a four-leg
intersection with signal control at Holly Springs Road should be considered to improve this
intersection to acceptable levels of service and to be consistent with the Town of Cary
Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

Chaumont Drive and Ten Ten Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and the addition of site trips will incur slight increases of
traffic delay on the northbound Chaumont Drive approach. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements:
        Restripe, or widen if necessary, the northbound Chaumont Drive approach to
        provide an exclusive left-turn lane with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and
        appropriate taper.

Megwood Court and Ten Ten Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions. However, site trips will only add to the northbound right-
turn and westbound left-turn movements which are projected to operate at better levels of
service. As a result, the average traffic delay on the northbound Megwood County approach
will decrease slightly with the addition of site trips. Therefore, no improvements are
required by the Town of Cary transportation adequacy ordinance.

Arthur Pierce Road and Access #1 (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Access #1 as a full movement access approximately
1,700 feet east of Kildaire Farm Road. The following driveway configuration and roadway
improvements are recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
        Construct Access #1 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
        outbound lane.
        Stripe the required widening along Arthur Pierce Road to provide an exclusive left-
        turn lane on the eastbound approach with a minimum of 100 feet of storage and
        appropriate taper.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2018) and Build (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Town of Cary has received a request from Ashton Woods Homes to provide a traffic
analysis report (13-TAR-373) for a single-family detached residential development (Jones
Farm Rezoning) located off of Arthur Pierce Road in southern Cary (Figure 1). The
proposed rezoning is projected to be completed by 2018 and consists of the following land
use:
         134 Single-Family Detached Dwelling Units

Note that this traffic study is prepared for a rezoning application that assumes the above
land use as the worst-case for trip generation purposes. A revised traffic study will be
required should any higher density land uses occur on the project site.

The site plan (Figure 2) proposes to construct a new full movement access along Arthur
Pierce Road:
     Access #1 ­ full access along Arthur Pierce Road, approximately 1,700 feet east of
     Kildaire Farm Road.

In addition, the development will construct connections to the existing stub outs of Rosiere
Drive, Chaumont Drive, and Belnap Drive. As a result, portions of project traffic may use
these existing streets to access Ten Ten Road and Arthur Pierce Road.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" as defined in
the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed rezoning on the adjacent roadways.

Based on the Town of Cary LDO requirements, the following intersections meet the Town's
requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future
conditions, where applicable:
         Kildaire Farm Road and Ten Ten Road (signalized)
         Ten Ten Road and Chaumont Drive (unsignalized)
         Ten Ten Road and Megwood Court (unsignalized)
         Kildaire Farm Road and Arthur Pierce Road (unsignalized)
         Holly Springs Road and Arthur Pierce Road (unsignalized)
         Holly Springs Road and Pierce Olive Road (unsignalized)
         Arthur Pierce Road and Belnap Drive (unsignalized)
         Arthur Pierce Road and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed rezoning and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This TAR summarizes trip generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and
traffic analyses for the proposed rezoning.

The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

The Town of Cary is in the process of repealing the APFO (LDO Chapter 3.23) and
implementing a new transportation adequacy process. Under the new process, any rezoning
generating over 100 peak hour trips needs to prove transportation adequacy. A traffic study
is needed to identify the inadequacies, and the applicant must provide mitigations as
conditions on the rezoning in a voluntary manner. The planned development is located

                                              10
within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary Land Use
Ordinance. Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the
average peak hour with LOS D considered adequate for both signalized intersections and
unsignalized approaches.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing scenario analysis
utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the Town of Cary, which are included in
Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be
found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, one signalized intersection and three stop-controlled approaches are
currently operating at failing levels of service (LOS E or F). Specifically, the signalized Ten
Ten Road and Kildare Farm Road intersection is operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour,
the stop-controlled westbound approach of Arthur Pierce Road at Kildaire Farm Road is
operating at LOS F in the AM peak hour, the stop-controlled eastbound approach of Arthur
Pierce Road at Holly Springs Road is operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour, and the stop-
controlled westbound approach of Pierce Olive Road at Holly Springs Road is operating at
LOS E in the AM peak hour. The remaining unsignalized approaches are operating at
acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2018) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed steady traffic growth
between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. An annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient traffic growth between the base year
(2013) and the build year (2018).

There are no approved background developments identified within the Town of Cary
jurisdictions in the study area. The Town of Holly Springs and Wake County were also
contacted; no approved background projects within the Town of Holly Springs or Wake
County jurisdictions were required to be included. In addition, there are no roadway
improvement projects known in the study area.


3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Background (2018) analysis scenario includes the Existing (2013) traffic with ambient
traffic growth. Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background
(2018) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. A summary of the findings for the
Background (2018) scenario LOS analyses can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS
output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2018) analysis, all but one of the study intersections will operate
at failing levels of service during at least one of the peak hours. Among the already-failing
intersections, the Ten Ten Road and Kildare Farm Road intersection will decline to operate
at LOS E during both the AM and PM peak hours, westbound Arthur Pierce Road at
Kildaire Farm Road will decline to operate at LOS F during both the AM and PM peak
hours, westbound Pierce Olive Road at Holly Springs Road will decline to operate at LOS F
in the AM peak hour, and eastbound Arthur Pierce Road at Holly Springs Road is projected
to remain operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour with delay increases. In addition, the
northbound approach of Chaumont Drive at Ten Ten Road will degrade to operate at LOS
E during both the AM and PM peak hours, and the northbound approach of Megwood
Court at Ten Ten Road will operate at LOS F in the AM peak hour.

4.0 BUILD (2018) ANALYSIS
The Town of Cary has received a request from Ashton Woods Homes to provide a traffic
analysis report (13-TAR-373) for a single-family detached residential development (Jones
Farm Rezoning) located off of Arthur Pierce Road in southern Cary (Figure 1). The
proposed development is projected to be completed by 2018.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The proposed Jones Farm Rezoning consists of 134 single-family detached dwelling units.
Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed rezoning for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours. In total, the proposed rezoning is projected to generate
1,361 external daily trips with 104 trips occurring in the AM peak hour (26 entering, 78
exiting) and 137 trips occurring in the PM peak hour (86 entering, 51 exiting).

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2018) analysis scenario includes the Background (2018) traffic, as well as site
generated trips from the proposed rezoning. Figure 8 depicts the turning movement
volumes used in the Build (2018) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. Table 8 summarizes the findings of
the LOS analysis for Build (2018) analyses and Appendix B contains the full Synchro/HCS
reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 7, the addition of site trips will incur delay increases at intersections
across the study area. As a result, all of the already-failing intersections are projected to
continue to operate at failing levels of service with increased traffic delay, but the
southbound Belnap Drive at Arthur Pierce Road will remain operating at acceptable levels of
service despite site trip addition and traffic delay increases. The planned Access #1 at
Arthur Pierce Road is projected to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak
hours.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed rezoning is projected to have
impact on traffic operations at six intersections within the study area. The following
roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP), the Town of Cary transportation adequacy ordinance, and
NCDOT requirements:

Frontage Widening along Arthur Pierce Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). For the section of Arthur Pierce Road in front of the
development, the CTP dictates a three-lane minor thoroughfare cross-section with two travel
lanes, a center turn lane, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 70 feet of right-of-
way. Under Existing (2013) conditions, Arthur Pierce Road is a two-lane roadway without
sidewalks. Therefore, the following improvements are required to meet the CTP standards:
        Widen the section of Arthur Pierce Road along the property frontage to achieve the
        ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP.

Ten Ten Road and Kildaire Farm Road (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, this intersection will continue to
operate at LOS E during both peak hours with a delay increase of 1.4 seconds per vehicle in
the AM peak hour and 4.8 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the
following improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements:
        Widen the eastbound Ten Ten Road approach to provide an exclusive right-turn lane
        with a minimum of 350 feet of storage length and appropriate taper. This
        improvement will also modify the existing shared through/right-turn lane to become
        a second through lane with a minimum of 350 feet of storage length.
        Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town including revised
        signal phasing and timing plans to accommodate the new lane geometrics.
The proposed mitigations are expected to improve this intersection to better-than-
background conditions, meeting the transportation adequacy ordinance requirements. In the
long term, constructing an exclusive right-turn lane on the westbound and southbound
approaches should be considered to improve this intersection to acceptable levels of service
(i.e., LOS D or better).

Arthur Pierce Road and Kildaire Farm Road (existing unsignalized, future signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and the addition of site trips will incur further delay increases
on the westbound Arthur Pierce Road approach. AM peak hour traffic volumes meet
warrants for a traffic signal at this location. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary transportation adequacy
ordinance requirements:
        Install a three-phase traffic signal at this intersection.
        Restripe the existing right-turn lane on the northbound Kildaire Farm Road

                                                24
        approach to a shared through/right-turn lane.

Arthur Pierce Road and Holly Springs Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and traffic operations will deteriorate with the addition of site
trips on the eastbound Arthur Pierce Road approach. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements:
        Widen the eastbound Arthur Pierce Road approach to provide an exclusive left-turn
        lane with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

Pierce Olive Road and Holly Springs Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and traffic operations will deteriorate with the addition of site
trips on the westbound Pierce Olive Road approach.                   Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements and to improve traffic operations and
safety:
        Widen the northbound Holly Springs Road approach to provide an exclusive right-
        turn lane with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
        Widen the westbound Pierce Olive Road approach to extend the existing right-turn
        taper with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.

The proposed turn lane improvements are expected to improve this intersection to better-
than-background conditions, meeting the transportation adequacy ordinance requirements.
In the long term, realigning Pierce Olive Road with Arthur Pierce Road to form a four-leg
intersection with signal control at Holly Springs Road should be considered to improve this
intersection to acceptable levels of service and to be consistent with the Town of Cary
Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

Chaumont Drive and Ten Ten Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions, and the addition of site trips will incur slight increases of
traffic delay on the northbound Chaumont Drive approach. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
transportation adequacy ordinance requirements:
        Restripe, or widen if necessary, the northbound Chaumont Drive approach to
        provide an exclusive left-turn lane with a minimum of 100 feet of storage length and
        appropriate taper.

Megwood Court and Ten Ten Road (unsignalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that this intersection will operate at failing levels of service in the
Background (2018) conditions. However, site trips will only add to the northbound right-
turn and westbound left-turn movements which are projected to operate at better levels of
service. As a result, the average traffic delay on the northbound Megwood County approach
will decrease slightly with the addition of site trips. Therefore, no improvements are

                                               25
required by the Town of Cary transportation adequacy ordinance.

Arthur Pierce Road and Access #1 (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Access #1 as a full movement access approximately
1,700 feet east of Kildaire Farm Road. The following driveway configuration and roadway
improvements are recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Access #1 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and one
       outbound lane.
       Stripe the required widening along Arthur Pierce Road to provide an exclusive left-
       turn lane on the eastbound approach with a minimum of 100 feet of storage and
       appropriate taper.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2018) and Build (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
under both the Background (2018) and Build (2018) conditions. Therefore, no further
improvements are recommended.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 8, and the resulting future lane
geometrics and traffic control for 2018 are depicted in Figure 9.

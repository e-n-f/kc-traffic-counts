EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
A mixed-use development is planned to be constructed in the southeast corner of the
Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road intersection in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2017. Note that the apartments are
scheduled for completion in 2015; however the applicant did not request a phased study and
therefore, only the 2017 year analysis was studied.

This development is part of a larger Activity Center Concept Plan (ACCP) currently being
planned, this portion consists of the following land uses:
   ·   Apartments ­ 286 units
   ·   Fast Food Restaurant ­ 4,500 square feet
   ·   General Retail ­ 6,000 square feet

The Town of Cary is in the process of repealing the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance
(APFO), as defined in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter
3.23, and implementing a new transportation adequacy process. Under the new process, any
rezoning generating over 100 peak hour trips needs to prove transportation adequacy. A
traffic study is needed to identify the inadequacies, and the applicant must provide
mitigations as conditions on the rezoning in a voluntary manner. The planned development
is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary's
Land Development Ordinance. Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an
analysis of the average peak hour, with LOS D considered adequate for both signalized
intersection and unsignalized approaches.

As per the site plan (Figure 2), vehicular access to the development is proposed via three (3)
accesses ­ two (2) along Morrisville Parkway and one (1) along Carpenter Upchurch Road,
as follows:
   ·   Access #1: restricted, right-in/right-out (RIRO) access along Morrisville Parkway,
       approximately 475 feet east of Carpenter Upchurch Road
   ·   Access #2: full movement, unsignalized access along Morrisville Parkway across
       from Carpenter Elementary School Driveway, approximately 950 feet east of
       Carpenter Upchurch Road
   ·   Access #3: full movement, unsignalized access along Carpenter Upchurch Road,
       approximately 750 feet south of Morrisville Parkway

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
   ·   NC 55 and Indian Wells Road/Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
   ·   NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
   ·   NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road (unsignalized)

   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive (signalized)
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Davis Drive (signalized)
   ·   Carpenter Upchurch Road and Louis Stephens Drive (unsignalized)*
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Access #1 (unsignalized, RIRO)
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Access #2/Carpenter Elementary School Driveway
       (unsignalized)
   ·   Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #3 (unsignalized)

Note that the Carpenter Upchurch Road and Louis Stephens Road intersection was included
in the analysis as it met the Town's "7% Rule" for inclusion in the study area.

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2013), Background (2017), Build
(2017), and Build (2017) with Improvements. The Existing (2017) scenario includes AM and
PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in March 2012,
November 2012, and February 2013. The Background (2017) scenario includes existing
traffic with eight (8) approved developments, some of which are in the Town review
process. The Build (2017) scenario includes Background (2017) volumes with the addition
of site trips generated by the proposed development. In addition, future conditions with
required mitigations in place were analyzed in a Build (2017) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2013) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.

As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vii, the majority of the
intersections within the study area are currently operating at acceptable levels of service
(LOS D, or better). However, the signalized NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
intersection is currently operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour.

As for transit operations, the development is not within walking distance of any transit
services. The closest options for transit are along NC 55 to the west (Triangle Transit Route
311) or High House Road to the south (C-Tran Route 4).

Background (2017) Conditions
There are eight (8) approved developments in the vicinity projected to be constructed prior
to, or around the same time as the build-out of the proposed development. Site traffic
associated with these approved developments was individually included in the Background
(2017) analysis; however, no off-site improvements associated with these developments were
included in the analysis, with one exception. An eastbound right-turn lane was added at the
NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection, as the Highcroft Reserve Phases 4 & 5
(Highcroft Village PDD Update/12-TAR-323) development has financially committed to
constructing this improvement.

Additionally, the fourth leg (Morrisville Parkway Extension) of the NC 55 and Morrisville
Parkway intersection was included in the Background (2017) analysis, as it is expected to be
at least partially open by 2017. Two of the approved developments, Highcroft Reserve

                                              ii
Phases 4 & 5 and Fryars Gate (Fryar Tract/12-TAR-331) are committed to constructing
portions of the Extension, however the construction timeline and funding is less known
beyond these two developments. Therefore, only the traffic associated with these two
developments were projected to utilize the Morrisville Parkway Extension.

Due to the amount of traffic added by the approved developments, no additional growth
rate was applied.

Based on the Background (2017) analysis, all of the intersections within the study area are
projected to experience significant increases in delay and level of service degradations.
Specifically, the signalized NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is projected
to degrade from LOS D to LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS E to LOS F in the PM
peak hour, while the signalized Davis Drive and Morrisville Parkway intersection is projected
to degrade from LOS D to LOS F in both the AM and PM peak hours.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The development is proposed to consist of the following uses:
   ·   Apartments ­ 286 units
   ·   Fast Food Restaurant ­ 4,500 square feet
   ·   General Retail ­ 6,000 square feet

Trip generation was conducted for each category based on the most appropriate
corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and
the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet. Internal
capture and pass-by trips were calculated based on standard ITE rates. To be conservative,
no transit reduction was applied.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 3,848 daily site trips, 354 AM
peak hour site trips (137 entering, 217 exiting), and 308 PM peak hour site trips (183
entering, 125 exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing
turning movement counts and land uses.

Build (2017) Conditions
The Build (2017) conditions account for both the Background (2017) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on
page vii, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase traffic delay at all study area
intersections.

The signalized intersections that were failing in the Background (2017) scenario are projected
to maintain the same failing levels of service, with increased delays. Additionally, the
signalized NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway intersection is projected to degrade from LOS D
to LOS E in the AM peak hour.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to


                                              iii
have an impact on several study area intersections. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's transportation
adequacy requirements:

Frontage Widening
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed development has frontage along both Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter
Upchurch Road. Morrisville Parkway is currently at its ultimate cross-section; however the
developer will be required to construct half of the ultimate cross-section for the portion of
Carpenter Upchurch Road that fronts the development. As shown in the Town of Cary
Comprehensive Transportation Plan Update ­ Roadway Widths (amended December 16,
2010), this section of Carpenter Upchurch Road is to be a 45-foot, 3-lane cross-section (70-
foot right-of-way), including a two-way center left-turn lane and wide outside travel lanes
along curbs and sidewalks on both sides. Thus, the following is required along Carpenter
Upchurch Road, along the frontage of the site:
    · Widen Carpenter Upchurch Road along the entire frontage of the proposed
        development to half (1/2) of the ultimate cross-section as defined in the Town's
        Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in the
AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this location to meet the Town of Cary's transportation adequacy
requirements:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along Carpenter Fire Station Road
       that provides at least 200 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared left/thru/right-turn lane to a shared left/thru lane.
    · Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town and NCDOT,
       including revised signal phasing and timing plans, to accommodate the new lane
       geometrics.

NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates this intersection is projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service during the AM and PM peak hours. It should be noted that this intersection was
analyzed as a 3-leg intersection, rather the 4-leg intersection that currently exists in the field,
due to the lack of calls the westbound approach (eastern leg) during peak hours. The green
time that this approach receives was applied to the mainline northbound and southbound
NC 55 to provide a more accurate representation of what actually happens in the field. The
analysis indicates that the northbound left-turn queues in the future are projected to spill out
of the existing storage length. Therefore, for safety reasons, the following improvement is
recommended:




                                                iv
    ·   Extend the northbound left-turn lane to provide for at least 500 feet of full storage
        with an appropriate taper. Extending the northbound left-turn lane to 365 feet was
        recommended in the Fryar Tract TAR and was attributed to the APFO. The
        recommendation to extend the northbound left-turn lane to 500 feet is based on
        safety concerns and would allow those vehicles making the left-turn to exit the
        northbound mainline traffic.

If the eastern leg of this intersection was ever connected to Carpenter Upchurch Road again,
the intersection would likely operate at a failing level of service and need further mitigations.

Morrisville Parkway and Davis Drive (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E during
both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this location to meet the Town of Cary's transportation adequacy
requirements:
    · Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides
         at least 100 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared thru/right-turn lane to an exclusive thru lane.
    · Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town, including revised
         signal phasing and timing plans, to accommodate the new lane geometrics.

NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E during
the AM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
location to meet the Town of Cary's transportation adequacy requirements:
    · Construct an additional southbound left-turn lane along NC 55, forming dual left-
        turn lanes, so that the two left-turn lanes have an average storage length of 300 feet
        with appropriate tapers.
    · Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town, including revised
        signal phasing and timing plans, to accommodate the new lane geometrics.

Morrisville Parkway and Access #1 (unsignalized, right-in/right-out)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled northbound Access #1 approach is
projected to operate acceptably during both peak hours based on the proposed configuration
(right-in/right-out) shown on the site plan. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the stop-controlled northbound Access #1 approach to provide one
         ingress lane (right-in) and one egress (right-only) lane.

Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Elementary School Driveway/Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that both the stop-controlled northbound Access #2 and
southbound Carpenter Elementary School Driveway approaches are projected to operate
acceptably during both peak hours based on the proposed configuration shown on the site
plan. Therefore, the following driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the stop-controlled northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one
         ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared


                                               v
       thru/right-turn lane that provides at least 75 feet of storage with an appropriate
       taper.
   ·   Construct an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane that provides at least 100 feet of
       storage and an appropriate taper.
   ·   Restripe the westbound u-turn lane and southbound right-turn lane to provide access
       to the proposed development.

Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled westbound Access #3 approach is
projected to operate acceptably during both peak hours based on the proposed configuration
shown on the site plan. Therefore, the following driveway configuration is recommended at
this location:
    · Construct the stop-controlled westbound Access #3 approach to provide one
        ingress lane and one egress lane.
    · In conjunction with the required frontage widening along Carpenter Upchurch Road,
        construct a southbound left-turn lane that provides at least 150 feet of storage with
        an appropriate taper, as per the site plan.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in the table on page vii, and the
resulting future lane configurations and traffic control for 2017 are shown in Figure ES on
page viii.

1.0    INTRODUCTION
       INTRODUCTION
A mixed-use development is planned to be constructed in the southeast corner of the
Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road intersection in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2017. Note that the apartments are
scheduled for completion in 2015; however the applicant did not request a phased study and
therefore, only the 2017 year analysis was studied.

This development is part of a larger Activity Center Concept Plan (ACCP) currently being
planned, this portion consists of the following land uses:
   ·   Apartments ­ 286 units
   ·   Fast Food Restaurant ­ 4,500 square feet
   ·   General Retail ­ 6,000 square feet

The Town of Cary is in the process of repealing the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance
(APFO), as defined in the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter
3.23, and implementing a new transportation adequacy process. Under the new process, any
rezoning generating over 100 peak hour trips needs to prove transportation adequacy. A
traffic study is needed to identify the inadequacies, and the applicant must provide
mitigations as conditions on the rezoning in a voluntary manner. The planned development
is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary's
Land Development Ordinance. Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an
analysis of the average peak hour, with LOS D considered adequate for both signalized
intersection and unsignalized approaches.

As per the site plan (Figure 2), vehicular access to the development is proposed via three (3)
accesses ­ two (2) along Morrisville Parkway and one (1) along Carpenter Upchurch Road,
as follows:
   ·   Access #1: restricted, right-in/right-out (RIRO) access along Morrisville Parkway,
       approximately 475 feet east of Carpenter Upchurch Road
   ·   Access #2: full movement, unsignalized access along Morrisville Parkway across
       from Carpenter Elementary School Driveway, approximately 950 feet east of
       Carpenter Upchurch Road
   ·   Access #3: full movement, unsignalized access along Carpenter Upchurch Road,
       approximately 750 feet south of Morrisville Parkway

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
   ·   NC 55 and Indian Wells Road/Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
   ·   NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
   ·   NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive (signalized)
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Davis Drive (signalized)

                                              1
   ·   Carpenter Upchurch Road and Louis Stephens Drive (unsignalized)*
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Access #1 (unsignalized, RIRO)
   ·   Morrisville Parkway and Access #2/Carpenter Elementary School Driveway
       (unsignalized)
   ·   Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #3 (unsignalized)

Note that the Carpenter Upchurch Road and Louis Stephens Road intersection was included
in the analysis as it met the Town's "7% Rule" for inclusion in the study area.

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

  The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4. Traffic volumes
  were adjusted along Morrisville Parkway and NC 55 to ensure proper balancing throughout
  the study area. Since part of the previous traffic counts along NC 55 were collected when
  NC 540 was partially completed, balancing with the NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
  intersection volumes was performed to account for possible traffic diversion due to the
  completion of NC 540 to the NC 55 Bypass in Holly Springs.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                     CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

          A               Little or no delay           <= 10 sec.            <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.             10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay         20-35 sec.             15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay           35-55 sec.             25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.             35-50 sec.
          F              Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.              > 50 sec.

The development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone." Level of
service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour (as
defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) with LOS D considered acceptable for
both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service less than LOS D, then
no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections, where the stop controlled approach is below an LOS D under background
conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans
from the Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for
the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output
can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, the majority of the intersections within the study area are currently
operating at acceptable levels of service (LOS D, or better). However, the signalized NC 55
and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is currently operating at LOS E in the PM peak
hour.

3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AN
                      AND
                        D DEVELOPMENT
There are eight (8) approved developments in the vicinity projected to be constructed prior
to, or around the same time as the build-out of the proposed development. Site traffic
associated with these approved developments was individually included in the Background
(2017) analysis, as described below. Due to the amount of traffic added by the approved
developments, no additional growth rate was applied.

Bradford Mixed-Use Development ­ (07-TAR-231A): Located in the northeast corner of the
Davis Drive and High House Road intersection (on the same site as this proposed
development, 13-TAR-367), the overall development is to consist of 200,000 square feet of
shopping center, 50,000 square feet of office development, and 450 condominium units and
be constructed by 2010. A traffic analysis report was prepared by SEPI Engineering Group,
Inc and submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2007. As detailed in the report, the
development is projected to generate 13,744 daily site trips, 518 AM peak hour site trips (269
entering, 249 exiting) and 1,330 PM peak hour site trips (636 entering, 694 exiting). Field
visits indicate that Phase 1 is being constructed and is expected to be completed by the build
year of the proposed development. Therefore 100% of the traffic in the Bradford Mixed-
Use Development was included in the Background (2017) analysis. Figure D-1 in Appendix
D depicts the assigned trips.

Searstone (07-TAR-236A) ­ Located in the southeast corner of the Davis Drive and High
House Road intersection, the development is to consist of a 135,000 square-foot shopping
center, 50,000 square feet of office development, 200 1-bedroom residential units, 409 age-
restricted apartment units, a 100-room hotel, and a 155-bed healthcare facility. The
development is scheduled for completions by 2013. A traffic analysis report was prepared
by SEPI Engineering Group, Inc and submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2007 As
detailed in the report, the development is projected to generate 12,232 daily site trips, 476
AM peak hour site trips (266 entering, 210 exiting) and 1,123 PM peak hour site trips (527
entering, 596 exiting. These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on
the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Field visits indicate that this development is
partially constructed and occupied, with the remaining development expected to be fully
constructed and occupied by the build year of the proposed development. Therefore 75%
of the traffic associated with the Searstone Development was included in the Background
(2017) analysis. Figure D-2 in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

Wake Memorial/Westvale Subdivision (10-TAR-320) ­ This residential development is being
proposed along Green Hope School Road west of NC 55. The development will include 62
residential homes. The project build-out year was scheduled for 2014. A traffic analysis
report (10-TAR-320) was prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to the
Town of Cary in November 2010. Based on TAR-320, the development is projected to
generate 670 daily vehicle trips with 53 AM peak hour trips (13 incoming and 40 outgoing)
and 68 PM peak hour trips (43 incoming and 25 outgoing). Site trips from Wake Memorial
were included as depicted in TAR-320 and applied at the remaining intersections in the study
area. Field visits indicate that some residential units have been partially constructed;
however they are not yet occupied. Therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with this

                                              15
development was included in the Background (2017) analysis. Figure D-3 in Appendix D
depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Wake Memorial development.

Alston Town Center (11-TAR-332A) ­ This mixed-use development is being proposed in the
southwest quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp interchange. The
development will include 355,905 square feet of retail space, 30,125 square feet of office
space, 37 townhomes, a 150-room hotel, a 5,255 square-foot bank, a 7,398 square-foot high
turnover (sit-down) restaurant, a 3,500 square-foot fast-food restaurant, a 16-fuel pump gas
station with convenience store, a 14,708 square-foot pharmacy and 590 apartments. The
project is scheduled for build-out in 2015. A Draft traffic analysis report (11-TAR-332A)
was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary on
October 10, 2012. Based on the study, the development is projected to generate 28,384 daily
vehicle trips with 1,298 AM peak hour trips (626 entering, 672 exiting) and 2,694 PM peak
hour trips (1,387 entering, 1,307 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Field visits indicate
that none of this development has been constructed; therefore, 100% of the traffic
associated with this development was included in the Background (2017) analysis. Figure D-
4 in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

Highcroft Village Phases 4 & 5 (11-TAR-323) ­ This residential development is being proposed
along Highcroft Drive between Green Hope School Road and future Morrisville Parkway
Extension west of NC 55. The development will include a total of 230 single family homes
and 62 townhomes. Phase 4 of Highcroft Village was expected to be completed by 2013,
and Phase 5 was expected to be completed by 2015. A traffic analysis report (11-TAR-323)
was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in
September 2011. Based on TAR-323, Phases 4 & 5 of the proposed Highcroft Village
development are projected to generate a total of 2,783 daily site trips, with 216 trips (52
entering, 164 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 278 site trips (177 entering, 101
exiting) occurring in PM peak hour. Site trips from Highcroft Village Phases 4 & 5 were
included as depicted in TAR-323 and applied at the remaining intersections in the study area.
Field visits indicate that some residential units have been constructed and occupied; however
the amount (approximately 7 units) is negligible. To be conservative 100% of the traffic
associated with this development was included in the Background (2017) analysis. Figure D-
5 in Appendix D depicts the projected peak hour trips due to the Highcroft Village
development. In addition to the volumes associated with the Highcroft Village
development, an eastbound right-turn lane at the NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
intersection was also included in the Background (2017) analysis, as this development has
already financially committed to this improvement.

Fryar Tract (12-TAR-331) ­ This mixed-use development is being proposed on the north side
of Green Hope School Road at Highcroft Drive. The development will include a total of
250 single-family homes, 125 townhomes, 7,500 square feet of office space, and 15,000
square feet of retail space. The project is scheduled for build-out in 2017. A traffic analysis
report (12-TAR-331) was prepared by Ramey Kemp & Associates, Inc and submitted to the
Town of Cary in November 2011. Based on the report, the proposed Fryar Tract
development is projected to generate 5,353 daily site trips, with 320 occurring in the AM
peak hour (109 entering, 211 exiting) and 583 occurring in the PM peak hour (303 entering,
280 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the

                                              16
assumed distribution patterns in the report. Field visits indicate that none of this
development has been constructed; therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with this
development was included in the Background (2017) analysis. Figure D-6 in Appendix D
depicts the assigned trips.

Parkside Town Commons (13-TAR-350A) ­ This mixed-use development is being proposed in
the northeast quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540 interchange. The development will
include 300 apartments, one (1) 140-room hotels, a 12-screen movie theater, a 16-lane
bowling alley, 501,000 square feet of retail space, 65,00 square feet of high turnover (sit-
down) restaurant space, and 31,000 square feet of fast food restaurant space. The project is
scheduled for build-out in 2016. A Draft traffic analysis report (13-TAR-350A) was
prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary on October
10, 2012. Based on the report, the proposed Parkside Town Commons development is
projected to generate 53,933 daily site trips, with 3,101 occurring in the AM peak hour (1,607
entering, 1,494 exiting) and 4,472 occurring in the PM peak hour (2,312 entering, 2,160
exiting). Field visits indicate that none of this development has been constructed; therefore
100% of the traffic associated with this development was included in the Background (2017)
analysis. Figure D-7 in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

Green Hope High School Expansion (13-TAR-365) ­ The expansion of Green Hope High
School, located on Carpenter Upchurch Road, is projected to be completed by 2013 and
consists of expanding the existing campus to accommodate 480 addition students. A Draft
traffic analysis report (13-TAR-365) was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and
submitted to the Town of Cary on December 19, 2012. Based on the report, the proposed
Green Hope High School Expansion will result in a net increase of 362 AM peak hour trips
(247 entering, 115 exiting), 187 school PM peak hour trips (21 entering, 166 exiting), and 75
PM peak hour trips (33 entering, 42 exiting). Field visits indicate that this expansion hasn't
been constructed; therefore 100% of the traffic associated with this development was
included in the Background (2017) analysis. Figure D-8 in Appendix D depicts the assigned
trips.

Additionally, the fourth leg (Morrisville Parkway Extension) of the NC 55 and Morrisville
Parkway intersection was included in the Background (2017) analysis, as it is expected to be
at least partially open by 2017. Two of the approved developments, Highcroft Reserve
Phases 4 & 5 and Fryars Gate (Fryar Tract/12-TAR-331) are committed to constructing
portions of the Extension, however the construction timeline and funding is less known
beyond these two developments. Therefore, only the traffic associated with these two
developments were projected to utilize the Morrisville Parkway Extension.

The total site trips from the approved developments included in the Background (2017)
analysis are included in Figure D-9 in Appendix D. The Background (2017) peak hour trips
are shown in Figure 5.

3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). As previously mentioned, the Background (2017) scenario includes an additional
eastbound right-turn lane at the NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station intersection that has been
financially committed to by Highcroft Reserve Phases 4 & 5 (Highcroft Village PDD
Update/12-TAR-323) and part of the Morrisville Parkway Extension that has been
committed to by Highcroft Reserve Phases 4 & 5 (Highcroft Village PDD Update/12-TAR-
323) and Fryars Gate (Fryar Tract/12-TAR-331). Signal cycle lengths and splits were
optimized within Synchro as part of the future year analysis. A summary of the findings for
the Background (2017) scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 4 and the full
Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2017) analysis, all of the intersections within the study area are
projected to experience significant increases in delay and level of service degradations.
Specifically, the signalized NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is projected
to degrade from LOS D to LOS E in the AM peak hour and LOS E to LOS F in the PM
peak hour, while the signalized Davis Drive and Morrisville Parkway intersection is projected
to degrade from LOS D to LOS F in both the AM and PM peak hours.

4.0    BUILD (2017)
              2017) ANALYSIS
A mixed-use development is planned to be constructed in the southeast corner of the
Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road intersection in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2017. Note that the apartments are
scheduled for completion in 2015; however the applicant did not request a phased study and
therefore, only the 2017 year analysis was studied.


4.1 TRIP GENERATION
This development is part of a larger Activity Center Concept Plan (ACCP) currently being
planned, this portion consists of the following land uses:
   ·   Apartments ­ 286 units
   ·   Fast Food Restaurant ­ 4,500 square feet
   ·   General Retail ­ 6,000 square feet

Trip generation was conducted for each category based on the most appropriate
corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and
the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet. Internal
capture and pass-by trips were calculated based on standard ITE rates.

Additionally, there is no transit route that directly serves the development; however there are
options for transit along NC 55 to the west (Triangle Transit Route 311) and along High
House Road to the south (C-Tran Route 4). While these facilities may be viable alternatives
to automobile travel, the potential utilization are deemed to be negligible, and therefore, no
multi-modal reductions were taken.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 3,848 daily site trips, 354 AM
peak hour site trips (137 entering, 217 exiting), and 308 PM peak hour site trips (183
entering, 125 exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing
turning movement counts and land uses.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation of the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and
the land uses in the vicinity of study area. Two separate distributions; one for the residential
portion and one for the commercial (retail and fast food restaurant) portion of the
development were developed, as follows:

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
The Build (2017) analysis scenario includes the Background (2017) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 11 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2017) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the build year
analysis. Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the
full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase traffic delay at all study
area intersections.

The signalized intersections that were failing in the Background (2017) scenario are projected
to maintain the same failing levels of service, with increased delays. Additionally, the
signalized NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway intersection is projected to degrade from LOS D
to LOS E in the AM peak hour.

5.0      FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
                      CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have an impact on several study area intersections. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's transportation
adequacy requirements:

Frontage Widening
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed development has frontage along both Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter
Upchurch Road. Morrisville Parkway is currently at its ultimate cross-section; however the
developer will be required to construct half of the ultimate cross-section for the portion of
Carpenter Upchurch Road that fronts the development. As shown in the Town of Cary
Comprehensive Transportation Plan Update ­ Roadway Widths (amended December 16,
2010), this section of Carpenter Upchurch Road is to be a 45-foot, 3-lane cross-section (70-
foot right-of-way), including a two-way center left-turn lane and wide outside travel lanes
along curbs and sidewalks on both sides. Thus, the following is required along Carpenter
Upchurch Road, along the frontage of the site:
    · Widen Carpenter Upchurch Road along the entire frontage of the proposed
        development to half (1/2) of the ultimate cross-section as defined in the Town's
        Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E in the
AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this location to meet the Town of Cary's transportation adequacy
requirements:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along Carpenter Fire Station Road
       that provides at least 200 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared left/thru/right-turn lane to a shared left/thru lane.
    · Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town and NCDOT,
       including revised signal phasing and timing plans, to accommodate the new lane
       geometrics.

NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates this intersection is projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service during the AM and PM peak hours. It should be noted that this intersection was
analyzed as a 3-leg intersection, rather the 4-leg intersection that currently exists in the field,
due to the lack of calls the westbound approach (eastern leg) during peak hours. The green
time that this approach receives was applied to the mainline northbound and southbound
NC 55 to provide a more accurate representation of what actually happens in the field. The
analysis indicates that the northbound left-turn queues in the future are projected to spill out
of the existing storage length. Therefore, for safety reasons, the following improvement is
recommended:
    ·   Extend the northbound left-turn lane to provide for at least 500 feet of full storage
        with an appropriate taper. Extending the northbound left-turn lane to 365 feet was
        recommended in the Fryar Tract TAR and was attributed to the APFO. The
        recommendation to extend the northbound left-turn lane to 500 feet is based on
        safety concerns and would allow those vehicles making the left-turn to exit the
        northbound mainline traffic.

If the eastern leg of this intersection was ever connected to Carpenter Upchurch Road again,
the intersection would likely operate at a failing level of service and need further mitigations.

Morrisville Parkway and Davis Drive (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E during
both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this location to meet the Town of Cary's transportation adequacy
requirements:
    · Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane along Davis Drive that provides
         at least 100 feet of full storage and an appropriate taper.
    · Restripe the existing shared thru/right-turn lane to an exclusive thru lane.
    · Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town, including revised
         signal phasing and timing plans, to accommodate the new lane geometrics.

NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at LOS E during
the AM peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
location to meet the Town of Cary's transportation adequacy requirements:
    · Construct an additional southbound left-turn lane along NC 55, forming dual left-
        turn lanes, so that the two left-turn lanes have an average storage length of 300 feet
        with appropriate tapers.
    · Develop a signal modification plan in coordination with the Town, including revised
        signal phasing and timing plans, to accommodate the new lane geometrics.

Morrisville Parkway and Access #1 (unsignalized, right-in/right-out)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled northbound Access #1 approach is
projected to operate acceptably during both peak hours based on the proposed configuration
(right-in/right-out) shown on the site plan. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the stop-controlled northbound Access #1 approach to provide one
         ingress lane (right-in) and one egress (right-only) lane.

Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Elementary School Driveway/Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that both the stop-controlled northbound Access #2 and
southbound Carpenter Elementary School Driveway approaches are projected to operate
acceptably during both peak hours based on the proposed configuration shown on the site
plan. Therefore, the following driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the stop-controlled northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one
         ingress lane and two egress lanes ­ an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared
       thru/right-turn lane that provides at least 75 feet of storage with an appropriate
       taper.
   ·   Construct an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane that provides at least 100 feet of
       storage and an appropriate taper.
   ·   Restripe the westbound u-turn lane and southbound right-turn lane to provide access
       to the proposed development.

Carpenter Upchurch Road and Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled westbound Access #3 approach is
projected to operate acceptably during both peak hours based on the proposed configuration
shown on the site plan. Therefore, the following driveway configuration is recommended at
this location:
    · Construct the stop-controlled westbound Access #3 approach to provide one
        ingress lane and one egress lane.
    · In conjunction with the required frontage widening along Carpenter Upchurch Road,
        construct a southbound left-turn lane that provides at least 150 feet of storage with
        an appropriate taper, as per the site plan.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configurations and traffic control for 2017 are shown in Figure 14.

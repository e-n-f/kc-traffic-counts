EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
Midland Atlantic Properties has plans to construct a mixed-use development in the southeastern
quadrant of the Walnut Street and Macedonia Road intersection (Figure 1). The proposed Tryon Village
East development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary Ordinance 05-009), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed.
The projected build-out is to occur by December 2009. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact
of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The proposed Tryon Village East development consists of two possible scenarios as listed below. (To
be conservative, the scenario that generates the most trips was used in the analysis.)
          Scenario A includes a drive-in bank with 4 drive-through windows, and a three-story, 82,080
           square foot (sf) building consisting of 27,360 square feet of retail space on the ground floor
           and 54,720 square feet of office space on the two upper floors.
           Scenario B includes a three-story 110,832 square foot building that would consist of 36,944
            square feet of retail space on the ground floor and 73,888 square feet of office space on the
            two upper floors.
Vehicular access to the development is proposed via one right-in/right-out (RIRO) driveway on Walnut
Street, one right-in (RI) driveway along Walnut Street and one full movement driveway along Macedonia
Road (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study
area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
      Walnut Street and Buck Jones Road (signalized)
      Walnut Street and US 1/64 Northbound Ramps (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Meeting Street (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Dillard Drive (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Crossroads Ford/Centrum Plaza (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Macedonia Road/Crossroads Manor Court (signalized)

                                                    i
Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2008), Background (2009), Build (2009), and
Build (2009) with Improvements. The Existing (2008) Scenario includes Saturday mid-day and weekday
P.M. peak hour analyses based on turning movement count data collected from July 2007 to March
2008. The Background (2009) Scenario includes existing traffic along with approved site traffic from
eleven (11) other approved developments within the study area. An annual growth rate was not applied
to existing volumes to account for background growth in the area due to the high volume of traffic that
will be added due to other approved developments in the area. The Build (2009) Scenario includes the
Background (2009) volumes with the addition of site trips generated by the proposed development. In
addition, future conditions with proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a Build
(2009) with Improvements Scenario.

Existing (2008) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection turning
movement counts. As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vi, all signalized
intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service, (i.e., LOS D or better), during both the
Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours. However, the stop-controlled eastbound and
westbound approaches at the Crossroads Boulevard and Jones Franklin Road intersection and the stop-
controlled westbound approach at the Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection are
operating at LOS F during both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours.

Background (2009) Conditions
In the Background (2009) scenario, no annual growth rate was applied to the existing traffic due to the
high volumes of traffic expected to be added to the network by other approved developments in the
area. There are eleven (11) developments in the study area expected to be partially or fully constructed
prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed development. These developments
include:

          Tryon Village Mixed Use (05-TAR-165)
          CVS and Bank at Tryon Road and Walnut Street (05-TAR-176)
          Crossroads Apartments (05-TAR-185)
          Crossroads Borders (07-TAR-227)
          Stephens Road Residential (07-TAR-229)
          Dillard Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-235)
          Swiftside Drive Office Building (07-TAR-244)
          Dillard Drive at Piney Plains Apartments (07-TAR-266)
          Walnut Street Mixed-Use (08-TAR-283)
          Hotels at Caitboo and Columbus (08-TAR-291)
          Tryon Village Subdivision (08-TAR-292)

The site traffic from these approved developments was therefore individually included in the
Background (2009) analysis. Any geometric improvements associated with these projects that overlap
the project study area were included in all future year analyses. Additionally, improvements associated
with the planned Town of Cary Walnut Street Widening project were included in all future year analyses.
The improvements included the widening of Walnut Street north of Dillard Drive.

Based on the Background (2009) analysis, one signalized intersection, Walnut Street and Meeting Street,
is projected to experience significant LOS degradation (i.e. from an acceptable LOS to an unacceptable
                                                   ii
LOS) and operate at LOS E in the Saturday mid-day peak hour. In addition, the westbound approach
on Jones Franklin Road at the unsignalized intersection at Macedonia Road is also expected to degrade
to LOS F in the weekday P.M. peak hour. By contrast, two intersections are projected to experience
improvements in LOS due to the planned improvements by other developments. Specifically, the Jones
Franklin Road and Holly Springs Road intersection is projected to improve to LOS B in both the
Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours after signalization. The newly signalized Jones Franklin
Road and Crossroads Boulevard intersection is projected to operate at LOS B in the Saturday mid-day
and weekday P.M. peak hours.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The Tryon Village East development is proposed to consist of two possible land use scenarios. Based
on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the
volumes generated by each scenario were found, as follows:

          Scenario A: 54,720 square feet of general office, 27,360 square feet of general retail, and
           drive-in bank with 4 drive-thru windows is projected to generate 4,705 trips on a typical
           Saturday with 649 of those occurring during the mid-day peak hour (338 entering, 311
           exiting). On a typical weekday, the development is projected to generate 5,100 trips with 586
           occurring in the P.M. peak hour (242 entering, 344 exiting).
          Scenario B: 73,888 square feet of general office, and 36,944 square feet of general retail is
           projected to generate 5,045 trips on a typical Saturday with 464 of those occurring during the
           mid-day peak hour (243 entering, 221 exiting). On a typical weekday, the development is
           projected to generate 4,364 trips with 470 occurring in the P.M. peak hour (176 entering, 294
           exiting).
The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and land uses in
the vicinity of study area. Reductions were applied to the total trips generated by the proposed
development in order to account for the internal capture of trips among land uses within the
development. The standard internal capture procedure outlined in the ITE Manual was used as a base
reference. Additionally, reductions were taken to account for "pass-by trips" made by vehicles passing
the development.

Build (2009) Conditions
The Build (2009) conditions account for both the background traffic and the site traffic generated by the
proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on page vi, the addition of site trips will
cause the Walnut Street and Meeting Street intersection to increase in delay at LOS E during the
Saturday mid-day peak hours. However, all other signalized intersections continue to operate at
acceptable levels of service during both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours.

The proposed right-in only Access #1 and right-in/right-out Access #2 along Walnut are projected to
operate at LOS A in both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours. The stop-controlled
Access #3 approach at Macedonia Road is projected to operate at LOS C both the Saturday mid-day
and weekday P.M. peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The analyses indicate that the addition of trips generated by the proposed development will cause some
traffic degradation on the roadway network within the study area. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended:
                                                    iii
Walnut Street
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of their property
to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan. The Plan dictates Walnut
Street to be a six-lane cross-section with median and sidewalks on both sides in front of the property.
The ultimate geometrics have already been constructed. Thus, no further widening to accommodate
through traffic is required on Walnut Street along the frontage of the proposed development.

Walnut Street and Meeting Street (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the addition of site traffic will cause the intersection to experience an
increase of delay by 1.8 seconds in the Saturday mid-day peak hour. As a result, the intersection
operation worsens and continues to operate at LOS E during the Saturday mid-day peak hours.
Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this intersection:
       Modify the southern leg of Walnut Street to incorporate a pedestrian refuge within the median.
       Install two-stage pedestrian signals along southern leg of Walnut Street and modify signal
        timings.

The intersection will improve to operate at LOS D in the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak
hour, with these improvements in place. The pedestrian refuge allows pedestrians to cross three or four
lanes of traffic instead of seven, thereby allowing for a shorter Eastbound phase in the signal operation.

Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road (unsignalized)
The analysis indicates that the stop-controlled westbound approach will operate at a LOS F during the
Build (2010) P.M. peak hour. This intersection has been identified in past reports as a location that is
projected to operate at failing levels in future years. The following roadway improvement is
recommended at this location:
       Relocate the stop controlled approach to the Macedonia Road approach; realign the intersection
        to allow free-flow condition along Joes Franklin Road in accordance with the Southeast Area
        Plan.
This improvement was also recommended in conjunction with the Swiftside Office Project, but it has
not yet been completed. With this improvement completed, the stop-controlled eastbound Macedonia
Roach approach will operate at a LOS C and LOS D during the Build (2010) Saturday Mid-day and
Weekday P.M. peak hours, respectively.

Walnut Street and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized, right-in only)
The traffic analysis indicates that the planned Site Access #1 will operate acceptably during both the
Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours. Nevertheless, the following driveway configuration
and geometric improvements are recommended at this intersection:
           Construct the planned Site Access #1 to provide one right-in only ingress lane, and provide
            appropriate channelization and traffic control to prevent left-turn and exiting movements.
           Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane on Walnut Street with at least 100 feet of
            storage and appropriate taper.
           Provide a minimum of 100 feet of internal protected stem before allowing crossover
            movements within the development.


                                                     iv
Walnut Street and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized, right-in/right-out)
The traffic analysis indicates that the planned Site Access #2 will operate acceptably during both the
Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours. Nevertheless, the following driveway configuration
and geometric improvements are recommended at this intersection:
          Construct the planned Site Access #2 to provide one right-in only ingress lane and one
           right-out only egress lane (right-in/right-out) and provide appropriate channelization and
           traffic control to prevent left-turn movements.
          Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane on Walnut Street with at least 100 feet of
           storage and appropriate taper.
          Provide a minimum of 100 feet of internal protected stem before allowing crossover
           movements within the development.

Macedonia Road and Site Access #3 (future unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the planned Site Access #3 will operate acceptably during both the
Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours. Nevertheless, the following driveway configuration
and geometric improvements are recommended at this intersection:
          Construct the planned Site Access #3 to provide one ingress lane and two egress lanes
           (exclusive right-turn lane and exclusive left-turn lane).
          Construct an exclusive westbound left-turn lane on Macedonia Road with at least 100 feet of
           storage and appropriate taper.
          Construct an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane on Macedonia Road with at least 100 feet
           of storage and appropriate taper.
          Provide a minimum of 100 feet of internal protected stem before allowing crossover
           movements within the development.

1.0    INTRODUCTION

Midland Atlantic Properties has plans to construct a mixed-use development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Walnut Street and Macedonia Road intersection (Figure 1).
The proposed Tryon Village East development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base
Transportation Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 05-009), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. The projected build-out is to occur
by December 2009. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed
development on the adjacent roadways.

The proposed Tryon Village East development consists of two possible scenarios as listed
below. (To be conservative, the scenario that generates the most trips was used in the
analysis.)
          Scenario A includes a drive-in bank with 4 drive-through windows, and a three-
           story, 82,080 square foot (sf) building consisting of 27,360 square feet of retail
           space on the ground floor and 54,720 square feet of office space on the two
           upper floors.
           Scenario B includes a three-story 110,832 square foot building that would consist
            of 36,944 square feet of retail space on the ground floor and 73,888 square feet
            of office space on the two upper floors.
Vehicular access to the development is proposed via one right-in/right-out (RIRO) driveway
on Walnut Street, one right-in (RI) driveway along Walnut Street and one full movement
driveway along Macedonia Road (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's
requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future
conditions, where applicable:
      Walnut Street and Buck Jones Road (signalized)
      Walnut Street and US 1/64 Northbound Ramps (signalized)

      Walnut Street and Access #1 (future unsignalized, RI)
      Walnut Street and Access #2 (future unsignalized, RIRO)
      Macedonia Road and Access #3 (future unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes the trip generation,
distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

          A               Little or no delay          <= 10 sec.             <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.             10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay         20-35 sec.             15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay           35-55 sec.             25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.             35-50 sec.
          F              Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.              > 50 sec.

The proposed Tryon Village East subdivision is located within the Town of Cary's "Base
Benefit Zone". Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the
average peak hour (as defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, ITE) with LOS
D considered acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled
approaches. For signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of
service worse than LOS D, then no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under
build conditions. For unsignalized intersections, where the stop-controlled approach is
below a level of service LOS D under background conditions, then no drop in level of
service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical Saturday mid-day and
weekday P.M. peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity
Software (HCS+). A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be
found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all signalized intersections are operating at acceptable levels of
service, (i.e., LOS D or better), during both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak
hours. However, the stop-controlled eastbound and westbound approaches at the
Crossroads Boulevard and Jones Franklin Road intersection and the stop-controlled
westbound approach at the Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection are
operating at LOS F during both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours.

3.0    BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
No general background growth rate was applied to the study area roadways or intersections
volume counts due to the high volumes of traffic expected to be added to the network by
other approved developments in the area. There are eleven (11) developments in the study
area expected to be partially or fully constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-
out of the proposed development. These developments include:

          Tryon Village Mixed Use (05-TAR-165)
          CVS and Bank at Tryon Road and Walnut Street (05-TAR-176)
          Crossroads Apartments (05-TAR-185)
          Crossroads Borders (07-TAR-227)
          Stephens Road Residential (07-TAR-229)
          Dillard Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-235)
          Swiftside Drive Office Building (07-TAR-244)
          Dillard Apartments (07-TAR-266)
          Walnut Street Mixed-Use (08-TAR-283)
          Hotels at Caitboo and Columbus (08-TAR-291)
          Tryon Village Subdivision (08-TAR-292)

Tryon and Walnut Development (05-TAR-165) - Also referred to as Tryon Village, this is a
mixed-use development currently under construction in the northwest quadrant of the
Tryon Road at Walnut Street/Holly Springs Road intersection. The original site plan for the
entire development shows two primary full movement access points: one on Walnut Street
opposite Macedonia Road and the other along Tryon Road opposite a church driveway.
Currently, there are also right-in/right-out access points along Tryon Road and Walnut
Street. The land use is expected to include 368 apartment units, 150 townhouse units,
169,000 square-feet (s.f.) of commercial/retail use, an 8,000 s.f. restaurant, a 4,500 s.f. bank
and 125,600 s.f. of office space. A Traffic Analysis Report (04-TAR-165) was prepared by
Stantec and submitted to the Town of Cary in 2004. Trip generation for the proposed
development indicates a total of 1,610 weekday P.M. peak hour trips  an estimated 964 of
which are new trips. 1,861 new trips will be generated during the Saturday peak hour, 1441
of which are new trips. Because the original build year has expired, a new TAR, 08-TAR-
292, was submitted to the town by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC, in February 2008 for the
development of Tract 3 of this development which accounts for townhome development.
The site trips expected to be generated by the TAR-292 townhomes were subtracted out of
these calculated trips by means of a reduction ratio. The remaining trips were assigned to
the study intersections based on the distribution used in the Stantec report. The report
distributed all of the development trips to the two signalized driveways to account for worst
case conditions. A portion of this traffic may actually access the surrounding roadway
network via Tryon Manor Drive, interconnected driveways (i.e., connection to BJ's Shopping
Center), partial access driveways to the development, or the new public road. There are
some mitigation recommendations associated with the Tryon and Walnut Development that
overlap study intersections in this TAR which have not yet been completed. A westbound
left-turn lane along Dillard Drive at Jones Franklin Road was recommended to mitigate

                                              19
impacts of the Tryon Village Development. Figure C-1 in Appendix C depicts the assigned
trips.
CVS and Bank at Tryon Road and Walnut Street (05-TAR-176)  This development, located in
the southeastern corner of the Walnut Street and Holly Springs Road at Tryon Road
intersection, has been recently completed. A Traffic Analysis Report (05-TAR-176) was
prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC and submitted in June 2005. This development
consists of 11,970 s.f. of CVS/pharmacy drugstore with a drive-through window and a 3,500
s.f. bank with three drive-through windows. The TAR for this project estimates 2,289
additional daily weekday trips will be added to the existing network due to the development.
During the P.M. peak hour, 134 new trips will be generated (66 entering and 68 exiting).
Currently, the CVS is built and open, and the bank has recently opened. To maintain a
conservative approach, the trips generated by the CVS were removed from the total
generated trips; however, the trips generated by the bank were added to the network, as the
majority of the counts used in this project were taken prior to the opening of this bank.
After this reduction, the generated trips were estimated at 1,234 daily weekday trips, 82 of
which will occur during the P.M. peak hour (44 entering and 38 exiting). There was no
Saturday peak hour analysis performed in the TAR for this project, so a trip generation for
the Saturday mid-day peak hour was completed. The trips generated during this time period
are found in Table 4.

These trips were distributed based on the same distribution patterns as used for the weekday
P.M. peak hour. The TAR for this development recommended a signal be installed at the
Jones Franklin Road and Holly Springs Road intersection. Therefore, a two-phased
coordinated signal was assumed at this location in all future analyses. Figure C-2 in
Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

Crossroads Apartments (05-TAR-185)  This development, which will be located in the
northwest quadrant of the Jones Franklin Road and Crossroads Boulevard intersection, was
originally planned to be completed in 2006 and is to consist of 350 apartments and 30,000
s.f. of office space. As such, a Traffic Analysis Report (05-TAR-185) was completed by
HNTB in 2005. Trip generation for this development indicates 2,682 new weekday trips,
262 of which occur in the P.M. peak hour (148 entering, 114 exiting). A typical Saturday will
yield 2,562 new daily trips, 558 of which occur during the peak hour (301 entering, 257
exiting). These trips were distributed in the same manner as assumed in the HNTB report.
There are no mitigation recommendations associated with this development that overlap
study intersections in this TAR. Figure C-3 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

  Borders Book Store (07-TAR-227)  This retail establishment will be a redevelopment of
  existing stores in the Crossroads Shopping Center. This project was originally slated for
  completion in 2008. According to a traffic analysis report (06-TAR-227) performed by
  HNTB in 2006, this redevelopment will produce 392 new trips in the weekday P.M. peak
  hour (204 entering, 188 exiting). During the Saturday mid-day peak hour, 427 new trips are
  expected (226 entering, 201 exiting). These trips were distributed in the same manner as
  assumed in the HNTB report. There are no mitigation recommendations associated with
  this development that overlap study intersections in this TAR. Figure C-4 in Appendix C
  depicts the assigned trips.

  Stephens Road Residential Development (07-TAR-229)  This subdivision, planned by Buxbaum
  Real Estate Company, LLC, is located on the south side of Stephens Road, west of Piney
  Plains Road. The project will consist of 48 single family dwelling units and is planned for
  completion in 2008. Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC prepared a Traffic Analysis Report (07-
  TAR-229) for this development which was submitted in February 2008. Trip generation for
  this project indicates an additional 529 daily trips will be added to the network on a typical
  weekday, 55 of which will occur in the P.M. peak hour (35 entering, 20 exiting). There was
  no Saturday peak hour analysis required for this report, so a trip generation for the Saturday
  mid-day peak hour was completed. The trips generated during this time period are found in
  Table 5.

  These trips were distributed based on the same distribution patterns as used for the weekday
  P.M. peak hour. There were no off-site roadway improvements associated with this
  development that overlap the study area for this TAR. Figure C-5 in Appendix C depicts the
  assigned trips.

  Dillard Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-235)  This office development is to be located adjacent
  to the Holiday Inn in the northeast quadrant of the Dillard Drive and Columbus Street
  intersection and will consist of 24,000 s.f. of general office space. It is planned for
  completion in 2008. According to the Traffic Analysis Report (07-TAR-235) completed by
  Wilbur Smith Associates in 2007, the development will generate 445 weekday trips with 106
  occurring during the P.M. peak hour. Eleven (11) trips are expected to enter or exit the
  development during the Saturday mid-day peak hour. The site trips were distributed to the
  roadway network in accordance with the distribution used in 07-TAR-235. There are no
  mitigation recommendations associated with this development that overlap study
  intersections in this TAR. Figure C-6 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

Swift Side Office Condominiums (07-TAR-244)  This commercial development is to be located
near the intersection of Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road. The development, consisting
of approximately 31,500 s.f. of general office space, is planned for completion by 2008.
According to the Traffic Analysis Report (07-TAR-244) prepared by HNTB for this
development, 348 new trips will be added to the roadways on a typical weekday, with 47 of
these occurring during the P.M. peak hour (8 entering, 39 exiting). There was no Saturday
peak hour analysis required for this report, so a trip generation for the Saturday mid-day
peak hour was completed. The trips generated during this time period are found in Table 6.

These trips, along with the weekday P.M. peak hour site trips were distributed to the study
area network in accordance with the distribution used in the HNTB report. This report
recommends the realignment of Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia Road to allow Jones
Franklin to be the major through movement. However, this realignment was not completed
as part of this development and therefore this improvement was not included in the future
year scenarios. Figure C-7 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

Dillard Drive at Piney Plains Apartments (07-TAR-266)  This 340-unit apartment complex is to
be located in the southwest quadrant of the Dillard Drive and Piney Plains Road
intersection. It is planned for completion in 2009. According to the Traffic Analysis Report
(07-TAR-266) prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC this development will generate
2,413 trips on a typical Saturday, with 159 of those occurring during the mid-day peak hour
(71 entering, 88 exiting). On a typical weekday, the apartments will generate 2,194 daily trips
with 205 occurring during the P.M. peak hour (133 entering, 72 exiting). These trips were
distributed to the study area network in accordance with the distribution used in 07-TAR-
266. It was recommended in that TAR that a southbound right-turn lane with 100 feet of
storage be constructed at the Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road intersection. This
improvement is not yet constructed but was included in all future year analyses. Figure C-8
in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

Walnut Street Mixed-Use Development (08-TAR-283)  This development is to be located in the
southeastern quadrant of the Walnut Street and US 1/64 Ramps/Donaldson Drive
intersection and is scheduled for completion in 2009. There are three possible land use
scenarios for this development. To remain conservative, trips generated by Scenario A were
included in the background analysis for this project as that Scenario generates the highest
volume of traffic of the three scenarios. In Scenario A, the development is to consist of a
6,000 square foot restaurant, a 7,800 square foot retail building, 27,600 square feet of office
space and two hotels totaling 240 rooms (110 and 130 each). The existing Hardee's building
and a 125-room Days Inn motel will be demolished. According to the Traffic Analysis

Report prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC (08-TAR-283), this development will
generate 5,992 net new trips on a typical Saturday, with 512 of those occurring during the
mid-day peak hour (271 entering, 241 exiting) and 5,995 net new trips on a typical weekday,
with 511 occurring during the P.M. peak hour (224 entering, 287 exiting). These trips were
distributed to the study area network in accordance with the distribution used in 08-TAR-
283. There are mitigation recommendations required at Meeting Street and Walnut Street,
but have not been approved, and therefore are not included in this TAR. Figure C-9 in
Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

Hotels at Caitboo and Columbus (08-TAR-291)  This development is located in the
southeastern quadrant of the Caitboo Avenue and Columbus Avenue intersection. The
development consists of a 125-room hotel and a 120-room hotel with projected build-out by
2009.      According to the Traffic Analysis Report (08-TAR-291) prepared by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC this development will generate 2,007 trips on a typical
Saturday with 176 of those occurring during the mid-day peak hour (99 entering, 77 exiting).
On a typical weekday, the development is projected to generate 2,002 trips with 145
occurring in the P.M. peak hour (77 entering, 68 exiting). These trips were distributed to the
study area network in accordance with the distribution used in 08-TAR-2912. There are
mitigation recommendations required at Meeting Street and Walnut Street, but have not
been approved, and therefore are not included in this TAR. Figure C-10 in Appendix C
depicts the assigned trips.

Tryon Village Subdivision (08-TAR-292)  This residential development is part of Tract 3 of the
Tryon Village Mixed-Use Development, which is located in the northwestern quadrant of
the Walnut Street and Tryon Road intersection. The proposed project is to consist of 105
townhomes and is scheduled for completion in 2010. According to the Traffic Analysis
Report (08-TAR-292) prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC this development will
generate 612 trips on a typical Saturday with 60 of those occurring during the mid-day peak
hour (26 entering, 34 exiting). On a typical weekday, the development is projected to
generate 669 trips with 63 occurring in the P.M. peak hour (42 entering, 21 exiting). These
trips were distributed to the study area network in accordance with the distribution used in
08-TAR-292. There are mitigation recommendations required at Walnut Street and
Macedonia Road/ Crossroads Manor Court, but have not been approved, and therefore are
not included in this TAR. Figure C-11 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

The projects previously discussed are in varying stages of construction and occupancy. In
order to account for these variances, completion ratios were applied to the distributed site
trips based on current completion and expected completion by the build year for the Tryon
east Village (2009). The figures in Appendix C illustrate the full build site trips for each
development, while Figure 5 illustrates the site trips with ratios accounting for current and
projected completion percentages as shown in the following matrix.

In addition, a signal is partially constructed at the Crossroads Boulevard and Jones Franklin
Road intersection; however, the signal is was not operational at the time of the data
collection, and therefore is not included in the Existing scenario, but it is included in all
future year scenarios.

and the resulting turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 6.


3.2 FUTURE STUDY AREA IMPROVEMENTS
Improvements associated with the planned Town of Cary Walnut Street Widening project
were included in all future year analyses. These improvements are as follows:

Town of Cary Walnut Street Widening  The Town of Cary plans to add a northbound through-
lane from Dillard Drive to the US 1/64 interchange. With the completion of this widening
and the recently completed interchange enhancements, Walnut Street will become a six-lane,
median-divided road from Tryon Road to Donaldson Drive. The construction was
tentatively set to begin in Spring 2008 and end in Fall 2008. As a result of this widening, the
northbound continuous right-turn lane at the Walnut Street and Dillard Drive intersection
will become a shared through/right-turn lane. This additional capacity along Walnut Street
was assumed in all future year analyses.

SE Area Plan, Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan - First adopted in 1998, the SE Area Plan
is designed to direct land uses and transportation in the area south of US 1/64, north of SE
Cary Parkway and west of Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road. The project is to
reexamine the town's land use vision for the area in light of its growth and the
accompanying traffic impacts and to evaluate whether or not there are better alternatives for
the development or redevelopment of the remainder of this area. As shown in Appendix D,
the SE Area Plan recommends the realignment of Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia Road
to allow Jones Franklin Road to be the major through movement, resulting in a stop-
controlled Macedonia Road approach. This realignment is accounted for in all future year
scenarios. Additionally, the Plan shows Jones Franklin Road as ultimately being a 4-lane
facility; however, because of the short project timeline, this improvement was not
incorporated into the future year scenarios.



                                                         24
The City of Raleigh is currently widening Tryon Road to a multi-lane facility from Campbell
Road to Dillard Drive. As part of the project additional turn lanes will be added at the Yates
Mill Pond Road intersection. This project is ongoing and therefore will not be included in
the Existing scenario, but is expected to be complete by build-out of this project and was
included on all future scenarios.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday Saturday mid-
day and weekday P.M. peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway
Capacity Software (HCS+). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as
part of the future year analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2009)
scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 8 below and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2009) analysis, one signalized intersection, Walnut Street and
Meeting Street, is projected to experience significant LOS degradation (i.e. from an
acceptable LOS to an unacceptable LOS) and operate at LOS E in the Saturday mid-day
peak hour. By contrast, two intersections are projected to experience improvements in LOS
due to the planned improvements by other developments. Specifically, the Jones Franklin
Road and Holly Springs Road intersection is projected to improve to LOS B in both the
Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours after signalization. The newly signalized
Jones Franklin Road and Crossroads Boulevard intersection is projected to operate at LOS B
and LOS C in the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours, respectively. Table 8
summarizes the LOS results for the Background (2009) analysis.

4.0    BUILD ANALYSIS
Midland Atlantic Properties has plans to construct a mixed-use development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Walnut Street and Macedonia Road intersection (Figure 1).
The proposed Tryon Village East development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base
Transportation Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 05-009), requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. The projected build-out is to occur
by December 2009. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed
development on the adjacent roadways.

The proposed Tryon Village East development consists of two possible scenarios as listed
below. (To be conservative, the scenario that generates the most trips was used in the
analysis.)
          Scenario A includes a drive-in bank with 4 drive-through windows, and a three-
           story, 82,080 square foot (sf) building consisting of 27,360 square feet of retail
           space on the ground floor and 54,720 square feet of office space on the two
           upper floors.
          Scenario B includes a three-story 110,832 square foot building that would consist
           of 36,944 square feet of retail space on the ground floor and 73,888 square feet
           of office space on the two upper floors.
Vehicular access to the development is proposed via one right-in/right-out (RIRO) driveway
on Walnut Street, one right-in (RI) driveway along Walnut Street and one full movement
driveway along Macedonia Road (Figure 2).

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Trip generation for the proposed Tryon Village East was based on the corresponding trip
generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition. The Tryon Village East
development is proposed to consist of two possible land use scenarios. The volumes
generated by each scenario were found, as follows: (To be conservative, the scenario that
generates the most trips was used for this analysis, therefore Scenario A was utilized.) Table
9 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the development during typical Saturday mid-
day and weekday P.M. peak hours.

          Scenario A: Projected to generate 4,705 trips on a typical Saturday with 649 of
           those occurring during the mid-day peak hour (338 entering, 311 exiting). On a
           typical weekday, the development is projected to generate 5,100 trips with 586
           occurring in the P.M. peak hour (242 entering, 344 exiting).
          Scenario B: Projected to generate 5,045 trips on a typical Saturday with 464 of
           those occurring during the mid-day peak hour (243 entering, 221 exiting). On a
           typical weekday, the development is projected to generate 4,364 trips with 470
           occurring in the P.M. peak hour (176 entering, 294 exiting).

As shown in Table 9, reductions were applied to the total trips generated by the proposed
development to account for the internal capture of trips among land uses within the
development. The standard internal capture procedure outlined in the ITE Manual was used
as a base reference. Additionally, reductions were applied in order to account for "pass-by
trips" made by vehicles passing the development.

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
The site trips for the proposed Tryon Village East were distributed based on existing traffic
patterns and future land use patterns, generally as follows:
       20% along Walnut Street to the northwest
       5% along Buck Jones Road to the northeast
       15% along US 1 Northbound to the north
       3% along Dillard Drive to the west
       5% along Jones Franklin Road to the north
       5% along Dillard Drive to the east
       2% along Piney Plains Road to the north
       10% along Tryon Road to the west
       10% along Tryon Road to the east
       5% along Yates Mill Pond Road to the south
       5% along SE Cary Parkway to the west
       15% along Holly Springs Road to the south

Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the non pass-by trip distribution percentages and resulting site trips,
respectively. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the pass-by trip distribution percentages and
resulting site trips, respectively. Figure 11 shows the total Saturday mid-day and weekday
P.M. peak hour generated site trips.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2009) analysis scenario includes the background traffic as described in Section 3.0
of this report as well as site generated trips from the proposed development as described
previously. Figure 12 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2009)
scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical Saturday mid-day and
weekday P.M. peak hour using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity
Software (HCS+). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the
future year analysis. Table 10 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B
contains the full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 10, the addition of site trips will cause the Walnut Street and Meeting
Street intersection to increase in delay at LOS E during the Saturday mid-day peak hours.
However, all other signalized intersections continue to operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours.



                                               32
The proposed right-in only Access #1 and right-in/right-out Access #2 along Walnut are
projected to operate at LOS A in both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours.
The stop-controlled Access #3 approach on Macedonia Street is projected to operate at
LOS C both the Saturday mid-day and weekday P.M. peak hours.

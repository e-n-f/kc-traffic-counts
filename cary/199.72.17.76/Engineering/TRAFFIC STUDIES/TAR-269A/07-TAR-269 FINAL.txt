EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
There are plans to construct a development on the eastern and western sides of the southern
portion of Wellesley Trade Lane (Figure 1). The proposed development is located with the
Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary's Ordinance
05-009), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. The
development is proposed to consist of 4,000 square feet of bank space, a 4,000-square foot
restaurant, and 45,200 square feet of office space. The project build-out year is scheduled
for 2009. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed development on
the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via three access points along
Wellesley Trade Lane ­ two to serve the eastern development and one to serve the western
development (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for
inclusion in the study are and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where
applicable:
    · NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
    · NC 55 and Wellesley Trade Lane (unsignalized)
    · NC 55 and High House Road/Green Level West Road (signalized)
    · NC 55 and Parkscene Lane/Shopping Center Driveway (signalized)
    · Green Level West Road and Wellesley Trade Lane/Shopping Center Driveway
        (signalized)
    · High House Road and Jenks-Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
    · High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road (signalized)
    · Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #1 (future unsignalized)
    · Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #2 (future unsignalized)
    · Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #3 (future unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2007), Background (2009), Build
(2009) and Build (2009) with Improvements. The Existing (2007) scenario includes A.M.
and P.M. peak hour analyses based on turning movement count data collected in September
2007. The Background (2009) scenario includes existing traffic as well as traffic from twelve
(12) approved developments within the study area. The Build (2009) scenario includes the
Background (2009) volumes with the addition of site trips generated by the proposed
development. In addition, future conditions with roadway improvements were analyzed in a
Build (2009) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2007) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page
v, all of the signalized study area intersections are currently operating at acceptable
conditions (LOS D or better) during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. However, the
unsignalized northbound Jenks Carpenter Road approach at High House Road is currently
operating at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. Also, eastbound Wellesley Trade Lane approach


                                              i
at NC 55 is currently operating at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour, while the westbound
Starbucks Driveway approach at NC 55 is currently operating at LOS F in both the A.M.
and P.M. peak hours.

Background (2009) Conditions
In the Background (2009) conditions, an annual growth rate was not applied to the existing
traffic. Instead, in order to account for the traffic growth between the base year (2007) and
the project Build year (2009), site trips from twelve (12) other approved developments in the
vicinity being constructed around the same time as, or prior to, the proposed development
were included in the Background (2009) analysis. Geometric improvements associated with
the approved developments were also included as part of the Background (2009) conditions.

Based on the Background (2009) analysis, the overall traffic operations are projected to
worsen at several of the study area intersections due to the significant amount of background
traffic being added to the roadway network. The signalized Green Level West Road and NC
55 intersection is projected to degrade from LOS D to LOS F and LOS D to LOS E in the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours, respectively. Additionally, the eastbound Wellesley Trade Lane
approach at NC 55 is projected to continue operating at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour, while
the westbound Starbucks Driveway approach at NC 55 is projected to continue operating at
LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The unsignalized northbound Jenks
Carpenter Road approach at High House Road is also projected to continue operating at
LOS F in the P.M. peak hour and degrades to LOS E in the A.M. peak hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed development is to consist of 4,000 square feet of bank space, a 4,000-square
foot restaurant, and 45,200 square feet of office space. Based on the corresponding trip
generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, and the suggested
method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet, the proposed
development is projected to generate 2,220 daily trips, 194 A.M. peak hour trips (138
entering, 56 exiting) and 356 P.M. peak hour trips (141 entering, 215 exiting).

Internal capture rates were applied to the development, as well as pass-by rates for the bank
(47%) and restaurant (43%) in the P.M. peak hour. The generated site trips were distributed
in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and the projected land uses in the vicinity of
study area. In all, the majority of site trips were distributed to the north and south along NC
55.

Build (2009) Conditions
The Build (2009) conditions account for both the background traffic and the site traffic
generated by the proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on page v,
the addition of site trips will result in an increase in intersection delay at the study area
intersections, however no significant LOS changes will result.

As for the newly constructed site accesses, the westbound Site Access #2 and eastbound Site
Access #3 approaches are projected to operate at LOS A in both the A.M. and P.M. peak
hours, while the westbound Site Access #1 approach is projected to operate at LOS A in the

                                              ii
A.M. peak hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The following roadway improvements are recommended due to the proposed development,
as discussed below:

Green Level West Road and NC 55 (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at LOS F and LOS
E in the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, respectively. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this location:
    · Restripe the eastbound approach to provide for an exclusive left-turn lane, one
        through lane, and a shared through-right-turn lane.
    · Construct an additional southbound lane, to be striped as an exclusive right-turn lane
        providing at least 250 feet of storage with appropriate taper. Restripe the existing
        shared through-right-turn lane to a through lane. Upgrade the signal to provide an
        overlapping phase for this movement.

Wellesley Trade Lane and NC 55 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that both the eastbound Wellesley Trade Lane approach and the
westbound Starbucks Driveway approach are projected to operate at LOS F during both the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours, while experiencing heavy queuing and long delays. Therefore,
the following improvements are recommended at this location:
    · Construct a median along NC 55, so as to restrict access at this location. Provide for
         right-in/right-out access on the eastbound and westbound approaches, while
         allowing for leftover movements from NC 55 to the sidestreets.
    · Construct an exclusive right-turn lane on the southbound NC 55 approach at
         Wellesley Trade Lane that provides at least 100 feet of storage.
    · In addition, southbound queues from the NC 55 signalized intersection are projected
         to spill through this intersection thereby blocking this driveway during the P.M. peak
         periods.

High House Road and Jenks Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Jenks Carpenter Road approach is
projected to operate at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. However, as this is
the minor approach and based on the close proximity to the adjacent signal at Carpenter
Upchurch Road, no improvements are recommended at this location. A future realignment
with Carpenter Upchurch, as planned by the Town post 2009, should remedy this problem.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Green Level West Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection will operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. However, due to the close proximity to the NC
55 intersection, the following improvements are recommended:
    · Construct a median along Green Level West Road so as to provide for right-
         in/right-out movements on both the northbound and southbound approaches. This
         median should result in approximately 300 feet of eastbound left-turn storage on the
         Green Level West Road approach at NC 55 and approximately 100 feet of left-turn

                                               iii
       storage for the farthest western shopping center driveway aligned across from the
       neighborhood street to the north.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection will operate at an acceptable level of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the westbound approach to provide for one ingress lane and one egress
         lane.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection will operate at an acceptable level of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the westbound approach to provide for one ingress lane and one egress
         lane.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection will operate at an acceptable level of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the eastbound approach to provide for one ingress lane and one egress
         lane.

1.0    INTRODUCTION

There are plans to construct a development on the eastern and western sides of the southern
portion of Wellesley Trade Lane (Figure 1). The proposed development is located with the
Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary's Ordinance
05-009), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. The
development is proposed to consist of 4,000 square feet of bank space, a 4,000-square foot
restaurant, and 45,200 square feet of office space. The project build-out year is scheduled
for 2009. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed development on
the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via three access points along
Wellesley Trade Lane ­ two to serve the eastern development and one to serve the western
development (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for
inclusion in the study are and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where
applicable:
    · NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
    · NC 55 and Wellesley Trade Lane (unsignalized)
    · NC 55 and High House Road/Green Level West Road (signalized)
    · NC 55 and Parkscene Lane/Shopping Center Driveway (signalized)
    · Green Level West Road and Wellesley Trade Lane/Shopping Center Driveway
        (signalized)
    · High House Road and Jenks-Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
    · High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road (signalized)
    · Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #1 (future unsignalized)
    · Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #2 (future unsignalized)
    · Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #3 (future unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed Wellesley Professional Park Development and to identify any
necessary roadway improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes the trip
generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed
development.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                     CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

          B                Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.             10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay          20-35 sec.             15-25 sec.
          D                Long traffic delay           35-55 sec.             25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay         55-80 sec.             35-50 sec.
          F               Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.               > 50 sec.

The proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone".
Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour
(as defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, ITE) with LOS D considered
acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches.
For signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service worse
than LOS D, then no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions.
For unsignalized intersections, where the stop-controlled approach is below a level of service
LOS D under background conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
The existing level of service analysis is based on signal phasing and timing plans obtained
from the Town of Cary and NCDOT as shown in Appendix D. It should be noted that the
NC 55 and Green Hope School Road intersection was analyzed as a T-intersection in the
analysis due to little to no volume observed on the westbound approach. A summary of the
findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full
Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all of the signalized study area intersections are currently operating at
acceptable conditions (LOS D or better) during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.
However, the unsignalized northbound Jenks Carpenter Road approach at High House
Road is currently operating at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. Also, eastbound Wellesley
Trade Lane approach at NC 55 is currently operating at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour, while
the westbound Starbucks Driveway approach at NC 55 is currently operating at LOS F in
both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

                          DEVELOPMENT
For the Background (2009) conditions an annual growth rate was not applied to the existing
traffic. Instead, in order to account for the traffic growth between the base year (2007) and
the project Build year (2009), approved site trips from twelve (12) other developments in the
vicinity being constructed around the same time as or prior to the proposed development
were included in the Background (2009) analysis. They are as follows:

Cary Park Planned Unit Development (PUD) Amendment ­ Known as Larkin Smith Tract, the
proposed Cary Park PUD Amendment will consist of 200 multi-family
townhomes/condominium units, 200,000 square feet of commercial retail, and 200,000
square feet of general office space. The build-out of the development was scheduled for
2008. A traffic analysis report (03-TAR-148) was prepared by Wilbur Smith Associates and
submitted to the Town of Cary in December 2002. Based on this TAR, the development
will generate 12,680 daily site trips, 558 A.M. peak hour trips (384 entering and 174 exiting),
and 1,265 P.M. peak hour trips (542 entering and 723 exiting). These trips were distributed
to the study area intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns as shown in Figure
C-1 of Appendix C.

Amberly PUD Revision ­ Located north of the study area, the proposed Amberly PUD was
originally planned to consist of 6,243 residential units, 270,000 square feet of commercial
retail space, 125,000 square feet of general office space, over 42 acres of park/recreation
areas, and an elementary school site. The full build-out of the development was originally
scheduled for 2015. A traffic analysis report (02-TAR-127) was originally prepared by
Wilbur Smith Associates and submitted to the Town of Cary in 2002. A revision of the
TAR (02-TAR-127a) was submitted in July 2004 to reflect the most recent size projections
of the Amberly PUD development. Based on the TAR revision, the development will
consist of 4,624 dwelling units, 500,000 square feet of commercial use, and 200,000 square
feet of office use, which will result in a slight reduction of site traffic. The traffic analysis
indicated that the proposed development will generate 42,470 daily site trips, 2,997 A.M.
peak hour trips (867 entering and 2,129 exiting), and 4,044 P.M. peak hour trips (2,394
entering and 1,650 exiting). A portion (15%) of these trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-2 of
Appendix C.

Weldon Ridge PUD ­ Formerly known as the Forest Oaks PUD, the proposed Weldon Ridge
PUD was planned to consist of 139 multi-family townhomes/condominium units, 451 single
family units, a 1,500-student private high school, a 500-student private K-8 school, and a
1,000-seat church located along Yates Store Road between New Hope Church Road and
Green Level Church Road. The full build-out of the development was originally scheduled
for 2008. A traffic analysis report (03-TAR-153) was originally prepared by Wilbur Smith
Associates in August 2003 and finalized in March 2004. Based on the TAR, the
development will generate 8,680 daily site trips, 1,264 A.M. peak hour trips (681 entering and
583 exiting), and 887 P.M. peak hour trips (490 entering and 397 exiting). A portion (70%)
of these trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed
distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-3 of Appendix C.

Panther Creek High School ­ Located north of the study area, the 1,600-student capacity
Panther Creek High School was proposed along McCrimmon Parkway roughly between
Green Level to Durham Road and NC 55. The planned public high school was originally
planned to be opened and fully operational by 2006. A traffic analysis report (03-TAR-154)
was prepared by Wilbur Smith Associates and submitted to the Town of Cary in August
2003. Based on the TAR, the development will generate 2,870 daily site trips, 736 A.M. peak
hour trips (515 entering and 221 exiting), and 240 P.M. peak hour trips (96 entering and 144
exiting). A portion (25%) of these trips were distributed to the study area intersections
based on the assumed distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-4 of Appendix C.

Stonewater PUD­ Formerly known as Forest Creek PUD, the proposed Stonewater PUD was
planned to consist of 1,357 residential units, 180,000 square feet of commercial retail space,
60,000 square feet of general office space, and a 28-acre Town Park. The full build-out of
the development was originally scheduled for 2010. A traffic analysis report (02-TAR-130a)
was prepared by Wilbur Smith Associates and submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2002.
Based on the TAR, the development will generate 19,790 daily site trips, 1,066 A.M. peak
hour trips (384 entering and 682 exiting), and 1,912 P.M. peak hour trips (1,025 entering and
887 exiting). A portion (20%) of these trips were distributed to the study area intersections
based on the assumed distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-5 of Appendix C.

Southbridge PUD­ Formerly known as the Kitt Creek Farm residential development, the
proposed 63-acre Southbridge PUD was planned to consist of 130 single family dwelling
units. The full build-out of the development was originally planned for 2006. A traffic
analysis report (03-TAR-155) was originally prepared by Wilbur Smith Associates in August
2003. Based on the TAR, the development will generate 1,320 daily site trips, 101 A.M. peak
hour trips (25 entering and 76 exiting), and 136 P.M. peak hour trips (87 entering and 49
exiting). A portion (50%) of these trips were distributed to the study area intersections
based on the assumed distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-6 of Appendix C.

Hillard Forest Subdivision ­ The proposed 67-acre Hillard Forest Subdivision was planned to
consist of 140 single family dwelling units. There was no traffic analysis report available for
this development. Trip generation was conducted for this development based on the
corresponding rates published in Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, 7th
Edition, as shown in Table 4:

A portion (90%) of these trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the
assumed distribution patterns in the Batchelor Property study (07-TAR-241). The trip
distribution results are shown in Figure C-7 of Appendix C.

Highcroft Commons ­ Located east of the study area at southwestern corner of NC 55 and
Green Hope School Road, the proposed Highcroft Commons commercial development was
originally planned to consist of 4,200 square foot convenience store with car wash and 20
gas pumps and 12,500 square foot of commercial retail space. The full build-out of the
development was scheduled for 2009. A traffic analysis report (05-TAR-182a) was originally
prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in October
2005. Based on the TAR, the development will generate 11,388 daily site trips, 357 A.M.
peak hour trips (180 entering and 177 exiting), and 430 P.M. peak hour trips (214 entering
and 216 exiting). A portion (90%) of these trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-8 of
Appendix C.

Village Investments PDD ­ Located north across from Highcroft Drive between Green Hope
School Road and future Morrisville Parkway extension, the proposed Village Investments
residential/commercial development was originally planned to built-out in 2010 and consist
of the following uses: 322 low-density and medium density single family dwelling units, and
30,000 square foot commercial retail space. A traffic analysis report (06-TAR-202) was
originally prepared by HNTB North Carolina, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in
March 2006. Based on the TAR, the development will generate 4,370 daily site trips, 273
A.M. peak hour trips (81 entering and 192 exiting), and 439 P.M. peak hour trips (260
entering and 179 exiting). A portion (90%) of these trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-9 of
Appendix C.

Batchelor Property ­ Located on the south side of Green Hope School Road, west of NC 55,
this residential development is scheduled for build-out in 2010 and consist of 12 single-
family dwelling units and 200 townhomes. A traffic analysis (07-TAR-241) was originally
prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC and submitted to the Town of Cary in
September 2007. Based on the TAR, the development will generate 1,305 daily trips, 108
A.M. peak hour trips (20 entering and 88 exiting) and 122 P.M. peak hour trips (81 entering
and 41 exiting). A portion (50%) of these trips were distributed to the study area

Appendix C.

Turner Creek Property ­ Located along Turner Creek, west of NC 55, this residential
development was originally proposed to be constructed by 2011 and consist of 215 single-
family dwelling units and 414 townhomes. A traffic analysis (05-TAR-172) was originally
prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC and submitted to the Town of Cary in January
2005. Based on the TAR, the development was expected to generate 4,483 daily trips, 345
A.M. peak hour trips (71 entering and 273 exiting) and 432 P.M. peak hour trips (281
entering and 151 exiting). However, since the submittal of the TAR, the land us has been
modified and the development is now proposed to consist of 300 single-dwelling units.
Based on this, the development is projected to generate 2,857 daily trips, 220 A.M. peak
hour trips (55 entering and 165 exiting) and 289 P.M. peak hour trips (189 entering and 107
exiting). A portion (50%) of these trips were distributed the study area intersections based
on the assumed distributions from the original report as shown in Figure C-11 of Appendix
C.

Bright Beginnings Child Development Center ­ Located at the end of Bright Beginnings Way, just
east of NC 55, the proposed Bright Beginning Child Development Center is scheduled for
completion in 2008 and to consist of the addition of a 3,000-square foot after school
building to the existing campus. A traffic analysis report (08-TAR-276) was originally
prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC and submitted to the Town of Cary in January
2008. Based on the TAR, the development will generate 238 daily site trips, 38 A.M. peak
hour trips (20 entering and 18 exiting) and 40 P.M. peak hour trips (19 entering, 21 exiting).
These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed
distribution patterns as shown in Figure C-12 of Appendix C.

It should be noted that among the twelve (12) approved developments within the study area,
several have been delayed for construction and will only be partially built by the build-out
year (2009) of the proposed development. Thus, discount ratios were applied for site trips
generated by some developments.

The total approved site trips are shown in Figure C-13 of Appendix C, while the resulting
turning movement volumes that are incorporated in the Background (2009) Scenario
capacity analysis are shown in Figure 5. Geometric improvements associated with the
approved developments were included as part of the Background (2009) conditions.

3.2 FUTURE ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
                   IMPROVEMENTS
The Town of Cary has plans to align Jenks Carpenter Road with Carpenter Upchurch Road
in the future resulting in a four-way signalized intersection along High House Road
(Appendix E). At this time, however, it appears that the project will not be completed until
after the build year of this development (2009) and therefore, these planned improvements
were not included in this analysis.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2009) scenario LOS analysis can
be found in Table 5 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2009) analysis, the overall traffic operations are projected to
worsen at several of the study area intersections due to the significant amount of background
traffic being added to the roadway network. The signalized Green Level West Road and NC
55 intersection is projected to degrade from LOS D to LOS F and LOS D to LOS E in the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours, respectively. Additionally, the eastbound Wellesley Trade Lane
approach at NC 55 is projected to continue operating at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour, while
the westbound Starbucks Driveway approach at NC 55 is projected to continue operating at
LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The unsignalized northbound Jenks
Carpenter Road approach at High House Road is also projected to continue operating at
LOS F in the P.M. peak hour and degrades to LOS E in the A.M. peak hour.

4.0     BUILD ANALYSIS

There are plans to construct a development on the eastern and western sides of the southern
portion of Wellesley Trade Lane (Figure 1). The development is proposed to consist of
4,000 square feet of bank space, a 4,000-square foot restaurant, and 45,200 square feet of
office space. The project build-out year is scheduled for 2009.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th
Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation"
Spreadsheet, the proposed development is projected to generate 2,220 daily trips, 194 A.M.
peak hour trips (138 entering, 56 exiting) and 356 P.M. peak hour trips (141 entering, 215
exiting).

Internal capture rates were applied to the development, as well as pass-by rates for the bank
(47%) and restaurant (43%) in the P.M. peak hour. The generated site trips were distributed
in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and the projected land uses in the vicinity of
study area. In all, the majority of site trips were distributed to the north and south along NC
55.

Table 6 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for the
typical weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
                             ASSIGNMENT
The site trips for the proposed development were distributed as follows based upon the
existing traffic patterns as well as the planned land uses in the study area, as follows:
    ·   20% along NC 55 to the north
    ·   28% along NC 55 to the south
    ·   5% along Green Hope School Road to the west
    ·   15% along Green Level West Road to the west
    ·   15% along High House Road to the east
    ·   2% along Parkscene Lane to the east
    ·   5% along Jenks Carpenter Road to the south
    ·   5% along Carpenter Upchurch Road to the north

Note, 5% of the traffic is projected to disburse into neighborhoods along NC 55, between
Wellesley Trade Lane and Green Hope School Road. In all, the majority of the trips were
distributed to the north and south along NC 55. The non-pass-by site trip distribution
percentages for the office portion of the development are shown in more detail in Figure 6
with the resulting site trips shown in Figure 7. The non-pass-by site trip distribution
percentages for the commercial portion of the development are shown in Figure 8 with the
resulting trips shown in Figure 9, while the pass-by site trips distribution percentages for the
commercial portion of the development are shown in Figure 10 with the resulting trips
shown in Figure 11. The total site trips from the proposed development are shown in
Figure 12.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
The Build (2009) analysis scenario includes the background traffic as described in Section 3.0
of this report as well as site generated trips from the proposed development, as described
previously. Figure 13 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2009)
scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. peak
hour using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. Table 7 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the
full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in the table, the addition of site trips will result in an increase in intersection delay
at the study area intersections, however no significant LOS changes will result.

As for the newly constructed site accesses, the westbound Site Access #2 and eastbound Site
Access #3 approaches are projected to operate at LOS A in both the A.M. and P.M. peak
hours, while the westbound Site Access #1 approach is projected to operate at LOS A in the
A.M. peak hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour.

5.0     FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
                     CONCLUSIONS
5.1 ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
The following roadway improvements are recommended due to the proposed development,
as discussed below:

Green Level West Road and NC 55 (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at LOS F and LOS
E in the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, respectively. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this location:
    · Restripe the eastbound approach to provide for an exclusive left-turn lane, one
        through lane, and a shared through-right-turn lane.
    · Construct an additional southbound lane, to be striped as an exclusive right-turn lane
        providing at least 250 feet of storage with appropriate taper. Restripe the existing
        shared through-right-turn lane to a through lane. Upgrade the signal to provide an
        overlapping phase for this movement.

Wellesley Trade Lane and NC 55 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that both the eastbound Wellesley Trade Lane approach and the
westbound Starbucks Driveway approach are projected to operate at LOS F during both the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours, while experiencing heavy queuing and long delays. Therefore,
the following improvements are recommended at this location:
    · Construct a median along NC 55, so as to restrict access at this location. Provide for
         right-in/right-out access on the eastbound and westbound approaches, while
         allowing for leftover movements from NC 55 to the sidestreets.
    · Construct an exclusive right-turn lane on the southbound NC 55 approach at
         Wellesley Trade Lane that provides at least 100 feet of storage.
    · In addition, southbound queues from the NC 55 signalized intersection are projected
         to spill through this intersection thereby blocking this driveway during the P.M. peak
         periods.

High House Road and Jenks Carpenter Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Jenks Carpenter Road approach is
projected to operate at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. However, as this is
the minor approach and based on the close proximity to the adjacent signal at Carpenter
Upchurch Road, no improvements are recommended at this location. A future realignment
with Carpenter Upchurch, as planned by the Town post 2009, should remedy this problem.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Green Level West Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection will operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. However, due to the close proximity to the NC
55 intersection, the following improvements are recommended:
    · Construct a median along Green Level West Road so as to provide for right-
         in/right-out movements on both the northbound and southbound approaches. This
         median should result in approximately 300 feet of eastbound left-turn storage on the
         Green Level West Road approach at NC 55 and approximately 100 feet of left-turn

                                               33
       storage for the farthest western shopping center driveway aligned across from the
       neighborhood street to the north.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection will operate at an acceptable level of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the westbound approach to provide for one ingress lane and one egress
         lane.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection will operate at an acceptable level of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the westbound approach to provide for one ingress lane and one egress
         lane.

Wellesley Trade Lane and Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection will operate at an acceptable level of service
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway configuration
is recommended at this location:
     · Construct the eastbound approach to provide for one ingress lane and one egress
         lane.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 8, and the resulting future lane
geometrics and traffic control for 2009 are shown in Figure 14. The rerouted traffic due to
the driveway restrictions recommended are shown in Figure 15.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location
A new daycare is proposed in southern Cary in the northwest corner of the Tryon Village
shopping center located in the northwest quadrant of the Tryon Road and Walnut Street / Holly
Springs Road intersection. The site is proposed to have a 9,430 square foot daycare which will
have two access drives. One access drive will be off the existing driveway connection for the
back of the Tryon Village shopping center on Tryon Manor Drive and the other will be located
slightly north along Tryon Manor Drive. Both access points will be full-movement and each will
form a "T-intersection" with Tryon Manor Drive. Figure ES-1 shows the study area for 12-TAR-
336 while Figure ES-2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
The daycare will generate more than the Town's 50 peak hour trip threshold (Land Development
Ordinance, section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This
property is also located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone". The
projected build-out year for this property is 2012. This TAR analyzes the potential impacts of the
proposed daycare in Tryon Village shopping center on the adjacent roadways and offers
methods of mitigation for those impacts.

The study area for this TAR will include the following intersections (which will be analyzed during
existing and future conditions):
       05-0127 ­ Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road
       05-1128 ­ Piney Plains Road and Tryon Road
       05-2100 ­ Tryon Road and Holly Springs Road/ Walnut Street
       05-2178 ­ Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road
       05-2269 ­ Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Road
       05-2270 ­ Macedonia Road and Walnut Street
       9001 ­ Tryon Manor Drive and Tryon Road (unsignalized)
       9002 ­Tryon Manor Drive and Tryon Springs Road (roundabout)
       9003 ­ Tryon Manor Drive and Access #1 (unsignalized)
       9004 ­ Tryon Manor Drive and Access #2 (unsignalized, future year only)
       9005 ­ Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road (unsignalized)

Traffic analyses were performed for the proposed site entrance and the study area intersections
listed above for three scenarios, specifically:
       Existing (2011) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts, site visit and existing signal and timing data).
       Background (2012) ­ Estimates future (2012) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 1%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby developments that
       have been approved, but not yet constructed.
       Combined (2012) ­ Adds the site generated traffic to the Background (2012) volumes.
                                                ES-1
Existing (2011) Analysis
The existing laneage network and the balanced counts that were collected were input into
Synchro Version 7 and analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. All signalized
intersections operate at LOS D or better, measured overall. The eastbound and westbound left-
turn lanes of the unsignalized Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection operate at
LOS E and F, respectively. The roundabout at Tryon Manor Drive and Tryon Springs Road
operates at an acceptable level of service, A.

Background (2012) Analysis
Future traffic estimates were made based on applying a 1% average annual growth rate (AAGR)
to the 2011 counts. Also, traffic from the following approved developments was considered, and
added as appropriate:
     08-TAR-288 ­ Tryon Village East
     08-TAR-292 ­ Tryon Village Subdivision
     09-TAR-307 ­ Epic Games Offices
     10-TAR-199a ­ Tryon Place at Cary Parkway

All signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better, measured overall. The eastbound left-turn
lane of the unsignalized Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection operates at LOS
E. The roundabout at Tryon Manor Drive and Tryon Springs Road operates at an acceptable
level of service, A.

Combined (2012) Analysis
Traffic for this scenario was determined by adding site traffic to the Background (2012) estimates.
All signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better, measured overall. The eastbound left-turn
lane of the unsignalized Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection operates at LOS
E. Also, the addition of site generated traffic is expected to increase the delay for the eastbound
left-turn at the intersection of Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road by 0.8 seconds. Note
that even with this small increase, the queue is expected to be contained within the existing turn
lane. The roundabout at Tryon Manor Drive and Tryon Springs Road operates at an acceptable
level of service, A.

Recommended Improvements
Based on comparing the Background (2012) level of service analyses and the Combined (2012)
analyses, reviewing the Town's Land Development Ordinance, and Town of Cary Long Range
Transportation Plan, no improvements are recommended for the development of the Tryon
Village daycare.

Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road
Based upon the Synchro analysis, the addition of site traffic (one vehicle) increases the delay for
the eastbound left-turn movement from 40.3 seconds to 41.1 seconds in the 2012 PM peak hour.
However, the level of service for the movement does not change (LOS E in both with and without
                                              ES-2
development scenarios). This movement is currently serviced by an exclusive left-turn lane. The
predicted queue increases by one foot (13' to 14') from the Background (2012) scenario to the
Combined (2012) scenario, and queues from either scenario are contained in the existing
storage. In order to better evaluate the operations of this intersection, a delay study was
performed:
           Based on the delay study, the existing PM peak hour average control delay for the
           left-turn movement is 14.7 seconds per vehicle (corresponds to LOS B operations);
           approximately 24 seconds less than reported by the Synchro 2011 Existing PM peak
           hour analysis.
For the eastbound left-turns, the delay study indicated LOS B operations versus LOS E
operations predicted by Synchro. Synchro only predicted an increase in delay of 0.8 seconds per
vehicle and an additional 1 foot of queue length with the addition of background and site traffic.
The delay study results in LOS B operations, which is within the criteria stated in the Town of
Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO). Based on the Synchro analysis, the additional site
traffic is anticipated to increase delay by less than one second per vehicle for this movement,
which will not result in LOS E operations for the Combined (2012) analysis. Therefore, no
improvements were recommended for the Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road
intersection.

1.      INTRODUCTION
A new daycare is proposed in southern Cary in the northwest corner of the Tryon Village
shopping center located in the northwest quadrant of the Tryon Road and Walnut Street / Holly
Springs Road intersection. See Figure 1 for a site location map. All figures are located in
Appendix A. The site is proposed to have a 9,430 square foot daycare which will have two
access drives. One access drive will be off the existing driveway connection for the back of the
Tryon Village shopping center on Tryon Manor Drive and the other will be located slightly north
along Tryon Manor Drive. Both access points will be full-movement and each will form a "T-
intersection" with Tryon Manor Drive. The daycare will generate more than the Town's 50 peak
hour trip threshold (Land Development Ordinance, section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a
Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the Town of Cary's "Base
Benefit Transportation Zone". The projected build-out year for this property is 2012. This TAR
analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed daycare in Tryon Village shopping center on the
adjacent roadways and offers methods of mitigation for those impacts.

The site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR will include the following intersections (which will be analyzed during
existing and future conditions):

        05-0127 ­ Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road
        05-1128 ­ Piney Plains Road and Tryon Road
        05-2100 ­ Tryon Road and Holly Springs Road/ Walnut Street
        05-2178 ­ Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road
        05-2269 ­ Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Road
        05-2270 ­ Macedonia Road and Walnut Street
        9001 ­ Tryon Manor Drive and Tryon Road (unsignalized)
        9002 ­Tryon Manor Drive and Tryon Springs Road (roundabout)
        9003 ­ Tryon Manor Drive and Access #1 (unsignalized)
        9004 ­ Tryon Manor Drive and Access #2 (unsignalized, future year only)
        9005 ­ Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road (unsignalized)

Existing signal plans and signal timing plans were obtained from NCDOT and the Town of Cary
as available and used in the analysis. They are located in Appendix B.



2.      EXISTING (2011) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.


                                                 1
2.1.1. TRYON ROAD (SR 1009)
Tryon Road is an east-west connector roadway that runs from the US 1 and US 64
interchange and ends in Garner, NC at Garner Road. The typical section of Tryon Road
within the study area limits is a paved, four-lane, divided roadway. Tryon Road has a
2009 AADT of 18,000 vehicles between Piney Plains Road and Tryon Manor Drive
(based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).


2.1.2. WALNUT STREET/ HOLLY SPRINGS ROAD (SR 1313/ SR 1152)
Walnut Street/ Holly Springs Road is a major north-south connector that runs from near
NC 55 in Holly Springs up to Kildaire Farm Road in downtown Cary, NC. The typical
section of Walnut Street/ Holly Springs Road is a six-lane divided roadway north of Tryon
Road and tapers down to a two-lane undivided roadway south of the study area. Walnut
Street/ Holly Springs Road has a 2009 AADT of 17,000 vehicles in between Macedonia
Road and Tryon Road and a 2009 AADT of 14,000 vehicles in between Tryon Road and
Jones Franklin (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).


2.1.3. JONES FRANKLIN ROAD (SR 1319)
Jones Franklin Road is a major north-south connector that runs from Hillsborough Street
in between Raleigh and Cary down to Holly Springs Road in this TARs study area. Jones
Franklin Road also forms a partial diamond interchange with I-440 and US 1. The typical
section of Jones Franklin Road is a two-lane undivided roadway throughout the study
area. Jones Franklin Road has 2009 AADTs of 7,900 vehicles in between Holly Springs
Road and Tryon Road, 11,000 vehicles between Tryon Road and Macedonia Road, and
8,900 vehicles north of Macedonia Road (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).


2.1.4. PINEY PLAINS ROAD (SR 1423)
Piney Plains Road could almost be considered a loop road around the study area of this
TAR. It runs from Tryon Road to the east of the study area, where it is called Dillard Drive,
through the Crossroads shopping center to the north of the study area, intersects Tryon
Road again as the western-most intersection in the study area, changes names again to
Lochmere Drive just south of Tryon Road and ends at Kildaire Farm Road near the
Lochmere golf course. The typical section of Piney Plains Road is a three-lane roadway
with the center lane being a two-way left-turn lane south of Tryon Road. North of Tryon
Road, Piney Plains Road is a five-lane section with the center lane again being a two-
way-left-turn lane. Piney Plains Road has 2009 AADTs of 11,000 vehicles just west of
Walnut Street, and 8,300 vehicles just north of Tryon Road (based on the 2009 NCDOT
traffic volume map).




                                          2
   2.1.5. MACEDONIA ROAD (SR 1313)
   Macedonia Road is a local street connecting Jones Franklin Road to Walnut Street at the
   entrance to the Tryon Village apartments and townhomes. The typical section of
   Macedonia Road is a two-lane undivided roadway and is approximately 1300 feet in
   length. Macedonia Road's AADT is unknown according to the NCDOT traffic volume
   maps.


   2.1.6. TRYON MANOR DRIVE
   Tryon Manor Drive is a local street running north-south that currently runs from
   Macedonia Lake Drive in the Tryon Village apartment complex to Tryon Road. Both of the
   Tryon Village daycare's site drives will intersect with this road. The typical section of
   Tryon Manor Drive is a two-lane undivided roadway and is approximately 2150 feet in
   length. Tryon Manor Drive's AADT is unknown according to the NCDOT traffic volume
   maps.


   2.1.7. TRYON SPRINGS ROAD
   Tryon Springs Road is primarily a shopping center driveway and a road internal to the
   shopping center. The typical section of Tryon Springs Road is a two-lane roadway that is
   divided because of parking and internal site medians. Tryon Springs Road's AADT is
   unknown according to the NCDOT traffic volume maps.

   2.3.        Turning Movement Counts
   Turning movement counts were conducted in November, 2011. The count data is located in
   Appendix C. These counts were taken to assist in determining the current volumes and
   directional splits of existing traffic. The count volumes were balanced in areas where
   appropriate and grown one year to 2012 to use in the 2012 analysis. The balanced counts
   that were used in the analyses are shown on Figure 4 and are also located in Appendix D.
   The following table, Table 1, lists the time and place counts were conducted.

   2.4.     Level of Service Criteria for Stop-controlled and Signalized
   Intersections
   Exhibit 16-2 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 provides the level of service criteria for
   signalized intersections. The criteria for level of service of a signalized intersection are
   described in Table 2 below.




                                                7
            Table 2: Level of Service Criteria for Signalized Intersections

                           B                     >10-20

                           C                     >20-35

                           D                     >35-55

                           E                     >55-80

                           F                       >80

Exhibit 17-2 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are described in Table 3 below.

         Table 3: Level of Service Criteria for Stop-Controlled Intersections
                    Level of Service Average Control Delay (s/veh)

                           A                      0-10

                           B                     >10-15

                           C                     >15-25

                           D                     >25-35

                           E                     >35-50

                           F                       >50


The daycare development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone which is
described in section 3.23.3 of the Land Development Ordinance. For areas located within the
Base Benefit Zone, the level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are
based on achieving a Level of Service (LOS) D or better for all movements located within the
study area intersections.


2.5.      Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing laneage network and the balanced counts that were collected were input into
Synchro Version 7 and analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. Levels of service
and delay were reported for each movement that experienced delay for unsignalized
intersections. For signalized intersections, levels of service and delay were reported per
                                           8
   approach and for the signal as a whole. Also, the westbound u-turns that were counted at the
   intersection of Tryon Road and Tryon Springs Road were analyzed as left-turns for reporting
   level of service and delay. This is based on Highway Capacity Manual methodologies. The
   summary of the findings are located in Table 3 below.

3.      BACKGROUND (2012) CONDITIONS
     3.1.      Background Growth and Development
     A 1% annual growth rate was applied to the existing volumes (2011) to determine the
     projected volumes for the Background (2012) analysis. These volumes can be found on
     Figure 5. There were also additional trips added to account for approved developments that
     are not yet constructed. These trips were based on other TARs provided by the Town of
     Cary. All additional developments are as follows and described in the sections below.

        3.1.1. 08-TAR-288 ­ TRYON VILLAGE EAST
        This TAR was conducted for the parcel in the southeast quadrant of the Walnut Street
        and Macedonia Road intersection. At the time that 08-TAR-288 was completed, the
        development was to be a mixed use development. Kevin Hales with the Town of Cary's
        planning department stated that they never received a site plan for the Tryon Village East
        parcel. Therefore, the site traffic from this TAR will not be included in this analysis.


        3.1.2. 08-TAR-292 ­ TRYON VILLAGE SUBDIVISION
        08-TAR-292 was conducted for the townhome community that is located west of Walnut
        Street between Tryon Road and Macedonia Road. It was determined, in the site visit
        taken for this TAR, that the townhome community has been built out and it appeared to
        be fully occupied. Therefore, due to the traffic generated by this development being
        accounted for in the traffic counts performed, the site traffic from this TAR will not be
        included in this analysis either.


        3.1.3. 09-TAR-307 ­ EPIC GAMES OFFICES
        Epic Games offices are a development in the southeastern quadrant of the intersection of
        Crossroads Boulevard and Caitboo Avenue. The proposed development included three
        phases of office buildings. It appears that two out of the three phases have been built.
        However, per the Town, the site is complete and only the completion of mitigations was to
        be verified. The mitigations for this development were to improve the Jones Franklin Road
        and Macedonia Road intersection. At the time of the site visit, these improvements had
        been completed and are included in all analyses. A call was made to the Epic Games
                                                  11
   office to determine the future expansion plans for the phase III building; however, we
   were not called back. It is assumed that the remaining third phase is no longer in the
   works and if by chance it is built in the near future, its site trips will be accounted for in the
   one percent background growth.


   3.1.4. 10-TAR-199A ­ TRYON PLACE AT CARY PARKWAY
   Tryon Place at Cary Parkway is a planned apartment complex located in the southeast
   quadrant of Tryon Road and Cary Parkway just west of the study area. The TAR for this
   development states that it is to be completed by 2012 and is planned to consist of 256
   mid-rise apartments. The common intersections between the Tryon Place TAR and this
   daycare TAR are Piney Plains Road and Tryon Road, and Tryon Springs Drive and Tryon
   Road intersections. Site trips from the proposed apartment complex were added to these
   intersections and the trips were routed through the other 12-TAR-336 intersections based
   on existing count patterns. The site trips added to our analysis is shown on Figure 6.


3.2.       Level of Service Analysis
Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2012) AM and PM peak hours which includes the approved development site
trips. This analysis will be used as the base case for the analysis of impacts for the daycare
site.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2012) scenarios analysis are shown on
Figure 5. The summary of the Level of Service analysis for the Background (2012) conditions
is reported in Table 5.

     plus Approved Development Synchro analyses are located in Appendix F.




4.      COMBINED (2012) CONDITIONS
The proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone and therefore
recommendations for the applicant will be based on a level of service standard of "D".


     4.1.       Trip Generation
     The Tryon Village daycare development is proposed to be a 9,430 square foot facility. Trip
     generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to determine the
     amount of vehicles the site would generate. The land use's trip generations are shown in
     Table 6 below.

                                 Table 6: Trip Generation Results

     As ITE and NCDOT recommend for land use code 565, no pass-by trip reductions were
     incorporated into this analysis.


     4.2.       Trip Distribution
     Access to the Tryon Village daycare will be via two full-access driveways on Tryon Manor
     Drive; one existing and one to be built with the site. Trip generation was estimated based on
     count data from nearby intersections, and from knowledge of local trip attractions and
     destinations in the area. The site distribution percentages are shown on Figures 7.1 and 7.2.
     The total amount of trips produced by this site can be found in Figure 8. The trip generation
     and distribution calculations are located in Appendix D.


     4.3.       Combined (2012) Level of Service Analysis
     The Combined (2012) scenario consists of the background with approved development traffic
     as determined in Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed
     Tryon Village daycare development. The volumes that are used in the Combined (2012)
     Analysis are shown in Figure 9.

                                                15
   Level of service analyses were performed for the ten (10) existing intersections plus the
   additional site drive for the Tryon Village daycare development. A summary of the levels of
   service are found in Table 7 below.

     As shown in the table above, all signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better,
     measured overall. The eastbound left-turn lane of the unsignalized Macedonia Road and
     Jones Franklin Road intersection operates at LOS E. Also, the addition of site generated
     traffic is expected to increase the delay for the eastbound left-turn at the intersection of Jones
     Franklin Road and Macedonia Road by 0.8 seconds. Note that even with this small increase,
     the queue is expected to be contained within the existing turn lane. The roundabout at Tryon
     Manor Drive and Tryon Springs Road operates at an acceptable level of service, A. The
     2012 Combined Synchro analyses are located in Appendix G.


     4.4.       Combined (2012) Improved Level of Service Analysis
     Based on the Combined (2012) analysis, and the Town of Cary's guidelines and standards,
     no improvements are recommended at any of the study area intersections. All movements at
     this intersection operate at adequate levels of service.




5.      CONCLUSIONS
Based on comparing the Background (2012) level of service analyses and the Combined (2012)
analyses, reviewing the Town's Land Development Ordinance and Town of Cary Long Range
Transportation Plan, no improvements are recommended.

Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road
Based upon the Synchro analysis, the addition of site traffic (one vehicle) increases the delay for
the eastbound left-turn movement from 40.3 seconds to 41.1 seconds in the 2012 PM peak hour.
However, the level of service for the movement does not change (LOS E in both with and without
development scenarios). This movement is currently serviced by an exclusive left-turn lane. The
predicted queue increases by one foot (13' to 14') from the Background (2012) scenario to the
Combined (2012) scenario, and queues from either scenario are contained in the existing

                                                  18
storage. In order to better evaluate the operations of this intersection, a delay study was
performed:
           Based on the delay study, the existing PM peak hour average control delay for the
           left-turn movement is 14.7 seconds per vehicle (corresponds to LOS B operations);
           approximately 24 seconds less than reported by the Synchro 2011 Existing PM peak
           hour analysis.
For the eastbound left-turns, the delay study indicated LOS B operations versus LOS E
operations predicted by Synchro. Synchro only predicted an increase in delay of 0.8 seconds per
vehicle and an additional 1 foot of queue length with the addition of background and site traffic.
The delay study results in LOS B operations, which is within the criteria stated in the Town of
Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO). Based on the Synchro analysis, the additional site
traffic is anticipated to increase delay by less than one second per vehicle for this movement,
which will not result in LOS E operations. Therefore, no improvements were recommended for
the Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection.

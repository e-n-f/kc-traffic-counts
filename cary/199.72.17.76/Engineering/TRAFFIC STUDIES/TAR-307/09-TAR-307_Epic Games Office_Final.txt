EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
The Town of Cary has received a request for a traffic impact study for an office development
proposed on the southeastern quadrant of the intersection of Crossroads Boulevard and Caitboo
Avenue (Figure 1). The proposed Epic Games Office development is located within the Town of
Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary Land Development Ordinance 3.23),
requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the
potential traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The proposed Epic Games Office development is to expand the existing office building to a total of
165,000 square feet (SF) of office use. It is proposed to include three phases, with Phase I being
already constructed and occupied:
 Phase I
        30,000 SF of office building;
 Phase II
        61,500 SF of office building with 54,159 SF of office space and 7,341 SF of employee-
           only incidental/accessory;
        13,500 SF of connector recreational facilities used exclusively by on-site employees;
 Phase III
        60,000 SF of office building.

The project build-out for the remaining phases is to occur by 2010 for Phase II and by 2011 for
Phase III.

Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via one existing full movement driveway
along Crossroads Boulevard and one future full movement driveway along Caitboo Avenue (Figure
2):
          Existing Epic Games Office Driveway: full access driveway located on Crossroads
           Boulevard aligned with Legacy Village Drive, approximately 650 feet east of Caitboo
           Avenue;
          Future Site Access: full access driveway located on Caitboo Avenue approximately 500
           feet south of Crossroads Boulevard.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and were
analyzed for existing and future conditions:

          Crossroads Boulevard and Legacy Village Drive/Epic Games Office (unsignalized)
          Caitboo Avenue and Full Site Access (future unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under six scenarios: Existing (2008), Background (2010/2011), Phase II
Build (2010), Phase II Build (2010) with Improvements, Phase III Build (2011), and Phase III Build
(2011) with Improvements conditions. The Existing (2008) Scenario includes weekday A.M. and
P.M. peak hour analyses based on turning movement count data collected in 2008. The Background
(2010/2011) Scenario includes existing traffic along with approved site traffic from nine (9)
proposed or approved developments within the study area. An annual growth rate was not applied
because of the expected high volume of traffic that will be added due to the proposed or approved
developments in the area. Phase II Build (2010) Scenario includes the Background (2010/2011)
volumes with the addition of site trips generated by Phase II of the proposed Epic Games Office
development. Phase III Build (2011) Scenario includes the Background (2010/2011) volumes with
site trips generated by both Phase II and Phase III of the proposed development. In addition,
future conditions with roadway improvement alternatives, where applicable, were analyzed in the
Build (2010) with Improvements and Build (2011) with Improvements Scenarios for traffic
mitigations required for Phase II and Phase III, respectively.

Existing (2008) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and the most recent
intersection turning movement counts collected by M/A/B. As reported in the summary level of
service (LOS) table on page vi, all existing signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches
included in the study area are operating at acceptable levels of service, i.e., LOS D or better, during
both the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours, with the exception of the Dillard Drive and Jones
Franklin Road, which operates at LOS D in the A.M. peak hour but LOS E in the P.M. peak hour.

Background (2010/2011) Conditions
In the Background (2010/2011) conditions, no annual growth rate was applied due to the high
traffic volumes expected by other proposed or approved developments in the area. There are nine
developments in the study area being constructed prior to the build-out of the proposed
development. These developments include:
      Crossroads Apartments (05-TAR-185)
      Stephens Road Residential Subdivision (07-TAR-229)
      Dillard Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-235)
      Swift Side Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-244)
      Walnut Street Mixed-Use (08-TAR-283)
      Tryon Village East (08-TAR-288)
                                                  ii
       Hotels at Caitboo and Columbus (08-TAR-291)
       Tryon Village Subdivision (08-TAR-292)
       Tryon Village Mixed-Use Development Update (08-TAR-165A)

The site traffic from these developments was included in the Background (2010/2011) analysis.
This will result in a ten to fifteen percent traffic demand increase at some key intersections in the
study area, such as the Walnut Street and Meeting Street intersection, the Walnut Street and Dillard
Drive intersection, and the Walnut Street and Tryon Road intersection.

Geometrically, the Town of Cary plans to widen Walnut Street to add another northbound through
lane from Dillard Drive to US 1 NB/US 64 EB Ramps, leading to geometric changes at three study
intersections in this TAR. The improvements were assumed in all future year analyses. In addition,
the City of Raleigh plans to widen Tryon Road to a four-lane divided facility between Campbell
Road and Dillard Drive, leading to geometric changes at two study intersections in this TAR. The
improvements associated with the Tryon Road Widening project were also included in all future year
analyses.

Based on the Background (2010/2011) analysis, the overall traffic operations will worsen slightly at
most study area intersections, although the addition of background traffic will not result in a
significant traffic performance degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any
study intersections, with the exception that the intersection of Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin
Road will experience a LOS decline in the morning and operate at LOS E during both the A.M. and
P.M. peak hours. Alternatively, traffic performance improvements are projected at the affected
Walnut Street and Tryon Road intersections as a result of the planned widening along these two
corridors.

As for the unsignalized approaches in the study area, the westbound Jones Franklin Road at
Macedonia Road is projected to decline to operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. The remaining
unsignalized approaches are projected to operate acceptably during both the A.M. and P.M. peak
hours.

Note that since no annual growth is applied and there will be no changes to the approved
developments between 2010 and 2011, the Background conditions will remain the same between
2010 and 2011. Hence, Background (2011) conditions were not separated Background (2010)
conditions in this analysis report.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The Epic Games Office development is proposed to consist of 165,000 SF of office use. ITE code
710 (General Office) was applied to trip generation for the proposed land uses. Based on the
corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the entire
development is projected to generate 1,962 trips on a typical weekday with 280 occurring in the
A.M. peak hour (246 entering and 34 exiting) and 264 occurring in the P.M. peak hour (45 entering,
219 exiting). For Phase II, the development is projected to generate 892 daily trips with 127 A.M.
peak hour trips (112 entering and 15 exiting) and 120 P.M. peak hour trips (20 entering and 100
exiting). For Phase III, the development is projected to generate 713 daily trips with 102 A.M. peak
hour trips (89 entering and 12 exiting) and 96 P.M. peak hour trips (16entering and 80 exiting).

The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and land
uses in the vicinity of project site. In all, the office trips were evenly distributed across the area as
                                                   iii
displayed in the existing traffic patterns.

Phase II Build (2010) Scenario Conditions
The Phase II Build (2010) Scenario conditions account for both the background traffic and the site
traffic generated by Phase II of the proposed office development. As shown in the summary LOS
table on page vi, the addition of site trips will incur an increase of traffic delay but will not result in
level of service decline at any study intersections. As a result, the intersection of Dillard Drive and
Jones Franklin Road will continue to operate at LOS E during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours
with a slight increase in traffic delay. The rest of the signalized intersections in the study area will
remain operating acceptably despite slight traffic delay increases. As for the unsignalized approaches,
the westbound Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia Road is projected to continue to operate at LOS
F in the P.M. peak hour. The rest of the unsignalized approaches will remain operating at
acceptable levels of service despite increases in traffic delay. The planned Future Site Access at
Caitboo Avenue is projected to operate at LOS A during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

Phase III Build (2011) Scenario Conditions
The Phase III Build (2011) Scenario conditions account for both the background traffic and the site
traffic generated by both Phase II and Phase III of the proposed office development. As shown in
the summary LOS table on page vi, the additional site trips will incur a further increase of traffic
delay. As a result, the Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road intersection will operate at LOS E
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, and the westbound Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia
Road will operate at LOS F with a further increase of traffic delay in the P.M. peak hour. The rest
of the signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches in the study area will remain operating
acceptably during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The planned Future Site Access at Caitboo
Avenue is projected to operate at LOS A in the A.M. peak hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour.

Phase II (2010) Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The following roadway improvements are recommended due to Phase II of the proposed
development, as discussed below:
Roadway Widening Along Property Frontage
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of their
property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan. The proposed
Epic Games Office has frontage along Caitboo Avenue and Crossroads Boulevard. Currently
Crossroads Boulevard has a four-lane cross-section with a landscaped median in front of the site,
which already satisfies the geometric requirements by the Comprehensive Plan. Caitboo Avenue is
not included in the Comprehensive Transportation Plan. Therefore, no roadway widening along
property frontage is required for the proposed development.
Caitboo Avenue and Future Site Access (future unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the westbound Future Site Access approach will operate acceptably
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Nevertheless, the following driveway configurations are
recommended at this intersection:
           Construct the planned Future Site Access to provide one inbound lane and one
            outbound lane;
           Install a stop sign on the westbound Future Site Access approach at Caitboo Avenue.
Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection will operate at LOS E with a delay increase of 2.3
                                                    iv
seconds in the A.M. peak hour and 2.0 seconds in the P.M. peak hour under the Phase II Build
(2010) conditions. Therefore, the following geometric improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town of Cary APFR:
          Widen the westbound Dillard Drive approach to provide for an exclusive left-turn lane
           with at least 150 feet of storage and appropriate taper length;
          Widen the southbound Jones Franklin Road approach to provide for an exclusive right-
           turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage and appropriate taper length.
Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road (unsignalized)
The analysis indicates that the stop-controlled westbound approach will operate at a LOS F during
the Phase II Build (2010) P.M. peak hour. This intersection has been identified in previous reports
(such as 06-TAR-244, 08-TAR-288, 08-TAR-292, and 08-TAR-165A) as a location that will require
roadway realignment in the future years. Therefore, the following geometrics and traffic control
improvements are recommended at this location to meet of the Town of Cary APFR if these are not
to be constructed by any other development:
      Realign Jones Franklin Road to become a north-south street and Macedonia Road to
       become a east-west street to allow for free-flow conditions along Jones Franklin Road in
       accordance with the Town of Cary Southeast Area Plan;
      After realignment, provide a continuous left-turn lane on the northbound Jones Franklin
       Road approach, an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length on the
       southbound Jones Franklin Road approach, and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100
       feet of storage length on the eastbound Macedonia Road approach
      Relocate the existing stop control to the future eastbound Macedonia Road approach.

With these improvements in place, the stop-controlled eastbound Macedonia Road will operate at
LOS C or better during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during both
the AM. And P.M. peak hours under the future conditions; therefore, no improvements are
recommended at those locations.

Phase III (2011) Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The following roadway improvements are recommended due to Phase III of the proposed
development, as discussed below:
Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection will operate at LOS E during both the A.M. and
P.M. peak hours without any improvements. A further analysis indicates that even with the addition
of the two recommended turn lanes on the westbound and southbound approaches by Phase II, this
intersection will still operate at LOS E during the A.M. peak hour under the Phase III Build (2011)
conditions. Therefore, the following additional geometric improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town of Cary APFR:
          Widen the westbound Dillard Drive approach to prove for an exclusive right-turn lane
           with at least 100 feet of storage and appropriate taper length.

The recommended future geometrics to mitigate traffic impact due to the proposed development
are shown in Figures ES.

1.0    INTRODUCTION

The Town of Cary has received a request for a traffic impact study for an office
development proposed on the southeastern quadrant of the intersection of Crossroads
Boulevard and Caitboo Avenue (Figure 1). The proposed Epic Games Office development
is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary
Land Use Ordinance 3.23), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be
completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed development
on the adjacent roadways.

The proposed Epic Games Office development is to expand the existing office building to a
total of 165,000 square feet (SF) of office use. It is proposed to include three phases, with
Phase I being already constructed and occupied:
 Phase I
        30,000 SF of office building;
 Phase II
        61,500 SF of office building with 54,159 SF of office space and 7,341 SF of
           employee- only incidental/accessory;
        13,500 SF of connector recreational facilities used exclusively by on-site
           employees;
 Phase III
        60,000 SF of office building.

The project build-out for the remaining phases is to occur by 2010 for Phase II and by 2011
for Phase III.

Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via one existing full movement
driveway along Crossroads Boulevard and one future full movement driveway along Caitboo
Avenue (Figure 2):
          Existing Epic Games Office Driveway: full access driveway located on
           Crossroads Boulevard aligned with Legacy Village Drive, approximately 650 feet
           east of Caitboo Avenue;
          Future Site Access: full access driveway located on Caitboo Avenue
           approximately 500 feet south of Crossroads Boulevard.

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions:

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC (M/A/B) was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the
potential traffic impacts of the proposed Epic Games Office and to identify any necessary
roadway improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes the trip generation,
distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Table 2 provides a general
description of various levels of service categories and delay ranges.

The planned Epic Games Office development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base
Benefit Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinances 3.23, Adequate Public
Facilities Planning and Development for Roads (APFR). Level of service in the "Base
Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered
acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches.

For signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service worse
than LOS D, no increase in overall intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For
unsignalized intersections where the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under
background conditions, the installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the
intersection meets required warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an
undesirable delay in the surrounding roadway system.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3
and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all existing signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches
included in the study area are operating at acceptable levels of service, i.e., LOS D or better,
during both the weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours, with the exception of the Dillard Drive
and Jones Franklin Road, which operates at LOS D in the A.M. peak hour but LOS E in the
P.M. peak hour.

3.0    BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
No general background growth rate was applied to the study area roadways or intersections
volume counts due to the high volumes expected to be added to the network by other
approved developments in the area. There are nine (9) developments in the study area being
constructed prior to the build-out of the proposed development. These developments are:
      Crossroads Apartments (05-TAR-185)
      Stephens Road Residential Subdivision (07-TAR-229)
      Dillard Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-235)
      Swift Side Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-244)
      Walnut Street Mixed-Use (08-TAR-283)
      Tryon Village East (08-TAR-288)
      Hotels at Caitboo and Columbus (08-TAR-291)
      Tryon Village Subdivision (08-TAR-292)
      Tryon Village Mixed-Use Development Update (08-TAR-165A)

Crossroads Apartments  This development, which will be located in the northwest quadrant of
the Jones Franklin Road and Crossroads Boulevard intersection, was originally planned to be
completed in 2006 and is to consist of 350 apartments and 30,000 SF of office space. A
traffic analysis report (05-TAR-185) was completed by HNTB in 2005. Trip generation for
this development indicates 2,682 new weekday trips will be generated with 226 of them (76
entering and 150 exiting) occurring in the A.M. peak hour and 262 occurring in the P.M.
peak hour (148 entering, 114 exiting). These trips were distributed in the same manner as
assumed in the HNTB report. Figure C-1 in Appendix C depicts the traffic assignment for
this development.

Stephens Road Residential Development  This residential subdivision, planned by Buxbaum Real
Estate Company, LLC, is located on the south side of Stephens Road, west of Piney Plains
Road. The project will consist of 48 single family dwelling units and is planned for
completion in 2008. Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC prepared a traffic analysis report (07-
TAR-229) for this development which was submitted in February 2007. Trip generation for
this project indicates an additional 529 daily trips will be added to the network on a typical
weekday due to this development, with 43 of these trips occurring in the A.M. peak hour (11
entering, 32 exiting) and 55 occurring in the P.M. peak hour (35 entering, 20 exiting). Figure
C-2 in Appendix C illustrates these assigned trips. There is no mitigation recommendation
associated with the Stephens Road Residential Development at any study intersections in
this TAR.

Dillard Drive Office Complex  This office development is to be located adjacent to the Holiday
Inn in the northeast quadrant of the Dillard Drive and Columbus Street intersection and will
consist of 24,000 SF of general office space. It is planned for completion in 2008.
According to the traffic analysis report (07-TAR-235) completed by Wilbur Smith Associates
in 2007, the development will generate 445 weekday trips with 106 occurring during the P.M.
peak hour. The site trips were distributed to the roadway network in accordance with the


                                              17
distribution used in 07-TAR-235. An A.M. peak hour analysis was not included in the
original TAR. Based on the rates included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the
proposed development will generate 60 A.M. peak hour trips (53 entering and 7 exiting).
These A.M. peak hour trips at each study intersection were therefore derived, by applying
the A.M./P.M. ratios for entering and exiting traffic, respectively, from the P.M. peak hour
site trips as shown in the WSA report. Figure C-3 in Appendix C illustrates these distributed
site trips. There is no mitigation recommendation associated with the Dillard Drive Office
Complex at any study intersections in this TAR.

Swift Side Office Condominiums  This commercial development is to be located near the
intersection of Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road. The development, consisting of
approximately 31,500 SF of general office space, is planned for completion by 2008.
According to the traffic analysis report (07-TAR-244) prepared by HNTB for this
development, 348 new trips will be added to the roadways on a typical weekday, with 49 of
these occurring in the A.M. peak hour (43 entering, 6 exiting) and 47 occurring during the
P.M. peak hour (8 entering, 39 exiting). The A.M. and P.M. peak hour site trips were
distributed to the surrounding roadways in accordance with the patterns used in the HNTB
report. Figure C-4 in Appendix C depicts this assignment. This report recommends the
realignment of Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia Road to allow Jones Franklin to be the
major through movement. However, no improvements have been made at this intersection
although the development is nearly completed. Therefore, this improvement was not
included in the background scenario.

Walnut Street Mixed-Use  The proposed mixed-use development is to be located near the
intersection of Walnut Street and US 1/64 Ramps/Donaldson Drive. The development,
consisting of three possible scenarios, is planned for completion by 2009. According to a
traffic analysis report (08-TAR-283) prepared by M/A/B in January 2008, this development,
in the worse case scenario (Scenario A), will generate 5,995 trips on a typical weekday with
511 of these occurring in the P.M. peak hour (224 entering, 287 exiting). TAR-283 did not
include an A.M. peak hour analysis. Based on the rates included in the ITE Trip Generation
Manual, 7th Edition, the proposed development will generate 288 A.M. peak hour trips (205
entering and 83 exiting). These A.M. peak hour trips at each study intersection were
therefore derived, by applying the A.M./P.M. ratios for entering and exiting traffic,
respectively, from the P.M. peak hour site trips as shown in the M/A/B report. Figure C-5
in Appendix C depicts the resulting trip assignment. TAR-283 recommended restriping the
westbound Meeting Street approach at Walnut Street to alleviate site impact at this
intersection on Saturdays. However, it was not included in the Background (2010/2011)
conditions due to the uncertain status of this project.

Tryon Village East  This office and retail development is located in the southeastern
quadrant of the Walnut Street and Macedonia Road intersection. The proposed project is to
consist of two possible land use scenarios and is scheduled for completion in 2009. Based
on the worse-case scenario (Scenario A) as described in the Traffic Analysis Report (08-
TAR-288) prepared by M/A/B, this development will generate 5,100 trips with 586
occurring in the P.M. peak hour (242 entering, 344 exiting) on a typical weekday. These trips
were distributed to the study area network in accordance with the distribution used in 08-
TAR-288. TAR-288 did not include an A.M. peak hour analysis. Based on the rates
included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the proposed development will

                                             18
generate 266 A.M. peak hour trips (203 entering and 63 exiting). These A.M. peak hour trips
at each study intersection were therefore derived, by applying the A.M./P.M. ratios for
entering and exiting traffic, respectively, from the P.M. peak hour site trips as shown in the
M/A/B report. There was mitigation recommended at the Walnut Street and Meeting Street
intersection and the Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection, but these
improvements were not finally committed. Therefore, they were not included in the
background analyses. Figure C-6 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

Hotels at Caitboo and Columbus (08-TAR-291)  This development is located in the
southeastern quadrant of the Caitboo Avenue and Columbus Avenue intersection. The
development consists of a 125-room hotel and a 120-room hotel with projected build-out by
2010. According to the 08-TAR-291 prepared by M/A/B, on a typical weekday, the
development is projected to generate 2,002 trips with 145 occurring in the P.M. peak hour
(77 entering, 68 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area network in
accordance with the distribution used in 08-TAR-291. TAR-291 did not include an A.M.
peak hour analysis. Based on the rates included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition,
the proposed development will generate 137 A.M. peak hour trips (84 entering and 53
exiting). These A.M. peak hour trips at each study intersection were therefore derived, by
applying the A.M./P.M. ratios for entering and exiting traffic, respectively, from the P.M.
peak hour site trips as shown in 08-TAR-291. There is mitigation required at Meeting Street
and Walnut Street, but the project has not been approved. Therefore, this mitigation was
not included in the background analyses. Figure C-7 in Appendix C depicts the assigned
trips.

Tryon Village Subdivision (08-TAR-292)  This residential development is part of Tract 3 of the
Tryon Village Mixed-Use Development, which is located in the northwestern quadrant of
the Walnut Street and Tryon Road intersection. The proposed project is to consist of 105
townhomes and is scheduled for completion in 2010. According to the Traffic Analysis
Report (08-TAR-292) prepared by M/A/B, this development is projected to generate 669
trips with 63 occurring in the P.M. peak hour (42 entering, 21 exiting) on a typical weekday.
These trips were distributed to the study area network in accordance with the distribution
used in 08-TAR-292. TAR-292 did not include an A.M. peak hour analysis. Based on the
rates included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the proposed development will
generate 54 A.M. peak hour trips (9 entering and 45 exiting). These A.M. peak hour trips at
each study intersection were therefore derived, by applying the A.M./P.M. ratios for entering
and exiting traffic, respectively, from the P.M. peak hour site trips as shown in 08-TAR-292.
There is mitigation required at the intersection of Walnut Street and Macedonia Road/
Crossroads Manor Court, but the project has not been approved. Therefore, this mitigation
was not included in the background analyses. Figure C-8 in Appendix C depicts the assigned
trips.

Tryon Village Mixed-Use Update (08-TAR-165A)  This office and retail development is
located in the northwestern quadrant of the Walnut Street and Tryon Road intersection.
The proposed project is to consist of two possible land use scenarios and is scheduled for
completion in 2010. Based on the worse-case scenario (Scenario B) as described in the
Traffic Analysis Report (08-TAR-165A) prepared by M/A/B, this development will generate
5,686 trips with 561 occurring in the P.M. peak hour (225 entering, 336 exiting) on a typical
weekday. These trips were distributed to the study area network in accordance with the

                                              19
distribution used in 08-TAR-165A. TAR-165A did not include an A.M. peak hour analysis.
Based on the rates included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the proposed
development will generate 291 A.M. peak hour trips (232 entering and 59 exiting). These
A.M. peak hour trips at each study intersection were therefore derived, by applying the
A.M./P.M. ratios for entering and exiting traffic, respectively, from the P.M. peak hour site
trips as shown in the M/A/B report. There was mitigation recommended at the Walnut
Street and Meeting Street intersection, the Tryon Road and Tryon Village/Colonial Baptist
Church intersection, and the Macedonia Road and Jones Franklin Road intersection, but
these improvements were not finally committed. Therefore, they were not included in the
background analyses. Figure C-9 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips.

All the projects previously discussed are expected to be completed by the build year of Phase
II of the proposed Epic Games Office. The resulting total site trips from approved
developments are shown in Figure 5. These approved trips are incorporated in the
Background (2010/2011) Scenario capacity analysis, and the resulting turning movement
volumes are shown in Figure 6. As a result, a ten to fifteen percent traffic demand increase
is projected at some key locations in the study area, such as the Walnut Street and Meeting
Street intersection, the Walnut Street and Dillard Drive intersection, and the Walnut Street
and Tryon Road intersection.

3.2 FUTURE STUDY AREA IMPROVEMENTS
Improvements associated with the planned Town of Cary and City of Raleigh projects in the
study area were included in all future year analyses. These improvements are as follows:

Town of Cary Walnut Street Widening  The Town of Cary plans to add a northbound through-
lane along Walnut Street from Dillard Drive to the US 1/US 64 interchange. With the
completion of this widening and the recently completed interchange enhancements, Walnut
Street will become a six-lane, median-divided road from Tryon Road to Donaldson Drive.
The construction is currently ongoing and is expected to be completed in fall 2008. As a
result of this project, a third northbound through lane will be added at the Walnut Street and
Meeting Street intersection. In addition, restriping will be made at the Walnut Street and
Dillard Drive intersection to convert the exclusive right-turn lanes on the westbound and
northbound approaches to shared through/right-turn lanes. These improvements, as shown
in Appendix D, were assumed in all future year analyses.

City of Raleigh Tryon Road Widening - The City of Raleigh is currently widening Tryon Road to
a multi-lane facility from Campbell Road to Dillard Drive. As part of the project, additional
through and turn lanes will be added at the Yates Mill Pond Road intersection and the
Dillard Drive intersection. This project is ongoing and is expected to be completed by
build-out of this project. Therefore, as shown in Appendix D, these geometric
improvements were included in all future scenarios.

SE Area Plan, Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan - First adopted in 1998, the Town of Cary
SE Area Plan is designed to direct land uses and transportation in the area south of US 1/64,
north of SE Cary Parkway and west of Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road. The
project is to reexamine the town's land use vision for the area in light of its growth and the
accompanying traffic impacts and to evaluate whether or not there are better alternatives for

                                             20
the development or redevelopment of the remainder of this area. As shown in Appendix D,
the SE Area Plan recommends the realignment of Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia Road
to allow Jones Franklin Road to be the major through movement, resulting in a stop-
controlled Macedonia Road approach.       However, this recommendation has not been
committed by any specific development, and, therefore, was not included in the future
analysis.

Note that since no annual growth is applied and there will be no changes to the approved
developments between 2010 and 2011, the Background conditions will be the same between
2010 and 2011. Hence, Background (2011) conditions were not separated from Background
(2010) conditions in this analysis report.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2010/2011) scenario LOS analysis
can be found in Table 4 below and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix
B.

Based on the Background (2010/2011) analysis, the overall traffic operations will worsen
slightly at most study area intersections, although the addition of background traffic will not
result in a significant traffic performance degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to
unacceptable LOS) at any study intersections, with the exception that the intersection of
Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road will experience a LOS decline in the morning and
operate at LOS E during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Alternatively, traffic
performance improvements are projected at the affected Walnut Street and Tryon Road
intersections as a result of the planned widening along these two corridors.

4.0    BUILD CONDITIONS

The proposed Epic Games Office development is to be located on the southeastern
quadrant of the intersection of Crossroads Boulevard and Caitboo Avenue (Figure 1), within
the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 05-
009). This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of the proposed development on the
adjacent roadways.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The proposed Epic Games Office development is to expand the existing office building to a
total of 165,000 square feet (SF) of office use. It is proposed to include three phases, with
Phase I being already constructed and occupied:
 Phase I
        30,000 SF of office building;
 Phase II
        61,500 SF of office building with 54,159 SF of office space and 7,341 SF of
           employee- only incidental/accessory;
        13,500 SF of connector recreational facilities used exclusively by on-site
           employees;
 Phase III
        60,000 SF of office building.

Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th
Edition, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,962 trips on a typical weekday
with 280 occurring in the A.M. peak hour (246 entering and 34 exiting) and 264 occurring in
the P.M. peak hour (45 entering, 219 exiting). For Phase II, the development is projected to
generate 892 daily trips with 127 A.M. peak hour trips (112 entering and 15 exiting) and 120
P.M. peak hour trips (20 entering and 100 exiting). For Phase III, the development is
projected to generate 713 daily trips with 102 A.M. peak hour trips (89 entering and 12
exiting) and 96 P.M. peak hour trips (16entering and 80 exiting).

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the Epic Games Office for typical
weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via one existing full movement
driveway along Crossroads Boulevard and one future full movement driveway along Caitboo
Avenue (Figure 2):
             Existing Epic Games Office Driveway: full access driveway located on
              Crossroads Boulevard aligned with Legacy Village Drive, approximately 650 feet
              east of Caitboo Avenue;
             Future Site Access: full access driveway located on Caitboo Avenue
              approximately 500 feet south of Crossroads Boulevard.

The site trips for the proposed Epic Games Office development were distributed based on
the existing traffic patterns and planned future land uses. In all, the office trips were evenly
distributed across the area as displayed in the existing traffic patterns. Table 6 illustrates the
directional traffic assignment percentages for each approach, while the site trip directional
distribution percentages at each study intersection are shown in Figure 7. The total number
of site trips generated by Phase II of the proposed development was calculated at each study
area intersection and is shown in Figure 8. The total number of site trips generated by Phase
II and Phase III of the proposed development was calculated at each study area intersection
and is shown in Figure 9.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Phase II Build (2010) analysis scenarios include the background traffic as described in
Section 3.0 of this report as well as site generated trips from Phase II of the proposed
development as described previously. The Phase III Build (2011) analysis scenarios include
the background traffic as well as site generated trips from both Phase II and Phase III of the
proposed development. Figure 10 and Figure 11 depict the turning movement volumes used
in the Phase II Build (2010) and Phase III Build (2011) analyses, respectively.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hour using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. Table 7 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the
full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

Phase II Build (2010) LOS Results
As shown in the table, the addition of site trips will incur an increase of traffic delay but will
not result in level of service decline at any study intersections. As a result, the intersection of
Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road will continue to operate at LOS E during both the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours with a slight increase in traffic delay. The rest of the signalized
intersections in the study area will remain operating acceptably despite slight traffic delay
increases. As for the unsignalized approaches, the westbound Jones Franklin Road at
Macedonia Road is projected to continue to operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. The
rest of the unsignalized approaches will remain operating at acceptable levels of service
despite increases in traffic delay. The planned Future Site Access at Caitboo Avenue is
projected to operate at LOS A during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

Phase III Build (2011) LOS Results
As shown in the table, the additional site trips will incur a further increase of traffic delay.
As a result, the Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road intersection will operate at LOS E
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, and the westbound Jones Franklin Road at
Macedonia Road will operate at LOS F with a further increase of traffic delay in the P.M.
peak hour. The rest of the signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches in the study
area will remain operating acceptably during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The
planned Future Site Access at Caitboo Avenue is projected to operate at LOS A in the A.M.
peak hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour.

5.0     FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The following roadway improvements are recommended due to the proposed Epic Games
Office, as discussed below:

Phase II (2010) Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The following roadway improvements are recommended due to Phase II of the proposed
development, as discussed below:
Roadway Widening Along Property Frontage
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed Epic Games Office has frontage along Caitboo Avenue and Crossroads
Boulevard. Currently Crossroads Boulevard has a four-lane cross-section with a landscaped
median in front of the site, which already satisfies the geometric requirements by the
Comprehensive Plan. Caitboo Avenue is not included in the Comprehensive Transportation
Plan. Therefore, no roadway widening along property frontage is required for the proposed
development.
Caitboo Avenue and Future Site Access (future unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the westbound Future Site Access approach will operate
acceptably during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Nevertheless, the following driveway
configurations are recommended at this intersection:
           Construct the planned Future Site Access to provide one inbound lane and one
            outbound lane;
           Install a stop sign on the westbound Future Site Access approach at Caitboo
            Avenue.
Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection will operate at LOS E with a delay increase
of 2.3 seconds in the A.M. peak hour and 2.0 seconds in the P.M. peak hour under the Phase
II Build (2010) conditions. Therefore, the following geometric improvements are
recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary APFR:
           Widen the westbound Dillard Drive approach to provide for an exclusive left-
            turn lane with at least 150 feet of storage and appropriate taper length;
           Widen the southbound Jones Franklin Road approach to provide for an
            exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage and appropriate taper
            length.




                                               36
Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road (unsignalized)
The analysis indicates that the stop-controlled westbound approach will operate at a LOS F
during the Phase II Build (2010) P.M. peak hour. This intersection has been identified in
previous reports (such as 06-TAR-244, 08-TAR-288, 08-TAR-292, and 08-TAR-165A) as a
location that will require roadway realignment in the future years. Therefore, the following
geometrics and traffic control improvements are recommended at this location to meet of
the Town of Cary APFR if these are not to be constructed by any other development:
      Realign Jones Franklin Road to become a north-south street and Macedonia Road to
       become a east-west street to allow for free-flow conditions along Jones Franklin
       Road in accordance with the Town of Cary Southeast Area Plan;
      After realignment, provide a continuous left-turn lane on the northbound Jones
       Franklin Road approach, an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage
       length on the southbound Jones Franklin Road approach, and an exclusive left-turn
       lane with at least 100 feet of storage length on the eastbound Macedonia Road
       approach
      Relocate the existing stop control to the future eastbound Macedonia Road
       approach.

With these improvements in place, the stop-controlled eastbound Macedonia Road will
operate at LOS C or better during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

The remaining study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM. And P.M. peak hours under the future conditions; therefore, no
improvements are recommended at those locations.

Phase III (2011) Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The following roadway improvements are recommended due to Phase III of the proposed
development, as discussed below:
Dillard Drive and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection will operate at LOS E during both the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours without any improvements. A further analysis indicates that even
with the addition of the two recommended turn lanes on the westbound and southbound
approaches by Phase II, this intersection will still operate at LOS E during the A.M. peak
hour under the Phase III Build (2011) conditions. Therefore, the following additional
geometric improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
APFR:
          Widen the westbound Dillard Drive approach to prove for an exclusive right-
           turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage and appropriate taper length.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 8, the resulting future lane
configurations and traffic control for 2010 and 2011 are shown in Figure 12.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Location and Description
The Town of Cary has received a proposal for rezoning a parcel (Herndon Tract) located in the
northwest quadrant of the NC 55 and Turner Creek Road intersection. The proposed rezoning is
from Wake County's R-40W and HD (Residential and Highway District) to the Town of Cary's
RMF (Residential Multi-Family) and the proposed land use is for a residential development
consisting of 110 duplex homes, 110 townhomes, or 68 single family homes. Of the proposed
uses, 68 single family homes generate the higher number of trips and therefore was used in the
analysis. Trip generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to
determine the number of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is shown in
Table 1.

The site plan for this parcel proposes one full-movement access on Turner Creek Road across
from the existing eastern access to Turner Creek Elementary and one full-movement access on
NC 55. This traffic study, 13-TAR-370, analyzes the effects of the proposed new residential
development on traffic operations in the study area. Figure ES-1 shows the study area for 13-
TAR-370 while Figure ES-2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
Although the rezoning application for this proposed development does not meet the Town's peak
hour trip requirements for the submittal of a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR), the applicant
voluntarily requested a TAR be performed due to pending amendments to the Town's Land
Development Ordinance (LDO). This property is located in the Base Transportation Zone
identified in the Town's LDO (Section 7.11.6). The projected build-out year for this development
is 2015. This TAR analyzes the potential traffic related impacts of the proposed residential
development on the adjacent roadways and offers potential mitigation for those impacts.

The intersections are analyzed with the traffic analysis program, Synchro. The study area for this
TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number is provided before the
intersection name):
   ·   2075 ­ NC 55 and Parkscene Lane/Shopping Center Access
   ·   2241 ­ NC 55 and Turner Creek Road/Lewey Drive
   ·   9001 ­ Turner Creek Road and School Access/Proposed Access 1 (unsignalized)

   ·   9002 ­ NC 55 and Proposed Access 2 (for the Combined and Combined Improved
       scenarios only)

Traffic analyses were performed for the study area intersections for four scenarios, specifically:
   ·   Existing (2013) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts (balanced if appropriate), aerial photography, site visit, and existing signal and
       timing data).
   ·   Background (2015) ­ Estimates future (2015) conditions based on an average annual
       growth rate (AAGR) of 2%, and adds the traffic generated by nearby developments that
       have not yet been constructed.
   ·   Combined (2015) ­ Adds the site generated traffic from the proposed residential
       development to the Background (2015) volumes.
   ·   Combined and Improved (2015) ­ If necessary, analyzes potential mitigations to provide
       acceptable levels of service based on the Town's LDO.

Background (2015) Analysis
Based on historical volume information, developing land uses in the area, and information from
adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth rate of 2% was assumed for the study
area The selection of this growth rate also took into consideration the fact that Triangle
Expressway is now open in this area. Future traffic estimates were made based on applying a
2% average annual growth rate (AAGR) to the 2013 balanced counts.

Potential Mitigations
Level of service is a calculated value that typically indicates the average rating that traveler would
give a roadway under a given set of conditions. Level of Service is reported by letter, with A
being the least congested and F being the worst. Additional detail regarding level of service can
be found in Section 1 of the report. While this project does not fall within the requirements of the
Town's ordinance relating to traffic studies, the typical TAR process was still followed regarding
analysis and mitigation procedures. The two signalized intersections did not fall below level of
service (LOS) D with the additional site traffic; however, both unsignalized intersections had
movements that fell below LOS D with the additional site traffic. As such, mitigation was
evaluated for these intersections and is described below. The proposed Build laneage is shown
in Figure ES-3.

   Intersection of Turner Creek Road and School Access/Proposed Access 1
   The shared southbound left, through and right-turn movement at this intersection operates at
   LOS E in the AM peak period and has an estimated 95th percentile queue length of 24 feet
   (approximately one vehicle). This approach serves as an egress for the proposed
   development. In an effort to mitigate the impacts of site traffic and to improve the LOS E
   operations, the following mitigations were evaluated:

                                                                                  13-TAR-370
                                                                                       FINAL


   ·   Provide an exclusive southbound left-turn and a shared through and right-turn lane ­
       With this mitigation, the left-turn movement still operates at LOS E in the AM peak
       period with an estimated 95th percentile queue length of 23 feet.

   ·   Provide an exclusive westbound right-turn lane ­ With this mitigation, operations for
       the southbound movement remain at LOS E.

   ·   Provide a traffic signal ­ When considering installation of a traffic signal, up to 9
       warrants are evaluated based on guidance provided in the Manual on Uniform Traffic
       Control Devices (MUTCD). The peak hour warrant evaluates traffic at the intersection
       during the peak hours (in this case the AM and PM peak hour) of the day. If this
       warrant is not met, it is not likely that the other volume-based warrants would be met.
       For this intersection, a peak hour signal warrant analysis was performed and is
       located in Appendix H. Based on that analysis, the peak hour signal warrant is not
       met and therefore a traffic signal would likely not be warranted or installed.

After investigating potential mitigation, it was determined that no reasonable geometric
improvements would improve the shared southbound left, through and right-turn movement
enough to reach LOS D. While this is not desirable, the movement operating at LOS E at this
intersection only affects vehicles exiting the site and not level of service along the adjacent
roadway (Turner Creek Road). Additionally, a key factor affecting the southbound operations
of this intersection is the volume of traffic associated with Turner Creek Road Elementary
School which conflicts with the southbound left-turn movement. Based on the typical traffic
operations at schools, it is anticipated that the heaviest volume on the northbound approach
(school driveway) will occur during a 30 minute period that coincides with the beginning and
end of the school day. Based on the current bell schedule for Turner Creek Elementary
School (9:15 AM ­ 3:15 PM) and the peak hour of the adjacent NC 55 intersection which
serves commuter traffic, the peak of the school traffic on the northbound approach may not
occur during the same hour as the residential site traffic on the southbound approach. If this
is actually the case, the operations of this intersection may be better than shown in the
analysis results; however, it should be noted that school bell schedules are subject to
change. Based on the evaluation of potential mitigations described above, the estimated
length of 95th percentile queue, and the fact that it is not unusual for low volume driveways to
have movement operating below LOS D, no modifications are suggested at this intersection
to mitigate site traffic at this time.

Additionally, it should be noted that Turner Creek Road is a state-maintained facility.
Therefore, this intersection will be subject to NCDOT review and approval.

Intersection of NC 55 and Proposed Access 2
The shared eastbound left and right-turn movement at this intersection operates at LOS E in
the PM peak period and has an estimated 95th percentile queue length of 5 feet (less than the

length of one vehicle). This approach serves as one egress for the proposed development
and, in an effort to mitigate the impacts of site traffic, the following mitigations were evaluated:

   ·   Provide exclusive eastbound left-turn and right-turn lanes ­ With this mitigation, the
       right-turn movement is improved, but the left-turn movement degrades to a LOS F in
       the PM peak period.

   ·   Provide an exclusive southbound right-turn lane ­ With this mitigation, operations on
       the eastbound movement remain at LOS E.

   ·   Restrict access to right-in/right-out operations ­ With this restriction, the level of
       service would be improved, but since the southern intersection of NC 55 and Turner
       Creek Road/Lewey Drive is not designed to accommodate southbound U-turns, the
       vehicles wishing to make a left-turn (the movement in question) are anticipated to exit
       the site at proposed Access 1. As described above, the site egress at Proposed
       Access 1 operates at LOS E in the AM peak period, which is expected to worsen with
       the addition of traffic due to the restriction at Proposed Access 2. However, it should
       be noted that the peak period in which the shared eastbound left and right-turn
       movement at this intersection operates at LOS E is not the same peak period that the
       shared southbound left and right-turn at Turner Creek Road and School
       Access/Proposed Access 1 operates at LOS E. Given this, these eastbound left-
       turning vehicles at Proposed Access 2 have the option to relocate to Proposed
       Access 1, with a better level of service, to access the signal at NC 55 and Turner
       Creek Road/Lewey Drive to make their desired maneuver.

   ·   Provide a traffic signal ­ When considering installation of a traffic signal, up to 9
       warrants are evaluated based on guidance provided in the Manual on Uniform Traffic
       Control Devices (MUTCD). The peak hour warrant evaluates traffic at the intersection
       during the peak hours (in this case the AM and PM peak hour) of the day. If this
       warrant is not met, it is not likely that the other volume-based warrants would be met.
       For this intersection, a peak hour signal warrant analysis was performed and is
       located in Appendix H. Based on that analysis, the peak hour signal warrant is not
       met and therefore a traffic signal would likely not be warranted or installed.

After investigating potential mitigation, it was determined that only one geometric
improvement, restricting the eastbound movement to right-in/right-out access, would improve
the eastbound approach to operate at LOS D. However, this improvement was not
suggested due to its potential negative impacts on Proposed Site Access 1 and the fact that
there is expected to be less than 5 feet of average queue during the peak hour. While LOS E
operations are not desirable, the movement operation of LOS E at this intersection only
affects the level of service for vehicles exiting the site and not the level of service for the
adjacent roadway (NC 55). Also, it is not uncommon for low volume driveways to have
exiting movements operating at LOS E or F during the peak periods even though the queues

   are minimal and short-lived. Based on the evaluation of potential mitigations described
   above, the estimated length of 95th percentile queue, the fact it is not unusual for low volume
   driveways to have movement operating below LOS D, no modifications are suggested at this
   intersection to mitigate site traffic at this time.

   Additionally, it should be noted that NC 55 is a state-maintained facility. Therefore, this
   intersection will be subject to NCDOT review and approval.

Table 2a provides a comparison of the signalized intersections in the 2013 Existing, 2015
Background, and 2015 Combined conditions. The results provided in Table 2a show that both
signalized intersections operate better than LOS D in all scenarios.

Table 2b provides a comparison of the unsignalized intersections in the 2013 Existing, 2015
Background, and 2015 Combined conditions. As indicated in Table 2b, the Turner Creek Road
and School Access/Proposed Access 1 intersection and the NC 55 and Proposed Access 2
intersection both have movements that operate at LOS E. Although these two intersections have
movements that operate below LOS D, no mitigation is suggested based on the evaluation of
potential improvements discussed above.

INTRODUCTION
The Town of Cary has received a proposal for rezoning a parcel (Herndon Tract) located in the
northwest quadrant of the NC 55 and Turner Creek Road intersection. The proposed rezoning is
from Wake County's R-40W and HD (Residential and Highway District) to the Town of Cary's
RMF (Residential Multi-Family) and the proposed land use is for a residential development
consisting of 110 duplex homes, 110 townhomes, or 68 single family homes. Of the proposed
uses, 68 single family homes generate the higher number of trips and therefore was used in the
analysis. The site plan for this parcel proposes one full-movement access on Turner Creek Road
across from the existing eastern access to Turner Creek Elementary and one full-movement
access on NC 55. Figure 1 provides the study area and site location. All figures are located in
Appendix A.

Although the rezoning application for this proposed development does not meet the Town's peak
hour trip requirements for the submittal of a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR), the applicant
voluntarily requested a TAR be performed due to pending amendments to the Town's Land
Development Ordinance (LDO). This property is located in the Base Transportation Zone
identified in the Town's LDO (Section 7.11.6). The projected build-out year for this development
is 2015. This TAR analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed residential development on the
adjacent roadways and offers potential mitigation for those impacts. The site plan is shown in
Figure 2.

The intersections are analyzed with the traffic analysis program, Synchro. The study area for this
TAR includes the following intersections (the Synchro intersection number is provided before the
intersection name):
     ·   2075 ­ NC 55 and Parkscene Lane/Shopping Center Access
     ·   2241 ­ NC 55 and Turner Creek Road/Lewey Drive
     ·   9001 ­ Turner Creek Road and School Access/Proposed Access 1 (unsignalized)
     ·   9002 ­ NC 55 and Proposed Access 2 (Combined and Combined Improved scenarios
         only)

Existing signal plans and signal timing plans were obtained from NCDOT and the Town of Cary,
as available and used in the analysis. They are located in Appendix B.

     1.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.

   1.1.1. NC 55
   NC 55 is a major north-south highway that, in the vicinity of the project, runs from the City
   of Durham through northwestern Wake County and into Harnett County. NC 55 provides
   access to multiple major roadways in southwestern Wake County, including I-40, US 64,
   US 1 and NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway/Triangle Expressway). The typical section of
   NC 55 within the study area limits is a five-lane roadway that includes a two-way left-turn
   lane. In the study area, NC 55 has a posted speed limit of 50 mph. NC 55 had a 2011
   average annual daily traffic (AADT) of 30,000 vehicles per day just north of the study area
   and 34,000 vehicles per day just south of the study area (based on 2011 NCDOT traffic
   volume GIS data).

   1.1.2. TURNER CREEK ROAD (SR 1609)
   Turner Creek Road is an east-west roadway serving Turner Creek Elementary School
   and residential properties that begins at NC 55 in the study area and comes to an end
   approximately 3,300 feet to the west. The typical section of Turner Creek Road within the
   study limits is a two-lane, undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 mph;
   however; the speed limit drops to 25 mph in the school zone on school days during the
   arrival and dismissal times of the school.

   1.1.3. LEWEY DRIVE (SR 1610)
   Lewey Drive is an east-west roadway that begins at NC 55 in the study area and comes
   to an end at Park York Lane to the east. The typical section of Lewey Drive within the
   study limits is a two-lane, undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 25 mph. Lewey
   Drive provides access to primarily residential development to the east of its intersection
   with NC 55.

   1.1.4. PARKSCENE LANE
   Parkscene Lane is generally a north-south loop roadway that intersects NC 55 in two
   locations within the study area. The typical section of Parkscene Lane is a two-lane
   undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 25 mph. Parkscene Lane provides
   access to retail and residential development to the east of NC 55 in the study area.

1.2.       Existing Intersections
All intersections within the study area that were analyzed are listed in Section 1 of this report.
All intersections are within the Town Limits of Cary or within the Town of Cary's Planning
Jurisdiction. Intersection laneage along with intersection operation controls such as signals
or stop signs are provided in Figure 3.

1.3.       Turning Movement Counts
Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
January 2013 and February 2013 for all intersections. Turner Creek Elementary School was
in session when the counts were taken. The count data is located in Appendix C. These

                                                                                   13-TAR-370
                                                                                        FINAL


counts were taken to provide current volumes and assist in determining the directional splits
of existing traffic. The count volumes were balanced in areas where appropriate and grown
two years at the determined growth rate (discussed in Section 3.1) to estimate 2015 volumes.
Typically, volumes are balanced between intersections so that the volume exiting an
intersection matches the volume entering the adjacent intersection. This balancing is
performed if there are no driveways, intersecting roadways, or other reasonable points for
vehicles to enter or exit the roadway which would result in an imbalance of traffic between
intersections. It should be noted that the AM peak hour volumes were not balanced between
the NC 55 and Turner Creek Road/Lewey Drive intersection and the Turner Creek Road and
School Access intersection. Although no driveways are located between these two
intersections on Turner Creek Road, the turning movement counts indicate that the peak AM
traffic periods for each of these intersections begin at different times. This reflects the unique
characteristics exhibited at these locations, with one intersection servicing mainly school
traffic and the other servicing mainly commuter traffic on NC 55. Balancing the volumes
between these two intersections in the AM peak hour would result in significant changes to
the turning movement volumes and would therefore not provide an accurate analysis of
existing traffic operations. After discussions with Town of Cary staff, it was agreed that this
TAR would provide analysis of both intersections during their respective AM peak hour
without balancing between the two.

The 2013 volumes that were used in the existing year analyses are shown on Figure 4 and
the volume calculations are located in Appendix D. The following table, Table 1, lists the
time and location where counts were conducted.

1.4. Level of Service Criteria for Stop-controlled and Signalized
     Intersections
Intersection level of service is based on average control delay. Control delay as described in
the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual, is the delay brought about by a traffic control device.
Control delay includes the delay due to slowing in advance of the intersection, time stopped

at the intersection, time spent as vehicles move-up within the intersection queue, and time
needed to accelerate back to desired speed.

Exhibit 18-4 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
signalized intersections. The criteria for level of service of a signalized intersection are
provided in Table 2 below.

Exhibit 19-1 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are provided in Table 3 below.

While this project does not fall within the requirements of the Town's ordinance relating to
traffic studies, the typical TAR process was still followed regarding analysis and mitigation
procedures. The proposed Herndon Tract Development is located within the Town of Cary's
Base Zone which is described in Section 7.11.6 of the LDO. For areas located within the
Base Zone, the level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are based
on achieving a LOS D or better for all intersections located within the study area (measured
                                             4

                                                                                      FINAL


overall for signalized intersections and by movement for unsignalized intersections) currently
operating at LOS D or better or not increasing delay (overall intersection delay for signalized
and movement for unsignalized) for those intersections/movements having a level of service
worse than LOS D without the development in the build-out year.

1.5.       Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. The following Synchro coding
assumptions were made for existing conditions and are included in all future analyses unless
otherwise noted:

   ·   The peak hour factors for all movements at the Turner Creek Road and School
       Access intersection were adjusted for the AM peak period based upon the peaking
       characteristics shown in the peak hour counts. A minimum peak hour factor of 0.50
       was maintained based on guidelines from NCDOT's Municipal School Transportation
       Assistance (MSTA) group. Therefore, the peak hour factors from the AM peak period
       counts were used for the school driveway unless that value fell below 0.50 in which
       case a minimum of 0.50 was used. The standard default value of 0.90 was used for
       the PM peak period.
   ·   The link speeds on Turner Creek Road were coded as 25 mph in the AM peak period
       only, to correspond with the speed limit posted for the school zone.
   ·   The site trip distribution for the proposed development resulted in several movements
       at proposed Site Access 1 having a volume of zero in the Combined (2015)
       conditions. In order to ensure that the total volumes into and out of the site matched
       the calculated site trip volumes, these movements were left at zero, rather than
       increased to the NCDOT Congestion Management Guidelines default value of four
       vehicles.
   ·   Since signal timings on NC 55 are developed to progress traffic along NC 55 in the
       peak hours, existing signal timings and offsets were maintained for each analysis
       scenario.

For signalized intersections, levels of service and delay were reported for the signal as a
whole. Levels of service and delay were reported for each yielding movement at the
unsignalized intersections. The summary of the findings are located in Tables 4a and 4b
below.

     better than the level of service criteria of LOS D for the Base Transportation Zone. The 2013
     Existing analysis results are located in Appendix E.



2.      BACKGROUND (2015) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information, developing land uses in the area, and information
     from adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth rate of 2% was assumed for the
     study area. The selection of this growth rate also took into consideration the fact that
     Triangle Expressway is now open in this area. The annual 2% growth rate was applied to the
     existing 2013 volumes to determine the projected 2015 volumes for the Background (2015)
     analysis. Based on information provided by the Town of Cary, Town of Apex, and Wake
     County, there are no approved developments nearby that would need to be accounted for in
     background traffic calculations. The 2015 background traffic volumes are shown in Figure 5.

     2.2.       Level of Service Analysis
     Level of service analyses were conducted for all three of the study area intersections for the
     Background (2015) AM and PM peak hours. The Background (2015) volumes are based on
     the methodology described in Section 3.1 and the resulting volumes are provided in Figure 5.

     This analysis will be used as the base case to estimate the effects on traffic operations due to
     the Herndon Tract Development and if mitigation is required based on the Town's
     requirements.

     The summary of the level of service analysis for the Background (2015) conditions is reported
     in Tables 5a and 5b.

     As in the 2013 Existing Analysis, the Background (2015) analysis indicates that all
     intersections operate better than the level of service criteria of LOS D for the Base
     Transportation Zone. The Background (2015) analyses are located in Appendix F.



3.      COMBINED (2015) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Zone and therefore recommendations will be based on a level of service standard of "D". The
Herndon Tract Development is proposed to consist of 68 single family homes. The site plan
proposes to provide one full-movement access on Turner Creek Road at the existing eastern
Turner Creek Elementary School Access, adding a fourth leg to this intersection. The site plan
also proposes to provide one full-movement access on NC 55, approximately 1,200 feet north of
the Turner Creek Road/Lewey Drive intersection.

3.1.       Trip Generation
Trip generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to
determine the number of trips the site would generate. The trip generation summary is
shown in Table 6.

3.2.       Trip Distribution
As previously mentioned, access to the development is proposed to be provided via one full-
movement driveway on Turner Creek Road and one full-movement driveway on NC 55. The
proposed access on Turner Creek Road will add a fourth leg to this existing three-leg
intersection. Trip distribution was estimated based on count data from nearby intersections
and from knowledge of local trip attractions and destinations in the area. The site distribution
percentages are shown on Figures 6.1 and 6.2 and the site trips are shown on Figure 7.
The trip generation and distribution calculations are located in Appendix D.

3.3.       Combined (2015) Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2015) scenario consists of the background volumes as discussed in Section
2 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed Herndon Property Rezoning
residential development. The volumes that are used in the Combined (2015) analysis are
shown in Figure 8. The laneage and traffic control used for the Combined (2015) scenario
are based on the existing conditions shown in Figure 3. Both access driveways shown on
the site plan in Figure 2 were analyzed under stop control and the laneage was taken from
the proposed site plan. Since NC 55 has a two-way left-turn lane in this area, a 100-foot
northbound left-turn lane was assumed for the NC 55 and Proposed Access 2 intersection for
the purposes of this analysis.

Level of service analyses were performed for all existing intersections as well as the
Proposed Access 2 intersection with NC 55. A summary of the levels of service analysis is
found in Tables 7a and 7b below.

   As seen in Table 7a, both signalized intersections in the Combined (2015) scenario operate
   better than LOS D in the AM and PM peak periods. Both signalized intersections experience
   no change in level of service and very little change in delay when compared to the
   Background (2015) conditions. As seen in Table 7b, one movement at each of the
   unsignalized intersections operates below the LOS D threshold for the Base Transportation
   Zone. The shared southbound left, through and right-turn movement at the unsignalized
   intersection of Turner Creek Road and School Access/Proposed Site Access 1 operates at
   LOS E in the AM peak period of the Combined (2015) conditions. The shared eastbound left
   and right-turn movement at the intersection of NC 55 and Proposed Access 2 operates at
   LOS E in the PM peak period of the Combined (2015) conditions. Because these
   unsignalized intersections have movements that operate below the LOS D threshold for the
   Base Transportation Zone, potential improvements were developed and analyzed to
   determine if geometric improvements or signalization may be practical mitigations. Potential

mitigations are evaluated and described in Section 3.4. The Combined (2015) analyses are
located in Appendix G.

The following provides the results of the 2015 Combined analysis and how they relate to the
LOS D threshold.

NC 55 and Parkscene Lane/Shopping Center Access
Because this intersection is outside the minimum one-half mile study limit required for
development in the Base Transportation Zone, the 7% rule was checked to determine if it
should be included in the study area for analysis. If projected site traffic is anticipated to
exceed 7% of the total traffic on any movement, it is generally included in the study area and
mitigation requirements to meet level of service thresholds are applied to that intersection.
According to the proposed site trip distribution and estimated 2015 volumes, this intersection
does not meet the 7% rule and no additional analysis or review for mitigations were
conducted. The calculations to determine if the 7% rule applied are provided in Appendix D.

NC 55 and Turner Creek Road/Lewey Drive
This intersection operates at LOS B in both the AM and PM peak periods. Therefore, this
intersection does not require improvements to mitigate site traffic.

Turner Creek Road and School Access/Proposed Site Access 1
This intersection has one movement, the shared southbound left, through and right turn,
operating at LOS E in the AM peak period. This approach serves as a site exit for the
proposed development, and based on the LOS D mitigation criteria stated above, no
movements should operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base Transportation Zone.
Therefore, mitigation should be considered at this intersection in order to meet the LOS D
threshold.

NC 55 and Proposed Site Access 2
This intersection has one movement, the shared eastbound left and right-turn, operating at
LOS E in the PM peak period. This intersection is a new unsignalized intersection proposed
by the development. Based on the LOS D mitigation criteria stated above, no movements
should operate below the LOS D threshold for the Base Transportation Zone; therefore,
mitigation should be considered at this intersection in order to meet the LOS D threshold.

3.4.       Combined (2015) Improved Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2015) Improved scenario consists of improvements identified as mitigations
that are proposed in order to meet the LOS D threshold or show no increase in overall
intersection/movement delay if the intersection/movement operates below LOS D in the
background condition as noted in Section 4.3. As noted in Section 4.3, two unsignalized
intersections meet these criteria in the Combined (2015) conditions. The intersections for
which mitigations were evaluated are discussed below.

Intersection of Turner Creek Road and School Access/Proposed Access 1
The shared southbound left, through and right-turn movement at this intersection operates at
LOS E in the AM peak period and has an estimated 95th percentile queue length of 24 feet
(approximately the length of one vehicle). This approach serves as an egress for the
proposed development. In an effort to mitigate the impacts of site traffic and to improve the
LOS E operations, the following mitigations were evaluated:

   ·   Provide an exclusive southbound left-turn and a shared through and right-turn lane ­
       With this improvement, the left-turn movement still operates at LOS E in the AM peak
       period with an estimated 95th percentile queue length of 23 feet.

   ·   Provide an exclusive westbound right-turn lane ­ With this improvement, operations
       for the southbound movement remains at LOS E.

   ·   Provide a traffic signal ­ When considering installation of a traffic signal, up to 9
       warrants are evaluated based on guidance provided in the Manual on Uniform Traffic
       Control Devices (MUTCD). The peak hour warrant evaluates traffic at the intersection
       during the peak hours (in this case the AM and PM peak hour) of the day. If this
       warrant is not met, it is not likely that the other volume-based warrants would be met.
       For this intersection, a peak hour signal warrant analysis was performed and is
       located in Appendix H. Based on that analysis, the peak hour signal warrant is not
       met and therefore a traffic signal would likely not be warranted or installed.

After investigating potential mitigation, it was determined that no reasonable geometric
improvements would improve the shared southbound left, through and right-turn movement
enough to reach LOS D. While this is not desirable, the movement operating at LOS E at this
intersection only affects vehicles exiting the site and not level of service along the adjacent
roadway (Turner Creek Road). Additionally, a key factor affecting the southbound operations
of this intersection is the volume of traffic associated with Turner Creek Road Elementary
School which conflicts with the southbound left-turn movement. Based on the typical traffic
operations at schools, it is anticipated that the heaviest volume on the northbound approach
(school driveway) will occur during a 30 minute period that coincides with the beginning and
end of the school day. Based on the current bell schedule for Turner Creek Elementary
School (9:15 AM ­ 3:15 PM) and the peak hour of the adjacent NC 55 intersection which
serves commuter traffic, the peak of the school traffic on the northbound approach may not
occur during the same hour as the residential site traffic on the southbound approach. If this
is actually the case, the operations of this intersection may be better than shown in the
analysis results; however, it should be noted that school bell schedules are subject to
change. Based on the evaluation of potential mitigations described above, the estimated
length of 95th percentile queue, and the fact that it is not unusual for low volume driveways to
have movement operating below LOS D, no modifications are suggested at this intersection
to mitigate site traffic at this time.

Additionally, it should be noted that Turner Creek Road is a state-maintained facility.
Therefore, this intersection will be subject to NCDOT review and approval.

Intersection of NC 55 and Proposed Access 2
The shared eastbound left and right-turn movement at this intersection operates at LOS E in
the PM peak period and has an estimated 95th percentile queue length of 5 feet (less than the
length of one vehicle). This approach serves as one egress for the proposed development
and, in an effort to mitigate the impacts of site traffic, the following mitigations were evaluated:

   ·   Provide exclusive eastbound left-turn and right-turn lanes ­ With this improvement,
       the right-turn movement is improved, but the left-turn movement degrades to a LOS F
       in the PM peak period.

   ·   Provide an exclusive southbound right-turn lane ­ With this improvement, operations
       on the eastbound movement remain at LOS E.

   ·   Restrict access to right-in/right-out operations ­ With this restriction, the level of
       service would be improved, but since the southern intersection of NC 55 and Turner
       Creek Road/Lewey Drive is not designed to accommodate southbound U-turns, the
       vehicles wishing to make a left-turn (the movement in question) are anticipated to exit
       the site at proposed Access 1. As described above, the site egress at Proposed
       Access 1 operates at LOS E in the AM peak period, which is expected to worsen with
       the addition of traffic due to the restriction at Proposed Access 2. However, it should
       be noted that the peak period in which the shared eastbound left and right-turn
       movement at this intersection operates at LOS E is not the same peak period that the
       shared southbound left and right-turn at Turner Creek Road and School
       Access/Proposed Access 1 operates at LOS E. Given this, these eastbound left-
       turning vehicles at Proposed Access 2 have the option to relocate to Proposed
       Access 1, with a better level of service, to access the signal at NC 55 and Turner
       Creek Road/Lewey Drive to make their desired maneuver.

   ·   Provide a traffic signal ­ When considering installation of a traffic signal, up to 9
       warrants are evaluated based on guidance provided in the Manual on Uniform Traffic
       Control Devices (MUTCD). The peak hour warrant evaluates traffic at the intersection
       during the peak hours (in this case the AM and PM peak hour) of the day. If this
       warrant is not met, it is not likely that the other volume-based warrants would be met.
       For this intersection, a peak hour signal warrant analysis was performed and is
       located in Appendix H. Based on that analysis, the peak hour signal warrant is not
       met and therefore a traffic signal would likely not be warranted or installed.

After investigating potential mitigation, it was determined that only one geometric
improvement, restricting the eastbound movement to right-in/right-out access, would improve
the eastbound approach to operate at LOS D. However, this improvement was not
suggested due to its potential negative impacts on Proposed Site Access 1 and the fact that

 there is expected to be less than 5 feet of average queue during the peak hour. While LOS E
 operations are not desirable, the movement operation of LOS E at this intersection only
 affects the level of service for vehicles exiting the site and not the level of service for the
 adjacent roadway (NC 55). Also, it is not uncommon for low volume driveways to have
 exiting movements operating at LOS E or F during the peak periods even though the queues
 are minimal and short-lived. Based on the evaluation of potential mitigations described
 above, the estimated length of 95th percentile queue, the fact it is not unusual for low volume
 driveways to have movement operating below LOS D, no modifications are suggested at this
 intersection to mitigate site traffic at this time.

 Additionally, it should be noted that NC 55 is a state-maintained facility. Therefore, this
 intersection will be subject to NCDOT review and approval.



4. CONCLUSIONS
 Based on analysis and the review of the Town's LDO and Long Range Transportation Plan,
 no improvements are proposed to mitigate the impact of site traffic for the Herndon Tract
 Rezoning residential development. The proposed build laneage in 2015 for the proposed
 development is shown on Figure 9.

Note: The highest trip generator was selected for land uses not specifically known and is highlighted in
Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, Phase 4-A includes a gas station with 14 fueling positions along with a
6,558 square foot convenience store and 10,000 square feet of either retail or office space.
Phase 4-B will include 4,000 square foot fast food restaurant with a drive-thru or a 150 room
hotel, or 15,000 square feet of retail, 12,000 square feet of retail space, a 56,000 square foot
supermarket, 20,000 square feet of office or retail space, 10,000 square feet of office or retail
space and 8,000 square feet of office or retail space. The site (Phases 4A and 4B combined) is
proposed to have a total of five access driveways. Phase 4-A proposes to have one full-
movement access on Kit Creek Road across from Black Gate Drive, one right-in/right-out access
on Kit Creek Road between Black Gate Drive and NC 55 and one right-in/right-out access on NC
55 just south of Kit Creek Road. Phase 4-B proposes to have one right-in/right-out access on
Green Level Church Road between Cartecay Drive and Kit Creek Road and one right-in/right-out
access on NC 55 just south of the right-in/right-out access provided with Phase 4-A. Figure ES-
1 shows the study area for 12-TAR-344 while Figure ES-2 provides the site plan.

Background Information
The development will generate more than the Town's 50 peak hour trip threshold (Land
Development Ordinance, section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report
(TAR). This property is also located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation
Zone" as identified in the APFO. The projected build-out years for Phases 4-A and 4-B are 2013

and 2014, respectively. This TAR analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed development
on the adjacent roadways and offers potential mitigation for those impacts associated with each
phase based on the Town of Cary's LDO.

Existing (2012) Analysis
The existing laneage network and the balanced counts that were collected were input into
Synchro Version 7 and analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. All signalized
intersections operate at LOS D or better, measured overall, except the Kit Creek Road and
O'Kelly Chapel Road intersections with NC 55, which operate at LOS F in the PM peak hour.
The eastbound and westbound approaches of the unsignalized Green Level Church Road and
NC 55 intersection operate at LOS F. The northbound approach of the Green Level Church
Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road eastern intersection also operates at LOS F. All other
movements at unsignalized intersections operate at LOS D or better.

Background (2013) Analysis
Future traffic estimates were made based on applying a 2% average annual growth rate (AAGR)
to the 2012 counts. Also, traffic from the following approved developments was considered and
incorporated as appropriate:
   ·   07-TAR-225 ­ Parkside Town Commons
   ·   09-TAR-149A ­ Cameron Pond Amendment
   ·   09-TAR-314 ­ Pittard Sears Age-Restricted Community
   ·   10-TAR-317 ­ Stonewater PUD Amendment
   ·   10-TAR-320 ­ Wake Memorial Park
   ·   11-TAR-323 ­ Highcroft Village Phases 4 & 5
   ·   11-TAR-325 ­ Pulte Homes (Carpenter Property)
   ·   11-TAR-326 ­ Amberly Town Center Townhomes Phases 1 & 2
   ·   11-TAR-332 ­ Alston Town Center

Phase 4A Recommendations

Analysis of one intersection, Kit Creek Road and Black Gate Drive/Site Access 2, was performed
under a different configuration than shown on the site plan. Based on information from the Town
of Cary, maintenance of Kit Creek Road is to be taken over by NCDOT at a future date. As part
of the CTP, Kit Creek Road is to be widened to a four-lane divided facility which is proposed as
part of Phase 4-A. The intersection of Kit Creek Road and Black Gate Drive/Access 2 does not
meet NCDOT's median spacing guidelines for a full movement median opening. Therefore, this
intersection was evaluated with a right-in/right-out with left-over configuration. Under this
configuration, all movements operate at LOS B or better and no mitigation is required.

The Combined (2013) Improved scenario consists of improvements shown on the site plan
(Figure ES-2) as well as additional improvements that are recommended in order to meet the
LOS D threshold or show no increase in overall intersection delay if the intersection operates
below LOS D in the background condition. The intersections requiring additional improvements
are listed below, along with the recommended improvements.

                                                                                      FINAL


Intersection of NC 55 and Kit Creek Road:
Based on the Town of Cary Official Town Limit Map (amended April 19, 2012) and
discussions with Town of Cary Planning staff, it appears that the westbound approach of Kit
Creek Road falls outside the Town of Cary limits and ETJ. However, recommendations were
made based on meeting the requirements of the APFO.

This intersection operates below the LOS D threshold in the PM peak of the 2013
Background scenario and experiences an increase in delay in the PM peak of the 2013
Combined scenario. The westbound left-turn experiences considerable delay and processes
over 700 vehicles in the existing peak hour. This movement meets multiple NCDOT criteria
for protected phasing. The site traffic contributes additional conflicting movements for the
westbound left-turn. After discussions with the Town of Cary's signal system staff, this
movement is recommended for protected plus permitted phasing. To meet the APFO, the
following mitigations were provided:

   ·   Provide a 400' eastbound left-turn lane with appropriate taper
   ·   Provide protected plus permitted phasing for the westbound left-turn (note Town of
       Cary signal system staff recommends this be done with a flashing yellow arrow design
       for consistency in the area)
   ·   Provide overlap northbound right-turn phase to coincide with the westbound protected
       left-turn phase.

With these mitigations, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS E, in
the PM peak period and with less intersection delay than experienced in the 2013
Background scenario.

Intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road:
NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road operates at LOS F in the PM Peak period. The results
provided in Table 8a, above, indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in delay
when compared to the background analyses. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the Land
Development Ordinance (LDO), no increase in delay time is allowed for signalized
intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit
Transportation Zone. Therefore, the following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's
APFO:

   ·   Provide a 250' southbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper

With these mitigations, the intersection still operates at LOS F in the PM peak period but with
less intersection delay than experienced in the 2013 Background scenario. As previously
mentioned, with the addition of site traffic the overall intersection delay increases. Even with
signal timing optimization, the delay exceeds the delay in the No Build condition for the PM
peak period; therefore, additional capacity was required to meet the APFO. Multiple
improvements were considered; however, given the provision of turn lanes for most

                                                                                    FINAL


movements in the No Build conditions, this mitigation is recommended to provide an overall
decrease in delay when compared to the background analyses and as an effort to minimize
impacts.

Intersection of O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road:
Based upon the Town's 7% rule and 1% rule, mitigation is required to meet the Town's
APFO. The CTP identifies the need for realignment of this intersection and several TARs
have previously recommended realigning and signalizing this intersection, but to our
knowledge, no funding has been made available. Given that, the recommended mitigation is
that the existing offset intersection of Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road be
realigned to form a single four-leg intersection in order to meet APFO requirements. A signal
warrant analysis was performed for this intersection (warrant analysis located in Appendix I).
Based on that the warrant analysis, the intersection will meet the peak hour signal warrants.
While meeting one signal warrant does not guarantee the installation of a signal, the
intersection was analyzed as a signalized intersection in the Combined and Improved
conditions which resulted in acceptable level of service operations. The recommended
laneage at this intersection to meet the APFO is as follows:

   ·   Northbound ­ One shared left-turn, through and right-turn lane
   ·   Southbound ­ One left-turn lane with 325 feet of full storage and appropriate taper,
       one through lane, and one full right-turn lane
   ·   Eastbound ­ One left-turn lane with 100 feet of full storage and appropriate taper and
       one shared through and right-turn lane
   ·   Westbound ­ One left-turn lane with 450 feet of full storage with appropriate taper and
       one shared through and right-turn lane. This movement was analyzed under
       protected conditions

Intersection of NC 55 and Alston Village Lane:
The northbound left-turn level of service reduces to LOS E in the 2013 Combined conditions.
A delay study was performed at the intersection of NC 55 and Alston Village Lane. This
study was conducted from 4:47 ­ 5:12 PM (which corresponded with the peak hour of the
intersection from the traffic counts) on Thursday, May 24, 2012. This study identifies the
average time in queue for northbound left-turning vehicles as 9.38 seconds. Based on the
delay methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual, this value should be adjusted
by a factor of 0.9 (recommended adjustment value for field delay studies), then increased by
9 seconds (based on free flow speed of the facility and vehicles in the queue) to account for
delay due to deceleration. Using this guidance, the field data would equate to a calculated
delay of 17.4 seconds per vehicle.

The Synchro-calculated delay for this movement in the 2012 PM Existing analysis was 30.4
seconds per vehicle. This value is approximately 13 seconds per vehicle higher than the
comparable field value. The 2013 PM Combined scenario delay at this location was 45.4
seconds per vehicle (based on the Synchro analysis), resulting in LOS E. Based on the
comparison of field data to analysis data in 2012, it would seem reasonable to assume that

                                                                                    12-TAR-344
                                                                                        FINAL


   the 2013 delay should be adjusted by approximately 13 seconds, yielding a delay of 32.4
   seconds per vehicle. This value falls below the threshold for LOS E (35 seconds per vehicle),
   resulting in LOS D. As such, it is believed that the operation for the northbound left-turning
   movement in the 2013 Combined scenario will be comparable to LOS D conditions.
   Therefore, no mitigation is recommended for this intersection. The delay study is located in
   Appendix M.

   Intersection of NC 55 and Green Level Church Road:
   This intersection has movements operating at LOS F 2013 Background conditions and these
   movements experience an increase in delay in the 2013 Combined conditions. A peak hour
   signal warrant analysis was performed and is included in Appendix I which indicates this
   intersection will meet peak hour warrants in the 2013 Combined scenario. While meeting one
   signal warrant does not guarantee the installation of a signal, the intersection was analyzed
   as a two-phase signalized intersection in the Combined and Improved conditions which
   resulted in acceptable level of service operations. As previously mentioned, this intersection
   is located in Durham County and therefore is not within the Town of Cary's ETJ; however, to
   meet the APFO requirements a signal was provided at this intersection.

   The recommended mitigation is shown in Figure ES-3.


Phase 4B Recommendations:

The Combined (2014) Improved scenario consists of improvements shown on the site plan
(Figure ES-2), mitigation from Phase 4A (Figure ES-3), and additional improvements that are
recommended in order to meet the intersection LOS D threshold or show no increase in delay for
intersections already operating below LOS D as noted in Section 6.3. The intersections requiring
additional improvements are listed below, along with the recommended improvements.

   Intersection of NC 55 and Kit Creek Road:
   This intersection operates at LOS F in the 2014 PM Background conditions and experiences
   an increase in delay in the 2014 Combined condition. To mitigate the increases in delay the
   proposed mitigation is the following:

       ·   Provide an additional eastbound left-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and appropriate
           taper operating under protected only phasing (the 200-foot requirement is based on
           the allowable distance to the existing at-grade rail crossing on Kit Creek Road).
       ·   Provide protected plus permitted phasing for the westbound left-turn. This was
           discussed with the Town of Cary's signal system staff and they recommended when
           installed a flashing arrow design be used.

   With these mitigations, the intersection will operate at LOS F however the overall intersection
   delay is reduced by over 50 seconds per vehicle.

                                                                                    FINAL



Intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road:
This intersection operates at LOS F in the 2014 PM peak Background conditions and
experiences an increase in intersection delay in the 2014 Combined condition. To mitigate
the increase in delay, the following is proposed:

   ·   Provide dual northbound left-turn lanes with 700 feet of storage and appropriate taper
       and 1,000 feet of receiving lanes.

With these mitigations, the intersection will operate at operate at LOS F however the overall
intersection delay is reduced by approximately 25 seconds per vehicle.

Intersection of Kit Creek Road and Black Gate Drive/Site Access 2:
While no mitigation is required based on the APFO, since Kit Creek Road is planned to be
maintained by NCDOT in the future, the NCDOT nomograph criteria was evaluated. Based
on those criteria the following is the minimum required based on the nomograph:

   ·   Provide an eastbound right-turn lane with 50 feet of storage and appropriate taper.

Green Level Church Road and Cartecay Drive/School Entrance:
This intersection has one movement, the westbound shared left-turn, through, and right-turn
operating at LOS F in the 2014 AM Combined conditions. This movement operates at LOS D
in the 2014 AM Background conditions. A delay study was performed at the intersection of
Green Level Church Road and Cartecay / school drive. This study was conducted from 8:00
­ 9:10 AM (which corresponded with the peak hour of the intersection from the previous
count) on Tuesday, May 15th. This study identifies the average time in queue for vehicles on
the westbound approach as 9.6 seconds. Based on the delay methodology described in the
Highway Capacity Manual, this value should be adjusted by a factor of 0.9 (recommended
adjustment value for field delay studies), then increased by 5 seconds (based on free flow
speed of the facility and vehicles in the queue) to account for delay due to deceleration.
Using this guidance, the field data would equate to a calculated delay of 13.7 seconds per
vehicle.

The Synchro-calculated delay for this movement in the 2012 AM Existing analysis was 22.4
seconds per vehicle. This value was about 8.8 seconds per vehicle higher than the
comparable field value. The 2014 AM Combined scenario delay at this location was 76.1
seconds per vehicle (based on the analysis), resulting in LOS F. The reduction based upon
the delay study does not result in acceptable operations, therefore other mitigation warranted
investigation. Additional turn lanes on the westbound approach were evaluated but their
provision did not improve the operations to LOS D.

A signal warrant analysis was performed for this intersection and is located in Appendix L.
The signal warrant analysis indicates this intersection will meet peak hour warrants in the
2014 Combined scenario. While meeting one signal warrant does not guarantee the
                                          ES-7

                                                                                       FINAL


   installation of a signal, the intersection was analyzed as a signalized intersection in the
   Combined and Improved conditions. As a two-phase signalized signal, this intersection will
   operate at LOS B which meets the requirement of the APFO.

   NC 55 and Alston Village Lane:
   Even with adjustments based upon the delay study the northbound left-turn operates at LOS
   E with an increase in delay form the 2014 PM Background conditions to the 2014 PM
   Combined improvements. No increase in laneage will improve the operation of the
   northbound left-turn lane and could actually worsen operations. A signal warrant was
   performed and this intersection did not meet the peak hour warrant. This is located in
   Appendix L. Given this information no additional mitigation is recommend for this leftover:

   NC 55 and Site Access 4:
   This intersection does not require mitigation to meet the APFO requirements, however since
   NC 55 is a NCDOT, facility the NCDOT nomograph criteria was checked. The following is the
   minimum required mitigation based on the nomograph:

           Provide a southbound right-turn lane with 100 feet of storage and appropriate taper.

   NC 55 and Site Access 5:
   This intersection does not require mitigation to meet the APFO requirements, however since
   NC 55 is a NCDOT facility the nomograph criteria was checked. The following is the
   minimum required mitigation based on the nomograph:

           Provide a southbound right-turn lane with 200 feet of storage and appropriate taper.

   Green Level Road and Site Access 1:
   This intersection does not require mitigation to meet the APFO requirements; however since
   Green Level Road is a NCDOT facility, the nomograph criteria was checked. The following is
   the minimum required mitigation based on the nomograph:

           Provide a northbound right-turn lane with 100 feet of storage and appropriate taper.

The recommended mitigation is shown in Figure ES-4.

1.     INTRODUCTION
A new development, an update to the Village at the Park PUD, is proposed in western Cary in the
southwest corner of the intersection of NC 55 and Kit Creek Road. Figure 1 provides the study
area and site location. All figures are located in Appendix A. The development is proposed to
be constructed in two phases (Phase 4-A and Phase 4-B) and includes the following land uses
listed in Table 1:

Table 1: Land Use Summary
                                              Phase 4-A
 Convenience Market with Gas Pumps                             14 fueling positions
 Retail or Office                                              10,000 square feet
                                         Phase 4-B
 Fast Food Restaurant with Drive-Thru or Hotel or Retail       4,000 square feet or 150 rooms or
                                                               15,000 square feet
 Retail                                                        12,000 square feet
 Supermarket                                                   56,000 square feet
 Retail or Office                                              20,000 square feet
 Retail or Office                                              10,000 square feet
 Retail or Office                                              8,000 square feet
 Note: The highest trip generator was selected for land uses not specifically known and is shown in bold
text in Table 1.

The site (Phases 4-A and 4-B combined) is proposed to have a total of five access driveways.
Phase 4-A is proposed to have one full-movement access on Kit Creek Road across from Black
Gate Drive, one right-in/right-out access on Kit Creek Road between Black Gate Drive and NC 55
and one right-in/right-out access on NC 55 just south of Kit Creek Road. Phase 4-B proposes to
have one right-in/right-out access on Green Level Church Road between Cartecay Drive and Kit
Creek Road and one right-in/right-out access on NC 55 just south of the right-in/right-out access
provided with Phase 4-A. The development will generate more than the Town's 50 peak hour trip
threshold (Land Development Ordinance, section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a Traffic
Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit
Transportation Zone" as indentified in the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO). The
projected build-out years for Phases 4-A and 4-B are 2013 and 2014, respectively. This TAR
analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways and offers
potential mitigation for those impacts associated with each phase. The site plan is shown in
Figure 2.

the City of Durham as available and used in the analysis. They are located in Appendix B.



2.       EXISTING (2012) CONDITIONS
     2.1.       Existing Roadways
     This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.


         2.1.1. NC 55
         NC 55 is a major north-south highway that, in the study area, runs from the City of
         Durham through northwestern Wake County and into Harnett County. NC 55 provides
         access to multiple major roadways in southwestern Wake County, including I-40, NC 540,
         US 64, US 1 and the future Western Wake Expressway toll facility. The typical section of
         NC 55 within the study area limits is a median-divided four-lane roadway. NC 55 had a
         2009 AADT (annual average daily traffic) of 17,000 vehicles per day between Kit Creek
         Road and Green Level Church Road (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).


         2.1.2. GREEN LEVEL CHURCH ROAD (SR 1625)
         Green Level Church Road is a major north-south connector that runs from NC 55 north of
         the proposed development to US 64 in Apex. The typical section of Green Level Church
         Road within the study limits is a two-lane undivided roadway north of Kit Creek Road and
         widens into a four-lane median divided road between Cartecay Drive and O'Kelly Chapel
                                                   2
                                                                            12-TAR-344
                                                                                FINAL


Road, south of the proposed development. The portion of Green Level Church Road to
the south of O'Kelly Chapel Road is a two-lane, undivided roadway that widens to a four-
lane, median divided roadway further south. Green Level Church Road had a 2007
AADT of 1,100 vehicles per day near its intersection with NC 55 (based on the 2007
NCDOT traffic volume map).


2.1.3. KIT CREEK ROAD (SR 1639)
Kit Creek Road is an east-west connector road that runs generally east­west from Church
Street in the Town of Morrisville to just west of Green Level Church Road in the Town of
Cary. The typical section of Kit Creek Road within the study limits is a two-lane,
undivided roadway, but is listed in the Town of Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan
(CTP) as needing a six-lane section east of NC 55 in the future (requirement listed in
2035 horizon year). The CTP also lists the extension of Kit Creek Road from its current
terminus west of Green Level Church Road to Wake Road as a future project. Based on
our knowledge, there are no current plans to construct these projects by the 2014 final
build-out year of the Village at the Park PUD. Currently, Kit Creek Road is maintained by
the NCDOT east of NC 55 and by the Town of Cary west of NC 55. Based on
conversations with the Town of Cary, it is anticipated that the NCDOT will take over
maintenance of the western portion of Kit Creek Road at some point in the future. Kit
Creek Road had a 2007 AADT of 790 vehicles per day just east of its intersection with NC
55 (based on the 2007 NCDOT traffic volume map).


2.1.4. O'KELLY CHAPEL ROAD (SR 1628)
O'Kelly Chapel Road is an east-west connector road that runs from NC 751 in Chatham
County to NC 55 in northwestern Wake County. The typical section within the study limits
is a two-lane, undivided roadway. O'Kelly Chapel Road serves developments to the west
of NC 55 and south of the study limits. O'Kelly Chapel Road had a 2009 AADT of 5,300
vehicles per day between NC 55 and Green Level Church Road (based on the 2009
NCDOT traffic volume map).


2.1.5. LOUIS STEPHENS DRIVE (SR 2153)
Louis Stephens Drive is a north-south connector road that runs from T.W. Alexander
Drive in Durham County to Little Drive, just north of NC 540. The typical section of Louis
Stephens Drive within the study limits is a four-lane, median-divided roadway that
narrows down to a two-lane, undivided roadway north and south of its intersection with Kit
Creek Road. Louis Stephens Drive had a 2009 AADT of 3,200 vehicles per day just north
of its intersection with Hopson Road (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).

   2.1.6. HOPSON ROAD (SR 1978)
   Hopson Road is an east-west connector road that runs from NC 55 to NC 54 in Durham
   County. The typical section of Hopson Road within the study limits is a four-lane, median-
   divided roadway that narrows to a two-lane, undivided roadway just east of its intersection
   with Louis Stephens Drive. Hopson Road provides access to the recently completed
   Triangle Expressway that connects NC 540 with the Research Triangle Park (RTP).
   Hopson Road had a 2009 AADT of 5,300 vehicles per day just west of its intersection with
   Davis Drive (based on the 2009 NCDOT traffic volume map).

2.3.       Turning Movement Counts
Peak hour turning movement counts from 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM were conducted in
April, 2012. The count data is located in Appendix C. These counts were taken to provide
current volumes and assist in determining the directional splits of existing traffic. The count
volumes were balanced in areas where appropriate, grown one year to estimate 2013
volumes and grown for two years to estimate 2014 volumes. The volumes that were used in
the analyses are shown on Figure 4 and are also located in Appendix E. The following
table, Table 2, lists the time and location of the counts.

Exhibit 17-2 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 provides the level of service criteria for
stop-controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service of an unsignalized (stop-
controlled) intersection are described in Table 4 below.

         Table 4: Level of Service Criteria for Stop-Controlled Intersections
                    Level of Service Average Control Delay (s/veh)

                            A                       0-10

                            B                     >10-15

                            C                     >15-25

                            D                     >25-35

                            E                     >35-50
                            F                       >50


The proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone which is
described in section 3.23.3 of the Land Development Ordinance. For areas located within the
Base Benefit Zone, the level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this TAR are
based on maintaining a level of service (LOS) D or better for all intersections located within
the study area (measured overall for signalized intersections and by movement for
unsignalized intersections) currently operating at LOS D or better or not increasing delay for
those intersections having a level of service worse than D without the development.


2.5.       Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing laneage network and the balanced counts were input into Synchro Version 7 and
analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. The following Synchro coding
assumptions were made for existing conditions and included in all future analyses unless
otherwise noted:

   ·   Peak Hour Factor (PHF) at Alston Ridge Elementary School entrances (Green Level
       Church Road and Kit Creek Road intersection and Green Level Church Road and
       Cartecay Drive/School Entrance intersection) were coded based on existing traffic
       counts for the AM peak period to account for school traffic peaks. The traffic count
       data can be found in Appendix C.
   ·   Based on information from the Town of Cary and the City of Durham, isolated
       signalized intersections were optimized.
   ·   At the intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road, the existing signal timing was
       maintained until the fourth leg was added in the 2013 Background conditions. Once

                                                                                  12-TAR-344
                                                                                      FINAL


          the fourth leg was added, the existing cycle length was maintained and the splits were
          optimized.
     ·    The lane utilization factor was adjusted based on a 60/40 split for all movements
          where a downstream lane drop occurs within 1,000 feet.

  Levels of service and delay were reported for each yielding movement at unsignalized
  intersections. For signalized intersections, levels of service and delay were reported per
  approach and for the signal as a whole. The summary of the findings are located in Tables
  5a and 5b below. More detailed level of service information is located in Appendix F,

     As shown by Tables 5a and 5b, multiple intersections and movements operate below the
     level of service criteria of LOS D for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. The signalized
     intersections of NC 55 with Kit Creek Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road operate at LOS F in the
     PM peak period while the unsignalized intersections of O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level
     Church Road (east intersection), and NC 55 and Green Level Church Road have movements
     that operate at LOS F in the PM peak period. The 2012 Existing Synchro analysis results are
     located in Appendix F.



3.      BACKGROUND (2013) CONDITIONS
     3.1.       Background Growth and Development
     Based on historical volume information, developing land uses in the area, and information in
     adjacent development TARs, an overall annual growth rate of 2% was assumed for the study
     area. This growth rate was applied to the existing volumes (2012) to determine the projected
     volumes for the Background (2013) analysis. These volumes can be found on Figure 5.
     Additional trips were added to account for known developments that are not yet constructed.
     This trip information was based on TARs provided by the Town of Cary. The additional
     developments are as follows and described in the sections below. The total approved
     development site trips included in 2013 analyses can be found on Figure 6.

3.1.1. 07-TAR-225 ­ PARKSIDE TOWN COMMONS
The TAR that was conducted for Parkside Town Commons had an estimated completion
date of 2009 and proposed a site that consists of 740,000 square feet of shopping center,
230,000 square feet of office space, 350 apartments, and 100 condominiums/townhomes.
However, there has been no construction to date. Based on discussions with Town of
Cary staff, there are ongoing negotiations with the developer and it is possible that the
overall plan of the development may change prior to construction. The development
currently has an approved site plan until 2014. Therefore, site trips shown in the TAR
were accounted for in background trips for this TAR. Based on known information, it was
assumed the development would be 75% complete by 2013 and 100% complete by 2014.
That portion of site trips was used for the 2013 and 2014 analyses, respectively.

A minimal amount of geometric improvements were also assumed to be in place as
mitigation from the Parkside Town Commons development. The following improvements
were assumed to be in place in our 2013 analyses:

   ·   O'Kelly Chapel Road constructed as the fourth leg of the NC 55 and O'Kelly
       Chapel Road intersection.
   ·   Construction of a third northbound through lane on NC 55 across the property
       frontage.
   ·   Construction of an exclusive northbound right-turn lane at the NC 55 and O'Kelly
       Chapel Road intersection.
   ·   Construction of two exclusive left-turn lanes on the westbound approach of O'Kelly
       Chapel Road at NC 55.
   ·   Widening of the eastbound approach of O'Kelly Chapel Road to add an exclusive
       through lane at NC 55.

Additional site driveways on NC 55 proposed in the Parkside Town Commons TAR were
not assumed to be in place in the analysis for the Village at the Park PUD. In order to
maintain traffic volumes along NC 55, a portion of the Parkside development was coded
in Synchro as a right-turn lane drop. This location was coded solely to adjust for Parkside
development site trips and was not analyzed.


3.1.2. 09-TAR-149A ­ CAMERON POND AMENDMENT
The Cameron Pond TAR was conducted for the proposed expansion of the Cameron
Pond residential development located on Carpenter Fire Station Road. The TAR states
that the expansion would be fully complete by 2011 and would consist of 15 new single-
family homes and an additional access to Carpenter Fire Station Road. The proposed
improvements were not observed during a field investigation for this TAR and Kevin Hales

with the Town of Cary planning department confirmed that this has not moved forward to
date. However, given the possibility that the development may be in place by the 2013
background year, we included these site trips in our analysis. While there were no
common intersections between the Cameron Pond TAR and this TAR, site traffic volumes
at the intersection of NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road were incorporated based on
previous count data. The trips routed to/from the north on NC 55 were distributed through
the Village at the Park network as through trips on NC 55.


3.1.3. 09-TAR-314 ­ PITTARD SEARS AGE-RESTRICTED COMMUNITY
The Pittard Sears TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development on Pittard
Sears Road, near its intersection with O'Kelly Chapel Road. The TAR states that the
development will consist of 166 units and be complete by 2013. While there were no
common intersections between the Pittard Sears TAR and this TAR, 65% of the site trips
for the Pittard Sears development are proposed to enter/exit the development to/from the
east on O'Kelly Chapel Road. Therefore, the site traffic from this development will be
added to O'Kelly Chapel Road in this analysis and distributed through the Village at the
Park network based on existing count data.


3.1.4. 10-TAR-317 ­ STONEWATER PUD AMENDMENT
The Stonewater PUD TAR was conducted for a revision to a proposed commercial parcel
that is part of the Stonewater PUD. This parcel is located in the northeastern quadrant of
the western Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection. Based on
a field investigation for Village at the Park and discussions with Town of Cary staff, this
development is not moving forward at this time, and therefore, not included in this
analysis.


3.1.5. 10-TAR-320 ­ W AKE MEMORIAL PARK
The Wake Memorial Park TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development on
Green Hope School Road west of NC 55. The development will consist of 62 single-
family homes and is estimated to be complete in 2014. While there were no common
intersections between the Wake Memorial Park TAR and this TAR, between 55 and 60%
of the Wake Memorial Park site trips were entering/exiting the site to/from the north on NC
55. Therefore, the site traffic from this development will be added to NC 55 as through
trips in this analysis. Site trips from this development are included in the 2014 analyses
only.


3.1.6. 11-TAR-323 ­ HIGHCROFT VILLAGE PHASES 4 & 5
The Highcroft Village TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development on
Green Hope School Road west of NC 55. The development will consist of 230 single-
family homes and 61 townhomes and will be built in two phases. Phase 4 will consist of
                                   15
                                                                              12-TAR-344
                                                                                  FINAL


114 single-family homes and is estimated to be complete in 2013. Phase 5 will consist of
116 single-family homes and is estimated to be complete in 2015. While there are no
common intersections between the Highcroft Village TAR and this TAR, 35% of the
Highcroft Village Phase 4 site trips were entering/exiting the site to/from the north on NC
55. Therefore, the site traffic from Phase 4 of this development will be added to NC 55 as
through trips in this analysis. Site traffic from Phase 5 of the development will not be
included in this analysis, based on a completion year of 2015, which is beyond the
completion year of the Village at the Park development.


3.1.7. 11-TAR-325 ­ PULTE HOMES (CARPENTER PROPERTY)
The Pulte Homes TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development located in
the northwest quadrant of the Green Level Church Road and McCrimmon Parkway
intersection. The development will consist of 75 single-family homes and is estimated to
be complete in 2013. Based on 11-TAR-325, 20% of the Pulte Homes Development site
traffic will utilize Green Level Church Road south of O'Kelly Chapel Road. It was
assumed that all of these trips were ultimately using NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road to
enter or exit the site. Therefore, the site traffic for this development will be added to the
Village at the Park network at the Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road
east intersection and the O'Kelly Chapel Road and NC 55 intersection. The site traffic will
then be distributed at NC 55 based on existing count patterns and carried through the
network as through trips on NC 55.


3.1.8. 11-TAR-326 ­ AMBERLY TOWN CENTER TOWNHOMES PHASES 1 & 2
The Amberly TAR was conducted for a proposed residential development in the Amberly
Planned Development District and will be located in the southeast quadrant of the O'Kelly
Chapel Road and Yates Store Road intersection. Both phases of the development will
consist of a total of 184 townhomes and are estimated to be complete in 2013. Both
Green Level Church Road intersections with O'Kelly Chapel Road were included in the
Amberly Town Center TAR. Therefore, the site traffic from this development will be
added to O'Kelly Chapel Road in this analysis and distributed through the 12-TAR-344
network based on existing count data.


3.1.9. 11-TAR-332 ­ ALSTON TOWN CENTER
The Alston Town Center TAR was conducted for a large mixed-use retail development
located in the southwest quadrant of the NC 55 and NC 540 Eastbound Off-Ramp
intersection. The development is estimated to be complete by 2015 and will consist of
355,905 square feet of shopping center, 30,125 square feet of office space, 37
townhomes, a 150 room hotel, a 5,255 square-foot bank, 7,398 square feet of a high-
turnover/sit down restaurant, a 3,500 square-foot fast food restaurant, a gas station with a
convenience store and 16 fuel pumps, a 14,708 square-foot pharmacy, and 590

   apartments. Because the completion year of this development is beyond the 2014
   completion year of the Village at the Park development, these site trips were not included
   in the 12-TAR-344 analysis.


3.2.       NC 55 Improvements
The Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies NC 55 as a future
six-lane, median-divided facility in the project study area (currently four-lane divided). Based
on information provided by the Town of Cary, the Town will construct an additional
southbound through lane on NC 55 from the Durham County line to NC 540 by the spring of
2013 in order to partially satisfy this vision. This additional lane was included in the 2013
Background and all subsequent analyses. As a result of this addition, the yellow and all-red
signal timings were changed in the analyses to 5 seconds and 2 seconds, respectively, for all
signalized intersections on NC 55.


3.3.       Level of Service Analysis
Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2013) AM and PM peak hours which includes the approved development site
trips described in the above section. This analysis will be used as the base case for the
analysis of impacts for Phase 4-A of the Village at the Park PUD Update development.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2013) analysis are shown by Figure 5. The
summary of the level of service analysis for the Background (2013) conditions is reported in
Tables 6a and 6b.

* Synchro is unable to estimate delay.

     As in the 2012 Existing conditions, the 2013 Background plus Approved Development
     analysis indicates that multiple movements and intersections will operate below the LOS D
     threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. In the 2013 Background plus Approved
     Development scenario, two signalized intersections, NC 55 and Kit Creek Road and NC 55
     and O'Kelly Chapel Road, operate at LOS F in the PM peak period.

     Also, two unsignalized intersections, Green Level Church Road (west) at O'Kelly Chapel
     Road and Alston Village Lane at NC 55, have movements operating below LOS D. For the
     O'Kelly Chapel Road intersection, the southbound left-turn operates at LOS F in the PM peak
     period where it operates at LOS D in the 2012 Existing PM peak period. For the Alston
     Village Lane intersection, the northbound left-turn lane operates at LOS E in the PM peak
     period where it operates at LOS D in the 2012 Existing PM peak period. Both the intersection
     of O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road (east) and NC 55 and Green Level
     Church Road have movements operating at LOS F in the PM peak period as they do in the
     2012 Existing PM peak period. The 2013 Background plus Approved Development Synchro
     analyses are located in Appendix G.



4.      COMBINED (2013) CONDITIONS
As previously discussed, the proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base
Benefit Zone and therefore recommendations will be based on a level of service standard of "D"
or not increasing delay when the intersection (signalized) or movement (unsignalized) operates
below LOS D in the 2013 Background conditions.

4.1.       Trip Generation
Phase 4-A of the Village at the Park PUD Update is proposed to consist of a 6,558 square
foot convenience market with gas pumps and 10,000 square feet of retail space. Trip
generation rates were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition to determine the
amount of vehicles the site would generate. Because both land uses are commercial, a
portion of the trips generated will be pass-by trips and will be drawn from traffic already on the
network. The pass-by trips for each land use were calculated based on the standard ITE
procedure and the percentages used were based on the latest ITE data and guidance
provided by NCDOT. The trip generation summary for Phase 4-A is shown in Table 7 below.

4.2.       Trip Distribution
Access to Phase 4-A of the Village at the Park PUD is proposed via one full-access driveway
on Kit Creek Road proposed to align across from existing Black Gate Drive; one right-in/right-
out only driveway on Kit Creek Road between Black Gate Drive and NC 55 and one right-
in/right-out only driveway on NC 55 approximately 500 feet south of NC 55. Trip distribution
was estimated based on count data from nearby intersections, and from knowledge of local
trip attractions and destinations in the area. Based on the assumption that Kit Creek Road
along the site frontage will be a four-lane, median-divided facility under NCDOT maintenance
in the future, the proposed access across from Black Gate Drive (Access 2) was analyzed
with restricted access. This restriction is described in further detail in section 4.3. The
primary site distribution percentages are shown on Figures 7.1 and 7.2 and the pass-by site
distribution percentages are shown on Figures 8.1 and 8.2. The total amount of trips

distribution calculations are located in Appendix E.


4.3.      Combined (2013) Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2013) scenario consists of the background with approved development traffic
as determined in Section 3.0 of this TAR plus the site generated trips from Phase 4-A of the
proposed Village at the Park PUD development. The volumes that are used in the Combined
(2013) analysis are shown in Figures 10.1 and 10.2. The laneage used for the 2013
Combined scenario is based on the existing laneage provided by Figure 3 and the previously
mentioned improvements at NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road with the addition of
improvements shown in the site plan, which is provided by Figure 2. These improvements
shown on the site plan are in agreement with the Town of Cary's Adequate Public Facility
Ordinance (APFO) requirements and are described in more detail below. This section
describes the improvements added to this scenario:

       Kit Creek Road Improvements:
       The Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) identifies Kit Creek
       Road as a four-lane divided facility with a landscaped median between NC 55 and
       Green Level Church Road. As part of Phase 4-A of the development, Kit Creek Road
       is proposed to be widened to a four-lane, median-divided facility with exclusive left-
       turn lanes provided at Black Gate Drive and Proposed Site Access 2.

       Intersection of Green Level Church Road and Kit Creek Road:
       The westbound approach is shown on the site plan to consist of an exclusive left-turn
       lane, one through lane, and a shared through and right-turn lane. However, since
       there is only one westbound receiving lane on Kit Creek Road, this study assumed
       that the outside lane dropped at the intersection as an exclusive right-turn lane.
       Therefore, the westbound approach was analyzed as having an exclusive left-turn
       lane, one through lane and one full right-turn lane. Based on the site plan, the
       westbound approach left-turn lane has 150 feet of storage.

       Intersection of Kit Creek Road and Black Gate Drive/Proposed Site Access 2:
       As noted in previous sections of this report, the site plan proposes this intersection as
       a full-movement intersection with the proposed widening of Kit Creek Road to a four-
       lane median divided facility. Also, as stated in Section 2.1.3 of this report, NCDOT is
       expected to take over maintenance of Kit Creek Road. Given that Kit Creek Road is
       to be a four-lane divided facility, NCDOT's Median Crossover Guidelines were
       investigated and it was determined that Site Access 2 would not meet NCDOT's
       Median Crossover Guidelines for a full movement opening. After discussions with
       Town of Cary staff, the possibility of the provision of a full movement opening at Site
       Access 2 was broached with NCDOT. Phase 4A (2013) and Phase 4B (2014)
       volumes for Kit Creek Road with Proposed Site Access 2 functioning as a full

                                                                              FINAL


movement driveway along with the Draft TAR were provided to NCDOT for their
review and comment. Preliminary analysis results were also noted, which showed
that Proposed Site Access 2 movements would operate at adequate levels of service
after the build-out of Phase 4A but would not upon completion of Phase 4B.
NCDOT's response indicated that the Median Crossover Guidelines would need to be
maintained, meaning that a full-movement driveway here would not be allowed.
However, NCDOT indicated they will consider allowing directional crossovers, which
allows for leftovers and right-in/right-out access. NCDOT also indicated that the
ultimate configuration should be constructed in Phase 4A. Based on this information,
this intersection was analyzed as a directional crossover in Phase 4A and Phase 4B.

Due to the restriction of the southbound left-turn movement at this intersection, traffic
currently exiting the apartment complex on Black Gate Drive was rerouted through the
network for analysis purposes. Southbound left-turning traffic destined for northbound
NC 55 was routed to the southbound right-turn and along Kit Creek Road to Green
Level Church Road where it would take Green Level Church Road north to NC 55.
Southbound left-turning traffic destined for southbound NC 55 and Kit Creek Road
east of NC 55 was routed to an existing right-in/right-out driveway on NC 55 north of
the Kit Creek Road intersection (not included in analysis). The traffic rerouting
calculations are provided in Appendix E.

Based upon the site plan and the restriction noted above, the following laneage will be
provided as part of Phase 4-A:

·   On the eastbound approach, provide one eastbound exclusive left-turn lane with
    100 feet of full storage, one through lane and one shared through and right-turn
    lane.
·   On the northbound approach, provide Proposed Site Access 2 with one ingress
    lane and one egress lane (to function as a right-turn only).
·   On the westbound approach, provide one exclusive left-turn lane with 150 feet of
    full storage, one through lane and one shared through and right-turn lane.
·   On the southbound approach, restrict the egress lanes on Black Gate Drive to
    function as a single right-turn only.

Intersection of Kit Creek Road and Proposed Site Access 3:
Based upon the site plan, the following laneage will be provided as part of Phase 4-A:

·   On the eastbound approach, provide one through lane and one shared through
    and right-turn lane.
·   On the northbound approach, provide Proposed Site Access 3 with one ingress
    lane and one egress lane (to function as a right-turn only).
·   On the westbound approach provide two through lanes.

        Intersection of NC 55 and Kit Creek Road:
        · On the eastbound approach, provide one exclusive left-turn lane with 200 feet of
        full storage, one through lane and one shared through and right-turn lane.

        Intersection of NC 55 and Proposed Site Access 4:
        Based upon the site plan, the following laneage will be provided as part of Phase 4-A:

        ·    On the eastbound approach, provide Proposed Site Access 4 with one ingress
             lane and one egress lane (to function as a right-turn only).
        ·    On the southbound lane, provide an exclusive right-turn lane with 200 feet of full
             storage and three through lanes.

   Intersection of NC 55 and Kit Creek Road:
   NC 55 and Kit Creek Road operates at LOS F in the PM Peak period. The results provided in
   Table 8a, above, indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in delay when
   compared to the background analyses. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the Land Development
   Ordinance (LDO), no increase in delay time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level
   of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore,
   additional improvements will be required at this intersection in order to mitigate the increase
   in delay. These improvements are described in Section 4.4 below.

   Intersection of NC 55 and Hopson:
   This intersection operates at LOS B in the AM and PM peak periods and therefore no
   mitigation is required.

   Intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road:
   The intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road operates at LOS F in the PM Peak
   period. The results provided in Table 8a, above, indicate that this intersection shows an
   overall increase in delay when compared to the background analyses. Based on Section
   3.23.3 of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO), no increase in delay time is allowed for
   signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit
   Transportation Zone. Therefore, additional improvements will be required at this intersection
   in order to mitigate the increase in delay. These improvements are described in Section 4.4
   below.

   Kit Creek Road and Louis Stephens Drive:
   As shown in Table 8a, Kit Creek Road and Louis Stephens Drive is anticipated to operate at
   LOS C or better with the addition of site trips and therefore no mitigation is required.

Kit Creek Road and Green Level Church Road:
As shown in Table 8a, Kit Creek Road and Green Level Church Road is anticipated to
operate at LOS C or better in the peak periods with the addition of site trips and therefore no
mitigation is required.

O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road (east and west):
While this intersection is outside the one-mile study limit, several approach movements
exceed the Town's 7% rule, meaning projected site traffic is anticipated to exceed 7% of the
total traffic of some movements. At least one approach for each intersection (east and west)
with movements exceeding the 7% rule also exceeded the Town's 1% rule, meaning
projected site traffic on the approach is expected to exceed 1% of the total approach volume.
These calculations are provided in Appendix E. Given this and the fact that Green Level
Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road (east and west) have movements that operate below
the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone and these movements
experience an increase in delay when compared to the background analyses, mitigation is
required which is described in Section 4.4.

NC 55 and Alston Village Lane:
The northbound left-turn lane operations reduce to LOS E with the addition of site trips in the
PM peak period. A delay study was performed to estimate the actual delay for this movement
to help determine if mitigation was required. This is detailed in Section 4.4.

Cartecay Drive and Chinqua Pine Drive:
All movements for this intersection are anticipated to operate at LOS A. Therefore, this
intersection does not require mitigation to meet the APFO requirements.

Cartecay Drive and Green Level Church Road/School Drive:
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS D or better, this intersection does not
require mitigation to meet the APFO requirements.

Kit Creek Road and Black Gate Drive/Site Access 2:
Based on information from the Town of Cary, maintenance of Kit Creek Road is to be taken
over by NCDOT at a future date. As part of the CTP, Kit Creek Road is to be widened to a
four-lane divided facility which is proposed as part of Phase 4-A. The intersection of Kit
Creek Road and Black Gate Drive/Access 2 does not meet NCDOT's median spacing
guidelines for a full movement median opening. Therefore, this intersection was evaluated
with a right-in/right-out with left-over configuration. Under this configuration, all movements
operate at LOS B or better and no mitigation is required.

Intersection of NC 55 and Green Level Church Road:
This intersection has movements operating at LOS F in the 2013 Background conditions and
these movements experience an increase in delay in the 2013 PM Combined conditions.

While this intersection is located in Durham County and therefore is not within the Town of
Cary's ETJ; mitigations to meet the APFO requirements will be evaluated.

NC 55 and Site Access 3:
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS B, this intersection does not require
mitigation to meet the APFO requirements.

NC 55 and Site Access 4:
Since all movements are anticipated to operate at LOS A, this intersection does not require
mitigation to meet the APFO requirements.

In summary, as with the 2012 Existing and 2013 Background analyses, two signalized
intersections, NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road and NC 55 and Kit Creek Road operate at
LOS F in the PM Peak period. The results provided in Table 8a, above, indicate that both
intersections show an overall increase in delay when compared to the background analyses.
Based on Section 3.23.3 of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO), no increase in delay
time is allowed for signalized intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold
for the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. Therefore, additional improvements will be
required at these intersections in order to mitigate the increase in delay. These mitigations
are described in Section 4.4 below.

As with the 2013 Background analyses, four unsignalized intersections, Green Level Church
Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road (east and west) NC 55 and Alston Village Lane, and NC 55
and Green Level Church Road have movements that operate below the LOS D threshold for
the Base Benefit Transportation Zone. The results provided in Table 8b, above, indicate that
the failing movements at all four intersections experience an increase in delay when
compared to the background analyses. As noted above, these intersections will require
additional mitigation which is described in Section 4.4 below. The 2013 Combined Synchro
analyses are located in Appendix H.


4.4.       Combined (2013) Improved Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2013) Improved scenario consists of improvements shown on the site plan
and described in the above section (Figure 2) as well as additional improvements that are
recommended in order to meet the LOS D threshold or show no increase in overall
intersection delay if the intersection operates below LOS D in the background condition as
noted in Section 4.3. The mitigations for intersections require additional improvements and
the corresponding operations are discussed below. The 2013 Combined with Improvements
Synchro analyses are located in Appendix I.

Intersection of NC 55 and Kit Creek Road:
Based on the Town of Cary Official Town Limit Map (amended April 19, 2012) and
discussions with Town of Cary Planning staff, it appears that the westbound approach of Kit

                                                                                  12-TAR-344
                                                                                      FINAL


Creek Road falls outside the Town of Cary limits and ETJ. However, recommendations were
made based on meeting the requirements of the APFO.

This intersection operates below the LOS D threshold in the PM peak of the 2013
Background scenario and experiences an increase in delay in the PM peak of the 2013
Combined scenario. The westbound left-turn experiences considerable delay and processes
over 700 vehicles in the existing peak hour. This movement meets multiple NCDOT criteria
for protected phasing. The site traffic contributes additional conflicting movements for the
westbound left-turn. After discussions with the Town of Cary's signal system staff, this
movement is recommended for protected plus permitted phasing. To meet the APFO, the
following mitigations were provided:

   ·   Provide a 400' eastbound left-turn lane with appropriate taper.
   ·   Provide protected plus permitted phasing for the westbound left-turn (note Town of
       Cary signal system staff recommends this be done with a flashing yellow arrow design
       for consistency in the area).
   ·   Provide overlap northbound right-turn phase to coincide with the westbound protected
       left-turn phase.

With these mitigations, the intersection operates at an improved level of service, LOS E, in
the PM peak period and with less intersection delay than experienced in the 2013
Background scenario.

Intersection of NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road:
NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road operates at LOS F in the PM Peak period. The results
provided in Table 8a, above, indicate that this intersection shows an overall increase in delay
when compared to the background analyses. Based on Section 3.23.3 of the Land
Development Ordinance (LDO), no increase in delay time is allowed for signalized
intersections with a level of service below the LOS D threshold for the Base Benefit
Transportation Zone. Therefore, the following mitigation is recommended to meet the Town's
APFO:

   ·   Provide a 250' southbound right-turn lane with appropriate taper

With these mitigations, the intersection still operates at LOS F in the PM peak period but with
less intersection delay than experienced in the 2013 Background scenario. As previously
mentioned, with the addition of site traffic the overall intersection delay increases. Even with
signal timing optimization, the delay exceeds the delay in the No Build condition for the PM
peak period; therefore, additional capacity was required to meet the APFO. Multiple
improvements were considered; however, given the provision of turn lanes for most
movements in the No Build conditions, this mitigation is recommended to provide an overall
decrease in delay when compared to the background analyses and as an effort to minimize
impacts.

Intersection of O'Kelly Chapel Road and Green Level Church Road:
Based upon the Town's 7% rule and 1% rule, mitigation is required to meet the Town's
APFO. The CTP identifies the need for realignment of this intersection and several TARs
have previously recommended realigning and signalizing this intersection, but to our
knowledge, no funding has been made available. Given that, the recommended mitigation is
that the existing offset intersection of Green Level Church Road and O'Kelly Chapel Road be
realigned to form a single four-leg intersection in order to meet APFO requirements. A signal
warrant analysis was performed for this intersection (warrant analysis located in Appendix I).
Based on that the warrant analysis, the intersection will meet the peak hour signal warrants.
While meeting one signal warrant does not guarantee the installation of a signal, the
intersection was analyzed as a signalized intersection in the Combined and Improved
conditions which resulted in acceptable level of service operations. The recommended
laneage at this intersection to meet the APFO is as follows:

   ·   Northbound ­ One shared left-turn, through and right-turn lane
   ·   Southbound ­ One left-turn lane with 325 feet of full storage and appropriate taper,
       one through lane, and one full right-turn lane
   ·   Eastbound ­ One left-turn lane with 100 feet of full storage and appropriate taper and
       one shared through and right-turn lane
   ·   Westbound ­ One left-turn lane with 450 feet of full storage with appropriate taper and
       one shared through and right-turn lane (This movement was analyzed under protected
       conditions)

Intersection of NC 55 and Alston Village Lane:
The northbound left-turn level of service reduces to LOS E in the 2013 Combined conditions.
A delay study was performed at the intersection of NC 55 and Alston Village Lane. This
study was conducted from 4:47 ­ 5:12 PM (which corresponded with the peak hour of the
intersection from the traffic counts) on Thursday, May 24, 2012. This study identifies the
average time in queue for northbound left-turning vehicles as 9.38 seconds. Based on the
delay methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual, this value should be adjusted
by a factor of 0.9 (recommended adjustment value for field delay studies), then increased by
9 seconds (based on free flow speed of the facility and vehicles in the queue) to account for
delay due to deceleration. Using this guidance, the field data would equate to a calculated
delay of 17.4 seconds per vehicle.

The Synchro-calculated delay for this movement in the 2012 PM Existing analysis was 30.4
seconds per vehicle. This value is approximately 13 seconds per vehicle higher than the
comparable field value. The 2013 PM Combined scenario delay at this location was 45.4
seconds per vehicle (based on the Synchro analysis), resulting in LOS E. Based on the
comparison of field data to analysis data in 2012, it would seem reasonable to assume that
the 2013 delay should be adjusted by approximately 13 seconds, yielding a delay of 32.4
seconds per vehicle. This value falls below the threshold for LOS E (35 seconds per vehicle),
resulting in LOS D. As such, it is believed that the operation for the northbound left-turning

movement in the 2013 Combined scenario will be comparable to LOS D conditions.
Therefore, no mitigation is recommended for this intersection. The delay study is located in
Appendix M.

Intersection of NC 55 and Green Level Church Road:
This intersection has movements operating at LOS F 2013 Background conditions and these
movements experience an increase in delay in the 2013 Combined conditions. A peak hour
signal warrant analysis was performed and is included in Appendix I which indicates this
intersection will meet peak hour warrants in the 2013 Combined scenario. While meeting one
signal warrant does not guarantee the installation of a signal, the intersection was analyzed
as a two-phase signalized intersection in the Combined and Improved conditions which
resulted in acceptable level of service operations. As previously mentioned, this intersection
is located in Durham County and therefore is not within the Town of Cary's ETJ; however, to
meet the APFO requirements a signal was provided at this intersection.

A summary of the intersection levels of service with mitigations is found in Tables 9a and 9b
below.

     4.5.       Phase 4-A Conclusions
     Based on analysis of Phase 4-A of the Village at the Park PUD and as indicated in Table 9b,
     the proposed mitigations show signalized intersections operating at overall LOS D or better or
     show no overall increase in delay when compared to 2013 Background conditions. Table 9b
     also indicates unsignalized intersections with all movements operating at LOS D or better.
     The recommended Combined and Improved laneage in 2013 for Phase 4-A is shown on
     Figure 11.




5.      BACKGROUND (2014) CONDITIONS
     5.1.       Background Growth and Development
     As described in Section 3.1, a 2% annual growth rate per year was applied to the existing
     volumes (2012) to determine the projected volumes for the Background (2014) analysis.
     These volumes can be found on Figure 5. There were also additional trips added to account
     for approved developments that are not yet constructed. The approved developments and
     their associated trips that were included in this analysis are described in Section 3.1 and can
     be found in Figure 13. The site traffic generated by Phase 4-A of this development was also
     included in the Background (2014) analysis and can be found in Figures 9.1 and 9.2


     5.2.       Level of Service Analysis
     Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
     Background (2014) AM and PM peak hours which includes the approved development site
     trips and the site trips from Phase 4-A of this development. This analysis will be used as the
     base case for the analysis of impacts for Phase 4-B of the Village at the Park PUD Update
     development.

     The volumes that were used in the Background (2014) analysis are shown on Figure 12.
     The summary of the level of service analysis for the Background (2014) conditions is reported
     in Tables 10a and 10b below.

   As seen in Table 10a, the 2014 Background analyses results indicate two signalized
   intersections, NC 55 and Kit Creek Road and NC 55 and O'Kelly Chapel Road, operate at
   LOS F in the PM peak period. All other signalized intersections operate at LOS D or better.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a mixed-use development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2011 and consist of the following proposed
uses:
    · Apartments ­ 198 dwelling units
    · Office ­ 16,100 square feet
    · Shopping Center ­ 16,800 square feet
    · Restaurants ­ 12,200 square feet

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four driveways ­ two along Winfair
Drive, one along Evans Road and one along Cary Parkway (Figure 2). The following
intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed
for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road (signalized ­ Town of Morrisville)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Sheldon Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Norwell Road (signalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Weston Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Rochelle Road/W. Dynasty Drive (signalized)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Site Access #1 (right-in/right-out
       with left-in only for Site Access #1)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Site Access #2 (future RI/RO)
   ·   Evans Road and Site Access #3 (future RI/RO)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Site Access #4 (right-in/left-out with left-in
       only for Site Access #4)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2009), Background (2011), Build
(2011) and Build (2011) with Improvements. The Existing (2009) scenario includes A.M.
and P.M. peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in July 2009.
The Background (2011) scenario includes existing traffic with four approved developments
and projected background growth. The Build (2011) scenario includes Background (2011)
volumes with the addition of site trips generated by the proposed development. Future
conditions with the proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a Build
(2011) with Improvements scenario.


                                             i
Existing (2009) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. As the traffic counts were conducted in the summer time when
traffic is typically lower and school is not in session, traffic volumes were increased by eight
percent (8%), derived from the NCDOT continuous count program, to determine the basis
for the Existing analysis.

As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vii, the majority of the
study area intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service, LOS D or better.
However, two intersections are currently operating under failing conditions. Specifically, the
Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road intersection is operating at LOS E in the A.M. peak
hour and LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. Additionally, the stop-controlled southbound
Norwell Boulevard approach along Cary Parkway is operating at LOS F in both the A.M.
and P.M. peak hours, while the stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court approach along
Cary Parkway is operating at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour.

Background (2011) Conditions
In the Background (2011) conditions, an annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year (2009)
and the build year (2011). Furthermore, there are four other developments in the vicinity
being constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
development. Site traffic, as well as any mitigation improvements associated with these
approved developments, was included in the Background (2011) analysis.

Based on the Background (2011) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area are
projected to experience an improvement in level of service, which can be attributed to both
optimized signal timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the intersection
of Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road is projected to operate at an improved level of service
­ LOS E to LOS D in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F to LOS D in the P.M. peak hour.
These LOS improvements can be attributed to optimized signal timings and mitigations
proposed at this intersection by the developer of Park West Village.

In addition, the stop-controlled southbound Norwell Boulevard approach along Cary
Parkway is projected to continue operating at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours,
while the stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway is
projected to degrade to LOS F in the A.M. peak hour. The stop-controlled northbound
Winfair Drive approach along Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS E in the A.M.
and P.M. peak hours. Additionally, the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach
along Cary Parkway and the stop-controlled eastbound Winfair Drive and Windbyrne Drive
approaches along Evans Road are projected to operate at LOS E in the P.M. peak hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The development is proposed to consist of 45,100 square feet of commercial space and 198
residential dwelling units. The commercial uses include a mix of general retail, specialty
retail, restaurants, and office uses. Trip generation was conducted for each category based
on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation

                                               ii
Manual, 8th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs.
Equation" Spreadsheet.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 5,181 daily site trips, 345
A.M. peak hour site trips (161 entering, 184 exiting), and 570 P.M. peak hour site trips (304
entering, 266 exiting). Internal capture was conducted based on standard ITE practices; in
addition, pass-by rates of 34% (general retail) and 43% (restaurants) were applied to the P.M.
peak hour traffic. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing
turning movement counts and land uses. Note, due to the types of retail developments
expected to be constructed within the overall development, no A.M. internal capture was
applied, which is standard ITE practice.

Additionally, there are currently no transit routes that directly serve the neighborhood or the
proposed development along Winfair Drive (the closest is a CTRAN stop along Norwell
Drive). Several roads in the study area (Evans Road, Cary Parkway, West Dynasty Drive and
Norwell Boulevard) are designated as Cary Commuter Routes with West Dynasty Drive
being the only roadway with existing bike lanes. However, while the existing and proposed
facilities are viable alternatives to single-occupied vehicles, these reductions are deemed to be
negligible and therefore no multi-modal reductions were taken.

Build (2011) Conditions
The Build (2011) conditions account for both the Background (2011) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on
page vii, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the intersection delay for all study
area intersections. As a result, the stop-controlled southbound Norwell Boulevard approach
along Cary Parkway is projected to continue operating at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M.
peak hours, while the stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court approach along Cary
Parkway is projected to continue operating at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour. The stop-
controlled northbound Winfair Drive approach along Cary Parkway is projected to worsen
from LOS E to LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Additionally, the stop-
controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach along Cary Parkway is projected to worsen
from LOS C to LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS E to LOS F in the P.M. peak hour,
while the stop-controlled eastbound Winfair Drive and Windbyrne Drive approaches along
Evans Road are projected worsen from LOS E to LOS F in the P.M. peak hour.

The stop-controlled southbound Access #1 and Access #4 approaches along Winfair Drive
are projected to operate at LOS A in the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The stop-controlled
northbound Access #2 approach along Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS C in
the A.M. peak hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour, while the stop-controlled westbound
Access #3 approach along Evans Road is projected to operate at LOS A in the A.M. peak
hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have an impact on the adjacent roadways. Therefore, the following roadway improvements
are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's APFO and NCDOT

                                                 iii
requirements:
Evans Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of Evans Road, the plan dictates a 102-foot, six lane cross-section with a
landscaped median and wide outside travel lanes along curbs and sidewalks on both sides.
Thus the following is recommended along Evans Road:
    · Widen the section of Evans Road along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive
Along this property frontage of Winfair Drive, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector
street design ­ a 37-foot, two lane collector avenue section with curb and sidewalks on both
sides. Thus the following is recommended along Winfair Drive:
    · Widen the section of Winfair Drive along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Per the site plan, construct the southbound Access #1 approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and one egress lane (shared right-thru lane).
    · Construct an additional lane on the eastbound Winfair Drive approach. Stripe the
        roadway to provide for an exclusive left-turn and a shared through-right-turn lane.
    · Provide signing on the site access approach to prohibit the left-turn movement out
        of the site.

Cary Parkway and Access #2 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane so as to form a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
    · Widen the northbound approach of Cary Parkway to provide for a right-turn lane
        with 100 feet of storage length.

Evans Road and Access #3 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the eastbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane so as to form a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
    · Stripe the required widening along Evans Road to provide for an exclusive right-turn
        lane along southbound Evans Road that provides at least 150 feet of storage.
    · Construct a concrete median in front of this site access to enhance access control.

                                              iv
Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Access #4 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Per the site plan, construct the southbound Access #4 approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and one egress lane (shared left-thru lane).
    · Stripe the required widening along Winfair Drive to provide for an exclusive right-
        turn lane westbound along Winfair Drive.
    · Provide signing on the site access approach to prohibit the right-turn movement out
        of the site.

Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Winfair Drive approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Based on Peak Hour
Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F), installation of a traffic signal is not warranted.
Therefore, the following improvement is recommended at this location:
    · With the construction of the additional lane at the Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge
       Farms Court/Access #1 intersection, restripe the westbound Winfair Drive
       approach at this location to provide for an exclusive left-turn and exclusive right-turn
       lane.
    · Traffic should be monitored at this location in the future for the possibility of
       signalization.

Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the eastbound Winfair Drive and westbound Windbyrne Drive
approaches are projected to operate at unacceptable levels of service in the P.M. peak hour.
Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this location:
   · Restrict both the eastbound Winfair Drive and the westbound Windbyrne Drive
       approaches to right-turn movements only through the installation of a left-over type
       median along Evans Road.
   · Construct two additional lanes on the southbound Evans Road approach to provide
       for an exclusive left-turn (with at least 75 feet of storage), two through lanes, and an
       exclusive right-turn lane (with at least 150 feet of storage).
   · Construct a left-turn lane on the northbound Evans Road approach that provides at
       least 150 feet of storage.

Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that northbound Silverrock Court approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS in the A.M. peak hour, while the southbound Norwell
Boulevard approach is projected to fail in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore,
the following improvement is recommended at this location:
    · Based on Peak Hour Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) and the good intersection
        spacing at this location, implementation of a signal is recommended. However, a full
        signal warrant analysis is recommended prior to installation.



                                              v
Cary Parkway and Sheldon Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at a failing LOS on
the southbound Sheldon Drive approach in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Peak Hour
Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) indicates that a signal is not warranted at this location;
however. In addition, SimTraffic shows better results, as the southbound left-turn movement
can make a two-stage crossing maneuver. With SimTraffic showing better results than the
Synchro analysis, no improvements are recommended at this time. However, traffic should be
monitored at this location in the future for the possibility of signalization.

Site Plan Comments
As shown on the site plan submitted by the developer, the two site accesses along Winfair
Drive are restricted, so as to deter traffic from traversing along Winfair Drive. This is
difficult to enforce and is not recommended; full access would be preferable for circulation.
The turn restrictions would achieve a trip reduction along Winfair Drive, but will result in
increased trips along the main thoroughfares ­ Evans Road and Cary Parkway. If the
development is constructed as proposed with the restrictions in place, it is critical that the
site be interconnected.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in the table on page vii, and the
resulting future lane configurations and traffic control for 2011 are shown in Figures ES on
page viii.

1.0    INTRODUCTION
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a mixed-use development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2011 and consist of the following proposed
uses:
    · Apartments ­ 198 dwelling units
    · Office ­ 16,100 square feet
    · Shopping Center ­ 16,800 square feet
    · Restaurants ­ 12,200 square feet

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four driveways ­ two along Winfair
Drive, one along Evans Road and one along Cary Parkway (Figure 2). The following
intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed
for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road (signalized ­ Town of Morrisville)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Sheldon Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Norwell Road (signalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Weston Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Rochelle Road/W. Dynasty Drive (signalized)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Site Access #1 (right-in/right-out
       with left-in only for Site Access #1)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Site Access #2 (future RI/RO)
   ·   Evans Road and Site Access #3 (future RI/RO)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Site Access #4 (right-in/left-out with left-in
       only for Site Access #4)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

 The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4. As the traffic
 counts were conducted in the summer time when traffic is typically lower and school is not
 in session, traffic volumes were increased by eight percent (8%), derived from the NCDOT
 continuous count program, to determine the basis for the Existing analysis.

2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                     CRITERIA
Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
ranges.

Table 2       Level of Service Descriptions for Intersections
                                                  Signalized                 Unsignalized
  Level of Service        Description
                                                 Intersection                Intersection
         A              Little or no delay        <= 10 sec.                  <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay         10-20 sec.               10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay        20-35 sec.               15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay          35-55 sec.               25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay       55-80 sec.               35-50 sec.
           F             Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.               > 50 sec.

The development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone." Level of
service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour (as
defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) with LOS D considered acceptable for
both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service less than LOS D, then
no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections, where the stop controlled approach is below an LOS D under background
conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans from the
Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the
Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, the majority of the study area intersections are operating at
acceptable levels of service, LOS D or better. However, two intersections are currently
operating under failing conditions. Specifically, the Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road
intersection is operating at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F in the P.M. peak hour.
Additionally, the stop-controlled southbound Norwell Boulevard approach along Cary
Parkway is operating at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, while the stop-
controlled northbound Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway is operating at LOS E
in the A.M. peak hour.

3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND
                      AND DEVELOPMENT
A general background growth rate of three percent (3%) was applied to the study area
roadways and intersections based on previous studies conducted in the area.

In addition, four developments in the vicinity are expected to be completed prior to, or at
the same time as the build-out of the proposed development. Therefore, traffic generated
from these approved or planned projects was included, partially or wholly, in the
Background (2011) scenario where appropriate. These projects include:

Park West Village ­ This mixed use development is proposed to be constructed in the
northwestern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection in Morrisville.
The proposed development is to consist of 425 apartments, a 140-room hotel, 50,000 square
feet of office space, an 180,000-square foot discount superstore, and 570,000 square feet of
retail space, including a movie theatre, and be fully constructed by 2010. A traffic analysis
report was prepared by Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. and submitted to the Town of
Morrisville in April 2007. As shown in the report, the proposed development is projected to
generate 1,158 A.M. peak hour trips (615 entering, 543 exiting) and 3,148 P.M. peak hour
trips (1,523 entering, 1,625 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Additionally, the
report details the following mitigation recommendations at the Cary Parkway and Chapel
Hill Road intersection:
    · Construct an eastbound left-turn lane along Cary Parkway (forming dual left-turn
         lanes) that provides at least 325 feet of storage.
    · Construct a southbound exclusive right-turn lane along Chapel Hill Road that
         provides at least 275 feet of storage.
    · Construct a northbound shared through-right lane along Chapel Hill Road that
         provides at least 600 feet of storage.
    · Modify the signal.
Figure D-1 in Appendix D depicts the total assigned trips.

Morrisville Manor ­ This senior housing development is proposed to be constructed in the
southeastern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection. The
proposed development is to consist of 214 bedrooms and be completed by 2009. A traffic
analysis report was not required of this development. The proposed development is
projected to generate 30 A.M. peak hour trips (15 entering, 15 exiting) and 43 P.M. peak
hour trips (26 entering, 17 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on current land uses and traffic patterns. Figure D-2 in Appendix D
depicts the assigned trips.

Wedgewood Subdivision ­ This residential development is proposed to be constructed along
Rochelle Road and consist of twenty-seven (27) single-family lots. A traffic analysis report
was not required of this development; therefore it was assumed that the development would
be completed by the 2011 build-out year of the proposed Singh MUSP. The proposed
development is projected to generate 29 A.M. peak hour trips (7 entering, 15 exiting) and 32


                                             16
P.M. peak hour trips (20 entering, 12 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
based on current land uses and traffic patterns. Figure D-3 in Appendix D depicts the
assigned trips.

Weston Parkway Property (08-TAR-296) ­ This mixed-use development is proposed to be
constructed in the northeastern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Weston Parkway
intersection. The proposed development is to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail space,
208 apartment units, 155 condominium units, 35 townhome units, and be fully constructed
by 2012. A traffic analysis report was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC and
submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2008. As shown in the report, the proposed
development is projected to generate 331 A.M. peak hour trips (101 entering, 230 exiting)
and 559 P.M. peak hour trips (318 entering, 241 exiting). These trips were distributed to the
study area intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Figure D-4
in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

The total site trips from the approved developments included in the Background (2011)
analysis are included in Figure D-5 in Appendix D. The Background (2011) peak hour trips
are shown in Figure 7.

3.2 FUTURE ROADWAY IMPROVEME
                   IMPROVEMENTS
                        VEMENTS
The Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan includes roadway improvements in
the future for Evans Road and Winfair Drive. Evans Road is currently planned to have a
six-lane cross-section with a raised median and wide outside travel lanes along with curbs
and sidewalks on both sides as shown in Figure 5. Winfair Drive is planned to have a two-
lane cross-section with curbs and sidewalks on both sides as shown in Figure 6.

The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of Evans Road, the plan dictates a 102-foot, six lane cross-section with a
landscaped median and wide outside travel lanes along curbs and sidewalks on both sides.

                              Cross-Section of Evans Road




Along this property frontage of Winfair Drive, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector
street design ­ a 37-foot, two lane collector avenue section with curb and sidewalks on both
sides.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2011) scenario LOS analysis can
be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2011) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area are
projected to experience an improvement in level of service, which can be attributed to both
optimized signal timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the intersection
of Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road is projected to operate at an improved level of service
­ LOS E to LOS D in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F to LOS D in the P.M. peak hour.
These LOS improvements can be attributed to optimized signal timings and mitigations
proposed at this intersection by the developer of Park West Village.

In addition, the stop-controlled southbound Norwell Boulevard approach along Cary
Parkway is projected to continue operating at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours,
while the stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway is
projected to degrade to LOS F in the A.M. peak hour. The stop-controlled northbound
Winfair Drive approach along Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS E in the A.M.
and P.M. peak hours. Additionally, the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach
along Cary Parkway and the stop-controlled eastbound Winfair Drive and Windbyrne Drive
approaches along Evans Road are projected to operate at LOS E in the P.M. peak hour.

The specific land uses currently envisioned as part of the development are:
       · 1,400 SF Sub Shop
       · 2,000 SF Pizza (fast casual)
       · 2,000 SF Chinese (fast casual)
       · 1,800 SF Coffee Shop with Drive Thru
       · 2,500 SF Casual Sit Down Restaurant
       · 2,500 SF Casual Sit Down Restaurant
       · 1,400 SF Dry Cleaners

       · 2,800 SF Professional Office (Real Estate and Tax Service)
       · 1,400 SF of Florist
       · 1,400 SF Beer and Wine Store
       · 1,400 SF Smoothie Store
       · 1,400 SF Health Beverage Store
       · 1,400 SF Weight Loss Clinic
       · 1,600 SF Day Spa
       · 9,400 SF Office Space
       · 198 Residential Apartments/Condos

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The development is proposed to consist of 45,100 square feet of commercial space and 198
residential dwelling units. The commercial uses include a mix of general retail, specialty
retail, restaurants, and office uses. Trip generation was conducted for each category based
on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation
Manual, 8th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs.
Equation" Spreadsheet.

Lack of survey data for some of the specific land uses led to many of them being combined

                                             22
into general land use categories more representative of the group. While there was a land
use code for the restaurants without drive-thru windows (Land Use #933), they were instead
grouped together (Land Use #932) because of the high amount of A.M. trips estimated by
Land Use #932. Office uses were also grouped together. As it was unknown whether the
residential units would be rentals or not, the apartment trip generation rate (Land Use #220)
was used to best estimate the number of expected trips. While the shopping center land use
(Land Use #820) generates higher trips than the specialty retail land use (Land Use #814),
the shopping center land use has a built-in internal capture rate between retail uses. The
method used here is the most conservative estimation of the trips that could be generated by
this site.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 5,181 daily site trips, 345
A.M. peak hour site trips (161 entering, 184 exiting), and 570 P.M. peak hour site trips (304
entering, 266 exiting). Internal capture was conducted based on standard ITE practices; in
addition, pass-by rates of 34% (general retail) and 43% (restaurants) were applied to the P.M.
peak hour traffic. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing
turning movement counts and land uses. Note, due to the types of retail developments
expected to be constructed within the overall development, no A.M. internal capture was
applied, which is standard ITE practice.

Additionally, there are currently no transit routes that directly serve the neighborhood or the
proposed development along Winfair Drive (the closest is a CTRAN stop along Norwell
Drive). Several roads in the study area (Evans Road, Cary Parkway, West Dynasty Drive and
Norwell Boulevard) are designated as Cary Commuter Routes with West Dynasty Drive
being the only roadway with existing bike lanes. However, while the existing and proposed
facilities are viable alternatives to single-occupied vehicles, these reductions are deemed to be
negligible and therefore no multi-modal reductions were taken.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation of the proposed development for typical
weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
The Build (2011) analysis scenario includes the Background (2011) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 17 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2011) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the build year analysis.
Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the full
Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the intersection
delay for all study area intersections. As a result, the stop-controlled southbound Norwell
Boulevard approach along Cary Parkway is projected to continue operating at LOS F in both
the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, while the stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court
approach along Cary Parkway is projected to continue operating at LOS F in the A.M. peak
hour. The stop-controlled northbound Winfair Drive approach along Cary Parkway is
projected to worsen from LOS E to LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.
Additionally, the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach along Cary Parkway
is projected to worsen from LOS C to LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS E to LOS F
in the P.M. peak hour, while the stop-controlled eastbound Winfair Drive and Windbyrne
Drive approaches along Evans Road are projected worsen from LOS E to LOS F in the
P.M. peak hour.

The stop-controlled southbound Access #1 and Access #4 approaches along Winfair Drive
are projected to operate at LOS A in the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The stop-controlled
northbound Access #2 approach along Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS C in
the A.M. peak hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour, while the stop-controlled westbound
Access #3 approach along Evans Road is projected to operate at LOS A in the A.M. peak
hour and LOS B in the P.M. peak hour.

5.0     FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
                     CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have an impact on the adjacent roadways. Therefore, the following roadway improvements
are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's APFO and NCDOT
requirements:
Evans Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of Evans Road, the plan dictates a 102-foot, six lane cross-section with a
landscaped median and wide outside travel lanes along curbs and sidewalks on both sides.
Thus the following is recommended along Evans Road:
    · Widen the section of Evans Road along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive
Along this property frontage of Winfair Drive, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector
street design ­ a 37-foot, two lane collector avenue section with curb and sidewalks on both
sides. Thus the following is recommended along Winfair Drive:
    · Widen the section of Winfair Drive along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Per the site plan, construct the southbound Access #1 approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and one egress lane (shared right-thru lane).
    · Construct an additional lane on the eastbound Winfair Drive approach. Stripe the
        roadway to provide for an exclusive left-turn and a shared through-right-turn lane.
    · Provide signing on the site access approach to prohibit the left-turn movement out
        of the site.

Cary Parkway and Access #2 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane so as to form a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
    · Widen the northbound approach of Cary Parkway to provide for a right-turn lane
        with 100 feet of storage length.

Evans Road and Access #3 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
driveway configuration is recommended at this location:


                                             38
   ·   Construct the eastbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
       one egress lane so as to form a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
   ·   Stripe the required widening along Evans Road to provide for an exclusive right-turn
       lane along southbound Evans Road that provides at least 150 feet of storage.
   ·   Construct a concrete median in front of this site access to enhance access control.

Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Access #4 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Per the site plan, construct the southbound Access #4 approach to provide for one
        ingress lane and one egress lane (shared left-thru lane).
    · Stripe the required widening along Winfair Drive to provide for an exclusive right-
        turn lane westbound along Winfair Drive.
    · Provide signing on the site access approach to prohibit the right-turn movement out
        of the site.

Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Winfair Drive approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Based on Peak Hour
Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F), installation of a traffic signal is not warranted.
Therefore, the following improvement is recommended at this location:
    · With the construction of the additional lane at the Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge
       Farms Court/Access #1 intersection, restripe the westbound Winfair Drive
       approach at this location to provide for an exclusive left-turn and exclusive right-turn
       lane.
    · Traffic should be monitored at this location in the future for the possibility of
       signalization.

Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the eastbound Winfair Drive and westbound Windbyrne Drive
approaches are projected to operate at unacceptable levels of service in the P.M. peak hour.
Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this location:
   · Restrict both the eastbound Winfair Drive and the westbound Windbyrne Drive
       approaches to right-turn movements only through the installation of a left-over type
       median along Evans Road.
   · Construct two additional lanes on the southbound Evans Road approach to provide
       for an exclusive left-turn (with at least 75 feet of storage), two through lanes, and an
       exclusive right-turn lane (with at least 150 feet of storage).
   · Construct a left-turn lane on the northbound Evans Road approach that provides at
       least 150 feet of storage.

Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that northbound Silverrock Court approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS in the A.M. peak hour, while the southbound Norwell
Boulevard approach is projected to fail in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore,

                                              39
the following improvement is recommended at this location:
    · Based on Peak Hour Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) and the good intersection
        spacing at this location, implementation of a signal is recommended. However, a full
        signal warrant analysis is recommended prior to installation.

Cary Parkway and Sheldon Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at a failing LOS on
the southbound Sheldon Drive approach in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Peak Hour
Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) indicates that a signal is not warranted at this location;
however. In addition, SimTraffic shows better results, as the southbound left-turn movement
can make a two-stage crossing maneuver. With SimTraffic showing better results than the
Synchro analysis, no improvements are recommended at this time. However, traffic should be
monitored at this location in the future for the possibility of signalization.

Site Plan Comments
As shown on the site plan submitted by the developer, the two site accesses along Winfair
Drive are restricted, so as to deter traffic from traversing along Winfair Drive. This is
difficult to enforce and is not recommended; full access would be preferable for circulation.
The turn restrictions would achieve a trip reduction along Winfair Drive, but will result in
increased trips along the main thoroughfares ­ Evans Road and Cary Parkway. If the
development is constructed as proposed with the restrictions in place, it is critical that the
site be interconnected.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configurations and traffic control for 2011 are shown in Figure 18.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a residential development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2015 and consists of the following proposed
use:
     · Apartments ­ 216 dwelling units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four driveways ­ two full accesses along
Winfair Drive, one restricted access along Evans Road and one restricted access along Cary
Parkway (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion
in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
    ·   Cary Parkway and Sheldon Road (unsignalized)
    ·   Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
    ·   Cary Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
    ·   Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
    ·   Evans Road and Rochelle Road/W Dynasty Drive (signalized)
    ·   Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
    ·   Cary Parkway and Access #2 (unsignalized, RIRO)
    ·   Evans Road and Access #3 (unsignalized, RIRO)
    ·   Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Access #4 (unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2012), Background (2015), Build
(2015) and Build (2015) with Improvements. The Existing (2012) scenario includes AM and
PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in September 2012.
The Background (2015) scenario includes existing traffic with three approved developments
and projected annual growth. The Build (2015) scenario includes Background (2015)
volumes with the addition of site trips generated by the proposed development. In addition,
future conditions with proposed mitigations in place were analyzed in a Build (2015) with
Improvements scenario.

Existing (2012) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.

As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page v, all of the study area
intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service, LOS D or better.

Additionally, there are no transit stops, or routes within the study area.

                                                i
Background (2015) Conditions
In the Background (2015) conditions, an annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year (2012)
and the build year (2015). Furthermore, there are three other developments in the vicinity
being constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
development. Site traffic associated with these approved developments, was included in the
Background (2015) analysis.

Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the study area intersections are projected to
continue operating at acceptable levels of service during both peak hours.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The development is proposed to consist of 216 apartment dwelling units. Trip generation
was conducted for each category based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, and the suggested
method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,360 daily site trips, 110 AM
peak hour site trips (22 entering, 88 exiting), and 136 PM peak hour site trips (88 entering, 48
exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing turning
movement counts and land uses.

Additionally, there are currently no transit routes that directly serve the neighborhood or the
proposed development along Winfair Drive (the closest is a CTRAN stop along Norwell
Drive). Several roads in the study area (Evans Road, Cary Parkway, West Dynasty Drive and
Norwell Boulevard) are designated as Cary Commuter Routes with West Dynasty Drive
being the only roadway with existing bike lanes. However, while the existing and proposed
facilities are viable alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, these reductions are deemed to
be negligible, and therefore no multi-modal reductions were taken.

Build (2015) Conditions
The Build (2015) conditions account for both the Background (2015) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development. As shown in the summary LOS table on
page v, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the intersection delay for all study
area intersections; however, all intersections are projected to continue operating at
acceptable levels of service during both peak hours.

The newly constructed access points to the proposed site are also projected to operate
acceptably during both peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have minimal impact on the adjacent roadways. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's APFO and
NCDOT requirements:
Evans Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of Evans Road, the plan dictates a 102-foot, six lane cross-section with a
landscaped median and wide outside travel lanes along curbs and sidewalks on both sides.
Thus the following is recommended along Evans Road:
    · Widen the section of Evans Road along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive
Along this property frontage of Winfair Drive, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector
street design ­ a 37-foot roadway section width, two lane collector avenue section with curb
and sidewalks on both sides. Thus the following is recommended along Winfair Drive:
    · Widen the section of Winfair Drive along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #1 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Restripe all approaches to provide for shared left/thru/right-turn lanes.

Cary Parkway and Access #2 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane, forming a right-in/right-out access point at this location.

Evans Road and Access #3 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the eastbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane, forming a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
    · Stripe the required widening along Evans Road to provide for an exclusive right-turn
        lane along southbound Evans Road that provides at least 100 feet of storage with an
        appropriate taper.
    · Construct a concrete median in front of this site access to enhance access control.

                                              iii
Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Access #4 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #4 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Restripe all approaches to provide for shared left/thru/right-turn lanes.

Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. However, with the required
widening, the geometric improvements are recommended at this location:
    · Stripe the required widening along Evans Road to provide for an exclusive right-turn
        lane along southbound Evans Road that provides at least 100 feet of storage with an
        appropriate taper.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in the table on page v, and the resulting
future lane configurations and traffic control for 2015 are shown in Figures ES on page vi.

1.0    INTRODUCTION
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a residential development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2015 and consists of the following proposed
use:
     · Apartments ­ 216 dwelling units

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via four driveways ­ two full accesses along
Winfair Drive, one restricted access along Evans Road and one restricted access along Cary
Parkway (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion
in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
   ·   Cary Parkway and Sheldon Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Rochelle Road/W Dynasty Drive (signalized)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Access #2 (unsignalized, RIRO)
   ·   Evans Road and Access #3 (unsignalized, RIRO)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Access #4 (unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

 The existing peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4. Traffic volumes
 were adjusted to ensure proper balancing throughout the study area.

 2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                      CRITERIA
 Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
 traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
 Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
 vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
 the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
 Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
 ranges.

          A                Little or no delay          <= 10 sec.             <= 10 sec.
           B              Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.              10-15 sec.
           C             Average traffic delay         20-35 sec.              15-25 sec.
          D                Long traffic delay          35-55 sec.              25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.              35-50 sec.
           F              Unacceptable delay           > 80 sec.                > 50 sec.

The development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone." Level of
service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour (as
defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) with LOS D considered acceptable for
both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service less than LOS D, then
no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections, where the stop controlled approach is below an LOS D under background
conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans
from the Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for
the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output
can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all of the study area intersections are operating at acceptable levels of
service, LOS D or better.

3.0    BACKGROUND (2015) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND
                      AND DEVELOPMENT
Traffic volumes in the area have been in an overall decline over the past half-decade,
however within the past few years there has been a slight increase in volumes. Therefore, a
conservative annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to the study area roadways
and intersections.

In addition, three developments in the vicinity are expected to be completed prior to, or at
the same time as the build-out of the proposed development. Therefore, traffic generated
from these approved or planned projects was included, partially or wholly, in the
Background (2015) scenario where appropriate. These projects include:

Weston Oaks Court Office (11-TAR-327) ­ This office development is being constructed on the
north side of Weston Oaks Court. The development is to consist of a 30,000-square foot
office building and be completed by 2012. A traffic analysis report was prepared by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and submitted to the Town of Cary in September 2011. As
shown in the report, the development is projected to generate 528 daily site trips, 72 AM
peak hour site trips (63 entering, 9 exiting) and 112 PM peak hour site trips (93 entering, 19
exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed
distribution patterns in the report. Field visits indicate that this development is in the
process of being constructed and is expected to fully constructed and occupied by the build
year of this development. Therefore 100% of the traffic associated with the Weston Oaks
Court Office development were included in the Background (2015) analysis for this
development. Figure D-1 in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

Weston Parkway Property (08-TAR-296a) ­ This mixed-use development is proposed to be
constructed in the northeastern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Weston Parkway
intersection. The proposed development is to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail space,
208 apartment units, 155 condominium units, 35 townhome units, and be fully constructed
by 2012. A traffic analysis report was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC and
submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2008. As shown in the report, the proposed
development is projected to generate 331 AM peak hour trips (101 entering, 230 exiting) and
559 PM peak hour trips (318 entering, 241 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study
area intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Field visits
indicate that this development has not been constructed and may not be constructed by the
time this development is constructed. However, to be conservative, 100% of the trips
associated with the Weston Parkway Property development were included in the
Background (2015) analysis for this development. Figure D-2 in Appendix D depicts the
assigned trips.

Park West Village ­ This mixed use development is being constructed in the northwestern
quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection in Morrisville. The
development is to consist of 425 apartments, a 140-room hotel, 50,000 square feet of office
space, an 180,000-square foot discount superstore, and 570,000 square feet of retail space,
including a movie theatre, and be fully constructed by 2010. A traffic analysis report was
prepared by Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. and submitted to the Town of Morrisville in

                                             14
April 2007. Subsequently, two separate memorandums were submitted by Kimley-Horn
with revised trip distributions (July 13, 2007) and revised trip generation based on revised
land uses (March 8, 2010). The March 8, 2010 memorandum shows that the development is
projected to generate 19,620 daily trips, 403 AM peak hour trips (246 entering, 157 exiting)
and 1,899 PM peak hour site trips (931 entering, 968 exiting). These trips were combined
with the trip distribution detailed in the July 13, 2007 memorandum to determine the
projected traffic at the study area intersections. To date, a significant portion of the Park
West Village development has been constructed. Based on field visits, it appears that
approximately 50% of the development (trip-wise) has been constructed. Therefore, it is
assumed in this analysis that the remaining 50% will be constructed and occupied by the
build-out of this development, and so the remaining portion (50%) of the projected trips
were included in the Background (2015) analysis for this development. Figure D-3 in
Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

The total site trips from the approved developments included in the Background (2015)
analysis are included in Figure D-4 in Appendix D. The Background (2015) peak hour trips
are shown in Figure 5.

3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2015) scenario LOS analysis can
be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the study area intersections are projected to
continue operating at acceptable levels of service during both peak hours.

4.0      BUILD (2015) ANALYSIS
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a residential development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed by 2015 and consists of the following proposed
use:
     · Apartments ­ 216 dwelling units


4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The development is proposed to consist of 216 apartment dwelling units. Trip generation
was conducted for each category based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th Edition, and the suggested
method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 1,360 daily site trips, 110 AM
peak hour site trips (22 entering, 88 exiting), and 136 PM peak hour site trips (88 entering, 48
exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing turning
movement counts and land uses.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation of the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
                             ASSIGNMENT
The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and
the land uses in the vicinity of study area as follows:
    · 25% to/from Cary Parkway to the north
    · 13% to/from Cary Parkway to the south
    · 35% to/from Evans Road to the west
    · 22% to/from Evans Road to the east
    · 3% to/from West Dynasty Drive to the east
    · 2% to/from Sheldon Drive to the south

The site trip percentages are depicted in Figure 6 with the resulting trips shown in Figure 7.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
The Build (2015) analysis scenario includes the Background (2015) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 8 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2015) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS
2010). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the build year
analysis. Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the
full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the intersection
delay for all study area intersections; however, all intersections are projected to continue
operating at acceptable levels of service during both peak hours.

The newly constructed access points to the proposed site are also projected to operate
acceptably during both peak hours.

5.0     FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
                     CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have minimal impact on the adjacent roadways. Therefore, the following roadway
improvements are recommended in order to comply with the Town of Cary's APFO and
NCDOT requirements:
Evans Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of Evans Road, the plan dictates a 102-foot, six lane cross-section with a
landscaped median and wide outside travel lanes along curbs and sidewalks on both sides.
Thus the following is recommended along Evans Road:
    · Widen the section of Evans Road along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive
Along this property frontage of Winfair Drive, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector
street design ­ a 37-foot roadway section width, two lane collector avenue section with curb
and sidewalks on both sides. Thus the following is recommended along Winfair Drive:
    · Widen the section of Winfair Drive along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #1 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Restripe all approaches to provide for shared left/thru/right-turn lanes.

Cary Parkway and Access #2 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane, forming a right-in/right-out access point at this location.

Evans Road and Access #3 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the eastbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane, forming a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
    · Stripe the required widening along Evans Road to provide for an exclusive right-turn
        lane along southbound Evans Road that provides at least 100 feet of storage with an
        appropriate taper.


                                             25
   ·   Construct a concrete median in front of this site access to enhance access control.

Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Access #4 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is proposed at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #4 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Restripe all approaches to provide for shared left/thru/right-turn lanes.

Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. However, with the required
widening, the geometric improvements are recommended at this location:
    · Stripe the required widening along Evans Road to provide for an exclusive right-turn
        lane along southbound Evans Road that provides at least 100 feet of storage with an
        appropriate taper.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane
configurations and traffic control for 2015 are shown in Figure 9.

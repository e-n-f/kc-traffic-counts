EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a mixed-use development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed in two phases and consists of the following land
uses:

Phase I (2009)
   · 5,000-square foot gas station with convenience store

Phase II (2013)
   · 22,750 square feet of general retail (2 buildings)
   · 14,750-square foot drug store
   · 4,000-square foot bank (5 drive throughs)
   · 85,000 square feet of medical office (2 buildings)
   · 8,000-square foot general office
   · 100-room hotel with a 50-seat conference center

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Ordinance 05-0009), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to
be completed. The proposed development is expected to be constructed in two phases, with
Phase I to be completed by 2009 and Phase II by 2013. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via five driveways ­ three along Winfair
Drive, one along Evans Road and one along Cary Parkway (Figure 2). The following
intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed
for existing and future conditions, where applicable:

   ·   Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road (signalized ­ Town of Morrisville)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Sheldon Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Weston Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Rochelle Road/West Dynasty Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Site Access #1 (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Site Access #2 (future right-in/right-out)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Valley Woods Drive/Site Access #3 (unsignalized)
   ·   Winfair Drive and River Rock Swim Club Driveway/Site Access #4 (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Site Access #5 (future right-in/right-out)



                                             i
Analysis was performed under seven scenarios: Existing (2008), Background (2009), Phase I
Build (2009), Phase I Build (2009) with Improvements, Background (2013), Phase II Build
(2013), and Phase II Build (2013) with Improvements. The Existing (2008) scenario includes
A.M. and P.M. peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in May
and June 2008. The Background (2009) scenario includes existing traffic with four approved
developments and projected background growth. The Phase I Build (2009) scenario
includes existing volumes with the addition of site trips generated by Phase I of the
proposed development. Future conditions with the proposed mitigation improvements in
place were analyzed in a Phase I Build (2009) with Improvements scenario. The Background
(2013) scenario includes existing traffic with five approved developments and projected
background growth. The Phase II Build (2013) scenario includes existing volumes with the
addition of site trips generated by both Phase I and Phase II of the proposed development.
Future conditions with the proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a
Phase II Build (2013) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2008) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page
ix, the majority of the study area intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service,
LOS D or better. However, two signalized intersections are currently operating under failing
conditions. Specifically, the Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road intersection is operating at
LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F in the P.M. peak hour, while the intersection of
Cary Parkway and Evans Road is operating at LOS E in the P.M. peak hour.

Background (2009) Conditions
In the Background (2009) conditions, an annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year (2008)
and the build year (2009). Furthermore, there are four other developments in the vicinity
being constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
development. Site traffic, as well as any mitigation improvements (with the exception of
TAR 296), associated with these approved developments were included in the Background
(2009) analysis.

Based on the Background (2009) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area will
experience an improvement in level of service, which can be attributed to both optimized
signal timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the intersection of Cary
Parkway and Chapel Hill Road is projected to experience a rise in level of service ­ LOS E
to LOS D in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F to LOS D in the P.M. peak hour. Also, the
Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection is projected to experience a rise in level of
service in the P.M. peak hour ­ from LOS E to LOS C. These improvements in level of
service can be attributed to optimized signal timings and intersection improvements at these
locations.

In addition, the stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court at Cary Parkway is projected
to operate at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour, while stop-controlled southbound Norwell
Boulevard at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. Also,
the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach along Cary Parkway is projected to

                                              ii
operate at LOS E in the P.M. peak hour.

Background (2013) Conditions
In the Background (2013) conditions, an annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year (2008)
and the build year (2013). Furthermore, there are five other developments in the vicinity
being constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
development. Site traffic, as well as any mitigation improvements, associated with these
approved developments were included in the Background (2013) analysis.

Based on the Background (2013) analysis, the majority of the intersections will experience an
increase in intersection delay. However, the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection is
projected to operate at better-than-Existing conditions in the P.M. peak hour (LOS E to
LOS D), while the Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road intersection is projected to
experience better-than-Existing level of service in the P.M. peak hour (LOS F to LOS E),
while continuing to operate LOS E in the A.M. peak hour. These improvements in level of
service can be attributed to optimized signal timings and improvements at these locations.

The Weston Parkway and Evans Road intersection is projected to degrade from LOS D to
LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS C to LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. In addition,
stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS
F in the A.M. peak hour, while stop-controlled southbound Norwell Boulevard at Cary
Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The
northbound Winfair Drive approach at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS E
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Also, the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon
Drive approach at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
Phase I (2009) of the development is proposed to consist of a 5,000-square foot gas station
with convenience store. Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE
Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's
"Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet, the proposed development is projected to generate 2,604 daily
site trips, 61 A.M. peak hour site trips (31 entering, 30 exiting), and 94 P.M. peak hour site
trips (47 entering, 47 exiting). Pass-by rates of 62% and 56% were applied to the A.M. and
P.M. peak hour traffic, respectively. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with
the existing turning movement counts and land uses.

Phase II (2013) of the development is proposed to consist of a 5,000-square foot gas station
with convenience store (from Phase I), 22,750 square feet of general retail space, a 14,750-
square foot drug store, a 4,000-square foot bank, 85,000 square feet of medical office space,
an 8,000-square foot general office and a 100-room hotel with a 50-seat conference center.
Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th
Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation"
Spreadsheet, the proposed development is projected to generate 12,111 daily site trips, 344
A.M. peak hour site trips (206 entering, 138 exiting), and 590 P.M. peak hour site trips (260
entering, 330 exiting). Pass-by rates of 62% and 56% were applied to the A.M. and P.M.
peak hour traffic associated with the gas station. Additionally, P.M. peak hour pass-by rates

                                              iii
of 34%, 49% and 47% were applied to the retail, drug store, and bank portions of the
development respecitively. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the
existing turning movement counts and land uses.

Phase I Build (2009) Conditions
The Phase I Build (2009) conditions account for both the Background (2009) traffic and the
site traffic generated by the Phase I of the proposed development. As shown in the
summary LOS table on page ix, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the
intersection delay for all study area intersections. As a result, stop-controlled northbound
Silverrock Court at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour,
while stop-controlled southbound Norwell Boulevard at Cary Parkway is projected to
operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. The stop-controlled northbound Winfair Drive
approach along Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F during both the A.M. and
P.M. peak hours. Also, the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach at Cary
Parkway is projected to operate at LOS E in the P.M. peak hour. All of the newly
constructed access points are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service.

Phase II Build (2013) Conditions
The Phase II Build (2013) conditions account for both the Background (2013) traffic and the
site traffic generated by the Phase II of the proposed development. As shown in the
summary LOS table on page ix, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the
intersection delay for all study area intersections. Specifically, the Cary Parkway and Evans
Road intersections id projected to degrade from LOS D to LOS E in the P.M. peak hour.
The Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road intersection is projected to decline from LOS E to
LOS F in the P.M. peak hour, while continuing to operate at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour.
Additionally, the Weston Parkway and Evans Road intersection is projected to continue
operating at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and continue operating at LOS F in the P.M.
peak hour.

In addition, stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court at Cary Parkway is projected to
operate at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour, while stop-controlled southbound Norwell
Boulevard at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak
hours. The stop-controlled northbound Winfair Drive approach at Cary Parkway is
projected to operate at LOS F during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Also, the stop-
controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at
LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The stop-controlled eastbound Winfair Drive
and westbound Windbyrne Drive approaches along Evans Road are projected to operate at
failing LOS F during the P.M. peak hour. All of the newly constructed site access points are
projected to operate at acceptable levels of service.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have an impact on the adjacent roadways. Therefore, the following roadway improvements
are recommended based on the Town of Cary's APFO and NCDOT requirements:
Phase I (2009)
Winfair Drive
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of roadway, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector street design ­
a 45-foot, two lane cross-section with curb and sidewalks on both sides. Thus the following
is recommended along Winfair Drive:
     · Widen the section of Winfair Drive along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #1 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Construct an additional lane on the eastbound Winfair Drive approach. Stripe the
        laneage to provide for an exclusive left-turn and a shared through-right-turn lane.

Cary Parkway and Access #2 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane so as to form a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
    · Widen the northbound approach of Cary Parkway to provide for a right-turn lane
        with 100 feet of storage length.

Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Winfair Drive approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the
following improvement is recommended at this location:
    · With the construction of the additional lane at the Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge
        Farms Court/Access #1 intersection, restripe the westbound Winfair Drive
        approach at this location to provide for an exclusive left-turn and exclusive right-turn
        lane.

Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that northbound Silverrock Court approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS in the A.M. peak hour, while the southbound Norwell
Boulevard approach is projected to fail in the P.M. peak hour. Therefore, the following


                                               v
improvement is recommended at this location:
   · Based on Peak Hour Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) and the good intersection
      spacing at this location, implementation of a signal is recommended. However, a full
      signal warrant analysis is recommended prior to installation.

Phase II (2013)

Evans Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of roadway, the plan dictates a 102-foot, six lane cross-section with a
landscaped median and wide outside travel lanes along curbs and sidewalks on both sides.
Thus the following is recommended along Evans Road:
    · Widen the section of Evans Road along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Winfair Drive
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of roadway, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector street design ­
a 45-foot, two lane cross-section with curb and sidewalks on both sides. Thus the following
is recommended along Winfair Drive:
     · Widen the section of Winfair Drive along the frontage of the proposed development
        to half of the cross-section required by the Town of Cary.

Weston Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that intersection is projected to operate at unacceptable levels
of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this location:
   · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along Weston Parkway that
       provides at least 150 feet of storage. Restripe the existing shared through-right lane
       to an exclusive through lane. Upgrade the signal phasing to accommodate the newly
       constructed westbound right-turn lane as a permitted+overlapping phase. Note, this
       improvement was also required in the 08-TAR-296 study.

Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at unacceptable
LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. Therefore, the following
improvements are recommended at this location:
   · Construct an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane along Cary Parkway that provides at
       least 150 feet of storage. Restripe the existing shared through-right lane to an
       exclusive through lane. Upgrade the signal phasing to accommodate the newly
       constructed westbound right-turn lane as a permitted+overlapping phase. Note, this
       improvement was also required in the 08-TAR-296 study.
   · Construct an exclusive northbound right-turn lane along Chapel Hill Road that
       provides at least 150 feet of storage. Restripe the existing shared through-right lane
       to an exclusive through lane. Upgrade the signal phasing to accommodate the newly

                                              vi
       constructed northbound right-turn lane as a permitted+overlapping phase.

Cary Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at unacceptable
LOS E in the P.M. peak hour. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at
this location:
    · Construct an additional eastbound left-turn lane along Cary Parkway to form dual
        left-turn lanes.
    · Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane along Evans Road that provides
        at least 150 feet of storage. Restripe the existing shared through-right lane to an
        exclusive through lane. Upgrade the signal phasing to accommodate the newly
        constructed southbound right-turn lane as a permitted+overlapping phase.

Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the eastbound Winfair Drive approach is projected to operate at
unacceptable levels of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the
following improvements are recommended at this location:
    · Restrict both the eastbound Winfair Drive and the westbound Windbyrne Drive
        approaches to right-turn movements only.
    · Construct two additional lanes on the southbound Evans Road approach to provide
        for an exclusive left-turn (with at least 75 feet of storage), two through lanes, and an
        exclusive right-turn lane (with at least 150 feet of storage).
    · Construct a left-turn lane on the northbound Evans Road approach that provides at
        least 150 feet of storage.

Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Winfair Drive approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the
following improvement is recommended at this location:
    · With the construction of the additional lane at the Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge
        Farms Court/Access #1 intersection, restripe the westbound Winfair Drive
        approach at this location to provide for an exclusive left-turn and exclusive right-turn
        lane.
    · Based on Peak Hour Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) and the good spacing at
        this location, implementation of a signal is recommended. However, a full signal
        warrant analysis is recommended prior to installation.

Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that northbound Silverrock Court approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable levels of service in the A.M. peak hour, while the southbound
Norwell Boulevard approach is projected to fail in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours.
Therefore, the following improvement is recommended at this location:
   · Based on Peak Hour Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) and the good spacing at
       this location, implementation of a signal is recommended. However, a full signal
       warrant analysis is recommended prior to installation.



                                              vii
Cary Parkway and Sheldon Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at LOS F on the
southbound Sheldon Drive approach in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. However,
SimTraffic shows better results. In addition, the southbound left-turn movement can make
two-stage crossing maneuver. With the installation of a new traffic signal at the adjacent
Winfair Drive intersection, there should be sufficient gaps to make the two-stage maneuver.
Traffic should be monitored at this location in the future for the possibility of signalization.

Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #1 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Construct an additional lane on the eastbound Winfair Drive approach. Stripe the
        laneage to provide for an exclusive left-turn and a shared through-right-turn lane.

Cary Parkway and Access #2 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the northbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane so as to form a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
    · Construct an exclusive right-turn lane along westbound Cary Parkway that provides
        at least 100 feet of storage.

Winfair Drive and Rose Valley Woods Drive/Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.

Winfair Drive and Swim Club Drive/Access #4 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the southbound Access #4 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Stripe the required widening along Winfair Drive to provide for an exclusive right-
        turn lane westbound along Winfair Drive.

Evans Road and Access #5 (RIRO)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
level of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following
driveway configuration is recommended at this location:


                                              viii
·   Construct the eastbound Access #5 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
    one egress lane so as to form a right-in/right-out access point at this location.
·   Stripe the required widening along Evans Road to provide for an exclusive right-turn
    lane along southbound Evans Road that provides at least 150 feet of storage.

1.0    INTRODUCTION
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a mixed-use development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed in two phases and consists of the following land
uses:

Phase I (2009)
   · 5,000-square foot gas station with convenience store

Phase II (2013)
   · 22,750 square feet of general retail (2 buildings)
   · 14,750-square foot drug store
   · 4,000-square foot bank (5 drive throughs)
   · 85,000 square feet of medical office (2 buildings)
   · 8,000-square foot general office
   · 100-room hotel with a 50-seat conference center

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Ordinance 05-0009), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to
be completed. The proposed development is expected to be constructed in two phases, with
Phase I to be completed by 2009 and Phase II by 2013. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via five driveways ­ three along Winfair
Drive, one along Evans Road and one along Cary Parkway (Figure 2). The following
intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed
for existing and future conditions, where applicable:

   ·   Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road (signalized ­ Town of Morrisville)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Sheldon Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Winfair Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Weston Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Winfair Drive/Windbyrne Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Rochelle Road/West Dynasty Drive (unsignalized)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Pebble Ridge Farms Court/Site Access #1 (unsignalized)
   ·   Cary Parkway and Site Access #2 (future right-in/right-out)
   ·   Winfair Drive and Valley Woods Drive/Site Access #3 (unsignalized)
   ·   Winfair Drive and River Rock Swim Club Driveway/Site Access #4 (unsignalized)
   ·   Evans Road and Site Access #5 (future right-in/right-out)

      2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                           CRITERIA
      Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
      traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
      Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
      vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
      the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
      Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
      ranges.

          A                Little or no delay          <= 10 sec.             <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.              10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay         20-35 sec.              15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay           35-55 sec.              25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.              35-50 sec.
           F             Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.               > 50 sec.

The development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone." Level of
service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour (as
defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) with LOS D considered acceptable for
both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service less than LOS D, then
no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections, where the stop controlled approach is below an LOS D under background
conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans from the
Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the
Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, the majority of the study area intersections are operating at
acceptable levels of service, LOS D or better. However, two signalized intersections are
currently operating under failing conditions. Specifically, the Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill
Road intersection is operating at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F in the P.M. peak
hour, while the intersection of Cary Parkway and Evans Road is operating at LOS E in the
P.M. peak hour.

3.0    BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND
                      AND DEVELOPMENT
A general background growth rate of three percent (3%) was applied to the study area
roadways and intersections based on previous studies conducted in the area (as shown in
Table 4).

In addition, four developments in the vicinity are expected to be completed prior to, or at
the same time as the Phase I (2009) build-out of the proposed development, while five
developments are expected to be completed around same time as the Phase II (2013) build-
out. Therefore, traffic generated from these approved or planned projects was therefore
included, partially or wholly, in the Background (2009) and Background (2013) scenarios
where appropriate. These projects include:

Twin Lakes Amendment (03-TAR-145A) ­ This mixed use development is proposed to be
constructed along Davis Drive, south of McCrimmon Parkway. The proposed development
is to consist of 159 detached single-family dwelling units, 662 townhomes, 150 assisted living
dwelling units, 250,000 square feet of retail space, four high-turnover sit down restaurants
totaling 28,000 square feet (7,000 square feet each) and 100,000 square feet of office space
and be fully constructed by 2011. A traffic analysis report was prepared by The Sear Brown
Group and submitted to the Town of Cary in August 2003 (with revisions in December
2003 and February 2004). As shown in 03-TAR-145a, the proposed development is
projected to generate 1,176 A.M. peak hour trips (548 entering, 628 exiting) and 1,254 P.M.
peak hour trips (669 entering, 585 exiting). As the development has already been partially
built and occupied, only a portion of the projected site trips were distributed to the study
area intersections, in both the Background (2009) and Background (2013) scenarios based on
the assumed distribution patterns in 03-TAR-145a. Figure D-1 in Appendix D depicts the
total assigned trips.

Park West Village ­ This mixed use development is proposed to be constructed in the
northwestern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection in Morrisville.
The proposed development is to consist of 425 apartments, a 140-room hotel, 50,000 square
feet of office space, a 180,000-square foot discount superstore, and 570,000 square feet of
retail space, including a movie theatre, and be fully constructed by 2010. A traffic analysis
report was prepared by Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. and submitted to the Town of
Morrisville in April 2007. As shown in the report, the proposed development is projected to
generate 1,158 A.M. peak hour trips (615 entering, 543 exiting) and 3,148 P.M. peak hour
trips (1,523 entering, 1,625 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report for both the
Background (2009) and Background (2013) scenarios. Figure D-2 in Appendix D depicts
the total assigned trips.

Morrisville Manor ­ This senior housing development is proposed to be constructed in the
southeastern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection. The
proposed development is to consist of 214 bedrooms and be completed by 2009. A traffic
analysis report was not required of this development. The proposed development is
projected to generate 30 A.M. peak hour trips (15 entering, 15 exiting) and 43 P.M. peak

                                             18
hour trips (26 entering, 17 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report for both the
Background (2009) and Background (2013) scenarios. Figure D-3 in Appendix D depicts
the assigned trips.

Weston Parkway Property (08-TAR-296) ­ This mixed use development is proposed to be
constructed in the northeastern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Weston Parkway
intersection. The proposed development is to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail space,
208 apartment units, 155 condominium units, 35 townhome units, and be fully constructed
by 2012. A traffic analysis report was prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC. and
submitted to the Town of Cary in May 2008. As shown in the report, the proposed
development is projected to generate 331 A.M. peak hour trips (101 entering, 230 exiting)
and 559 P.M. peak hour trips (318 entering, 241 exiting). These trips were distributed to the
study area intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report for only the
Background (2013) scenario. Figure D-4 in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips.

The total site trips from the approved developments included in the Background (2009) and
Background (2013) analysis are included in Figures D-5 and D-6, respectively, in Appendix
D. The Background (2009) and Background (2013) peak hour trips are shown in Figures 7
and 8, respectively.


3.2 FUTURE ROADWAY IMPROV
                   IMPROVEMENTS
The Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan includes roadway improvements in
the future for Evans Road and Winfair Drive. Ultimately, Evans Road will have a six-lane
cross-section with a raised median and wide outside travel lanes along with curbs and
sidewalks on both sides as shown in Figure 5. Winfair Drive will have a two-lane cross-
section with curbs and sidewalks on both sides as shown in Figure 6. These improvements
are depicted in Appendix E and were included in the Background (2009) and Background
(2013) analysis.

The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of roadway, the plan dictates a 102-foot, six lane cross-section with a
landscaped median and wide outside travel lanes along curbs and sidewalks on both sides.

The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
Along this section of roadway, the plan dictates a standard two-lane collector street design ­
a 45-foot, two lane cross-section with curb and sidewalks on both sides.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2009) and Background (2013)
scenario LOS analyses can be found in Tables 4 and 5 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2009) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area will
experience an improvement in level of service, which can be attributed to both optimized
signal timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the intersection of Cary
Parkway and Chapel Hill Road is projected to experience a rise in level of service ­ LOS E
to LOS D in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F to LOS D in the P.M. peak hour. Also, the
Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection is projected to experience a rise in level of
service in the P.M. peak hour ­ from LOS E to LOS C. These improvements in level of
service can be attributed to optimized signal timings and intersection improvements at these
locations.

In addition, the stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court at Cary Parkway is projected
to operate at LOS F in the A.M. peak hour, while stop-controlled southbound Norwell
Boulevard at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. Also,
the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon Drive approach along Cary Parkway is projected to
operate at LOS E in the P.M. peak hour.

Based on the Background (2013) analysis, the majority of the intersections will experience an
increase in intersection delay. However, the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection is
projected to operate at better-than-Existing conditions in the P.M. peak hour (LOS E to
LOS D), while the Cary Parkway and Chapel Hill Road intersection is projected to
experience better-than-Existing level of service in the P.M. peak hour (LOS F to LOS E),
while continuing to operate LOS E in the A.M. peak hour. These improvements in level of
service can be attributed to optimized signal timings and improvements at these locations.

The Weston Parkway and Evans Road intersection is projected to degrade from LOS D to
LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS C to LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. In addition,
stop-controlled northbound Silverrock Court at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS
F in the A.M. peak hour, while stop-controlled southbound Norwell Boulevard at Cary
Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The
northbound Winfair Drive approach at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS E
during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Also, the stop-controlled southbound Sheldon
Drive approach at Cary Parkway is projected to operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour.

4.0    BUILD ANALYSIS
The Singh Development Company plans to construct a mixed-use development in the
southeastern quadrant of the Cary Parkway and Evans Road intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to be constructed in two phases and consists of the following land
uses:

Phase I (2009)
   · 5,000-square foot gas station with convenience store

Phase II (2013)
   · 22,750 square feet of general retail (2 buildings)
   · 14,750-square foot drug store
   · 4,000-square foot bank (5 drive throughs)
   · 85,000 square feet of medical office (2 buildings)
   · 8,000-square foot general office
   · 100-room hotel with a 50-seat conference center

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Ordinance 05-0009), requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to
be completed. The proposed development is expected to be constructed in two phases, with
Phase I to be completed by 2009 and Phase II by 2013.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Phase I (2009) of the development is proposed to consist of a 5,000-square foot gas station
with convenience store. Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE
Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's
"Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet, the proposed development is projected to generate 2,604 daily
site trips, 61 A.M. peak hour site trips (31 entering, 30 exiting), and 94 P.M. peak hour site
trips (47 entering, 47 exiting). Pass-by rates of 62% and 56% were applied to the A.M. and
P.M. peak hour traffic, respectively. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with
the existing turning movement counts and land uses.

Phase II (2013) of the development is proposed to consist of a 5,000-square foot gas station
with convenience store (from Phase I), 22,750 square feet of general retail space, a 14,750-
square foot drug store, a 4,000-square foot bank, 85,000 square feet of medical office space,
an 8,000-square foot general office and a 100-room hotel with a 50-seat conference center.
Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th
Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation"
Spreadsheet, the proposed development is projected to generate 12,111 daily site trips, 344
A.M. peak hour site trips (206 entering, 138 exiting), and 590 P.M. peak hour site trips (260
entering, 330 exiting). Pass-by rates of 62% and 56% were applied to the A.M. and P.M.
peak hour traffic associated with the gas station. Additionally, P.M. peak hour pass-by rates
of 34%, 49% and 47% were applied to the retail, drug store, and bank portions of the
development respecitively. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the
existing turning movement counts and land uses.

Tables 6 and 7 summarize the assumed trip generation Phase I and Phase II of the proposed
development for typical weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

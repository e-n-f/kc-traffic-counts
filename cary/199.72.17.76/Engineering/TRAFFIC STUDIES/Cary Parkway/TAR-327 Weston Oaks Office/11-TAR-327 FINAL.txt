EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
An office development is proposed to be constructed on the north side of Weston Oaks
Court in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is projected to be completed by 2012 and
consist of a 30,000-square foot office building.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The Site Plan proposes two driveway accesses ­ one along Weston Oaks Court directly
across from the existing easternmost Biologics Rx Express driveway and one that will result
in a new driveway that will tie into the existing roundabout at the end of Weston Oaks Court
(Figure 2).

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       Weston Parkway and Norwell Boulevard (signalized)
       Norwell Boulevard and Weston Oaks Court (unsignalized)
       Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
       Weston Oaks Court and Biologics Rx Express Driveway/Site Access #1
       (unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2011), Background (2012), Build
(2012) and Build (2012) with Improvements. The Existing (2011) scenario includes AM and
PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in April 2011. The
Background (2012) scenario includes existing traffic along with site traffic from one future
development in the study area. The Build (2012) scenario includes Background (2012)
volumes with the addition of site trips generated by the proposed development. Future
conditions with the proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a Build
(2012) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2011) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.

As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page v, all of the study area
intersections are currently operating at acceptable levels of service, with one exception.
Specifically, the northbound stop-controlled Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway
is currently operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour; however there are only six (6) vehicles
exiting on this approach during that time period.




                                             i
Background (2012) Conditions
In the Background (2012) conditions, an annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for normal traffic growth between the base year
(2011) and the build year (2012) based on a recent study in the area. In addition, site traffic
from one future development in the vicinity of the study area (Weston Lakeside
Apartments/11-TAR-322) was included in the background traffic for this study. No
mitigations from the Weston Lakeside Apartments study were included in this study, as none
of the study area intersections overlap between the two studies.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, all of the study area intersections are projected to
continue operating at acceptable levels of service with the exception of the northbound stop-
controlled Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway, which is projected to continue
operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour (a 2.3-second increase in intersection delay when
compared to the Existing (2011) AM peak hour) while only servicing six (6) vehicles.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The development is proposed to consist of a 30,000-square foot office building. Trip
generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 528 daily site trips, 72 AM
peak hour site trips (63 entering, 9 exiting), and 112 PM peak hour site trips (93 entering, 19
exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing turning
movement counts and surrounding land uses.

Build (2012) Conditions
The Build (2012) conditions account for both the Background (2012) traffic and the site
traffic generated by the proposed development.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page v, the addition of site trips will not result in
any significant level of service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS)
at any study area intersections. As a result, all of the existing study area intersections are
projected to continue operating acceptably as in the Existing (2011) and Background (2012)
scenarios, with the exception of the northbound stop-controlled Silverrock Court approach
along Cary Parkway which is projected to degrade to LOS F in the AM peak hour (a 5.9-
second increase in intersection delay when compared to the Background (2012) AM peak
hour), while continuing to service only six (6) vehicles.

The newly constructed southbound stop-controlled Access #1 approach is projected to
operate at LOS A in the AM and PM peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a very minor impact on the roadways and intersections within the study area. The

                                               ii
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's APFO
and NCDOT requirements:
Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound stop-controlled Silverrock Court approach
at this location is projected to operate at LOS E in the Background (2012) conditions and
LOS F in the Build (2012) conditions in the AM peak hour, while operating at an acceptable
level of service during the PM peak hour. The southbound stop-controlled Norwell
Boulevard approach at this location is projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Consideration was given to constructing an additional egress lane along the Silverrock Court
approach; however, due to the minor traffic volumes on this approach (6 total egressing
vehicles during the AM peak hour), the reduction in delay was not sufficient enough to meet
the Town's APFO requirements.

A signal warrant analysis was conducted for the Existing (2011), Background (2012) and
Build (2012) scenarios (included in Appendix E) that shows that a signal is not currently
warranted at this location and will not be warranted based on the projected 2012 volumes.

Finally, SimTraffic simulation shows the operations to be better than reported in the
Synchro reports, indicating sufficient gaps in traffic to service the side street volume;
therefore, no improvements are recommended at this location.

Weston Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Verizon Entrance (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at acceptable levels
of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, no improvements are
recommended at this location.

Norwell Boulevard and Weston Oaks Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the westbound stop-controlled Weston Oaks Court
approach at this location is projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during both
the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, no improvements are recommended at this
location.

Weston Oaks Court and Biologics Rx Express Driveway/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound stop-controlled Biologics Rx Express
Driveway and the southbound stop-controlled Access #1 approach at this location are
projected to operate at acceptable levels of service for both the AM and PM peak hours.
Therefore, to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site, the following is
recommended:
     Construct the Access #1 approach to provide for one egress and one ingress lane.




                                                iii
Weston Oaks Court and Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
Analysis was not performed on this intersection, due to the nature of the configuration.
This intersection will have no conflicting movements and will result in the construction of a
new road that will tie into the eastern side of the existing roundabout at the eastern end of
Weston Oaks Court. Therefore, to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site, the
following is recommended:
     Construct the shared driveway and Access #2 as shown on the site plan to provide
        for one egress and one ingress lane.

   No further improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
An office development is proposed to be constructed on the north side of Weston Oaks
Court in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is projected to be completed by 2012 and
consist of a 30,000-square foot office building.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The site plan proposes two driveway accesses ­ one along Weston Oaks Court directly
across from the existing easternmost Biologics Rx Express driveway and one that will result
in a new driveway that will tie into the existing roundabout at the end of Weston Oaks Court
(Figure 2).

The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       Weston Parkway and Norwell Boulevard (signalized)
       Norwell Boulevard and Weston Oaks Court (unsignalized)
       Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
       Weston Oaks Court and Biologics Rx Express Driveway/Site Access #1
       (unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

   No turning movement count was conducted for the Weston Oaks Court and Biologics Rx
   Express Driveway; however field observations made while conducting the turning
   movement count at the Norwell Boulevard and Weston Oaks Court intersection suggest that
   the majority of vehicles accessing Weston Oaks Court turn into the first Biologics Rx
   Express Driveway on the south side of the road, or the Independent Insurance Agents of
   North Carolina Driveway on the north side. Therefore, for this analysis, only 25% of the
   traffic accessing Weston Oaks Court was assumed to utilize the second (easternmost)
   Biologics Rx Driveway. The resulting peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in
   Figure 4.

   2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
   Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
   traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
   Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
   vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
   the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
   Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
   ranges.

          A                Little or no delay         <= 10 sec.              <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay         10-20 sec.               10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay        20-35 sec.               15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay          35-55 sec.               25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay       55-80 sec.               35-50 sec.
           F             Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.               > 50 sec.

The planned Weston Oaks Office is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone"
as defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities
Planning and Development for Roads (APFR). Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone"
is based on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable for both
signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For signalized intersections, when the
background analysis yields a level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall
intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where
the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the
installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the intersection meets required
warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the
surrounding roadway system.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal plans from the Town of Cary,
which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario
LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in
Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all of the study area intersections are currently operating at
acceptable levels of service, with one exception. Specifically, the northbound stop-
controlled Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway is currently operating at LOS E in
the AM peak hour; however there are only six (6) vehicles exiting on this approach during
that time period.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2012) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Based on a previous study conducted in the area, a growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied to the study area roadways and intersections to account for normal traffic growth
between the existing (2011) and build (2012) years.

In addition, there is one future development in the study area expected to be partially or fully
constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed development.
Therefore, site trips from that development were included in the Background (2012) analysis.

Lofts at Weston Lakeside (11-TAR-322) ­ This residential development consists of 240
apartment units along Winstead Drive and Old Reedy Creek Road, north of Weston
Parkway and is scheduled to be constructed by 2012. A traffic analysis report (11-TAR-322)
was prepared by M/A/B and a draft was submitted to the Town of Cary in April 2011. The
associated traffic was distributed through the study area intersections in this TAR, as shown
in Figure D-1 of Appendix D. There are no mitigations associated with TAR-322 that
overlap study area intersections in this TAR

The resulting Background (2012) volumes are shown in Figure 5.


3.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background (2012) scenario
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2012) scenario LOS analyses can
be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, all of the study area intersections are projected to
continue operating at acceptable levels of service with the exception of the northbound stop-
controlled Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway, which is projected to continue
operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour (a 2.3-second increase in intersection delay when
compared to the Existing (2011) AM peak hour) while only servicing six (6) vehicles. all of
the study area intersections are projected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service
with the exception of the northbound stop-controlled Silverrock Court approach along Cary
Parkway, which is projected to continue operating at LOS E in the AM peak hour (a 2.3-
second increase in intersection delay when compared to the Existing (2011) AM peak hour)
while only servicing six (6) vehicles.

4.0 BUILD (2012) ANALYSIS
An office development is proposed to be constructed on the north side of Weston Oaks
Court in Cary, NC (Figure 1). The development is projected to be completed by 2012 and
consist of a 30,000-square foot office building.


4.1 TRIP GENERATION
The development is proposed to consist of a 30,000-square foot office building. Trip
generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition.

As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 528 daily site trips, 72 AM
peak hour site trips (63 entering, 9 exiting), and 112 PM peak hour site trips (93 entering, 19
exiting). The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing turning
movement counts and surrounding land uses.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2012) analysis scenario includes the Background (2012) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 8 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2012) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the full
Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant level of
service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area
intersections. As a result, all of the existing study area intersections are projected to continue
operating acceptably as in the Existing (2011) and Background (2012) scenarios, with the
exception of the northbound stop-controlled Silverrock Court approach along Cary Parkway
which is projected to degrade to LOS F in the AM peak hour (a 5.9-second increase in
intersection delay when compared to the Background (2012) AM peak hour), while
continuing to service only six (6) vehicles.

The newly constructed southbound stop-controlled Access #1 approach is projected to
operate at LOS A in the AM and PM peak hours.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have a very minor impact on the roadways and intersections within the study area. The
following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's APFO
and NCDOT requirements:
Cary Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Silverrock Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound stop-controlled Silverrock Court approach
at this location is projected to operate at LOS E in the Background (2012) conditions and
LOS F in the Build (2012) conditions in the AM peak hour, while operating at an acceptable
level of service during the PM peak hour. The southbound stop-controlled Norwell
Boulevard approach at this location is projected to operate at acceptable levels of service
during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Consideration was given to constructing an additional egress lane along the Silverrock Court
approach; however, due to the minor traffic volumes on this approach (6 total egressing
vehicles during the AM peak hour), the reduction in delay was not sufficient enough to meet
the Town's APFO requirements.

A signal warrant analysis was conducted for the Existing (2011), Background (2012) and
Build (2012) scenarios (included in Appendix E) that shows that a signal is not currently
warranted at this location and will not be warranted based on the projected 2012 volumes.

Finally, SimTraffic simulation shows the operations to be better than reported in the
Synchro reports, indicating sufficient gaps in traffic to service the side street volume;
therefore, no improvements are recommended at this location.

Weston Parkway and Norwell Boulevard/Verizon Entrance (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate at acceptable levels
of service during both the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, no improvements are
recommended at this location.

Norwell Boulevard and Weston Oaks Court (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the westbound stop-controlled Weston Oaks Court
approach at this location is projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during both
the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, no improvements are recommended at this
location.

Weston Oaks Court and Biologics Rx Express Driveway/Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound stop-controlled Biologics Rx Express
Driveway and the southbound stop-controlled Access #1 approach at this location are
projected to operate at acceptable levels of service for both the AM and PM peak hours.
Therefore, to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site, the following is
recommended:
     Construct the Access #1 approach to provide for one egress and one ingress lane.




                                     22
Weston Oaks Court and Site Access #2 (unsignalized)
Analysis was not performed on this intersection, due to the nature of the configuration.
This intersection will have no conflicting movements and will result in the construction of a
new road that will tie into the eastern side of the existing roundabout at the eastern end of
Weston Oaks Court. Therefore, to provide safe ingress and egress to and from the site, the
following is recommended:
     Construct the shared driveway and Access #2 as shown on the site plan to provide
        for one egress and one ingress lane.

No further improvements are recommended. A summary of LOS results across scenarios is
shown in Table 7, and the resulting future lane configuration and traffic control for 2012 are
depicted in Figure 9.

                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


I. Project Description

The Searstone Development is being proposed for construction at the
intersection of Davis Drive and High House Road in Cary, North Carolina. The
development will include a 175,000 square-foot (SF) shopping center, 75,000 SF
of office development, 298 one bedroom residential units, 232 (one and two
bedroom) age restricted apartments, 46 (one and two bedroom) age restricted
condominiums, 108 (one, two, and three bedroom) age restricted single family
homes, 30 (one and two bedroom) age restricted apartments ­ (located above
the proposed Clubhouse), a 200 room hotel, and a 155 bed healthcare facility.
Figure ES-1 shows the general site location of the development. The proposed
development will be located in the southeast quadrant of the intersection of Davis
Drive and High House Road. The proposed development is scheduled to be
completed by 2013. This report analyzes the 2007 existing year traffic
conditions, the no-build scenario for 2013, the full build-out scenario for the year
2013, as well as the full 2013 build-out scenario with mitigated improvements.

The proposed site is currently undeveloped. Figure ES-2 shows a preliminary
proposed project site plan and location of five site driveways connecting to both
Davis Drive and High House Road. Figure ES-2 also shows the specific
locations of the proposed lots and internal roadways. The internal roadways
were not examined as part of this study.

This report analyzes and presents the traffic impacts that the proposed
Searstone Development will have on the following (existing* and future)
intersections:

       ·   Davis Drive and High House Road*
       ·   High House Road and Legault Drive / Prestonwood Parkway*
       ·   High House Road and Cary Parkway*
       ·   High House Road and Stone Creek Village Drive / Cornerstone Drive*
       ·   High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road*
       ·   Davis Drive and Cornerstone Drive* / Full Access Drive 1
       ·   Davis Drive and Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood Boulevard*
       ·   Davis Drive and Preston Village Way / Hogans Valley Way*
       ·   Davis Drive and RIRO Drive 2
       ·   High House Road and RIRO Drive 3
       ·   High House Road and Full Access Drive 4
       ·   High House Road and RIRO Drive 5 (With Left-Over Access)

The impacts of the Searstone Development site traffic on the above existing and
future intersections will be evaluated during the AM and PM peak hours of a

typical weekday. The following analysis is based on the 2007 existing year
traffic, the 2013 traffic with the addition of ambient growth and background traffic
volumes, the 2013 total traffic with the addition of the estimated site-generated
traffic produced by the Searstone Development, and 2013 total traffic with
mitigated improvements. Currently there are three background developments to
be completed within the surrounding region. These developments include:

        ·   TAR-196 Cornerstone Office Building
        ·   TAR-201 Rabon Property
        ·   TAR-207 Davis Drive Office, Self Storage, and Day Care

In addition to the background traffic volume from these developments, to account
for area-wide future ambient traffic growth, an annual growth rate percentage of
3.0 percent was applied to the existing volumes. This value was obtained
through conversations with Town of Cary Staff.

II. Existing Conditions

The project study area is currently serviced by three major corridors: Davis Drive,
High House Road, and Cary Parkway. Each facility is currently four lanes and
each services residential and commercial developments. In addition, several
minor facilities and site driveways complete the study area. Currently there are
two ongoing Town of Cary and Developer funded roadway / intersection projects
planned for completion prior to the 2013 project build-out year. Prior to the onset
of construction on the Searstone Development, widening will occur along High
House Road in two locations: 1) the intersection of Davis Drive / High House
Road and 2) High House Road / Carpenter Upchurch Road.

There are currently seven signalized intersections and one unsignalized
intersection in the project study area. The intersections of Davis Drive and High
House Road, High House Road and Legault Drive / Prestonwood Parkway, High
House Road and Cary Parkway, High House Road and Stone Creek Village
Drive / Cornerstone Drive, High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road,
Davis Drive and Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood Boulevard, and Davis
Drive and Preston Village Way / Hogans Valley Way are currently signalized
where the intersections of Davis Drive and Cornerstone Drive is unsignalized.
Future site build-out conditions will include two full-movement driveways, two
RIRO site driveways, and one RIRO site driveway with connecting left-over
access from High House Road.

The Triangle Transit Authority (TTA) Bus Route 310 currently operates along the
Davis Drive, High House Road, and Cary Parkway corridors and includes several
area stops. Buses travel along the corridor and make stops at 30 minute
headways. Because of these large headways, it is anticipated that this route will
have minimal impact on the proposed development. Town of Cary's C-Tran
Service offers area wide transit coverage as a phone ahead "door-to-door" or

demand-responsive service. Eligible riders include persons over 55 years old or
disabled persons. It is anticipated that this service will also have minimal to no
impact on the proposed development. Currently, sidewalks exist along many of
the existing roadway facilities. Additionally, some facilities include provisions for
bicyclists. However, to ensure a conservative (or maximum) vehicle estimate, no
adjustments were made to anticipated traffic volumes to account for alternative
modes of transportation.


III. Probable Impacts of the Project

Currently there are three approved background developments in the study area
scheduled for completion prior to the 2013 build-out year. These include: TAR-
196 (Cornerstone Office Building), TAR-201 (Rabon Property), and TAR-207
(Davis Drive Office, Self Storage, and Day Care). Additional background traffic
from these developments was included for this analysis in the 2013 no-build and
build scenarios. To account for area-wide future ambient traffic growth, an
annual growth rate percentage of 3.0 percent was applied to the existing
volumes. This value was obtained through discussions with Town of Cary Staff.

Two studies were originally conducted and approved for the Searstone
Development: Sears Farm (TAR-124) and Sears Farm Supplemental (TAR-
124a). Originally the development was proposed to include the following land
uses: 12 apartment units, 397 units of an age restrictive community, a 110 room
hotel, 28,130 SF of office space, as well as a 111,610 SF shopping center.
Recommendations from these studies included signalization of the Cornerstone
Drive and Davis Drive intersection as well as the construction of the fourth
driveway intersection leg.

The traffic generation potential of the proposed Searstone Development was
determined using the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation
Engineers, 7th Edition, 2003). Land Use Codes 230 (Residential Condominium /
Townhouse), 251 (Senior Adult Housing ­ Detached), 252 (Senior Adult Housing
­ Attached), 254 (Assisted Living), 310 (Hotel), 710 (General Office Building),
and 820 (Shopping Center) as well as the number of dwelling units, beds,
occupied rooms, and square footages were used to estimate the total peak hour
and average daily traffic volumes generated by the mixed-use development.
Following the NCDOT procedures for use of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, trip
generation results were determined using the provided equation for each land
use type. Trips generated by the development totaled 400 and 303 in-coming
and out-going AM peak hour trips (respectively) and 669 and 778 in-coming and
out-going PM peak hour trips (respectively). Average daily traffic (ADT) volumes
generated by the development totaled approximately 16,310 vehicles.

Table ES-1 summarizes the estimated traffic generation for each portion of the
proposed development during the AM and PM peak hours as well as during an


                                        ES-3
                                                                       Town of Cary: 07-TAR-236
                                                                       Searstone Development TIA

      average week day. Due to the land use types to be constructed for the
      Searstone Development (residential, commercial, and office development), the
      overall number of daily trips and PM peak hour trips were reduced by a
      calculated internal capture factor (17% daily and 17% for PM peak hour).
      Following this reduction, PM peak hour trips total 592 incoming vehicles and 658
      outgoing vehicles.     Additionally, PM peak hour trips from the proposed
      commercial development were reduced by 34% due to pass-by trips. Following
      the reduction of PM trips due to pass-bys, trips generated during the PM peak
      hour totaled 444 and 498 in-coming and out-going (respectively). No attempt
      was made to reduce the number of trips by a transit factor (due to the lengthy
      bus routes headways) or other alternate form of transportation. A truck
      percentage of two percent was used for all site-generated traffic.

      IV. Traffic Operations Analysis

      As is typical for a traffic impact study, each of the study area intersections were
      first analyzed under existing conditions. The intersections (existing and future)
      were then analyzed with and without the addition of site traffic during the
      Searstone Development build-out year (2013). Next, mitigated improvements
      were introduced to the network so that each intersection either operated at a
      LOS D (or better) or operated at a LOS equal to or better than the without site
      traffic condition.

          For this analysis, the following four conditions were evaluated:

          Condition 1: 2007 Existing Traffic
          Condition 2: Build-Out Year (2013) Without Site Traffic
          Condition 3: Build-Out Year (2013) With Site Traffic
          Condition 4: Build-Out Year (2013) With Site Traffic & Mitigated Improvements

V. Mitigation

In conclusion, the Searstone Development was analyzed for four separate
conditions: 2007 existing, 2013 without the addition of site traffic, 2013 with the
addition of site traffic, and finally 2013 with the addition of site traffic and
mitigated improvements. Table ES-2 above shows the levels of service and
delay values for each analyzed condition (intersection or critical movement).
Traffic counts, performed by SEPI Engineering, form the basis for the analysis of
Conditions 1 - 4. Based on these analyses, it was determined that several on
and off site improvements are required due the construction of the proposed
Searstone Development. Improvement recommendations were based upon
projected 2013 With Site Traffic Volumes. Table ES-3 below shows a listing of
each recommended improvement.

Per NCDOT and Town of Cary standards and practices, each site driveway
intersection with Davis Drive and High House Road will need to include a 100-
foot minimum right-turn deceleration bay into the site and, additionally, each full
movement site driveway intersection will need to include a 150-foot minimum left-
turn bay (to access the site) along Davis Drive and High House Road. Finally, it
is recommended that Full Access Drive 1 and 4 not be allowed unless each
proposed intersection is signalized.       Both intersections, Davis Drive /
Cornerstone Drive / Full Access Drive 1 and High House Road / Full Access 4
should include three and two-phase signals (respectively).

It should be noted that the intersection of High House Road / RIRO 5 includes
the addition of a left-over access.        The Searstone Dveloper should be
responsible for the construction of a concrete island of appropriate size and
dimension in the existing two-way left-turn lane on High House Road. This island
shall restrict the proposed northbound left-turning movements from the
Searstone Development and not allow these movements to access High House
Road.

It is recommended that the signalized intersections along both Davis Drive and
High House Road be optimized and synchronized to allow for optimal
progression along the corridors. Optimal corridor progression will produce
optimal signalized intersection levels of service and delays as well as provide
gaps in traffic large enough to be utilized by vehicles turning to and from
unsignalized intersections and site driveways. Levels of service and delay
values shown for Condition 4 include optimized network coordination.

In addition to recommendations provided for the site driveways, two off-site
intersections will require improvements due the construction of the proposed
Searstone Development. Due to heavy turning volumes, it is recommended that

   peak hour and 350 during the PM peak hour. Additionally, due to heavy
   southbound right-turning volumes, it is recommended that a 300-foot right-turn
   bay be constructed at the intersection of High House Road / Cary Parkway.
   However, depending upon the order of approval, this development could be
   responsible for the construction of a 200-foot westbound right-turn bay and a
   150-foot northbound right-turn bay at the intersection of High House Road / Cary
   Parkway in lieu of the aforementioned 300-foot southbound right-turn bay. With
   the required improvements in place, each intersection will operate with delay
   lower than those projected during Condition 2, thus satisfying Town of Cary
   requirements. Table ES-3 below shows a listing of each recommended
   improvement.

I. Existing Conditions

A. Introduction

The Searstone Development is being proposed for construction at the
intersection of Davis Drive and High House Road in Cary, North Carolina. The
development will include a 175,000 square-foot (SF) shopping center, 75,000 SF
office development, 298 one bedroom residential units, 232 (one and two
bedroom) age restricted apartments, 46 (one and two bedroom) age restricted
condominiums, 108 (one, two, and three bedroom) age restricted single family
homes, 30 (one and two bedroom) age restricted apartments ­ (located above
the proposed Clubhouse), a 200 room hotel, and a 155 bed healthcare facility.
Figure 1 (located in Appendix A) shows the general site location of the
development. The proposed development will be located in the southeast
quadrant of the intersection of Davis Drive and High House Road. The proposed
development is scheduled to be completed by 2013. This report analyzes the
2007 existing year traffic conditions, the no-build scenario for 2013, the full build-
out scenario for the year 2013, as well as the full 2013 build-out scenario with
mitigated improvements.

The proposed site is currently undeveloped.        Figure 2 shows a preliminary
proposed project site plan and location of five site driveways connecting to both
Davis Drive and High House Road. Figure 2 also shows the specific locations of
the internal roadways. The internal roadways were not examined as part of this
study.

B. Project Description

This report analyzes and presents the traffic impacts that the proposed
Searstone Development will have on the following (existing* and future)
intersections:

        ·   Davis Drive and High House Road*
        ·   High House Road and Legault Drive / Prestonwood Parkway*
        ·   High House Road and Cary Parkway*
        ·   High House Road and Stone Creek Village Drive / Cornerstone Drive*
        ·   High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road*
        ·   Davis Drive and Cornerstone Drive* / Full Access Drive 1
        ·   Davis Drive and Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood Boulevard*
        ·   Davis Drive and Preston Village Way / Hogans Valley Way*
        ·   Davis Drive and RIRO Drive 2
        ·   High House Road and RIRO Drive 3
        ·   High House Road and Full Access Drive 4
        ·   High House Road and RIRO Drive 5 (With Left-Over Access)

The impacts of the Searstone Development site traffic on the above existing and
future intersections will be evaluated during the AM and PM peak hours of a
typical weekday. The following analysis is based on the 2007 existing year
traffic, the 2013 traffic with the addition of ambient growth and background traffic
volumes, the 2013 total traffic with the addition of the estimated site-generated
traffic produced by the Searstone Development, and 2013 total traffic with
mitigated improvements. Currently there are three background developments to
be completed within the surrounding region. These developments include:

      ·   TAR-196 Cornerstone Office Building
      ·   TAR-201 Rabon Property
      ·   TAR-207 Davis Drive Office, Self Storage, and Day Care

In addition to the background traffic volume from these developments, to account
for area-wide future ambient traffic growth, an annual growth rate percentage of
3.0 percent was applied to the existing volumes. This value was obtained
through conversations with Town of Cary Staff.

The capacity analysis methodology is provided by the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM 2000) and related Highway Capacity Software (HCS 2000). Using
these methods, a level of service (LOS) is determined. Level of service is the
measure that rates traffic conditions qualitatively based on the observed and
collected data for the given transportation facility. The HCS 2000 was
supplemented with the traffic operations optimization and evaluation software
Synchro Light Version 6.0 to evaluate the existing and proposed signalized
intersections.

C. Geometrics and Traffic Control

Roadways

Davis Drive is a four-lane median divided arterial that runs approximately north-
south through the middle of the project study area. Davis Drive provides a
connection between US-64 to the south and Research Triangle Park (RTP) to the
north. In the project study area, this facility has a posted 45-mph speed limit and
includes exclusive turn-bays at each major signalized and unsignalized
intersection. Along its length, Davis Drive services both commercial and
residential developments. In the project study area, Davis Drive includes
signalized intersections with Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood Blvd, High
House Road, and Preston Village Way / Hogans Valley Way. For project build-
out Full Access Drive 1 and RIRO Drive 2 will connect to Davis Drive.

High House Road is primarily a four-lane divided arterial that runs approximately
east-west through the middle of the project study area. This facility connects
Chatham Street to the east with NC-55 to the west. In the project study area,
High House Road has a posted 45 mph speed limit and includes signalized

                                                        Searstone Development TIA

intersections with Cary Parkway, Legault Drive, Davis Drive, Cornerstone Drive,
and Carpenter Upchurch Road. High House Road services both commercial and
residential developments along its length. For project build-out, RIRO Drive 3,
Full Access Drive 4, and RIRO Drive 5 will connect to High House Road.

Cary Parkway is a four lane arterial that forms a signalized intersection with High
House Road in the project study area. This facility has a posted 45 mph speed
limit and primarily services commercial developments. Sidewalks line both sides
of Cary Parkway and its signal with High House Road includes pedestrian
actuation. Cary Parkway serves as a partial loop surrounding a large portion of
the Town of Cary.

Cornerstone Drive is a partial loop road that surrounds the Cornerstone
Shopping Center in the southwest quadrant of the Davis Drive and High House
Road intersection. Cornerstone Drive forms a signalized intersection with Stone
Creek Village Drive and High House Road and an unsignalized intersection with
Davis Drive (and future Searstone Full Access Drive 1). This facility primarily
services traffic from the shopping center driveways.

Carpenter Upchurch Road is a two-lane arterial that includes a signalized
intersection with High House Road. This facility stretches from High House Road
to the south to Morrisville ­ Carpenter Road to the north. Carpenter Upchurch
Road roughly parallels NC-55 to the north of the project study area. Construction
is currently taking place just west of this intersection as the adjacent bridge on
High House is being widened to accommodate four lanes of traffic.

Legault Drive, Prestonwood Parkway, Leonard Christian Road, Waldo Rood
Boulevard, Preston Village Way, and Hogans Valley Way are each minor
roadways that form signalized intersections with either Davis Drive or High
House Road in the project study area. Each facility services a different area
residential community and speed limits along these facilities range from 25 to 35
mph. Exclusive turn-bays are provided for patrons wishing to turn onto or from
these facilities.

Intersections

There are currently seven signalized intersections and one unsignalized
intersection in the project study area. The intersections of Davis Drive and High
House Road, High House Road and Legault Drive / Prestonwood Parkway, High
House Road and Cary Parkway, High House Road and Stone Creek Village
Drive / Cornerstone Drive, High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road,
Davis Drive and Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood Boulevard, and Davis
Drive and Preston Village Way / Hogans Valley Way are currently signalized
where the intersection of Davis Drive and Cornerstone Drive is currently
unsignalized. Future site build-out conditions will include two full-movement
driveways, two RIRO site driveways, and one RIRO site driveway with left-over

E. Alternate Modes of Transportation / Transit Impacts

The Triangle Transit Authority (TTA) Bus Route 310 currently operates along the
Davis Drive, High House Road, and Cary Parkway corridors and includes several
area stops. Buses travel along the corridor and make stops at 30 minute
headways. Because of these large headways, it is anticipated that this route will
have minimal impact on the proposed Searstone Development. To provide a
more conservative vehicle estimate, no adjustments will be made to anticipated
traffic volumes to account for transit use.

The Town of Cary's C-Tran Service offers area wide transit coverage as a phone
ahead "door-to-door" or demand-responsive service. Eligible riders include
persons over 55 years old or disabled persons. Though C-Tran also offers a
fixed route system, currently no routes run along Davis Drive, High House Road,
or any of the studied corridors. Because such a small percentage of the
population is covered by this service, it is anticipated that this service will have
minimal to no impact on the proposed development. No adjustments will be
made to anticipated traffic volumes due to this service.

Currently, sidewalks exist along many of the existing roadway facilities.
Additionally, some facilities include provisions for bicyclists. However, to ensure
a conservative (or maximum) vehicle estimate, no adjustments were made to
anticipated traffic volumes to account for alternative modes of transportation.

F. Existing Signal Phasing / Timing Information

Signal phasing and timing information for each of the existing signalized
intersections (05-1459, 05-1692, 05-1741, 05-1882, 05-2029, 05-2128, and 05-
2246) are located in Appendix C. The existing signal plans and signal timing
information were obtained from the NCDOT Signals and Geometrics Section as
well as from the Town of Cary. Information from the plans related to signal timing
offsets and phasing sequences were used for all conditions in this analysis.
Minimum green times, yellow and all red times, etc. followed the typical NCDOT
standards and practices for signalized intersection analysis.


II. Background Conditions

A. Background Traffic / Approved Developments

Currently there are three approved background developments in the study area
scheduled for completion prior to the 2013 build-out year. These include: TAR-
196 (Cornerstone Office Building), TAR-201 (Rabon Property), and TAR-207
(Davis Drive Office, Self Storage, and Day Care). Additional background traffic
from these developments was included for this analysis in the 2013 no-build and
build scenarios. Appendix D includes the background traffic figures from each
of the background developments. To account for area-wide future ambient traffic
growth, an annual growth rate percentage of 3.0 percent was applied to the
existing volumes. This value was obtained through discussions with Town of
Cary Staff. Figure 5 shows the 2013 background traffic volumes and Figure 6
shows the 2013 without site traffic volumes.

Two studies were originally conducted and approved for the Searstone
Development: Sears Farm (TAR-124) and Sears Farm Supplemental (TAR-
124a). Originally the development was proposed to include the following land
uses: 12 apartment units, 397 units of an age restrictive community, a 110 room
hotel, 28,130 SF of office space, as well as a 111,610 SF shopping center.
Recommendations from these studies included signalization of the Cornerstone
Drive and Davis Drive intersection as well as the construction of the fourth
driveway intersection leg.    Section IIIA below discusses the original trip
generation at build-out and provides a comparison to the trip generation
proposed for this study.

B. Planned Roadway Improvements

Currently there are currently two Town of Cary project scheduled for completion
in the project study area prior to the completion of the Searstone Development
(see Appendix E). Figure 14 shows the anticipated 2013 lane configurations
and traffic control for each intersection. The approved projects include:

                                                       Searstone Development TIA

High House Road is scheduled to be widened to a four-lane facility west of
Carpenter Upchurch Road. This project is currently on-going and is scheduled to
be completed by 2007. At project build-out, High House Road will be analyzed
as a four-lane facility along its length with turn-bays at the analyzed signalized
intersections.

A new bridge is to be constructed by 2009 allowing Jenks Carpenter Road to be
aligned across from Carpenter Upchurch Road and forming a new four-way
intersection with High House Road. In addition to the bridge construction, both
Jenks Carpenter Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road will be widened to three
lanes with wide outside lanes that will accommodate bicyclists. A new three-way
intersection will be created north of High House Road at the intersection of Louis
Stephens Drive and Carpenter Upchurch Road. Finally, Jenks Carpenter Road
and Carpenter Upchurch Road will be realigned allowing for smoother north-
south flow along the facility.

TAR-196.recommended the construction of a 150' long exclusive left-turn lane for
eastbound traffic along Cornerstone Drive at its intersection with Davis Drive.
This improvement will be included in the 2013 build-out of this development.

III. Project Conditions

A. Site Generated Traffic

The traffic generation potential of the proposed development was determined
using the ITE Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 7th
Edition, 2003) (Appendix F). Land Use Codes 230 (Residential Condominium /
Townhouse), 251 (Senior Adult Housing ­ Detached), 252 (Senior Adult Housing
­ Attached), 254 (Assisted Living), 310 (Hotel), 710 (General Office Building),
and 820 (Shopping Center) as well as the number of dwelling units, beds,
occupied rooms, and square footages (see Table 2 below) were used to estimate
the total peak hour and average daily traffic volumes generated by the mixed use
development. Following the NCDOT and Town of Cary procedures for use of the
ITE Trip Generation Manual, trip generation results were determined using the
provided equation for each land use type. Trips generated (excluding reductions
due to internal capture and pass-bys trips) totaled 400 and 303 in-coming and
out-going AM peak hour trips (respectively) and 669 and 778 in-coming and out-
going PM peak hour trips (respectively). Average daily traffic (ADT) volumes
generated by the development totaled approximately 16,310 vehicles.

Table 2 summarizes the estimated traffic generation for each portion of the
proposed development during the AM and PM peak hours as well as during an
average week day. Due to the land use types to be constructed for the
Searstone Development (residential, commercial, and office development), the
overall number of daily trips and PM peak hour trips were reduced by a
calculated internal capture factor (17% daily and 17% PM peak hour ­ both

standard for a development this size). An internal capture factor was not
calculated during the AM peak hour due to the lack of data and equations found
in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. The AM peak hour typically consists of only
commuter traffic (home based work trips) where the PM peak hour and daily trips
include a mixture of both commuter traffic and vehicles accessing area
commercial developments.          ITE collected data shows that only a small
percentage of internally captured trips are home based work trips and that the
vast majority of internally captured trips are from residential or office
developments to commercial developments. Because this is the case, little to no
trips will be internally captured during the AM peak hour, thus no AM peak hour
internal capture factors are provided.

Along with reductions due to internal capture, PM peak hour trips from the
proposed commercial development were reduced by 34% due to pass-by trips.
This percentage was calculated by the ITE Trip Generation Manual and
represents the average pass-by trip percentage using data collected from
similarly sized commercial developments. An equation has been provided to
calculate pass-by trips (33% calculated for this study), however, the validity of
this equation is in question due to the low R^2 value (0.37). It has been
determined that the average pass-by percentage provides a better representation
of actual pass-by trip reduction.

Following both reductions described above, PM peak hour trips totaled 444
incoming vehicles and 498 outgoing vehicles. Internal capture values and pass-
by trips were calculated using the procedures provided in the ITE Trip Generation
Manual and are located in Appendix F. No attempt was made to reduce the
number of trips by a transit factor (due to the lengthy bus routes headways) or
other alternate form of transportation. A truck percentage of two percent was
used for all site-generated traffic.

      As previously mentioned, total site build-out from the Sears Farm (TAR-124) and
      Sears Farm Supplemental (TAR-124a)) included 12 apartment units, 397 units of
      an age restrictive community, a 110 room hotel, 28,130 SF of office space, as
      well as a 111,610 SF shopping center. Original trip generation estimates, based
      upon the 6th Edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, did not include
      adjustments to AM or PM traffic based upon internal capture factors or pass-by
      trips. Incoming and outgoing AM peak hour trips totaled 178 vehicles and 116
      vehicles (respectively) where incoming and outgoing PM peak hour trips totaled
      308 vehicles and 333 (vehicles) respectively. Using the current land uses, AM
      trips have increased by 239% where PM trips have increased by 147%.

      B. Trip Distribution

      The directional traffic patterns, or trip distribution, of the site-generated traffic was
      determined using the existing 2007 AM and PM peak hour traffic characteristics.
      It was assumed, for purposes of this study, that all site traffic would enter and exit
      the study area in the same manner as the projected traffic volumes. Total trips
      into and out of the study area using High House Road, Davis Drive, Cary
      Parkway, Carpenter Upchurch Road, Stone Creek Village Drive, Cornerstone
      Drive, Prestonwood Parkway, Legault Drive, Leonard Christian Road, Waldo
      Rood Boulevard, Preston Village Way, and Hogans Valley Way form the basis of
      the percentage distribution. Distribution percentages into and out of the study
      area are calculated using projected traffic volumes that enter and exit the study

area. The percentages are routed, via shortest path, to and from the proposed
development. This distribution percentage is then applied to the generated trips
to predict routes and project traffic volumes for the 2013 build-out scenario.
Figures 7 ­ 8 show the 2013 distributional percentages and Figures 9 ­ 10
show the 2013 site trip distribution volumes. Due to space limitations on Figure
10, pass-by trips were not shown. Figure 11 shows the net change in pass-by
trips from driveway to driveway along the Davis Drive and High House Road
corridors. 2013 build-out traffic volumes are determined by applying the site trip
distribution volumes to the Condition 2 traffic volumes (see Figure 6). 2013
build-out traffic volumes can be found in Figures 12 and 13.


IV. Traffic Operations Analysis

A. Methodology

The capacity of an intersection is measured by the "level of service" it provides,
as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board,
2000). Level of service (LOS) is a measure used to describe the operating
conditions of an intersection based on characteristics such as speed, traffic
volumes, geometric configuration, delays, and freedom to maneuver. Levels of
service range from "A" to "F," with "A" describing smooth free flow conditions
where queues clear through each cycle length, and "F" describing congested,
over-saturated conditions, where queues are often forced to wait through multiple
cycle lengths prior to traversing an intersection. Other factors, such as a high
percentage of trucks or buses within the traffic stream can affect level of service.
The intersection setting, whether it is urban, suburban, or rural, can also affect
level of service. For signalized intersections in urban areas, LOS D is generally
considered acceptable, while in rural areas, LOS C is considered acceptable.

At unsignalized intersections, a LOS E is generally considered acceptable only if
the side street encounters delay. Nevertheless, side streets typically function at
a LOS F during peak traffic periods, because the traffic volumes often do not
warrant a traffic signal to assist side street traffic. Table 3 below provides a
general description of the various level of service categories and delay ranges:

           Table 3 ­ Level of Service Descriptions for Intersections

As is typical for a traffic impact study, each of the study area intersections were
first analyzed under existing conditions. The intersections (existing and future)
were then analyzed with and without the addition of site traffic during the project
build-out year (2013). Next, mitigated improvements were introduced to the
network so that each intersection either operated at a LOS D (or better) or
operated at a LOS equal to or better than the without site traffic condition.
For this analysis, the following four conditions were evaluated:

Condition 1: 2007 Existing Traffic
Condition 2: Build-Out Year (2013) Without Site Traffic
Condition 3: Build-Out Year (2013) With Site Traffic
Condition 4: Build-Out Year (2013) With Site Traffic & Mitigated Improvements

HCS 2000 was used to analyze all existing and future unsignalized intersections.
Because overall intersection levels of service are not provided for unsignalized
intersections, the results were evaluated on a per-movement basis. Thus,
intersection improvements may need to be considered should one or more of the
intersection movements experience a failing level of service. This methodology
differs from signalized intersections, where one or more movements at an
intersection may be deficient, but no intersection improvements would be
deemed necessary as long as the overall intersection level of service does not
fall below LOS D. If an existing unsignalized intersection movement falls to LOS
E or below, a detailed existing delay study will be provided. If this study indicates
an acceptable level of service and delay, CORSIM will be used to determine the
delay for future analysis conditions.

Synchro Light Version 6.0 (using HCM delay formulas) was used to analyze all
existing and future signalized intersections. For Condition 1, the existing cycle
lengths and green splits of each of the signalized intersections were used and
LOS and delay values were reported. Green split timings and cycle lengths
remained constant throughout Conditions 1-3 to provide a consistent evaluation
of each signal during Conditions 1-3. During Condition 4, intersection cycle
lengths and green splits were optimized and network signal timings were
synchronized to allow each intersection to operate at a LOS D or better (if
possible).

B. Capacity Analysis Results

Appendices G and H contain the HCS and Synchro outputs (respectively) for
this analysis. Table 4 below shows the results of the intersection analyses for
Conditions 1 ­ 4. A description of each Condition follows the table.

C. Condition 1 ­ 2007 Existing Traffic

Table 4 above reveals that the signalized intersection of High House Road / Cary
Parkway is currently operating at a LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E
during the PM peak hour of Condition 1. Additionally the eastbound left-turning
movement from Cornerstone Drive (at Davis Drive) is operating at a LOS E or
worse during the Condition 1 peak hours. All other intersections and intersection
movements are operating acceptably during Condition 1. Each analysis was
conducted using the existing 2007 geometric configuration, existing Condition 1
traffic volumes (see Figure 4), and existing signal timing values.

D. Condition 2 ­ Build-Out Year (2013) Without Site Traffic

As shown in Table 4 the signalized intersections of Davis Drive / High House
Road and High House Road / Cary Parkway are projected to operate
unacceptably during the 2013 AM and PM peak hours without the addition of site
traffic. Additionally, the intersection of Davis Drive / Leonard Christian Road /
Waldo Rood Blvd is projected to operate unacceptably during the AM peak hour.
Finally, the eastbound left and right-turning movements from Cornerstone Drive
(at Davis Drive) are projected to operate unacceptably during the AM and PM
peak hours. All of the other analyzed intersections are projected to operate
acceptably during Condition 2. Each analysis was conducted using the proposed
2013 geometric configuration (see Figure 14), projected 2013 Condition 2
without site traffic volumes (see Figure 6), and existing signal timing values.

E. Condition 3 ­ Build-Out Year (2013) With Site Traffic

The addition of site traffic in Condition 3 will further aggravate the projected
deficiencies at the intersections of Davis Drive / High House Road, High House
Road / Cary Parkway, and Davis Drive / Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood
Blvd. Each intersection is projected to operate unacceptably (LOS E or worse)
during one or both of the 2013 peak hours with the addition of site traffic (see
Table 4 above). Along with these intersections, the east and westbound
movements from Full Access Drive 1 / Cornerstone Drive at Davis Drive and
northbound left-turning movement from Full Access Drive 4 at High House Road
are projected to operate unacceptably during Condition 3. The other study area
intersections as well as the remaining site driveways will operate acceptably
during Condition 3. Each analysis was conducted using the proposed 2013
geometric configuration (see Figure 14), projected 2013 Condition 3 with site
traffic volumes (see Figures 12 and 13), and existing signal timing values.

V. Mitigation

A. Proposed Site Access

The Searstone Development is projected to have five site driveways including
two full access drives, two RIRO drives, and one RIRO driveway with left-over
access. Each site driveway will connect to either Davis Drive or High House
Road. Analysis of each of these site driveways during 2013 Condition 3 (with
site traffic) revealed that both of the full access site driveway intersections are
projected to operate at unacceptable levels of service during the 2013 peak
hours. Each of the RIRO Drives will operate acceptably during the 2013
Condition 3 AM and PM peak hours.

It should be noted that the intersection of High House Road / RIRO 5 includes
the addition of a left-over access. The Searstone Developer should be
responsible for the construction of a concrete island of appropriate size and
dimension in the existing two-way left-turn lane on High House Road. This island
shall restrict the proposed northbound left-turning movements from the
Searstone Development and not allow these movements to access High House
Road.

Each site driveway intersection was analyzed using exclusive left-turn and right-
turn bays where applicable. Per NCDOT and Town of Cary standards, site
driveways that access state maintained facilities with average daily traffic
volumes greater than 4,000 vehicles per day are required to include turn-bays.
Therefore, each site driveway should include a 100-foot minimum right-turn
deceleration lane and 150-foot minimum left-turn bay (for full-access driveways)
off Davis Drive and High House Road. These turn bays will help to separate
slowing and stopping vehicles from the through traffic stream allowing for a safer
turning maneuver and more efficient arterial.

For Conditions 1 and 2 the eastbound Cornerstone Drive left-turning movement
(at Davis Drive) will operate at unacceptable levels of service during the AM and
peak hour. For Condition 3, the east and westbound left-turning movements at
the intersection of Davis Drive / Cornerstone Drive / Full Access Drive 1 are
projected to fail during the AM and PM peak hours. With extremely heavy north
and southbound traffic volumes on Davis Drive, vehicles wishing to turn left to or
from the site driveway without the protection afforded by a traffic signal will
experience extremely unsafe conditions. Because this driveway will act as a
main collector of site traffic, it is recommended that a three phase signal (with a
protected / permitted northbound left-turning phase) be installed at this
intersection. With this signal in place, the intersection will operate at a LOS C or
better during both peak hours.

The northbound left-turning movement at the intersection of High House Road /
Full Access Drive 4 is projected to fail during the AM and PM peak hours. With

                                                          Searstone Development TIA

heavy traffic volumes along High House Road, vehicles wishing to turn left from
this site driveway without the protection afforded by a traffic signal will experience
extremely unsafe conditions. For purposes of safety and operation, it is
recommended that this full movement driveway not be allowed unless the
proposed intersection is signalized. A two-phase signal should be installed at
this intersection. With this signal in place, the intersections will operate at a LOS
B or better during the 2013 AM and PM peak hours (see Table 4). Additionally,
to help operations at this signal installation as well as all existing / proposed
signals, it is recommended that each of the study area signalized intersections
along the Davis Drive and High House Road corridors be closely coordinated to
ensure smooth network traffic flow.

B. Off Site Intersections

Davis Drive and High House Road

The intersection of Davis Drive and High House Road currently operates at a
LOS D during the AM and PM peak hours. During Condition 2, using the
projected westbound lane configuration shown in TAR-196 (exclusive left-turn
lane, one through lane, and a shared through / right-turn lane) the intersection is
projected to operate at a LOS E during the AM peak hour and LOS F during the
PM peak hour. The addition of site traffic to this intersection will only further
aggravate delay and the intersection will operate at a LOS E during the AM peak
hour and LOS F during the PM peak hour. Table 4 above shows the existing
and projected LOS and delay values for Conditions 1 ­ 4.

To help decrease delay at this intersection it is recommended that exclusive 450-
foot westbound and 100-foot southbound right-turn bays be constructed.
Westbound right-turning volumes at this intersection are projected to top 400
during the AM peak hour and 350 during the PM peak hour. Southbound right-
turning volumes at this intersection total approximately 100 vehicles during each
peak hour. Construction of these turn lanes, along with optimizing corridor signal
timings, will allow this intersection to operate at LOS D during the AM and PM
peak hours. As shown in Table 4 above, with these improvements in place, the
intersection will operate with lower delay than those projected during Condition 2,
thus satisfying Town of Cary requirements. No further recommendations are
provided for this intersection based upon effects from site build-out traffic
volumes. Because the Searstone Development did not add additional traffic to
either movement, it is recommended that these turn lanes be constructed by
future area development.

High House Road and Legault Drive / Prestonwood Parkway

This intersection currently operates at a LOS A during the AM and PM peak
hours. During the 2013 build-out year the intersection is projected to operate at a
LOS A during the AM and PM peak hour without the addition of site traffic. With

                                                          Searstone Development TIA

the addition of site traffic (Condition 3), the intersection is projected to continue
operate at a LOS B during the AM peak hour and LOS A during the PM peak
hour. No improvements or modifications are necessary at this intersection.

High House Road and Cary Parkway

The intersection of High House Road and Cary Parkway currently operates at a
LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during the PM peak hour. For
Condition 2, the intersection is projected to operate at a LOS F during the AM
and PM peak hours. The addition of site traffic to this intersection will only further
aggravate delay and the intersection will continue to operate at a LOS F during
both peak hours. Table 4 above shows the existing and projected LOS and
delay values for Conditions 1 ­ 4.

To help alleviate delay at this intersection, it is recommended that the
intersection signal timings be optimized and that a southbound 300-foot right-turn
bay from Cary Parkway to High House Road be constructed. With a right-turning
volume approaching 400 during the PM peak hour, the construction of this bay
will pull the slowing and stopping vehicles from the through vehicle stream and
lower the overall intersection delay. With these improvements in place the
intersection is projected to operate at a LOS F (132.1 sec / veh) during the AM
peak hour and LOS F (102.1 sec / veh) during the PM peak hour. As shown in
Table 4 above, with these improvements in place, the intersection will operate
with delay lower than those projected during Condition 2, thus satisfying Town of
Cary requirements.

Depending on the order of approval of this development, the developer may be
required to construct improvements alternative to those suggested above.
Should this development be approved after the Cornerstone (Mixed-Use)
Development (to be constructed in the northeast quadrant of Davis Drive / High
House Road), the developer will be required to construct a 200-foot westbound
right-turn bay and a 150-foot northbound right-turn bay at the intersection of High
House Road / Cary Parkway in lieu of the southbound right-turn bay. With these
improvements in place (along with site traffic from this development and
background traffic from the Cornerstone (Mixed-Use) development) the
intersection will operate with delay lower than those projected during Condition 2,
thus satisfying Town of Cary requirements.

To allow this intersection to operate acceptably during both peak hours, both
Cary Parkway and High House Road will need to be widened to six lanes to
accommodate the heavy commuter traffic traversing the intersection. No amount
of additional turn lanes or signal timing adjustments will allow this intersection to
operate acceptably.         Currently, the Town of Cary's Comprehensive
Transportation Plan recommends that both Cary Parkway and High House Road
be constructed as four-lane facilities with landscaped medians.

High House Road and Stone Creek Village Drive / Cornerstone Drive

All analyzed movements of the existing signalized intersection at High House
Road and Stone Creek Village Drive / Cornerstone Drive currently operate at a
LOS B or better during the AM and PM peak hours. For both Condition 2 and
Condition 3, the addition of background traffic and site traffic (respectively), all
movements will continue to operate acceptably (LOS B) during both peak hours.
No improvements or modifications are necessary at this intersection.

High House Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road

This intersection currently operates at a LOS D during the AM peak hour and
LOS C during the PM peak hour. During the 2013 build-out year, with the
widening of High House Road completed the intersection is projected to operate
at a LOS C or better during both peak hours without and with the addition of site
traffic. No improvements or modifications are necessary at this intersection.

Future intersection improvements at this location include the rerouting of Jenks
Carpenter Road to align with Carpenter Upchurch Road by the Spring of 2009
(as quoted on the Town of Cary website). However, Jenks Carpenter Road was
not included with the original scope of this study and Carpenter Upchurch Road
was only analyzed as a T-intersection. The future fourth leg, Jenks Carpenter
Road, was not included as part of this analysis. Upon speaking with Tom Ellis at
the Town of Cary, the 2009 schedule as quoted on the Town's website
represents an aggressive scheduling date for the project. The project design is
at approximately 75% and funding for the project is still in the process of being
acquired. More than likely the Searstone Development and rerouting project will
be completed at approximately the same time.

Through conversations with the Town of Cary, it was determined that the future
northbound lane configuration (Jenks Carpenter approach) at this intersection will
consist of an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared through / right-turn lane. The
southbound lane configuration (Carpenter Upchurch approach) will consist of
exclusive southbound left, through, and right-turn lanes. The eastbound lane
configuration will consist of dual left-turn lanes, a single through lane, and a
shared through / right-turn lane. Finally, the westbound lane configuration will
consist of an exclusive left-turn lane, two through lanes, and an exclusive right-
turn lane.

With the above lane configuration constructed, an adequate amount of capacity
will be available for future projected through and turning volumes at this
intersection. The heaviest projected movements at this intersection, eastbound
left-turn and westbound right-turn will be serviced by exclusive dual and single
turn lanes (respectively). Additionally, exclusive left-turn lanes will be provided
for each direction and the southbound will include an exclusive right-turn lane for
vehicles approaching from Carpenter Upchurch Road.                  No additional

improvements are recommended for this intersection due to future traffic
volumes.

Davis Drive and Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood Boulevard

The intersection of Davis Drive / Leonard Christian Road / Waldo Rood
Boulevard currently operates at a LOS D or better during the AM and PM peak
hours. With the addition of background traffic and ambient growth, the
intersection is projected to operate at a LOS F during the AM peak hour and a
LOS C during the PM peak hour (using the existing signal timings). With the
addition of site traffic, the intersection is predicted to operate at a LOS F during
the AM peak hour and a LOS D during the PM peak hour. Upon optimizing the
signal timings for the intersection, it is projected to operate at a LOS E during the
AM peak hour and LOS C during the PM peak hour.

Projected volumes show 647 vehicles performing the westbound right-turning
maneuver during the AM peak hour and 670 vehicles performing the southbound
left-turning maneuver during the PM peak hour. To accommodate these
vehicles, Waldo Rood Boulevard will need to be widening significantly in the
future.    An additional southbound left-turning movement as well as the
lengthening of the westbound left-turning movement (to accommodate queuing
vehicles) will be required which will force Waldo Rood Boulevard to be widened
to a four-lane section. Previous counts (from earlier studies) at this location do
not reflect volumes of this magnitude at this intersection. It is SEPI's engineering
judgment that the recent counts conducted were most likely performed under
uncharacteristic conditions for the network (though no area accidents were noted
nor were weather conditions less than ideal). Additionally, because the
intersection will operate at a lower delay value than found in Condition 2 with the
optimization of the signal no improvements are recommended for this
intersection.

Davis Drive and Preston Village Way / Hogans Valley Way

All analyzed movements of the existing signalized intersection at Davis Drive and
Preston Village Way / Hogans Valley Way currently operate at a LOS B or better
during the AM and PM peak hours. For both Condition 2 and Condition 3, the
addition of background traffic and site traffic (respectively), all movements are
projected to continue to operate acceptably (LOS B or better) during both peak
hours. No improvements or modifications are necessary at this intersection.


VI. Conclusions and Recommendations

In conclusion, the Searstone Development was analyzed for four separate
conditions: 2007 existing, 2013 without the addition of site traffic, 2013 with the
addition of site traffic, and finally 2013 with the addition of site traffic and

mitigated improvements. Table 4 above shows the levels of service and delay
values for each analyzed condition.        Traffic counts, performed by SEPI
Engineering, form the basis for the analysis of Conditions 1 - 4. Based on these
analyses, it was determined that several on site improvements are required due
the construction of the proposed Searstone Development.             Improvement
recommendations were based upon projected 2013 With Site Traffic Volumes.
Table 5 below shows a listing of each recommended improvement. Figures 15
and 16 shows the proposed 2013 lane configuration with the addition of the
Searstone Development improvements.

Per NCDOT and Town of Cary standards and practices, each site driveway
intersection with Davis Drive and High House Road will need to include a 100-
foot minimum right-turn deceleration bay into the site and, additionally, each full
movement site driveway intersection will need to include a 150-foot minimum left-
turn bay (to access the site) along Davis Drive and High House Road. Finally, it
is recommended that Full Access Drive 1 and 4 not be allowed unless each
proposed intersection is signalized.       Both intersections, Davis Drive /
Cornerstone Drive / Full Access Drive 1 and High House Road / Full Access 4
should include three and two-phase signals (respectively).

It should be noted that the intersection of High House Road / RIRO 5 includes
the addition of a left-over access. The Searstone Developer should be
responsible for the construction of a concrete island of appropriate size and
dimension in the existing two-way left-turn lane on High House Road. This island
shall restrict the proposed northbound left-turning movements from the
Searstone Development and not allow these movements to access High House
Road.

It is recommended that the signalized intersections along both Davis Drive and
High House Road be optimized and synchronized to allow for optimal
progression along the corridors. Optimal corridor progression will produce
optimal signalized intersection levels of service and delays as well as provide
gaps in traffic large enough to be utilized by vehicles turning to and from
unsignalized intersections and site driveways. Levels of service and delay
values shown for Condition 4 (see Table 4 above) include optimized network
coordination.

In addition to recommendations provided for the site driveways, two off-site
intersections will require improvements due the construction of the proposed
Searstone Development. Due to heavy turning volumes, it is recommended that
an exclusive 100-foot southbound and 450-foot westbound right-turn bay be
constructed at the intersection of Davis Drive / High House Road. Projected
westbound right-turning Condition 3 traffic volumes exceed 400 during the AM
peak hour and 350 during the PM peak hour. Additionally, due to heavy
southbound right-turning volumes, it is recommended that a 300-foot right-turn
bay be constructed at the intersection of High House Road / Cary Parkway.

   However, depending upon the order of approval, this development could be
   responsible for the construction of a 200-foot westbound right-turn bay and a
   150-foot northbound right-turn bay at the intersection of High House Road / Cary
   Parkway in lieu of the aforementioned 300-foot southbound right-turn bay. With
   the required improvements in place, each intersection will operate with delay
   lower than those projected during Condition 2, thus satisfying Town of Cary
   requirements. Table 4 shows the levels of service and delay values for
   Condition 4. Table 5 below shows a listing of each recommended improvement.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
Davis Development, Inc. plans to construct a mixed-use development in the northeastern
quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road (NC 54) and Weston Parkway intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail space, 308 apartment
units, 155 condominium units, and 35 townhome units. The property is located within the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary's Ordinance 05-0009),
requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. The proposed
development is expected to be completed in two phases ­ the first being completed in 2012
and the second in 2014. Phase I of the development consists of the retail space, apartment
units, and townhomes, with Phase II consisting of the condominiums. This report analyzes
the potential traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via three driveways - two along NC 54 and
one along Martin Tavern Road (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's
requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future
conditions, where applicable:

   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Weston Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Weston Parkway and Martin Tavern Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Weston Parkway and Sheldon Drive/Weston Estates Way (unsignalized)
   ·   Weston Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Access #1 (future signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Access #2 (future right-in/right-out)
   ·   Martin Tavern Road and Access #3 (future unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under seven scenarios: Existing (2008), Background (2012), Phase I
Build (2012), Phase I Build (2012) with Improvements, Background (2014), Phase II Build
(2014) and Phase II Build (2014) with Improvements. The Existing (2008) scenario includes
A.M. and P.M. peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in April
2008. The Background (2012) scenario includes existing traffic with three approved
developments and projected background growth. The Phase I Build (2012) scenario
includes existing volumes with the addition of site trips generated by Phase I of the
proposed development. In addition, future conditions with the proposed mitigation
improvements in place were analyzed in a Phase I Build (2012) with Improvements scenario.
The Background (2014) scenario includes existing traffic with three approved developments
and projected background growth. The Phase II Build (2014) scenario includes the
Background (2014) volumes with the addition of site trips generated by Phase I and Phase II
of the proposed development. In addition, future conditions with the proposed mitigation
improvements in place were analyzed in a Phase II Build (2014) with Improvements
scenario.


                                             i
Existing (2008) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page
viii, the majority of the study area intersections are operating at acceptable levels of service,
LOS D or better. However, two signalized intersections are currently operating under failing
conditions. Specifically, the Chapel Hill Road and Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter
Road intersection operates at LOS F during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, while the
Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection is operating at LOS E in the A.M. peak
hour and LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. In addition, both stop-controlled approaches of
Sheldon Drive and Weston Estates Way at Weston Parkway are operating under failing level
of service conditions in the P.M. peak hour.

Background (2012) Conditions
In the Background (2012) conditions, an annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year (2008)
and the build year (2012). Furthermore, there are three other developments in the vicinity
being constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
development. Site traffic, as well as any mitigation improvements, associated with these
approved developments were included in the Background (2012) analysis.

The Town of Morrisville has plans to improve the intersection of Chapel Hill Road and
Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road by adding additional turn lanes northbound
along Chapel Hill Road and eastbound along Morrisville-Carpenter Road. These impending
improvements were also included in the Background (2012) analysis.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area will
experience an increase in level of service, which can be attributed to both optimized signal
timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the Chapel Hill Road and
Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection is projected to experience a rise
in level of service ­ LOS F to LOS D in the A.M. while continuing to operate at LOS F in
the P.M. peak hour with a reduction in traffic delay. Additionally, the Chapel Hill Road and
Cary Parkway intersection is projected to experience a rise in level of service in the P.M.
peak hour (LOS F to LOS E), while continuing to operate at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour.
However, the intersection of Weston Parkway and Evans Road is projected to degrade from
LOS D to LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS C to LOS E in the P.M. peak hour. In
addition, southbound Weston Estates Way at Weston Parkway declines to LOS E in the
A.M. peak hour, while the northbound approach will decline to a LOS F in the P.M. peak
hour.

Background (2014) Conditions
In the Background (2014) conditions, an annual growth rate of three percent (3%) was
applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year (2008)
and the build year (2014). Furthermore, there are three other developments in the vicinity
being constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the proposed
development. Site traffic, as well as any mitigation improvements, associated with these

                                               ii
approved developments were included in the Background (2014) analysis. The Background
(2014) analysis does not account for the Phase I (2012) site trips or associated mitigations;
but rather accounts only for background growth and approved developments, as previously
mentioned.

The Town of Morrisville has plans to improve the intersection of Chapel Hill Road and
Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road by adding additional turn lanes northbound
along Chapel Hill Road and eastbound along Morrisville-Carpenter Road. These impending
improvements were also included in the Background (2014) analysis.

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area will
experience an increase in level of service, which can be attributed to both optimized signal
timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the Chapel Hill Road and
Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection is projected to experience a rise
in level of service ­ LOS F to LOS D in the A.M. while continuing to operate at LOS F in
the P.M. peak hour with a reduction in traffic delay. Additionally, the Chapel Hill Road and
Cary Parkway intersection is projected to experience a rise in level of service in the P.M.
peak hour (LOS F to LOS E), while continuing to operate at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour.
However, the intersection of Weston Parkway and Evans Road is projected to degrade from
LOS D to LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS C to LOS E in the P.M. peak hour. In
addition, southbound Weston Estates Way at Weston Parkway declines to LOS F in the
A.M. peak hour, while the northbound approach will decline to a LOS F in the P.M. peak
hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
Phase I (2012) of the development is proposed to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail
space, 308 apartment units and 35 townhome units. Based on the corresponding trip
generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, and the suggested
method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet, the proposed
development is projected to generate 5,259 daily site trips, 267 A.M. peak hour site trips (90
entering, 177 exiting), and 378 P.M. peak hour site trips (215 entering, 163 exiting).
Reductions were taken to account for internal capture between land uses. In addition, a
pass-by rate of 34% was applied to the P.M. peak hour traffic. The generated trips were
distributed in accordance with the existing turning movement counts and land uses.

Phase II (2014) of the development is proposed to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail
space, 308 apartment units, 35 townhome units (from Phase I) and an additional 155
condominiums. Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip
Generation Manual, 7th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate
vs. Equation" Spreadsheet, the proposed development is projected to generate 6,104 daily site
trips, 331 A.M. peak hour site trips (101 entering, 230 exiting), and 455 P.M. peak hour site
trips (266 entering, 189 exiting). Reductions were taken to account for internal capture
between land uses. In addition, a pass-by rate of 34% was applied to the P.M. peak hour
traffic. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing turning
movement counts and land uses.



                                              iii
Phase I Build (2012) Conditions
The Phase I Build (2012) conditions account for both the Background (2012) traffic and the
site traffic generated by Phase I of the proposed development. As shown in the summary
LOS table on page viii, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the intersection
delay for all study area intersections, however none of the intersections will incur significant
decline in level of service (i.e. from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS). The newly
constructed site accesses are all projected to operate at acceptable levels of service in both
the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, with one exception. The newly constructed westbound
Access #1 approach at Chapel Hill Road is projected to operate at LOS F during both the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

Phase II Build (2014) Conditions
The Phase II Build (2014) conditions account for both the Background (2014) traffic and the
site traffic generated by Phase I and Phase II of the proposed development. As shown in
the summary LOS table on page viii, the addition of site trips will lead to an increase in the
intersection delay for all study area intersections. Specifically, the intersection of Chapel Hill
Road and Aviation Parkway is projected to degrade from LOS D to LOS E in the A.M. peak
hour, while the Chapel Hill Road and Morrisville Parkway intersection is projected to
degrade from LOS D to LOS E in the P.M. peak hour. Additionally, the Chapel Hill Road
and Cary Parkway intersection is projected to degrade from LOS E to LOS F in the P.M.
peak hour, while continuing to operate at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour. The intersection of
Weston Parkway and Evans Road is projected to degrade from LOS E to LOS F in both the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours. The unsignalized southbound Weston Estates Way approach
along Weston Parkway continues to operate at LOS F in the P.M. peak hour, while the
northbound Sheldon Drive approach continues to operate at LOS F during both the A.M.
and P.M. peak hours. Also, the unsignalized southbound Martin Tavern Road approach at
Weston Parkway is projected to decline from LOS E to LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. The
newly constructed site accesses are all projected to operate at acceptable levels of service in
both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, with one exception. The newly constructed westbound
Access #1 approach at Chapel Hill Road is projected to operate at LOS F during both the
A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have an impact on the adjacent roadways. Only two of the study area intersections fall
within Town of Cary jurisdiction ­ the Weston Parkway and Evans Road intersection and
partially the Chapel Hill Road and Weston Parkway intersection. All others fall within the
Town of Morrisville's jurisdiction. However, the following roadway improvements are
recommended based on the Town of Cary's APFO and NCDOT requirements:
Phase I (2012)

Chapel Hill Road and Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an unacceptable
LOS F in the P.M. peak hour, despite committed improvements by the Town of Morrisville.
Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this location:

                                                iv
   ·    Construct an additional left-turn lane on the northbound Chapel Hill Road
        approach, forming dual left-turn lanes.
    · Construct an additional westbound receiving lane on the eastbound Morrisville-
        Carpenter Road approach.
These improvements would require widening across the railroad tracks and would therefore
present major constructability issues.

Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an unacceptable
LOS E in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours, despite committed improvements.
Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this location:
   · Construct an exclusive eastbound right-turn lane along Cary Parkway that provides at
       least 150 feet of storage. Restripe the existing shared through-right lane to an
       exclusive through lane. Upgrade the signal phasing to accommodate the newly
       constructed eastbound right-turn as a permitted+overlapping phase.

Weston Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an unacceptable
LOS E in both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following improvements are
recommended at this location:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along Weston Parkway that
       provides at least 150 feet of storage. Restripe the existing shared through-right lane
       to an exclusive through lane. Upgrade the signal phasing to accommodate the newly
       constructed westbound right-turn lane as a permitted+overlapping phase.

Weston Parkway and Weston Estates Way/Sheldon Drive (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the northbound Sheldon Drive approach is projected to
operate at unacceptable LOS F in the P.M. peak hour, while the southbound Weston Estates
Way approach is projected to operate at LOS F during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hour.
Therefore, the following improvement is recommended at this location:
   · Based on Peak Hour Signal Warrant analyses (Appendix F) and the good intersection
       spacing at this location, implementation of a signal is recommended. However, a full
       signal warrant analysis is recommended prior to installation.

Weston Parkway and Martin Tavern Road (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection is projected to operate at a LOS E during the
P.M. peak hour under the Build (2012) conditions. Therefore, the following improvement is
recommended:
    · Construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane along Weston Parkway that
       provides at least 100 feet of storage. Restripe the existing shared through-right lane
       to an exclusive through lane.
It should also be noted that there are sight distance issues on Martin Tavern Road looking
westbound along Weston Parkway from southbound Martin Tavern Road, however no
improvements are recommended for this issue at this time.




                                              v
Chapel Hill Road and Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection is projected to operate at an unacceptable LOS
F during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, as shown on the site plan, the
following driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the westbound Access #1 approach to provide for two ingress lanes and
        two egress lanes.
    · Construct an exclusive right-turn lane on the northbound Chapel Hill Road
        approach that provides at least 500 feet of storage.
    · Construct an additional northbound through lane from Access #2 that tapers down
        to one lane approximately 300 feet north of Access #1.
    · Construct an exclusive left-turn lane on the southbound Chapel Hill Road approach
        that provides at least 300 feet of storage.
    · A complete MUTCD Signal Warrant analysis should be completed for this location
        to determine if signalization is warranted as part of Phase I. An analysis of the peak
        hour volumes indicates that the location does meet the Peak Hour Warrant during
        the P.M. peak hour (Appendix F). In addition, sight access may be limited exiting
        this access, and is therefore signalization is recommended at this location.

Chapel Hill Road and Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection is projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, as shown on the site plan, the
following driveway configuration is recommended at this location:
    · Construct the westbound Access #2 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    · Construct an exclusive right-turn lane on the northbound Chapel Hill Road
        approach that provides at least 300 feet of storage.
    · Construct a median along Chapel Hill Road, from the Weston Parkway intersection
        to the Access #1 intersection, so as to restrict access at this location, forming a right-
        in/right-out access.

Martin Tavern Road and Access #3 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates the intersection is projected to operate at acceptable levels of
service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, the following driveway
configuration is recommended at this location:
    ·   Construct the eastbound Access #3 approach to provide for one ingress lane and
        one egress lane.
    ·   Stripe an exclusive left-turn lane on the northbound Martin Tavern Road approach
        continuous to Weston Parkway. Note, there is sufficient pavement width along the
        northbound approach to accommodate this new lane without any additional
        widening.
    ·   Maintain stop control on the southbound and westbound approaches, and provide
        stop sign control on the new eastbound approach. The northbound approach
        should operate free-flow.

Phase II (2014)
All roadway improvements recommended as part of Phase I of this development should be

                                                vi
completed prior to the construction on Phase II. In addition to these improvements, two
additional improvements are required of Phase II. These improvements include:

Chapel Hill Road and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at an acceptable
LOS during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. However, due to heavy southbound
Chapel Hill Road queuing due to a very heavy right-turn volume, the following improvement
is recommended:
     · Construct an exclusive southbound right-turn lane along Chapel Hill Road with
        storage back to the adjacent gas station entrance (approximately 300 feet). Restripe
        the existing shared through-right lane to an exclusive through lane. Upgrade the
        signal phasing to accommodate the newly constructed southbound right-turn lane as
        a permitted+overlapping phase.

Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the intersection is projected to operate at unacceptable
levels of service during both the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Therefore, in addition to the
improvements proposed in Phase I at this location, the following is recommended:
    · Construct an exclusive right-turn lane, with at least 150 feet of storage, northbound
        along Chapel Hill Road. Restripe the existing northbound shared through-right turn
        lane to an exclusive through lane. Upgrade the signal phasing to accommodate the
        newly constructed northbound right-turn lane to a permitted+overlapping phase.

The lane configurations established for the Site Accesses in Phase I of the proposed
development will be sufficient to accommodate the additional traffic demand created by the
construction of Phase II.

development is proposed to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail space, 308 apartment
units, 155 condominium units, and 35 townhome units. The property is located within the
Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the Town of Cary's Ordinance 05-0009),
requiring a Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. The proposed
development is expected to be completed in two phases ­ the first being completed in 2012
and the second in 2014. Phase I of the development consists of the retail space, apartment
units, and townhomes, with Phase II consisting of the condominiums. This report analyzes
the potential traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the development is proposed via three driveways - two along NC 54 and
one along Martin Tavern Road (Figure 2). The following intersections meet the Town's
requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future
conditions, where applicable:

   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Weston Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway (signalized)
   ·   Weston Parkway and Martin Tavern Road (unsignalized)
   ·   Weston Parkway and Sheldon Drive/Weston Estates Way (unsignalized)
   ·   Weston Parkway and Evans Road (signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Access #1 (future signalized)
   ·   Chapel Hill Road and Access #2 (future right-in/right-out)
   ·   Martin Tavern Road and Access #3 (future unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

      2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
                           CRITERIA
      Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
      traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
      Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
      vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
      the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
      Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
      ranges.

  Level of Service           Description

          A                Little or no delay          <= 10 sec.             <= 10 sec.
          B               Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.              10-15 sec.
          C              Average traffic delay         20-35 sec.              15-25 sec.
          D               Long traffic delay           35-55 sec.              25-35 sec.
          E             Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.              35-50 sec.
           F             Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.               > 50 sec.

The development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone." Level of
service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour (as
defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers) with LOS D considered acceptable for
both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled approaches. For signalized
intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service less than LOS D, then
no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under build conditions. For unsignalized
intersections, where the stop controlled approach is below an LOS D under background
conditions, then no drop in level of service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans from the
Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the
Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, the majority of the study area intersections are operating at
acceptable levels of service, LOS D or better. However, two signalized intersections are
currently operating under failing conditions. Specifically, the Chapel Hill Road and Aviation
Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection operates at LOS F during both the A.M.
and P.M. peak hours, while the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection is operating
at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS F in the P.M. peak hour. In addition, both stop-
controlled approaches of Sheldon Drive and Weston Estates Way at Weston Parkway are
operating under failing level of service conditions in the P.M. peak hour.

In addition, three developments in the vicinity are expected to be completed prior to, or at
the same time as the build-out of the proposed development. Traffic generated from these
approved or planned projects was therefore included in the Background scenarios (2012 and
2014). These projects include:

Twin Lakes Amendment (03-TAR-145A) ­ This mixed use development is proposed to be
constructed along Davis Drive, south of McCrimmon Parkway. The proposed development
is to consist of 159 detached single-family dwelling units, 662 townhomes, 150 assisted living
dwelling units, 250,000 square feet of retail space, four high-turnover sit down restaurants
totaling 28,000 square feet (7,000 square feet each) and 100,000 square feet of office space
and be fully constructed by 2011. A traffic analysis report was prepared by The Sear Brown
Group and submitted to the Town of Cary in August 2003 (with revisions in December
2003 and February 2004). As shown in 03-TAR-145a, the proposed development is
projected to generate 1,176 A.M. peak hour trips (548 entering, 628 exiting) and 1,254 P.M.
peak hour trips (669 entering, 585 exiting). As the development has already been partially
built and occupied, only a portion of the projected site trips were distributed to the study
area intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in 03-TAR-145a. Figure D-1
in Appendix D depicts the assigned trips. The TIA for this development recommended the
following roadway improvements:
      · Chapel Hill Road at Morrisville Carpenter Road/Aviation Parkway
              o Construct a southbound right-turn lane
              o Construct an eastbound right-turn lane
These improvements have been committed to by the Town of Morrisville.

Park West Village ­ This mixed use development is proposed to be constructed in the
northwestern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection in Morrisville.
The proposed development is to consist of 425 apartments, a 140-room hotel, 50,000 square
feet of office space, a 180,000-square foot discount superstore, and 570,000 square feet of
retail space, including a movie theatre, and be fully constructed by 2010. A traffic analysis
report was prepared by Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. and submitted to the Town of
Morrisville in April 2007. As shown in the report, the proposed development is projected to
generate 1,158 A.M. peak hour trips (615 entering, 543 exiting) and 3,148 P.M. peak hour
trips (1,523 entering, 1,625 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the assumed distribution patterns in the report. Figure D-2 in
Appendix D depicts the assigned trips. The TIA for this development recommended the
following roadway improvements:
      · Chapel Hill Road at Cary Parkway
              o Construct an eastbound left-turn lane with 325 feet of full storage along Cary
                 Parkway.
              o Construct an additional northbound through lane along Chapel Hill Road.
              o Construct a northbound right-turn lane along Chapel Hill Road.

     · Chapel Hill Road at Morrisville Parkway
           o Restripe the existing northbound right-turn lane to accommodate a shared
              through/right-turn lane. Modify the northbound departure to receive the
              additional through lane.
           o Restripe the existing southbound right-turn lane to accommodate a shared
              through/right-turn lane. Modify the northbound departure to receive the
              additional through lane.
           o Construct an exclusive eastbound left-turn lane on Morrisville Parkway with
              325 feet of full storage, creating dual left-turn lanes.
           o Modify existing signal to accommodate recommended lane configurations.

Morrisville Manor ­ This senior housing development is proposed to be constructed in the
southeastern quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road and Cary Parkway intersection. The
proposed development is to consist of 214 bedrooms and be completed by 2009. A traffic
analysis report was not required of this development. The proposed development is
projected to generate 30 A.M. peak hour trips (15 entering, 15 exiting) and 43 P.M. peak
hour trips (26 entering, 17 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
intersections based on the current land uses and traffic patterns. Figure D-3 in Appendix D
depicts the assigned trips. The TIA for this development recommended the following
roadway improvements:
      · Chapel Hill Road at Cary Parkway
             o Construct an additional northbound through lane, striped as a shared
                through/right-turn lane.

The total site trips from the approved developments are depicted in Figure 5. Because all
approved developments within the vicinity of the proposed development are projected to be
completed by the build year of Phase I (2012), the total site trips for these developments
included in the Background (2012) and Background (2014) analyses are identical, and all
associated roadway improvements were included in the 2012 and 2014 analyses. Figures 6

and 7 illustrate the volumes used in the Background (2012) and Background (2014) analyses,
respectively.


3.2 FUTURE ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
                   IMPROVEMENTS
The Town of Morrisville has plans to improve the intersection of Chapel Hill Road and
Aviation Parkway by adding additional lanes northbound along Chapel Hill Road and
eastbound along Morrisville-Carpenter Road as well as upgrading the signal phasing and
timings. These impending improvements, depicted in Appendix E, were included in both
the Background (2012) and Background (2014) analyses.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
                     ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday A.M. and P.M.
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the future year
analyses. A summary of the findings for the Background (2012) and Background (2014)
scenario LOS analyses can be found in Tables 5 and 6, respectively, and the full Synchro/HCS
output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2012) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area will
experience an increase in level of service, which can be attributed to both optimized signal
timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the Chapel Hill Road and
Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection is projected to experience a rise
in level of service ­ LOS F to LOS D in the A.M. while continuing to operate at LOS F in
the P.M. peak hour with a reduction in traffic delay. Additionally, the Chapel Hill Road and
Cary Parkway intersection is projected to experience a rise in level of service in the P.M.
peak hour (LOS F to LOS E), while continuing to operate at LOS E in the A.M. peak hour.
However, the intersection of Weston Parkway and Evans Road is projected to degrade from
LOS D to LOS E in the A.M. peak hour and LOS C to LOS E in the P.M. peak hour. In
addition, southbound Weston Estates Way at Weston Parkway declines to LOS E in the
A.M. peak hour, while the northbound approach will decline to a LOS F in the P.M. peak
hour.

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, some of the intersections within the study area will
experience an increase in level of service, which can be attributed to both optimized signal
timings and committed geometric improvements. Namely, the Chapel Hill Road and
Aviation Parkway/Morrisville-Carpenter Road intersection is projected to experience a rise

4.0    BUILD ANALYSIS
Davis Development, Inc. plans to construct a mixed-use development in the northeastern
quadrant of the Chapel Hill Road (NC 54) and Weston Parkway intersection (Figure 1). The
development is proposed to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail space, 308 apartment
units, 155 condominium units, and 35 townhome units. The proposed development is
expected to be completed in two phases ­ the first being completed in 2012 and the second
in 2014. Phase I of the development consists of the retail space, apartment units, and
townhomes, with Phase II consisting of the condominiums.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Phase I (2012) of the development is proposed to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail
space, 308 apartment units and 35 townhome units. Based on the corresponding trip
generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, and the suggested
method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet, the proposed
development is projected to generate 5,259 daily site trips, 267 A.M. peak hour site trips (90
entering, 177 exiting), and 378 P.M. peak hour site trips (215 entering, 163 exiting).
Reductions were taken to account for internal capture between land uses. In addition, a
pass-by rate of 34% was applied to the P.M. peak hour traffic. The generated trips were
distributed in accordance with the existing turning movement counts and land uses.

Phase II (2014) of the development is proposed to consist of 40,000 square feet of retail
space, 308 apartment units, 35 townhome units (from Phase I) and an additional 155
condominiums. Based on the corresponding trip generation codes included in ITE Trip
Generation Manual, 7th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate
vs. Equation" Spreadsheet, the proposed development is projected to generate 6,104 daily site
trips, 331 A.M. peak hour site trips (101 entering, 230 exiting), and 455 P.M. peak hour site
trips (266 entering, 189 exiting). Reductions were taken to account for internal capture
between land uses. In addition, a pass-by rate of 34% was applied to the P.M. peak hour
traffic. The generated trips were distributed in accordance with the existing turning
movement counts and land uses.

Tables 7 and 8 summarize the assumed trip generation for both phases of the proposed
development for typical weekday A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

    · 10% from Chapel Hill Road to the south
    · 5% from Morrisville-Carpenter Road to the west
    · 5% from Aviation Parkway to the east
    · 10% from Morrisville Parkway to the west
    · 5% from Cary Parkway to the west
    · 5% from Cary Parkway to the east
    · 2% from Sheldon Drive to the south
    · 13% from Evans Road to the north
    · 5% from Evans Road to the south
    · 25% from Weston Parkway to the east

    ·    3% from Martin Tavern Road to the north
    ·    3% from Weston Estates Way to the north
    ·    2% from Sheldon Drive to the south
    ·    5% from Evans Road to the north
    ·    5% from Evans Road to the south
    ·    5% from Weston Parkway to the east

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the residential trip distribution and assignment, respectively for
Phase I. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the non-pass-by retail trip distribution and assignment,
respectively for Phase I. Figures 12 and 13 illustrate the pass-by retail trip distribution and
assignment, respectively for Phase I. Figure 14 illustrates the total site trips assigned as part
of Phase I of the proposed development.

Figure 15 illustrates the residential trip assignment for Phase II. This assignment is based on
the same distribution used for the Phase I residential trips. Note, this figure illustrates total
residential trips from Phase I and Phase II combined. Figure 16 illustrates the total retail
trips (non-pass-by and pass-by trips combined, from Phase I). Finally, Figure 17 illustrates
the total site trips assigned for Phase II of the proposed development.

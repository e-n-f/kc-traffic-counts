                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A new commercial development, tentatively named Cooke Property, is being proposed
for construction along the N.C. Highway 55 corridor between its intersection with
Carpenter Fire Station Road and future intersection with the Morrisville Parkway
Extension, in Cary, N.C. Figure 1 shows the general site location of the planned
development. The proposed Cooke Property site has 10 individual site parcels, nine to
be located east of N.C. 55 and one west of N.C. 55 and will feature commercial and
retail land uses. The proposed development is planned to be fully complete by 2013
and is planned to have a phased construction schedule. This report analyzes the full
build-out scenario and the no-build scenario for the 2013 design year, as well as 2008
existing year traffic conditions for the AM and PM peak hours of an average weekday.

The site parcel currently has limited residential development.        Figure 2 shows a
preliminary site plan for the proposed development. This figure also indicates locations
of proposed site access roadways along N.C. 55 and the conversion of Morrisville
Carpenter Road in the vicinity of N.C. 55 into a site driveway. This report analyzes and
presents the traffic impacts that the Cooke Property development will have on the
following existing intersections in the northwest Cary area:

      N.C. 55 and McCrimmon Parkway
      N.C. 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
      N.C. 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road
      N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road
      Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Fire Station Road
      Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road
      Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road

The report also analyzes seven future site driveway intersections that provide access to
the individual site parcels. Four site driveways are located on the east side of N.C. 55,
and one site driveway is located on the west side of N.C. 55. The site plan shows the
conversion of Morrisville Carpenter Road to a site access driveway that dead-ends just
west of the existing CSX Railroad corridor. This main driveway will also serve individual
parcel driveways to the north and south.

There are numerous Town of Cary-approved future developments either currently under
construction or planned to be complete by the 2013 design year in the study area that
are expected to generate additional background traffic.

II.   EXISTING CONDITIONS

Four study area intersections along N.C. 55 are currently signalized. The remaining
study area intersections are unsignalized, stop-controlled intersections. N.C. 55 serves
as a high volume regionally significant arterial providing access to numerous east-west
arterials in areas of west Cary and also provides connectivity to the Research Triangle
Park area, the City of Durham and the Town of Apex. N.C. 55 experiences heavy
northbound AM peak hour and southbound PM peak hour traffic flows to and from the
Research Triangle Park area.          Carpenter Fire Station Road, Morrisville Carpenter
Road, Morrisville Parkway, and McCrimmon Parkway serve the study area as minor
arterials, providing access to residential and commercial areas in the nearby west Cary
vicinity. Currently, the site property is features limited residential development.

III. PROBABLE IMPACTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

The preliminary Cooke Property plans consist of 10 separate development parcels
along N.C. 55 with several proposed access points. Development plans include a drive-
through pharmacy, three fast food restaurants, two drive-through banks, three separate
commercial/retail buildings and a self-storage facility. Parking for the proposed facilities
is expected to be provided on surface parking lots that either serve an individual
development or may be shared between developments. Any internal connections and
individual circulation for the site was not analyzed in this study, except for internal
driveway connections at a primary access driveway which is slated to be located at the
existing cross-section of Morrisville Carpenter Road just west of the CSX Railroad
corridor. The project is proposed to be built in three phases with build-out of the entire
project is assumed to be complete by 2013.

The proposed site plan (Figure 2) shows three right-turn in/right-turn out only (RIRO)
driveways along northbound N.C. 55, a RIRO driveway with a proposed left-over access
break along N.C. 55 approximately 1,000 feet south of the existing Morrisville Carpenter
Road intersection, and a RIRO driveway along southbound N.C. 55. With the access
limitations along N.C. 55, some site trips are expected to potentially make u-turns
upstream and downstream to access the site from a particular direction. No external
roadway improvements beyond those described above are shown on the site plan.
Table ES-1 shows the estimated trip generation data for the proposed development,
based on methodologies found in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip
Generation Manual, Volume 7. Individual trip generation data was applied for each site
parcel to determine site traffic assignment at individual driveways. Site trip distribution
estimates were made using existing study area traffic volume data and account for
several changes due to background roadway improvement projects (Carpenter Fire
Station Road, Morrisville Parkway Extension, Western Wake Parkway).

IV. TRAFFIC OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

Existing intersections were analyzed during AM and PM peak hours, with the use of
average peak hour traffic volumes calculated from data collected by HNTB. 2013
design year traffic volumes were estimated from ambient area-wide traffic growth
estimates and projected site traffic from two Town-approved background traffic
generators (Town of Cary TAR 182a ­ Highcroft Commons and TAR 253 ­ McCrimmon
Property Restaurant/Retail).     Numerous other developments are either under
construction or planned to be complete by the 2013 design year, and their effects, as
well as effects from expected roadway improvement projects, were included in the 2013
design year traffic volume estimates. It was assumed that the Carpenter Fire Station
Road widening project west of N.C. 55, the Carpenter Fire Station Road
widening/realignment/railroad grade separation project, and the Morrisville Parkway
Extension project to N.C. 55 would be completed by 2013 and appropriate adjustments
for these improvements were made in the operations analysis for the 2013 without site
and with site scenarios. The addition of background traffic growth exacerbates peak
hour operational problems at intersections along N.C. 55, due to heavy peak hour
volumes on N.C. 55.

The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2000) and the corresponding Highway
Capacity Software (HCS+) provide the methodology with which to perform the analyses.
The HCM methods determine level of service. Level of service provides a qualitative
rating of traffic conditions based on quantitative data for a given transportation facility
type. The Highway Capacity Software was supplemented with the traffic operations
optimization and evaluation software Synchro Professional Version 6.0 to evaluate

traffic operations for each intersection, related to vehicular delays (intersection average
as a whole if signalized, critical movement if stop-controlled) and the corresponding

                                        Cooke Property ­ Proposed Commercial Development

V. MITIGATION RELATED TO THE PROJECT
A summary of intersection operations capacity analysis and the effect of site traffic from
the Cooke Property development on each individual study area intersection is presented
below, along with a discussion of necessary mitigation for the 2013 design year.
Figures 12 and 12a present all recommended mitigation improvements.

N.C. 55 and McCrimmon Parkway
This intersection will operate acceptably in all existing and 2013 design year scenarios
for both peak periods. No mitigation is required for this intersection.

N.C. 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
This intersection operates over capacity, even with the recent improvements to N.C. 55,
in the 2008 AM and PM peak hours. This is primarily due to increasingly heavy traffic
flow on both N.C. 55 (regionally) and Carpenter Fire Station Road (locally) and the fact
that the Carpenter Fire Station Road approaches feature a single shared left-
turn/through/right-turn lane. Background mitigation by 2013 at this intersection for these
and future traffic increases is expected to feature improvements provided by the Town
of Cary Carpenter Fire Station Road widening project to the west of N.C. 55 and the
Town of Cary project to widen/realign Carpenter Fire Station Road to the east of N.C.
55, providing a grade separation at the nearby CSX railroad corridor. This project has
not been specifically approved by the Town, but is considered necessary for the viability
of the Cooke Property project, due to its correlation with the at-grade railroad crossing
closure on Morrisville Carpenter Road.

No final design for either section of the Carpenter Fire Station Road improvements was
available for review for this report, but it is assumed that the cross section on either side
of N.C. 55 will be improved to a four-lane divided facility with exclusive left-turn lanes at
the N.C. 55 intersection. Even with these improvements completed by 2013,
background traffic volumes cause the intersection to operate at a LOS F in the AM peak
hour and a LOS E in the PM peak hour.

The recommended mitigation strategy for this intersection is to include additional
through travel lanes on N.C. 55 to provide the necessary capacity to make a significant
improvement in LOS and per vehicle delay. A southbound through travel lane should
be constructed at least 1,200 feet upstream of the intersection. A northbound through
travel lane should extend at least 2,000 feet past the intersection. These improvements
are consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

In addition to these improvements, a dual left-turn lane with at least 200 feet of storage
in each lane should be constructed for the westbound Carpenter Fire Station Road
approach. If a tunnel were constructed under the CSX railroad crossing, provision for a
dual left-turn lane may not extend into the tunnel roadway cross-section, whereas a
longer single-lane left-turn bay may impact the tunnel roadway cross-section. The
existing northbound left-turn bay should also be extended to at least 350 feet minimum
full storage to accommodate additional site-related left-turns and u-turns.

N.C. 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road (Main Site Driveway)
This intersection currently operates over capacity in the 2008 AM peak hour. With the
proposed Carpenter Fire Station Road improvements east of N.C. 55, Town of Cary
staff has indicated that additional improvements to at-grade railroad crossings along the
N.C. 55 corridor may occur due to other developments. These improvements are part
of a plan to provide a grade separation at Carpenter Fire Station Road and close the
existing crossing at Morrisville Carpenter Road, effectively splitting the road in two and
making each segment a local traffic-only facility. Thus, 2013 Without Site analyses
estimate the no peak hour traffic volume will use the stubbed-out portion of Morrisville
Carpenter Road and the resulting LOS is A for both peak hours.

The proposed site plan shows Morrisville Carpenter Road just east of N.C. 55 being
used as a primary site driveway, though no laneage is specified. 2013 With Site
Condition capacity analyses indicate that the intersection will operate at a LOS F in the
AM peak hour with existing laneage on N.C. 55 and two exiting lanes from the site
driveway.

To mitigate the deficient AM peak hour LOS, it is recommended that an additional travel
lane northbound and southbound on N.C. 55 be constructed through this intersection.
In addition, to ensure that westbound approach queues from the site parcels do not
block the internal site driveway crossing at the terminus of Morrisville Carpenter Road, a
three-lane approach is recommended with a left-turn lane, a shared left-turn/through
lane, and an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 125 feet of storage. The existing
southbound left-turn bay on N.C. 55 should be lengthened from 225 feet to 350 feet to
account for additional site-related left-turn and u-turn traffic. The existing northbound
right-turn lane full storage length could be reduced from 225 feet to 150 feet.

N.C. 55 and Morrisville Parkway Extension
This intersection is expected to be signalized by 2013 and is expected to operate at a
LOS E in the 2013 AM peak hour in the Without Site Condition. The AM LOS drops to a
LOS F with the addition of site-related traffic. As with the intersections described above,
significant improvements to through travel capacity are required to mitigate deficient
operations. N.C. 55 will require an additional through travel lane northbound at this
intersection and the existing southbound left-turn bay will need to be extended to 500
feet from an existing 250 feet to adequately store left-turning traffic. The proposed
mitigation improvement to add a southbound through travel lane on N.C. 55 is not
necessary for adequate capacity at this intersection and the lane can be dropped
upstream of this intersection, although future pavement widening should extend to the
intersection to allow development of adequate laneage when the extension of Morrisville
Parkway west of the intersection is built.

N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road
The intersection of N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road currently operates at an
acceptable LOS in the 2008 AM and PM peak hours. Additional background traffic
growth impacts by 2013 are expected to drop the LOS in the AM peak hour to LOS E.
Additional site-related traffic from the Cooke Property development is expected to

                                       Cooke Property ­ Proposed Commercial Development

further worsen overall delay in the AM peak hour to LOS F. To mitigate these impacts,
additional though travel capacity is needed along N.C. 55 northbound.              It is
recommended that a third through travel lane be constructed starting at least 1,200 feet
south of the intersection. LOS in the AM peak hour is expected to improve to a LOS C.
No other improvements are required.

Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Fire Station Road
This intersection operates at a deficient LOS F in the 2008 PM peak hour, due to
moderate to high traffic volumes on both roadways coupled with the fact there are no
auxiliary turning lanes at any approach. With the proposed improvements to Carpenter
Fire Station Road east of N.C. 55, it is expected that roadway realignment will create a
new intersection where Morrisville Carpenter Road with terminate at the four-lane
divided Carpenter Fire Station Road facility. It was assumed that a full median break
would be provided at this location and that an exclusive westbound left-turn lane would
be constructed. Northbound stop-controlled laneage was analyzed as a single shared
left-turn/right-turn lane. With this laneage, 2013 traffic operations for both the Without
Site Condition and With Site Conditions are expected to provide adequate LOS in both
AM and PM peak hours. No further mitigation due to site traffic impact is necessary.

Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road
This intersection operates at a deficient LOS E in the 2008 existing AM peak hour for
northbound stop-controlled turning movements. The proposed project to eliminate the
current at-grade railroad crossing along Morrisville Carpenter Road, coupled with the
access limitations on Carpenter Upchurch Road at Morrisville Parkway proposed in the
Morrisville Parkway Extension project will result in both roadways in this vicinity to
function as local access facilities with much lower traffic volumes. Capacity analysis
results in 2013 for both Without Site and With Site Conditions show that the intersection
will operate acceptably in both AM and PM peak hours. Thus, no further mitigation to
existing geometrics/traffic control is recommended.

Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road
This intersection operates acceptably in the 2008 AM and PM peak hours. The access
restrictions imposed on Carpenter Upchurch Road in the Morrisville Parkway Extension
project will result in acceptable operations in all 2013 scenarios. No further mitigation is
required at this intersection beyond what has been designed for the Morrisville Parkway
Extension project.

Proposed Site Driveways along N.C. 55

      Site Driveways #1, #2 and #4
      In the 2013 With Site Condition, these intersections are reported as being
      deficient for the westbound stop-controlled right-turn driveway movements in the
      AM peak hour, due to limited gaps in heavy northbound N.C. 55 traffic. With the
      proposed mitigation widening of N.C. 55 along the site frontage to include a third
      northbound through travel lane, LOS improves to acceptable levels in all three
      cases. It is recommended that each driveway also feature a northbound right-
      turn deceleration lane to remove site-related traffic from the travel stream with at
      least 100 feet of full storage and adequate taper.

      Site Driveway #3 (Proposed Left-Over)
      In the 2013 With Site Condition, this intersection is reported as being deficient for
      the southbound left-turn/u-turn movement and westbound right-turn driveway
      movement in the AM peak hour and for the northbound u-turn movement in the
      PM peak hour, due to high directional traffic volumes on N.C. 55 limiting gaps
      with two travel lanes in each directions. The proposed widening of N.C. 55 to
      three through travel lanes in each direction will allow more gaps in traffic in this
      vicinity and reduces delays in both peak hours. In the AM peak hour, the
      southbound left-turn/u-turn movement is still expected to operate at LOS E and
      the westbound stop-controlled movement at LOS F, but an analysis of maximum
      estimated queues for these movements suggests that spillback onto N.C. 55 or
      blocking internal driveways will not occur. The design of the left-over turn lanes
      should provide at least 200 feet of storage in each direction, to conservatively
      provide enough storage. The northbound approach should also feature a right-
      turn deceleration lane with at least 100 feet of full storage.

      Site Driveway #5
      In the 2013 With Site Condition, this intersection is reported as being deficient for
      the eastbound stop-controlled right-turn driveway movement in the PM peak
      hour, due to limited gaps in heavy southbound N.C. 55 traffic. With the proposed
      mitigation widening of N.C. 55 along the site frontage to include a third
      southbound through travel lane, LOS improves to an acceptable level in the PM
      peak hour. It is recommended that the driveway also feature a southbound right-
      turn deceleration lane to remove site-related traffic from the travel stream with at
      least 100 feet of full storage and adequate taper.

      Main Site Driveway and Site Driveways #6&#7 (Internal to Site)
      In the 2013 With Site Condition, this intersection will operate acceptably in both
      peak hours, and is not expected to cause any spillback onto N.C. 55 or block
      internal driveways provided that the eastbound Main Site Driveway laneage
      contains separate left-turn and right-turn lanes. The northbound and southbound
      laneage was assumed to feature a single shared through/turning lane in each
      direction. The westbound Main Site Driveway exiting laneage should feature two
      travel lanes, with a right-turn bay at the N.C. 55 intersection.

                                      Cooke Property ­ Proposed Commercial Development


I. EXISTING CONDITIONS

A. Introduction

A new commercial development, tentatively named Cooke Property, is being proposed
for construction along the N.C. Highway 55 corridor between its intersection with
Carpenter Fire Station Road and future intersection with the Morrisville Parkway
Extension, in Cary, N.C. Figure 1 shows the general site location of the planned
development. The proposed Cooke Property site has 10 individual site parcels, nine to
be located east of N.C. 55 and one west of N.C. 55 and will feature commercial and
retail land uses. The proposed development is planned to be fully complete by 2013
and is planned to have a phased construction schedule. This report analyzes the full
build-out scenario and the no-build scenario for the 2013 design year, as well as 2008
existing year traffic conditions.

The site parcel currently has limited residential development.      Figure 2 shows a
preliminary site plan for the proposed development. This figure also indicates locations
of proposed site access roadways along N.C. 55 and the conversion of Morrisville
Carpenter Road in the vicinity of N.C. 55 into a site driveway.

B. Project Description

This report analyzes and presents the traffic impacts that the Cooke Property
development will have on the following existing intersections in the northwest Cary area:

      N.C. 55 and McCrimmon Parkway
      N.C. 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
      N.C. 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road
      N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road
      Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Fire Station Road
      Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road
      Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road

The report also analyzes seven future site driveway intersections that provide access to
the individual site parcels. Four site driveways are located on the east side of N.C. 55,
and one site driveway is located on the west side of N.C. 55. The site plan shows the
conversion of Morrisville Carpenter Road to a site access driveway that dead-ends just
west of the existing CSX Railroad corridor. This main driveway will also serve individual
parcel driveways to the north and south.

The impacts of the proposed site at these intersections will be evaluated during the AM
and PM peak hours of an average weekday. The following analysis is based on
background traffic for the existing year, 2008, the growth in background traffic for the
design year of 2013, and the estimated site-generated traffic produced by the
development parcel. There are numerous Town of Cary-approved future developments

either currently under construction or planned to be complete by the 2013 design year in
the study area that are expected to generate additional background traffic.

C. Geometrics and Traffic Control

Existing Roadways

N.C. Highway 55 is a heavily traveled arterial located just to the west of the site that
runs north-south in the study area connecting Cary and Apex with RTP (Research
Triangle Park) and Durham. Currently, it is a four-lane median divided facility in the
project study area, with turn lanes at major intersections. The current posted speed in
the study area is 50 mph. No pedestrian facilities are present, and on-street parking is
not allowed.

McCrimmon Parkway is an east-west minor arterial connecting N.C. 55 in the study
area with Green Level-to-Durham Road to the west of the study area. It serves Panther
Creek high school and numerous residential developments either complete, under
construction, or planned in the near future. In the project study area, McCrimmon
Parkway is a two-lane facility with a 45 mph speed limit. Current right-of-way is
reserved for an eventual four-lane divided cross section. Limited pedestrian facilities
are present and on-street parking is not allowed.

Carpenter Fire Station Road is a two-lane minor arterial roadway in the study area that
connects the historic village of Carpenter, near N.C. 55, with new residential
developments located in western Cary. East of N.C. 55, Carpenter Fire Station Road
has a 35 mph speed limit that increases to 45 mph past the N.C. 55 intersection. No
pedestrian facilities are present and on-street parking is not allowed.

Morrisville Carpenter Road is an east-west arterial connecting N.C. 55 in the study
area with Aviation Parkway and the Raleigh-Durham International Airport to the east of
the study area. In the project study area, Morrisville Carpenter Road is a two-lane
facility with a 35 mph speed limit to the east of N.C. 55. West of N.C. 55, the road is
known as Indian Wells Road, a local residential access street.

Carpenter Upchurch Road is a north-south collector roadway that parallels N.C. 55
just to the east of the CSX railroad corridor. Carpenter Upchurch Road is a two-lane
facility that provides access to local neighborhoods east of the project study area. The
posted speed limit varies from 35 to 45 mph.

Morrisville Parkway is an east-west arterial facility serving areas of west Cary and the
Town of Morrisville. Portions of Morrisville Parkway are currently under construction
and the completed segments will eventually provide a continuous connection between
N.C. 55 and the Town of Morrisville. The roadway is a four-lane divided cross-section
with auxiliary turn lanes and sidewalks. Morrisville Parkway has a posted speed limit of
45 mph.

Green Hope School Road is a two-lane semi-rural collector facility that operates with a
posted speed limit of 45 mph. Currently, this roadway was designed to accommodate
light traffic volumes and features substandard vertical and horizontal geometrics in
some locations. It also features narrow pavement lane widths of 11 feet or less and no
pedestrian facilities are present.

Intersections

Currently, there are seven intersections in the study area. The intersections of N.C. 55
with McCrimmon Parkway, Carpenter Fire Station Road, Morrisville Parkway, and
Green Hope School Road are all signalized. Figure 3 shows the existing lane
configurations and traffic control for these intersections and adjacent roadway
segments.

The intersection of N.C. 55 and McCrimmon Parkway is currently signalized and
operating with three signal phases. Eastbound minor approach laneage consists of
dual left-turn lanes and an exclusive right-turn lane. The northbound N.C. 55 approach
has an exclusive left-turn lane storage bay and two through travel lanes. Southbound
N.C. 55 is separated into an exclusive U-turn storage bay lane, two through travel lanes,
and an exclusive right-turn lane. Protected/permitted northbound left-turn phasing is
currently in operation. No on-street parking or sidewalks are present in the intersection
vicinity.

The intersection of N.C. 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road is currently signalized and
operating with five signal phases. Eastbound and westbound minor approach laneage
consists of single shared left/through/right-turn lanes, although the eastbound approach
has adequate width for left-turning vehicles and through/right-turning vehicles. The
northbound and southbound N.C. 55 approaches have exclusive left-turn lane storage
bays, two through travel lanes, and an exclusive right-turn lane. Protected/permitted
southbound left-turn phasing is currently in operation. No on-street parking or sidewalks
are present in the intersection vicinity.

The intersection of N.C. 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road is currently signalized and is
operating with three signal phases. Northbound and southbound approaches feature an
exclusive left-turn lane, two through travel lanes, and an exclusive right-turn lane. The
eastbound and westbound approaches have shared left-turn/through/right-turn lanes.
Northbound and southbound approaches on N.C. 55 feature protected+permitted left-
turn signal phasing. No on-street parking or sidewalks are present in the intersection
vicinity.

The intersection of N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road is currently signalized and is
operating with six signal phases. The northbound approach features an exclusive left-
turn lane, two through travel lanes, and a short flared right-turn deceleration lane. The
southbound approach features an exclusive left-turn lane, two through lanes, and a
right-turn deceleration lane. The eastbound approach on Green Hope School Road has
an exclusive left-turn lane and a shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane. The westbound

approach has a shared left-turn/through/right-turn lane. The eastbound and westbound
approaches features split signal phasing. No on-street parking or sidewalks are present
in the intersection vicinity.

D. Existing Traffic Volumes and Other Potential Impacts

Figure 4 shows the existing AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes for the study area
intersections. The turning movement counts used to determine these volumes were
conducted by Mulkey Engineers, Inc. for HNTB North Carolina, P.C. for the following
intersections on the respective dates shown in Table 1. Traffic count data files can be
found in Appendix B of this report.

Transit Impacts
Currently, Triangle Transit Authority (TTA) Route 311 operates within the study area.
The daily 311 route runs along N.C. 55, making a stop at commercial and retail
developments at N.C. 55 and High House Road for both northbound and southbound
riders south of the TAR 290 study area. Route 311 buses have 30 minute headways in
each direction during the AM and PM peak periods. Because of the large headways
between buses (two/three total buses by direction in the AM peak hour and two/three
buses in the PM peak hour) and the small percentage of ridership (in terms of total trips
made in the study area), it is anticipated that this route will have an insignificant effect
on travel behavior of site traffic in the study area.

                                       Cooke Property ­ Proposed Commercial Development

The Town of Cary offers a demand-responsive bus service, C-Tran, which is available
to senior citizens and those with mobility limitations. It is a door-to-door service that is
available for use by reservation only. Though this service is provided throughout most
of the study area, it is anticipated that it will have an insignificant effect on travel
behavior of site traffic in the study area. C-Tran also offers fixed route bus service on
three routes, but none of these routes operate within one mile of the study area
Therefore, no adjustment has been made to projected site traffic volumes, based on C-
Tran services.

Planned Roadway Improvement Impacts
The Town of Cary has two major projects that will have direct impacts on traffic flow in
the Cooke Property study area by 2013.

 Carpenter Fire Station Road will be widened to a four-lane cross section with
 median west of N.C. 55 by the fall of 2010. This improvement project has not
 entered final design, but all design year analyses for this study account for potential
 improvements to be made to the eastbound Carpenter Fire Station Road approach
 at N.C. 55.

 Morrisville Parkway will be extended to the west from its existing terminus at
 Carpenter Upchurch Road to N.C 55 by early 2010. This project will involve the
 extension of the existing four-lane divided roadway and design plans show a
 concrete median that will limit the movements at the existing northbound and
 southbound approaches on Carpenter Upchurch Road to right-turn in/right-turn out
 only. This project will also disallow left-turns eastbound on the new roadway and will
 allow left-turns westbound in a separate turn lane.

   The Town of Cary has plans to extend Morrisville Parkway west of N.C. 55 to
   eventually extend to Green Level to Durham Road and provide an interchange
   access with the proposed Western Wake Parkway toll project. This project is shown
   in the Town's 10 Year Capital Improvements Plan for funding in 2011, but was NOT
   considered complete for this study.

For the purposes of this study, an additional roadway improvement was considered in
all analyses for the 2013 build out year. In conversations with Town of Cary staff, this
project may be funded by the Town for completion in the future, depending on pending
agreements and construction schedules for other development projects near the TAR
290 study area. It was assumed that this improvement will need to be complete in the
2013 design year for the Cooke Property development to be a viable project, as the
improvements described below are necessary for the use of Morrisville Carpenter Road
as a primary site access driveway.

 Carpenter Fire Station Road, to the east of N.C. 55, is assumed to be widened to a
 four-lane divided facility, per recommendations in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
 Transportation Plan, Town of Cary Northwest Area Plan, and Town of Cary Historic
 Carpenter Village Plan. It also is shown in the Town's 2008 Capital Improvements

   Program budget. This section of Carpenter Fire Station Road will also feature a
   grade-separated crossing of the existing CSX Railroad corridor. The exact type of
   grade separation (bridge or tunnel) is not specifically analyzed for this study. The
   roadway improvement will connect with existing Morrisville Carpenter Road east of
   the study area and may require the realignment of Morrisville Carpenter Road to tie
   into the new realigned facility. Per information from Town of Cary staff, this project
   would also cause the closure of the existing at-grade railroad crossing at Morrisville
   Carpenter Road, thus making Morrisville Carpenter Road in the project vicinity a
   local access facility east of the railroad corridor and usable as a site access
   driveway for the TAR 290 project.

The North Carolina Toll Authority (NCTA) is planning on constructing the Western
Wake Parkway (NCDOT TIP Project R-2635) just west of the project study area to be
open to traffic by 2011. This project is expected to have significant impacts on traffic
flow on the N.C. 55 corridor and on local east-west arterials in the study area. Access
to the proposed four-lane divided tollway will be at N.C. 55 north of the study area and
at an extension of Morrisville Parkway west of the project study area.

A schematic of assumed road improvements and laneage changes to be complete by
2013 in the project study area is shown in Figure 5.


II. PROBABLE IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT

Lands upon which the site will be constructed currently feature several residential
properties, with most of the land being undeveloped. The general location of the
proposed land uses and site access roadway connections to N.C. 55 are shown in the
proposed site plan in Figure 2. Traffic entering and exiting the proposed Cooke
Property development will be assumed to use the most convenient and direct access
points for external trips. The site plan delineates specific access restrictions for each
proposed site driveway and is proposing the use of existing Morrisville Carpenter Road
just east of N.C. 55 as a full access point. A second access break along N.C. 55 is
shown approximately 1,000 feet to the south of Morrisville Carpenter Road. This
access is proposed as a left-over (left-turns into the site only). It was assumed that this
left-over access break would also feature a northbound left-over u-turn movement along
N.C. 55.

The preliminary Cooke Property site plan consists of 10 separate development parcels,
which include a pharmacy with drive through, two banks with drive through lanes, three
fast food restaurants, three buildings designated for retail shopping, and a self-storage
facility. The project is scheduled to be built in three phases and is to be fully complete
by 2013. Parking for the proposed parcels is to be provided on internal surface parking
lots. The site plan also shows internal driveways for connectivity between parcels along
N.C. 55.

III. TRAFFIC IMPACTS

A. Trip Generation

The projected trips generated by the proposed development are based on the ITE Trip
Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 7th Edition, 2003).
Methodologies for the use of trip generating variables (square footage, number of drive
through lanes) and for the use of average rate or equation-based generation estimates
follow standard procedures used by the NCDOT Congestion Management Unit for
preparation of traffic impact analyses.

Table 2, on the next two pages, shows the estimated number of trips generated by the
10 development parcels for an average weekday and during the AM and PM peak hours
of the adjacent streets. No attempt was made to reduce the number of estimated site
trips by a transit factor, due to the small amount of potential ridership in relation to total
trips in the study area and large bus headways. Pass-by trips were considered for this
study for both the shopping center (retail), drive through bank, and fast food restaurant
land use types. Pass-by trip estimations use methodologies found in the ITE Trip
Generation Handbook and current NCDOT Congestion Management Unit practice.
Internal trips, though possible with the provision of internal circulation roadways, were
not specifically considered for this study, due to a lack of suitable methodology for
estimating these trips using ITE practices. A truck percentage of two percent was used
for all site-generated traffic.

Table 2 shows that, when fully developed in 2013, the Cooke Property development will
generate approximately 640 new site trips (1,000 total trips with pass-bys) in the AM
peak hour and approximately 700 new site trips (1,250 total trips with pass-bys) in the
PM peak hour and about 14,400 trips daily.

B. Trip Distribution/Assignment

Existing AM and PM peak hour traffic patterns were used to determine the directional
traffic characteristics of the site-generated traffic, with some modifications due to
changes to study area network roadway improvements in the 2013 build out year. Site-
related trips were assumed use the most convenient driveway entrance/exit to access
the proposed site. Site trip distributions were calculated for each development parcel
and schematics showing site trip distribution and assignment for each parcel are shown
in Appendix C. Some movements are assumed to require the ability to make u-turns at
local intersections/roadway median breaks as several entrance/exits to the development
are right-turn in/right-turn out only. External site trip distribution was modified for the
extension of Morrisville Parkway to N.C. 55 and for the improvements to Carpenter Fire
Station Road/closure of Morrisville Carpenter Road at the CSX Railroad corridor in the
project vicinity. Figure 6 shows the external trip distribution percentages used for the
2013 site traffic assignment. Figures 7 and 7a show the corresponding external and
internal site traffic volume assignment, based on the trip generation rates and projected
distribution, for the 2013 final build-out. This figure also shows the effects of AM and
PM peak hour pass-by trips on assigned net traffic flows.

C. Background Traffic

There are numerous Town of Cary-approved developments in the study area that could
contribute to background traffic growth by the 2013 design year. Based on field
inspection and information from Town staff, the following developments are considered
to potentially add to background traffic in the TAR 290 project study area in the 2013
design year analyses:

       O'Kelley Chapel Road Multi-family (TAR 284)
       Evans Farm and Weycroft Amendment (TAR 167a)
       Alston Elementary School (TAR 258)
       Panther Creek Development (TAR 219)
       Cary Creek Commons (TAR 197)
       Parkside Commons (TAR 225)
       McCrimmon and NC 55 Retail/Restaurant (TAR 253)
       Highcroft Commons (TAR 182a)
       Amberly PUD
       Stonewater PUD

Field inspection noted a number of other development projects that are currently under
construction in the project study area vicinity and will likely add additional traffic to the
study area roadway network by 2013.

Due to the sheer number of developments under construction/to be completed prior to
the 2013 design year, and to the fact that the Western Wake Parkway project is likely to
affect traffic flows along N.C. 55 and the major arterial roadways in the project study
area, actual peak hour traffic assignments from the studies listed above were not
directly aggregated for background traffic calculations for this study, except for the two
developments located on N.C. 55 in the project study area ­ Highcroft Commons (TAR
182a) and McCrimmon and N.C. 55 Restaurant/Retail (TAR 253). Many of the
background generators listed above are large projects with regional significance and
may yield trip-making patterns that do not necessarily ADD all of their predicted traffic to
the network, but may instead redistribute traffic, as trips from local residential projects
divert to the commercial development to be built in TAR 197, TAR 219 and TAR 225,
instead of traveling elsewhere beyond the study area. For these reasons, the method
for determining 2013 design year background traffic volumes is as follows:

       McCrimmon Parkway ­ estimated 10% per year peak hour growth
       Carpenter Fire Station Road ­ estimated 5% per year peak hour growth west of
       N.C. 55
       Indian Wells Road ­ estimated 2% per year peak hour growth
       Green Hope School Road ­ estimated 5% per year peak hour growth
       Carpenter Upchurch Road ­ estimated 5% per year peak hour growth south of
       Morrisville Parkway
       Morrisville Parkway ­ estimated 10% per year peak hour growth
       Morrisville Carpenter Road ­ estimated 5% per year peak hour growth east of the
       project study area

                                             10

                                      Cooke Property ­ Proposed Commercial Development

      N.C. 55 ­ 2008 traffic volumes north of McCrimmon Parkway held constant (0%
      growth to 2013) to account for estimated traffic shifts from east-west arterials and
      regional traffic shift to Western Wake Parkway. Volumes to the south of this
      location balanced to account for other roadway growth percentages as described
      above

In addition to these external roadway network background traffic growth assumptions,
additional traffic volumes adjustments were necessary for the 2013 design year to
account for:

      Morrisville Carpenter Road closure at CSX railroad tracks ­ existing turning
      movements at Morrisville Carpenter Road and N.C. 55 intersection shifted to
      Carpenter Fire Station Road and Morrisville Parkway in a 50/50 ratio. Traffic at
      Morrisville Carpenter Road and N.C. 55 is assumed to be zero for Morrisville
      Carpenter Road.

      Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Fire Station Road/Carpenter Upchurch
      Road ­ assume only local traffic to use roadways within the Historic Carpenter
      Village area. Traffic volumes of less than 100 vehicles per hour per direction
      assumed in this area.

      Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road ­ access limitations imposed
      by the design of the Morrisville Parkway Extension project require the shift of
      existing traffic volumes away from Carpenter Upchurch Road. Completion of
      paralleling Louis Stephens Road facility to the east and completion of Morrisville
      Parkway to the east will allow the rerouting of through traffic on Carpenter
      Upchurch Road to those facilities.

The result of this ambient/background traffic growth methodology is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 9 displays the specific background generator peak hour trips produced by the
TAR 182a and TAR 253 studies.

IV. IMPACT ANALYSIS

A. Capacity Analysis Methodology

Evaluation of traffic operations on suburban arterials is most effective through the
determination of level of service (LOS) criteria. The concept of level of service
correlates qualitative aspects of traffic flow to quantitative terms. This enables
transportation professionals to take the qualitative issues, such as congestion and
substandard geometrics, and translate them into measurable quantities, such as
operating speeds and vehicular delays. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM
2000) characterizes level of service by letter designations A through F. Level of service
A represents ideal low-volume traffic operations, and level of service F represents over-
saturated high-volume traffic operations. Level of service is measured differently for
various highway facilities, but in general, level of service letter designations are
described by Table 3.

The minimum acceptable level of service established for this project is LOS D based on
average peak hour volumes, or no increase in delay for intersections operating below
LOS D without the inclusion of site traffic. The following scenarios were evaluated for
this analysis:

Condition 1 - Existing Traffic
Condition 2 - 2013 Traffic without Site Traffic (Includes Ambient and Town-approved
            background generators)
Condition 3 - 2013 Traffic with Site Traffic Volumes Added to Background Growth
Condition 4 - 2013 Traffic with Site Traffic and Improvements
              (for all intersections operating below LOS D, where applicable)

The results of this analysis are based on the LOS and delay procedures presented in
the HCM 2000. To obtain optimized signal timings for the existing and future traffic
signals, the timing optimization software Synchro Professional Version 6.0 was used to
evaluate an optimal cycle length for the given existing timing and phasing parameters
and existing volumes. The methodology of evaluating signalized intersections is
presented on the next page:




                                               13
                                                     Town of Cary: Traffic Analysis Report 290
                                           Cooke Property ­ Proposed Commercial Development

       Condition 1 ­ Use cycle lengths/splits/offsets of individual signalized intersections from
       data provided by NCDOT/Town of Cary and report LOS and delay values from Synchro
       6.0 (using percentile delay formulas).

       Build-Out/Future Year Scenarios ­ Reoptimize the cycle lengths, splits, and offsets of
       individual intersections in Synchro to account for periodic retiming of traffic signals by the
       Town of Cary and any proposed geometric changes anticipated to occur between the
       existing year and build-out year. Adjust split timings to allow the overall intersection to
       operate at LOS D, or better, if possible. Timing data will remain constant between the
       No-Build and Build scenarios if no physical changes are proposed by the proposed
       development.

       Build-Out/Future Year Scenario Improvements ­ Reoptimize the signalized
       intersections in Synchro to account for any necessary recommended geometric
       improvements. Also, evaluate the potential for different signal phasing schemes (left-
       turn lag phases, for example) Retain existing split minimums and any pedestrian timing
       values. Recommendations will be made to obtain at least LOS D for the intersection as a
       whole (or at least a mitigation to reduce peak hour delays to the future year No-build
       levels.

The net effect of this process is that direct comparisons, by movement, of delay and
LOS between each of the scenarios are impossible because splits and cycle lengths
can and do change between scenarios. The pertinent statistic of this analysis is the
overall intersection level of service and delay. Improvements to deficient intersections in
Condition 3 were made by first attempting to create an optimally progressed signal
system with acceptable adjustments to signal phasing, if feasible. If that did not
produce satisfactory results for all intersections, geometric improvements to improve
intersection capacity were considered for the deficient intersections.

Unsignalized intersections were analyzed in HCS 2000, using HCM delay and LOS
formulas. Their results were evaluated on a per-movement basis, since HCM methods
do not produce overall intersection level of service for unsignalized intersections. Thus,
intersections with deficient movements in the Build scenarios may need to have the
movements evaluated for improvements. This methodology differs from signalized
intersections, where one or more movements at an intersection may be deficient in the
Build scenario, but as long as the overall intersection level of service does not fall below
LOS D, no intersection improvements were deemed necessary. If HCM analyses
indicated abnormally large per-vehicle delay values for relatively low approach volumes,
the intersection under study was input into the traffic microsimulation model SimTraffic
to produce a comparable peak hour evaluation. If the simulation model delay results
indicate wide discrepancies in the per-vehicle delay for the affected movements, the
simulation values will be used instead of the HCM formula results in determining the
need for additional mitigation due to site traffic impact.

The signals involved in Condition 1 were evaluated as coordinated/actuated
intersections based on existing phasing schemes from the existing signal plans and
data from NCDOT Division 5. Similar procedures were used for all future 2013
Conditions, with any changes to signal operation made through the use of standards
from the NCDOT Congestion Management Unit with regards to signal phasing and
operations. Appendix D contains the Synchro output for all four conditions for all
signalized intersections under study. Appendix E contains output from HCS+ for the
unsignalized intersections in the study area.

B. Capacity Analysis Results

Figures 10 and 10a show the traffic volumes for Condition 2 (without site). Condition 2
peak hour traffic volumes represent both ambient area-wide traffic growth and approved
background traffic generators. Figures 11 and 11a display the Condition 3 projected
study area traffic volumes with site traffic added.

Tables 4A and 4B, on the following pages, summarize intersection and critical
movement LOS and vehicle delay details for all study area intersections, based on
estimated peak hour traffic volumes. Following the tables, a synopsis of each analysis
scenario at each intersection is presented.

As shown in Tables 4A and 4B, there are a number of study area intersections that
exhibit a deficient peak hour LOS in 2008. In the AM peak hour, heavy traffic volumes
on N.C. 55 cause the intersections of N.C. 55 at Carpenter Fire Station Road and
Morrisville Carpenter Road to operate at an overall LOS F. In addition the northbound
stop-controlled movement at the intersection of Morrisville Carpenter Road and
Carpenter Upchurch Road operates at a LOS E in the AM peak hour.

In the PM peak hour, heavy traffic flows on N.C. 55 cause the intersection of N.C. 55
and Carpenter Fire Station Road to operate at an overall LOS F. Also, the southbound
stop-controlled approach at the intersection of Morrisville Carpenter Road and
Carpenter Fire Station Road operates at a LOS F.

No other study area intersections operate at deficient levels-of-service in the 2007 AM
or PM peak hours.

Condition 2 ­ 2013 No-Build
The results for Condition 2 account for numerous geometric changes (and associated
traffic volume redistributions) for the study area transportation network in the 2013
design year. As shown in Tables 4A and 4B, the intersection of N.C. 55 and Carpenter
Fire Station Road will remain deficient in both peak hours, even with significant
geometric improvements to the Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection approaches.
The removal of all traffic from the Morrisville Carpenter Road approach at its
intersection with N.C. 55 will allow this intersection to operate at a LOS A in both peak
hours. The intersection of N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road is expected to drop to
a LOS E in the 2013 AM peak hour. Also, the new intersection of N.C. 55 with
Morrisville Parkway is expected to operate at a LOS E in the AM peak hour, given the
proposed laneage shown in Town of Cary plans at this intersection.

The proposed geometric changes and traffic volume redistributions at Morrisville
Parkway/Carpenter Upchurch Road and at the existing intersection of Morrisville
Carpenter Road/Carpenter Upchurch Road allow the stop-controlled critical movements
at these intersections to operate acceptably in Condition 2 for both peak periods.

The assumption of a realigned Morrisville Carpenter/Carpenter Fire Station Road east
of the proposed project will include an assumed full median break of the four-lane
Carpenter Fire Station Road corridor at this location. Assuming a two-lane Morrisville
Carpenter Road facility tying into this realigned corridor, HCS results indicate
acceptable operations for the stop-controlled approach.

Condition 3 ­ 2013 Build
As shown in Tables 4A and 4B, the proposed Cooke Property development has some
significant effects on intersection traffic operations in the AM and PM peak hours, and
proposed driveway connections to N.C. 55 are expected to experience deficient
operations, as well. At the intersection of N.C. 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road,
LOS drops from an E to an F in the PM peak hour with the addition of site-related traffic.
At the intersection of Morrisville Carpenter Road and N.C. 55, the existing Morrisville

Carpenter Road westbound approach will function as the main site driveway for the
proposed development. No specific laneage is proposed for this approach on the site
plan, so it was assumed that two lanes would exit the development, providing a shared
left-turn/through lane and an exclusive right-turn lane. Even with this improvement to
existing geometrics, the intersection is expected to operate at a LOS F in the 2013 AM
Peak hour. The intersections of N.C. 55 with Green Hope School Road and Morrisville
Parkway are expected to fall from LOS E to LOS F in the AM peak hour with the
addition of site traffic. Every proposed site driveway (except for the internal driveway
intersection of the main site driveway and driveways #6 and #7) is expected to
experience a deficient LOS in at least one peak hour in 2013 with all site traffic added to
the study area network. It was assumed that N.C. 55 would retain its existing laneage
for all of these site driveway analyses, with the provision of deceleration lanes at each
driveway, and appropriate left-turn bays at the proposed left-over serving Site Driveway
#3.

Condition 4 ­ 2013 Build with Mitigation
Capacity deficiencies in the 2013 Build Condition are caused primarily by high traffic
volumes northbound on N.C. 55 in the AM peak hour and southbound in the PM peak
hour. To mitigate these deficiencies, an additional through travel lane along N.C. 55
was analyzed in the study area. Northbound, the lane was analyzed to extend from
south of Green Hope School Road through the Carpenter Fire Station Road
intersection. Southbound, the lane was analyzed to extend from north of Carpenter Fire
Station Road to Morrisville Parkway. The resulting capacity improvements allow the
N.C. 55/Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection to operate at per vehicle delays less
than the 2013 No-Build Condition, though they do not improve the intersection fully to a
LOS D. The improvements allow the N.C. 55 intersection with Morrisville Carpenter
Road (Main Site Driveway) to operate at a LOS B (from LOS F) in the AM peak hour.
LOS is improved from a LOS F to a LOS B at N.C. 55/Morrisville Parkway in the AM
peak hour and is improved from a LOS F to a LOS C at N.C. 55/Green Hope School
Road.

The N.C. 55 laneage improvements were also analyzed for the proposed site driveway
intersections in Condition 4. Since HCM methodologies for unsignalized intersections
can only account for two through travel lanes on the major street, projected 2013 traffic
volumes on N.C. 55 were divided by a ratio of 0.67 to account for estimated volumes in
the nearest two lanes at each driveway. Results in Tables 4A and 4B show that
deficient critical stop-controlled movements are mitigated to a LOS D or better in most
cases. For the intersection of N.C. 55 and Site Driveway #3 (the proposed left-over),
deficient conditions remain in the AM peak hour for the SB left-turn/u-turn and WB right-
turn movements. However, predicted 95th percentile delay estimates indicate that these
movements do not produce excessive queuing that would result in spillback problems
on N.C. 55 or within the proposed site.

V. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A summary of intersection operations capacity analysis and the effect of site traffic from
the Cooke Property development on each individual study area intersection is presented
below, along with a discussion of necessary mitigation for the 2013 design year.
Figures 12 and 12a present all recommended mitigation improvements.

N.C. 55 and McCrimmon Parkway
This intersection will operate acceptably in all existing and 2013 design year scenarios
for both peak periods. No mitigation is required for this intersection.

N.C. 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
This intersection operates over capacity, even with the recent improvements to N.C. 55,
in the 2008 AM and PM peak hours. This is primarily due to increasingly heavy traffic
flow on both N.C. 55 (regionally) and Carpenter Fire Station Road (locally) and the fact
that the Carpenter Fire Station Road approaches feature a single shared left-
turn/through/right-turn lane. Background mitigation by 2013 at this intersection for these
and future traffic increases is expected to feature improvements provided by the Town
of Cary Carpenter Fire Station Road widening project to the west of N.C. 55 and the
Town of Cary project to widen/realign Carpenter Fire Station Road to the east of N.C.
55, providing a grade separation at the nearby CSX railroad corridor. This project has
not been specifically approved by the Town, but is considered necessary for the viability
of the Cooke Property project, due to its correlation with the at-grade railroad crossing
closure on Morrisville Carpenter Road.

No final design for either section of the Carpenter Fire Station Road improvements was
available for review for this report, but it is assumed that the cross section on either side
of N.C. 55 will be improved to a four-lane divided facility with exclusive left-turn lanes at
the N.C. 55 intersection. Even with these improvements completed by 2013,
background traffic volumes cause the intersection to operate at a LOS F in the AM peak
hour and a LOS E in the PM peak hour.

The recommended mitigation strategy for this intersection is to include additional
through travel lanes on N.C. 55 to provide the necessary capacity to make a significant
improvement in LOS and per vehicle delay. A southbound through travel lane should
be constructed at least 1,200 feet upstream of the intersection. A northbound through
travel lane should extend at least 2,000 feet past the intersection. These improvements
are consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Transportation Plan.

In addition to these improvements, a dual left-turn lane with at least 200 feet of storage
in each lane should be constructed for the westbound Carpenter Fire Station Road
approach. If a tunnel were constructed under the CSX railroad crossing, provision for a
dual left-turn lane may not extend into the tunnel roadway cross-section, whereas a
longer single-lane left-turn bay may impact the tunnel roadway cross-section. The
existing northbound left-turn bay should also be extended to at least 350 feet minimum
full storage to accommodate additional site-related left-turns and u-turns.

N.C. 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road (Main Site Driveway)
This intersection currently operates over capacity in the 2008 AM peak hour. With the
proposed Carpenter Fire Station Road improvements east of N.C. 55, Town of Cary
staff has indicated that additional improvements to at-grade railroad crossings along the
N.C. 55 corridor may occur due to other developments. These improvements are part
of a plan to provide a grade separation at Carpenter Fire Station Road and close the
existing crossing at Morrisville Carpenter Road, effectively splitting the road in two and
making each segment a local traffic-only facility. Thus, 2013 Without Site analyses
estimate the no peak hour traffic volume will use the stubbed-out portion of Morrisville
Carpenter Road and the resulting LOS is A for both peak hours.

The proposed site plan shows Morrisville Carpenter Road just east of N.C. 55 being
used as a primary site driveway, though no laneage is specified. 2013 With Site
Condition capacity analyses indicate that the intersection will operate at a LOS F in the
AM peak hour with existing laneage on N.C. 55 and two exiting lanes from the site
driveway.

To mitigate the deficient AM peak hour LOS, it is recommended that an additional travel
lane northbound and southbound on N.C. 55 be constructed through this intersection.
In addition, to ensure that westbound approach queues from the site parcels do not
block the internal site driveway crossing at the terminus of Morrisville Carpenter Road, a
three-lane approach is recommended with a left-turn lane, a shared left-turn/through
lane, and an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 125 feet of storage. The existing
southbound left-turn bay on N.C. 55 should be lengthened from 225 feet to 350 feet to
account for additional site-related left-turn and u-turn traffic. The existing northbound
right-turn lane full storage length could be reduced from 225 feet to 150 feet.

N.C. 55 and Morrisville Parkway Extension
This intersection is expected to be signalized by 2013 and is expected to operate at a
LOS E in the 2013 AM peak hour in the Without Site Condition. The AM LOS drops to a
LOS F with the addition of site-related traffic. As with the intersections described above,
significant improvements to through travel capacity are required to mitigate deficient
operations. N.C. 55 will require an additional through travel lane northbound at this
intersection and the existing southbound left-turn bay will need to be extended to 500
feet from an existing 250 feet to adequately store left-turning traffic. The proposed
mitigation improvement to add a southbound through travel lane on N.C. 55 is not
necessary for adequate capacity at this intersection and the lane can be dropped
upstream of this intersection, although future pavement widening should extend to the
intersection to allow development of adequate laneage when the extension of Morrisville
Parkway west of the intersection is built.

N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road
The intersection of N.C. 55 and Green Hope School Road currently operates at an
acceptable LOS in the 2008 AM and PM peak hours. Additional background traffic
growth impacts by 2013 are expected to drop the LOS in the AM peak hour to LOS E.
Additional site-related traffic from the Cooke Property development is expected to
further worsen overall delay in the AM peak hour to LOS F. To mitigate these impacts,
additional though travel capacity is needed along N.C. 55 northbound.              It is
recommended that a third through travel lane be constructed starting at least 1,200 feet
south of the intersection. LOS in the AM peak hour is expected to improve to a LOS C.
No other improvements are required.

Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Fire Station Road
This intersection operates at a deficient LOS F in the 2008 PM peak hour, due to
moderate to high traffic volumes on both roadways coupled with the fact there are no
auxiliary turning lanes at any approach. With the proposed improvements to Carpenter
Fire Station Road east of N.C. 55, it is expected that roadway realignment will create a
new intersection where Morrisville Carpenter Road with terminate at the four-lane
divided Carpenter Fire Station Road facility. It was assumed that a full median break
would be provided at this location and that an exclusive westbound left-turn lane would
be constructed. Northbound stop-controlled laneage was analyzed as a single shared
left-turn/right-turn lane. With this laneage, 2013 traffic operations for both the Without
Site Condition and With Site Conditions are expected to provide adequate LOS in both
AM and PM peak hours. No further mitigation due to site traffic impact is necessary.

Morrisville Carpenter Road and Carpenter Upchurch Road
This intersection operates at a deficient LOS E in the 2008 existing AM peak hour for
northbound stop-controlled turning movements. The proposed project to eliminate the
current at-grade railroad crossing along Morrisville Carpenter Road, coupled with the
access limitations on Carpenter Upchurch Road at Morrisville Parkway proposed in the
Morrisville Parkway Extension project will result in both roadways in this vicinity to
function as local access facilities with much lower traffic volumes. Capacity analysis
results in 2013 for both Without Site and With Site Conditions show that the intersection
will operate acceptably in both AM and PM peak hours. Thus, no further mitigation to
existing geometrics/traffic control is recommended.

Morrisville Parkway and Carpenter Upchurch Road
This intersection operates acceptably in the 2008 AM and PM peak hours. The access
restrictions imposed on Carpenter Upchurch Road in the Morrisville Parkway Extension
project will result in acceptable operations in all 2013 scenarios. No further mitigation is
required at this intersection beyond what has been designed for the Morrisville Parkway
Extension project.

Proposed Site Driveways along N.C. 55

   Site Driveways #1, #2 and #4
   In the 2013 With Site Condition, these intersections are reported as being deficient
   for the westbound stop-controlled right-turn driveway movements in the AM peak
   hour, due to limited gaps in heavy northbound N.C. 55 traffic. With the proposed
   mitigation widening of N.C. 55 along the site frontage to include a third northbound
   through travel lane, LOS improves to acceptable levels in all three cases. It is
   recommended that each driveway also feature a northbound right-turn deceleration
   lane to remove site-related traffic from the travel stream with at least 100 feet of full
   storage and adequate taper.

   Site Driveway #3 (Proposed Left-Over)
   In the 2013 With Site Condition, this intersection is reported as being deficient for the
   southbound left-turn/u-turn movement and westbound right-turn driveway movement
   in the AM peak hour and for the northbound u-turn movement in the PM peak hour,
   due to high directional traffic volumes on N.C. 55 limiting gaps with two travel lanes
   in each directions. The proposed widening of N.C. 55 to three through travel lanes
   in each direction will allow more gaps in traffic in this vicinity and reduces delays in
   both peak hours. In the AM peak hour, the southbound left-turn/u-turn movement is
   still expected to operate at LOS E and the westbound stop-controlled movement at
   LOS F, but an analysis of maximum estimated queues for these movements
   suggests that spillback onto N.C. 55 or blocking internal driveways will not occur.
   The design of the left-over turn lanes should provide at least 200 feet of storage in
   each direction, to conservatively provide enough storage. The northbound approach
   should also feature a right-turn deceleration lane with at least 100 feet of full storage.

   Site Driveway #5
   In the 2013 With Site Condition, this intersection is reported as being deficient for the
   eastbound stop-controlled right-turn driveway movement in the PM peak hour, due
   to limited gaps in heavy southbound N.C. 55 traffic. With the proposed mitigation
   widening of N.C. 55 along the site frontage to include a third southbound through
   travel lane, LOS improves to an acceptable level in the PM peak hour. It is
   recommended that the driveway also feature a southbound right-turn deceleration
   lane to remove site-related traffic from the travel stream with at least 100 feet of full
   storage and adequate taper.

   Main Site Driveway and Site Driveways #6&#7 (Internal to Site)
   In the 2013 With Site Condition, this intersection will operate acceptably in both peak
   hours, and is not expected to cause any spillback onto N.C. 55 or block internal
   driveways provided that the eastbound Main Site Driveway laneage contains
   separate left-turn and right-turn lanes. The northbound and southbound laneage
   was assumed to feature a single shared through/turning lane in each direction. The
   westbound Main Site Driveway exiting laneage should feature two travel lanes, with
   a right-turn bay at the N.C. 55 intersection.

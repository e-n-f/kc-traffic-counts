EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
A residential development is proposed to be constructed north of Green Hope School Road
and south of the future Morrisville Parkway extension in northwest Cary, NC (Figure 1).
The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The development is to consist of Phases 4 and 5 of Highcroft Village. Phase 4 of the
proposed development consists of 114 single family homes and is expected to be completed
by 2013. Phase 5 of the proposed development consists of 116 single family homes and 61
townhomes and is to be completed by 2015. Phase 4 will have access off of Green Hope
School Road for up to 100 dwelling units with a secondary access provided at a later date.
The site plan proposes two access points ­ one initially along Green Hope School Road and
a second along future Morrisville Parkway (Figure 2):
       Site Access #1: full movement driveway along Green Hope School Road
       approximately 1,700 feet west of NC 55, to be constructed with Phase 4
       Site Access #2: full movement driveway on future Morrisville Parkway extension
       approximately 2,600 feet west of NC 55, to be constructed with Phase 5
The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
       NC 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road (signalized)
       NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
       NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
       Green Hope School Road and Highcroft Drive (unsignalized)
       Green Hope School Road and Sears Farm Road (unsignalized)
       Green Hope School Road and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)
       Future Morrisville Parkway and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)

Analysis was performed under seven scenarios: Existing (2010), Background (2013), Phase 4
Build (2013), Phase 4 Build (2013) with Improvements, Background (2015), Phase 5 Build
(2015), and Phase 5 Build (2015) with Improvements. The Existing (2010) scenario includes
AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in
November and December 2010. The Background (2013) and Background (2015) scenarios
include existing traffic with projected annual traffic growth, as well as site traffic from six
approved developments within the study area. The Phase 4 Build (2013) and Phase 5 Build
(2015) scenarios include Background (2013) and Background (2015) volumes with the
addition of site trips generated by the corresponding phases of the proposed development.
Future conditions with the proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in
Phase 4 Build (2013) with Improvements and Phase 5 Build (2015) with Improvements
scenarios.


                                               i
Existing (2010) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts.

As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page vii, two signalized
intersections included in the study area are currently operating at unacceptable levels of
service (LOS E or worse). Specifically, the NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road
intersection is operating at LOS E during both the AM and PM peak hours. The NC 55 and
Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road intersection is operating at LOS B in the PM
peak hour, but LOS E in the AM peak hour. The remaining signalized intersections and
unsignalized approaches are all operating acceptably during both the AM and PM peak
hours.

Background (2013) Conditions
When traffic counts were conducted, McCrimmon Parkway was closed due to NC 540
construction and Carpenter Fire Station Road was designated as the detour route. In the
Background (2013) conditions, traffic diversion was first projected to compensate for
normal conditions when McCrimmon Parkway reopens to traffic. An annual growth rate of
two percent (2%) was then applied to the adjusted existing traffic to account for ambient
traffic growth between the base year (2010) and the build year of Phase 4 (2013). In
addition, site traffic from five proposed/approved developments in the vicinity of the study
area was included based on the most recent status update from the Town of Cary on these
projects. Traffic diversion due to two anticipated roadway improvements projects,
Morrisville Parkway Extension Phase II by the Town of Cary and NC 540 (Western Wake
Freeway) by the North Carolina Turnpike Authority, was individually projected and included
in the Background (2013) conditions.

Based on the Background (2013) analysis, traffic conditions along NC 55 are projected to
improve with the expected traffic diversion due to the opening of NC 540. As a result, the
NC 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road intersection is projected to
improve to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours. The NC 55 and
Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is projected to improve to operate at LOS C in the
AM peak hour, but remain operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour. The remaining
intersections are projected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service as in the
Existing (2010) analysis.

Phase 4 Trip Generation and Assignment
The Phase 4 of Highcroft Village is proposed to consist of 114 single family dwelling units.
Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in
the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

As a result, the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4 is projected to generate 1,173 daily site
trips, with 90 trips (23 entering, 67 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 118 site trips
(74 entering, 44 exiting) occurring in PM peak hour. The generated trips were distributed in

                                               ii
accordance with the existing turning movement counts and surrounding land uses.

Phase 4 Build (2013) Conditions
The Phase 4 Build (2013) conditions account for both the Background (2013) traffic and the
site traffic generated by the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4. As shown in the summary
LOS table on page vii, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant level of
service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area
intersections. However, the failing NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection will
continue to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 2.0 seconds per
vehicle. The remaining study area intersections are projected to continue operating
acceptably. The proposed stop-controlled Access #1 approach along Green Hope School
Road is projected to operate LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Phase 4 Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4
development is projected to have some impact on the roadways and intersections within the
study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of
Cary's Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) requirements and NCDOT engineering
standards:
Green Hope School Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4 has frontage along Green Hope School Road,
which has a two-lane undivided cross-section under the Existing (2010) conditions. For the
section of Green Hope School Road in front of the development, the Comprehensive
Transportation Plan dictates a three-lane minor arterial cross-section with two travel lanes, a
two-way left-turn lane, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 70 feet of right-of-way.
Thus, the following improvements are required to meet the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Plan standards:
     Widen the section of Green Hope School Road along property frontage to achieve
        half of the ultimate cross-section as required by the Town of Cary Comprehensive
        Transportation Plan.

NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
The traffic analyses indicate that this intersection is operating at failing levels of service
under the Existing (2010) and Background (2013) conditions. Despite no LOS change as a
result of the additional site trips generated by the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4, this
intersection is projected to experience a delay increase of 2.0 seconds per vehicle in the PM
peak hour with a LOS E. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
     Widen the eastbound approach of Carpenter Fire Station Road to provide an
        exclusive right-turn lane with at least 150 feet of full storage length.
     Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate this new turn lane.

Green Hope School Road and Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled southbound Access #1 approach is

                                              iii
projected to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours. Nevertheless, the
following improvements are recommended at this location to improve traffic safety and to
meet NCDOT engineering guidance:
     Construct the planned Access #1 with one ingress lane and two egress lanes with an
        exclusive right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of full
        storage length.
     Widen Green Hope School Road at Access #1 to provide an exclusive left-turn lane
        on the eastbound approach with at least 75 feet of full storage length.

Secondary Access
As acknowledged by the developer, Highcroft Village Phase 4 will have access off of Green
Hope School Road for up to 100 units and then a second means of access will need to be
provided, which has not been determined at this time. The location and access type should
satisfy the requirements by the Town of Cary Engineering Standard for residential driveways.

The remaining intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours; thus, no further improvements are recommended.

Background (2015) Conditions
Background (2015) conditions account for Background (2013) traffic, as well as further
ambient traffic growth between the Phase 4 build year (2013) and the Phase 5 build year
(2015). The five previously included background developments were added in the same
manner as in Background (2013) conditions, with inclusion percentages adjusted based on
increased built-out estimates for two developments in 2015. In addition, one more
development is expected to occur in the vicinity of the study area between the build-out of
Phases 4 and 5 of the proposed development and, therefore, was included in the
Background (2015) conditions. Traffic diversion due to two ongoing roadway projects,
Morrisville Parkway Extension Phase II by the Town of Cary and NC 540 (Western Wake
Freeway) by the North Carolina Turnpike Authority, was included in the same manner as in
the Background (2013) conditions.

Based on the Background (2015) analysis, traffic conditions at one signalized intersection on
NC 55 are projected to deteriorate to operate at failing levels of service. Specifically, the NC
55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is projected to worsen to operate at LOS D
in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. The remaining intersections are
projected to experience slight delay increases, but will continue operating at acceptable levels
of service.

Phase 5 Trip Generation and Assignment
The Phase 5 of Highcroft Village is proposed to consist of 116 single family dwelling units
and 61 townhomes. Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate
corresponding trip generation code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition, and the
suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

As a result, the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 5 is projected to generate 1,610 daily site
trips, with 126 trips (29 entering, 97 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 160 site


                                               iv
trips (103 entering, 57 exiting) occurring in PM peak hour. With the additional planned
access along Morrisville Parkway Extension, the generated trips by both Highcroft Village
Phase 4 and Phase 5 were distributed in accordance with the existing turning movement
counts and surrounding land uses.

Phase 5 Build (2015) Conditions
The Phase 5 Build (2015) conditions account for both the Background (2015) traffic and the
site traffic generated by the proposed Highcroft Village Phases 4 and 5. As shown in the
summary LOS table on page vii, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant
level of service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study
area intersections. The failing NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is
projected to continue to operate at a failing LOS F in the PM peak hour with no vehicle
traffic delay increase. The rest of the study area intersections are projected to continue
operating acceptably. The proposed stop-controlled Access #1 approach along Green Hope
School Road is projected to operate LOS B, and the proposed stop-controlled Access #2
approach along Morrisville Parkway Extension is projected to operate at LOS A during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

Phase 5 Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed Highcroft Village Phases 4 and
5 development is projected to have negative impact on traffic conditions at one intersection
within the study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the
Town of Cary's APFO requirements and NCDOT engineering guidance:
Morrisville Parkway
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage or
build roads across their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan. Highcroft Village Phase 5 is crossed by a future alignment of
Morrisville Parkway Extension, which is ultimately planned to be a four-lane, median divided
cross-section with four travel lanes, a 30-foot landscaped median, and pedestrian sidewalks
on both sides within 112 feet of right-of-way in the Comprehensive Plan. However, the
developer has approached the Town of Cary and requested that instead of providing half of
the four-lane cross-section of Morrisville Parkway along their frontage, they will provide a
two-lane section of Morrisville Parkway from the property frontage to NC 55. Thus, the
following improvements are required:
     If approved by the Town of Cary, construct Morrisville Parkway Extension
         westwards from NC 55 to the property frontage as a two-lane roadway with turn
         lanes provided at the NC 55 intersection and Access #2.

NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
The traffic analyses indicate that this intersection is operating at failing levels of service in
the PM peak hour with or without the proposed development. By constructing an exclusive
right-turn lane on the westbound approach as previously recommended for Phase 4, traffic
conditions are projected to improve to better-than-background conditions. Therefore, the
previously recommended right-turn lane improvement is considered a sufficient mitigation
for both Phases 4 and 5, and no additional improvements are needed for Phase 5 at this
intersection.

                                               v
NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
The project site plan proposes to construct a fourth leg at this intersection. The following
improvements are recommended to meet the Town of Cary and NCDOT engineering
standards:
     Construct Morrisville Parkway Extension with three eastbound approach lanes at
       NC 55 including one through lane, an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 150 feet of
       full storage length, and an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of full
       storage length and one westbound departure lane.
     Restripe the existing westbound approach of Morrisville Parkway to provide a shared
       through/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane.
     Widen the southbound approach of NC 55 to provide an exclusive right-turn lane
       with at least 150 feet of full storage length.
     Modify traffic signal to accommodate the new fourth leg and the recommended new
       turn lane on the southbound approach.

Morrisville Parkway Extension and Access #2 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled northbound Access #2 approach is
projected to operate at LOS A during both the AM and PM peak hours. Nevertheless, the
following improvements are recommended to accommodate long-term traffic needs at this
location:
     Construct the planned Access #2 with one ingress lane and two egress lanes with an
         exclusive right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of full
         storage length.
     Construct Morrisville Parkway Extension at Access #2 to provide a through lane and
         an exclusive left-turn lane on the westbound approach with at least 100 feet of full
         storage length, and a shared through/right-turn lane on the eastbound approach.

The remaining intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours; thus, no further improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
A residential development is proposed to be constructed north of Green Hope School Road
and south of the future Morrisville Parkway extension in northwest Cary, NC (Figure 1).
The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" (as defined in the
Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance Chapter 3.23), requiring a Transportation
Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential traffic impact of
the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

The development is to consist of Phases 4 and 5 of Highcroft Village. Phase 4 of the
proposed development consists of 114 single family homes and is expected to be completed
by 2013. Phase 5 of the proposed development consists of 116 single family homes and 61
townhomes and is to be completed by 2015. Phase 4 will have access off of Green Hope
School Road for up to 100 dwelling units with a secondary access provided at a later date.
The site plan proposes two access points ­ one initially along Green Hope School Road and
a second along future Morrisville Parkway (Figure 2):
       Site Access #1: full movement driveway along Green Hope School Road
       approximately 1,700 feet west of NC 55, to be constructed with Phase 4
       Site Access #2: full movement driveway on future Morrisville Parkway extension
       approximately 2,600 feet west of NC 55, to be constructed with Phase 5
The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area
and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
       NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
       NC 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road (signalized)
       NC 55 and Morrisville Parkway (signalized)
       NC 55 and Green Hope School Road (signalized)
       Green Hope School Road and Highcroft Drive (unsignalized)
       Green Hope School Road and Sears Farm Road (unsignalized)
       Green Hope School Road and Site Access #1 (future unsignalized)
       Future Morrisville Parkway and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)

Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip generation, distribution,
traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

   The resulting peak hour turning movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

   2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
   Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
   traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
   Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
   vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
   the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
   Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
   ranges.

          A                 Little or no delay            <= 10 sec.           <= 10 sec.
          B                 Short traffic delay            10-20 sec.           10-15 sec.
          C               Average traffic delay            20-35 sec.           15-25 sec.
          D                 Long traffic delay             35-55 sec.           25-35 sec.
          E               Very long traffic delay          55-80 sec.           35-50 sec.
          F                Unacceptable delay              > 80 sec.            > 50 sec.

The planned Highcroft Village Phases 4 and 5 development is located within the Town of
Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23,
Adequate Public Facilities Planning and Development for Roads (APFR). Level of service
in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D
considered acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For
signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of service worse than
LOS D, no increase in overall intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For
unsignalized intersections where the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under
background conditions, the installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the
intersection meets required warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an
undesirable delay in the surrounding roadway system.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
The Existing scenario analysis utilized the existing signal timing and phasing plans from the
Town of Cary, which are included in Appendix D. A summary of the findings for the
Existing scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, two signalized intersections included in the study area are currently
operating at unacceptable levels of service (LOS E or worse). Specifically, the NC 55 and
Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is operating at LOS E during both the AM and PM
peak hours. The NC 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road intersection is
operating at LOS B in the PM peak hour, but LOS E in the AM peak hour. The remaining
signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are all operating acceptably during both
the AM and PM peak hours.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2013) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
When traffic counts were conducted, McCrimmon Parkway was closed for through traffic
west of Panther Creek High School due to the NC 540 construction, and Carpenter Fire
Station Road was designated as the detour route. In the Background (2013) traffic
conditions, traffic diversion was projected based on historical counts at the intersections of
NC 55 at McCrimmon Parkway and Carpenter Fire Station Road to account for conditions
when McCrimmon Parkway reopens to through traffic. The projected traffic diversion due
to reopening of McCrimmon Parkway is depicted in Figure C-1, and the adjusted traffic
volumes are depicted in Figure C-2.

Based on AADT collected by the NCDOT in the vicinity of the proposed development, a
background growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to the adjusted traffic turning
movement volumes to account for normal traffic growth between the existing and build
years.

In addition, site trips from background developments were added to the background
conditions. There are five (5) developments in the study area expected to be partially or fully
constructed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of Phase 4 of the proposed
development. These developments include:
           Wellesley Professional Park (07-TAR-269a)
           McCrimmon Property (08-TAR-253)
           Hilliard Forest
           Cameron Pond Update (09-TAR-149a)
           NC 55 at CFS Strip Center (09-TAR-290)

Wellesley Professional Park (07-TAR-269a) ­ This 53,200-square foot office development was
proposed along Wellesley Trade Lane near the intersection of NC 55 and High House
Road/Green Level West Road. A traffic analysis report (07-TAR-269a) was prepared by
M/A/B and submitted to the Town of Cary in September 2009. The project build-out year
was originally scheduled for 2009. However, to date it is not completed yet. Based on 07-
TAR-269a, the development is projected to generate 2,220 daily trips with 194 AM peak
hour trips and 256 PM peak hour trips. Figure C-3 in Appendix C depicts the projected
peak hour vehicle trips in the study network. There is no mitigation associated with this
development at any study intersections in this TAR.

McCrimmon Property (08-TAR-253) ­ This 27,200-square foot commercial development is
located on the northwest corner of the NC 55 and McCrimmon Parkway intersection. A
traffic analysis report (08-TAR-253) was prepared by HNTB and submitted to the Town of
Cary in October 2007. The project build-out year was originally scheduled for 2009.
However, to date it is not completed yet. Based on TAR-253, the development is projected
to 1,674 daily vehicle trips with 90 AM peak hour trips and 146 PM peak hour trips. Figure
C-4 in Appendix C depicts the projected peak hour trips due to McCrimmon Property.
There is no mitigation committed by this development at any study intersections in this
TAR.

                                              14
Hillard Forest ­ This residential development is located along Green Hope School Road east
of Green Level Church Road. The entire development consists of four phases with a total
of 160 single family homes. To date homes included in Phases 1 and 2 have been sold and
mostly occupied, while Phase 3 is under construction. While no traffic analysis was
available, projected site trips for the Hillard Forest development were taken from previous
studies (10-TAR-312) and included in this study. Figure C-5 in Appendix C depicts the
projected peak hour trips due to Hillard Forest. Based on the current completion status,
25% of site trips due to Hillard Forest were included in the Background (2013) conditions.
There is no mitigation committed by this development at any study intersections in this
TAR.

Cameron Pond PUD Update (09-TAR-149a) ­ This residential development including 15
additional home sites is projected on the south side of Carpenter Fire Station Road between
NC 55 and future NC 540. A traffic analysis report (09-TAR-149a) was prepared by HNTB
and submitted to the Town of Cary in January 2009. The project is planned to be fully
completed by 2011. Based on TAR-149a, the development is projected to 182 daily vehicle
trips with 20 AM peak hour trips and 19 PM peak hour trips. Figure C-6 in Appendix C
depicts the projected peak hour trips due to Cameron Pond PUD Update. There is no
mitigation committed by this development at any study intersections in this TAR.

NC 55 and CFS Strip Center (09-TAR-290) ­ This commercial development, previously
named Cooke Property, is proposed along NC 55 between Carpenter Fire Station Road and
Morrisville Parkway Extension. The project consists of 10 parcels with a total of 326,400
square feet and is planned to be fully completed by 2013. A traffic analysis report (09-TAR-
290) was prepared by HNTB and submitted to the Town of Cary in September 2009. Based
on TAR-290, the development is projected to 14,420 daily vehicle trips with 1,005 AM peak
hour trips and 1,266 PM peak hour trips. Figure C-7 in Appendix C depicts the projected
peak hour trips due to NC 55 and CFS Strip Center. Recent information indicates a delay of
schedule and density reduction for this development, therefore only 25% of site trips were
included in Background (2013) conditions. There are mitigations recommended at four
signalized intersections along NC 55 in TAR-290. However, no mitigations are considered
as committed improvements at this time.


3.2 BACKGROUND ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
Two roadway improvement projects, NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) and Morrisville
Parkway Extension, are currently under construction in the study area. Both projects are
expected to have a major impact on future traffic conditions.

NC 540 (Western Wake Freeway) ­ North Carolina Turnpike Authority is constructing NC 540
(Western Wake Freeway) in the study area. The proposed Western Wake Freeway, identified
in the NCDOT Transportation Improvement Program as Project R-2635, will provide a new
six-lane, controlled access freeway in western Wake County, west of NC 55. Currently, the
project is under construction and is expected to open to traffic in 2012. After completion,
this new roadway is expected to divert a significant portion of existing traffic on NC 55, US
1, I-40, and NC 751, thereby relieving traffic congestion on these routes. For this study,

traffic diversion is projected based on the 2011 traffic volume estimates on NC 55, NC 540
and NC 751 as included in the Preliminary Traffic and Revenue Report (June 2006 by WSA).
Figure C-8 in Appendix C depicts the projected traffic diversion due to the expected
opening of NC 540.

Morrisville Parkway Extension ­ The Town of Cary is constructing the section of Morrisville
Parkway between NC 55 and Davis Drive in the study area. This project, identified in the
Town of Cary Capital Improvement Program as Morrisville Parkway Extension Phases 1
and 2, will provide another east-west corridor between NC 55 and Davis Drive. The
construction was originally scheduled to be completed by winter 2010; however, currently it
is still under construction. After completion, traffic diversion is expected from High House
Road, Morrisville Carpenter Road, and Carpenter Fire Station Road. For this study, traffic
diversion is projected based on the existing and historical traffic counts at the intersections
along NC 55 at High House Road, Morrisville Carpenter Road, and Carpenter Fire Station
Road. Figure C-9 in Appendix C depicts the projected traffic diversion due to the expected
completion of Morrisville Parkway Extension.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background (2013) scenario
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2013) scenario LOS analyses can
be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2013) analysis, traffic conditions along NC 55 are projected to
improve with the expected traffic diversion due to the opening of NC 540. As a result, the
NC 55 and Morrisville Carpenter Road/Indian Wells Road intersection is projected to
improve to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours. The NC 55 and
Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is projected to improve to operate at LOS C in the
AM peak hour, but remain operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour. The remaining
intersections are projected to continue operating at acceptable levels of service as in the
Existing (2010) analysis.

 4.0 PHASE 4 BUILD (2013) ANALYSIS
 A residential development is proposed to north of Green Hope School Road and south of
 the future Morrisville Parkway Extension in northwest Cary, NC (Figure 1). Phase 4 of the
 proposed Highcroft Village development is to be completed by 2013 and consists of 114
 single family homes.

 4.1 TRIP GENERATION
 The development is proposed to consist of 114 single family dwelling units. Trip generation
 was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation code included
 in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's
 "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

 As a result, the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4 is projected to generate 1,173 daily site
 trips, with 90 trips (23 entering, 67 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 118 site trips
 (74 entering, 44 exiting) occurring in PM peak hour.

 Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
 weekday AM and PM peak hours.

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2013) analysis scenario includes the Background (2013) traffic as well as site
generated trips from the proposed developments as described previously. Figure 8 depicts
the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2013) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the build year analysis.
Table 6 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the full
Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 6, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant level of
service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area
intersections. However, the failing NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection will
continue to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 2.0 seconds per
vehicle. The remaining study area intersections are projected to continue operating
acceptably. The proposed stop-controlled Access #1 approach along Green Hope School
Road is projected to operate LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours.

5.0 PHASE 4 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4
development is projected to have some impact on the roadways and intersections within the
study area. The following roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of
Cary's Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO) requirements and NCDOT engineering
standards:
Green Hope School Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.
The proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4 has frontage along Green Hope School Road,
which has a two-lane undivided cross-section under the Existing (2010) conditions. For the
section of Green Hope School Road in front of the development, the Comprehensive
Transportation Plan dictates a three-lane minor arterial cross-section with two travel lanes, a
two-way left-turn lane, and pedestrian sidewalks on both sides within 70 feet of right-of-way.
Thus, the following improvements are required to meet the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Plan standards:
     Widen the section of Green Hope School Road along property frontage to achieve
        half of the ultimate cross-section as required by the Town of Cary Comprehensive
        Transportation Plan.

NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road (signalized)
The traffic analyses indicate that this intersection is operating at failing levels of service
under the Existing (2010) and Background (2013) conditions. Despite no LOS change as a
result of the additional site trips generated by the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 4, this
intersection is projected to experience a delay increase of 2.0 seconds per vehicle in the PM
peak hour with a LOS E. Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this
intersection to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
     Widen the eastbound approach of Carpenter Fire Station Road to provide an
        exclusive right-turn lane with at least 150 feet of full storage length.
     Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate this new turn lane.

Green Hope School Road and Access #1 (unsignalized)
The traffic analysis indicates that the stop-controlled southbound Access #1 approach is
projected to operate at LOS B during both the AM and PM peak hours. Nevertheless, the
following improvements are recommended at this location to improve traffic safety and to
meet NCDOT engineering guidance:
     Construct the planned Access #1 with one ingress lane and two egress lanes with an
        exclusive right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane with at least 100 feet of full
        storage length.
     Widen Green Hope School Road at Access #1 to provide an exclusive left-turn lane
        on the eastbound approach with at least 75 feet of full storage length.

Secondary Access
As acknowledged by the developer, Highcroft Village Phase 4 will have access off of Green
Hope School Road for up to 100 units and then a second means of access will need to be
provided, which has not been determined at this time. The location and access type should

                                              26
satisfy the requirements by the Town of Cary Engineering Standard for residential driveways.

The remaining intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours; thus, no further improvements are recommended.

A summary of LOS results across Existing and Phase 4 scenarios is shown in Table 7, and
the resulting future lane configuration and traffic control for 2013 are depicted in Figure 9.

6.0 BACKGROUND (2015) CONDITIONS
6.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
As in the Background (2013) conditions, a background growth rate of two percent (2%) was
applied for two more years to the adjusted existing turning movement volumes to account
for normal traffic growth between the Phase 4 and Phase 5 build years.

In addition, site trips from background developments included in the Background (2013)
conditions were added in the same manner to the Background (2015) conditions. Based on
based on their current construction status and the estimated project timelines, different
inclusion ratios were applied to two background developments as listed below:
           Wellesley Professional Park (07-TAR-269a), 100% included in both Background
           (2013) and Background (2015)
           McCrimmon Property (08-TAR-253), 100% included in both Background (2013)
           and Background (2015)
           Hilliard Forest (160 SF homes), 25% included in Background (2013) and 50%
           included in Background (2015)
           Cameron Pond Update (09-TAR-149a), 100% included in both Background
           (2013) and Background (2015)
           NC 55 at CFS Strip Center (09-TAR-290), 25% included in Background (2013)
           and 50% included in Background (2015)

In addition, there is one more development, Wake Memorial PDD (10-TAR-320), expected
to be constructed in the study area between the build-out of Phase 4 and Phase 5 of the
proposed development.

Wake Memorial PDD (10-TAR-320) ­ This residential development, including 62 single family
dwelling units, is projected on the north side of Green Hope School Road between NC 55
and future NC 540. A traffic analysis report (10-TAR-320) was prepared by HNTB and
submitted to the Town of Cary in November 2010. The project was scheduled for
completion in 2014. Based on TAR-320, the development is projected to 670 daily vehicle
trips, with 53 AM peak hour trips and 68 PM peak hour trips. Figure C-10 in Appendix C
depicts the projected peak hour trips due to Wake Memorial PDD. Based on the projected
completion year, site trips from Wake Memorial PDD were included in the Background
(2015) conditions only. There is no mitigation committed by this development at any study
intersections in this TAR.

There is no new roadway improvement project programmed to occur between the build-out
of Phases 4 and 5 of the proposed development. Traffic diversion due to completion of NC
540 (Western Wake Freeway) and Morrisville Parkway Extension is included in the same
manner as in the Background (2013) conditions.

6.2 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Figure 10 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background (2015) scenario

                                              30
analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2015) scenario LOS analyses can
be found in Table 8 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2015) analysis, traffic conditions at one signalized intersection on
NC 55 are projected to deteriorate to operate at failing levels of service. Specifically, the NC
55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is projected to worsen to operate at LOS D
in the AM peak hour and LOS F in the PM peak hour. The remaining intersections are
projected to experience slight delay increases, but will continue operating at acceptable levels
of service.

 7.0 PHASE 5 BUILD (2015) ANALYSIS
 Phase 5 of the proposed Highcroft Village development is to be completed by 2015 and
 consists of 116 single family dwelling units and 61 townhomes.

 7.1 TRIP GENERATION
 Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
 code included in ITE Trip Generation, 8th Edition, and the suggested method of calculation in
 the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

 As a result, the proposed Highcroft Village Phase 5 is projected to generate 1,610 daily site
 trips, with 126 trips (29 entering, 97 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 160 site
 trips (103 entering, 57 exiting) occurring in PM peak hour.

 Table 9 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
 weekday AM and PM peak hours.

7.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
The generated site trips were distributed externally in the same manner as in the Phase 4
Build (2013) conditions. However, it is expected that the construction of Access #2 along
Morrisville Parkway Extension will provide a more convenient route for site traffic to travel
to and from the north. Therefore, in addition to new Phase 5 site trips, site trips generated
from Phase 4 were re-distributed to reflect this new access pattern.

The site distribution percentages are depicted in Figure 11, and the resulting site trips from
both Phases 4 and 5 of the proposed development are shown in Figure 12.

7.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2015) analysis scenario includes the Background (2015) traffic as well as site
generated trips from Phases 4 and 5 of the proposed developments as described previously.
Figure 13 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2015) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway Capacity Software (HCS+).
Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the build year analysis.
Table 10 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B contains the full
Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 10, the addition of site trips will not result in any significant level of
service degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area
intersections. The failing NC 55 and Carpenter Fire Station Road intersection is projected to
continue to operate at a failing LOS F in the PM peak hour with no vehicle traffic delay
increase. The rest of the study area intersections are projected to continue operating
acceptably. The proposed stop-controlled Access #1 approach along Green Hope School
Road is projected to operate LOS B, and the proposed stop-controlled Access #2 approach
along Morrisville Parkway Extension is projected to operate at LOS A during both the AM
and PM peak hours.

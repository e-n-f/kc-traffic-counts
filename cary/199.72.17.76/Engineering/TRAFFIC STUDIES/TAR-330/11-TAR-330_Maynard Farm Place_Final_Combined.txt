EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project Location
The proposed Maynard Farm Place development is located on Old Maynard Road (Louis
Stephens Drive) north of the Louis Stephens Drive intersection with McCrimmon Parkway. The
existing zoning is R-40, and the site is located within a Base Benefit Transportation Zone. The
proposed site would have one access point, located on Louis Stephens Drive between
Addenbrock Drive and Gray Marble Drive. Figure ES-1 shows the study area for 11-TAR-330
while Figure ES-2 shows the proposed site plan.

Background Information
Land owners have requested a rezoning for a site along Old Maynard Road to allow the
construction of homes on 98 lots, or to allow approximately 150 townhomes to be built. This
Traffic Analysis Report (11-TAR-330) analyzes the potential effect of the proposed development
on the surrounding intersections. The proposed build-out year of the development is 2016.

For this study, traffic analyses were performed for the proposed site access point, as well as the
following existing intersections:

   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Parkside Valley Drive (currently unsignalized)
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Grey Marble Road (currently unsignalized)
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Addenbrock Drive (currently unsignalized)
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and McCrimmon Parkway (currently unsignalized)

Traffic analyses were performed for the proposed site entrance and the study area intersections
listed above for 3 scenarios, specifically:

   ·   Existing (2011) ­ Analyzes current conditions (traffic data from manual turning movement
       counts).
   ·   Background (2016) Plus Approved Developments ­ Estimates future (2016) conditions
       based on an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 3%, and adds the traffic generated by
       nearby developments that have been approved, but not yet constructed.
   ·   Combined (2016) ­ Adds the site generated traffic to the Background (2016) Plus
       Approved Developments volumes.

Existing (2011) Analysis

The Existing (2011) traffic was determined through manual turning movement counts taken in
April and June of 2011. Based on the traffic analysis, all intersections in the study area operate
at Level of Service (LOS) C or better in the Existing (2011) scenario.

                                                                               Maynard Farm Place



Background (2016) plus Approved Development Analysis
Future traffic estimates were made based on applying a 3% average annual growth rate (AAGR)
to the 2011 counts. Also, traffic from the following approved developments was considered, and
added as appropriate:

   ·   06-TAR-210 ­ Second Old Maynard Subdivision
   ·   05-TAR-178 ­ Old Maynard Property
   ·   04-TAR-159 ­ Carpenter Property
   ·   03-TAR-147a ­ Carpenter Village
   ·   03-TAR-135a ­ Twin Lakes

Next, development data from the Town of Morrisville was considered, and added based on the
proximity to the Maynard Farm Place site, and existing travel patterns. Finally, the future
extension of Louis Stephens Dive, assumed to be complete in 2016, was factored into the trip
routing and overall volume determinations. The result was the development of expected traffic
volumes at the study intersections for the year 2016. The level of service analysis for this
scenario shows that all study intersections operate at LOS D or better except for the intersection
of McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive. This intersection is expected to experience
failing (LOS F) conditions in 2016, specifically for the southbound approach. Further, high delay
times (484.9 seconds per vehicle in the AM peak, and 691.5 seconds per vehicle in the PM peak)
were calculated and the simulation indicated queues would extend beyond the Louis Stephens
Drive and Parkside Valley Drive intersection.


Combined (2016) Analysis
Traffic for this scenario was determined by adding site traffic to the Background (2016) Plus
Approved Development volume estimates. The level of service analysis of this scenario shows
LOS D or better operations for all study area intersection movements except at the intersection of
McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive. This intersection is expected to experience
failing (LOS F) movements in 2016, specifically for the southbound approach. The delay for the
southbound approach is expected to increase from 484.9 to 570.6 seconds in the AM peak, and
691.5 to 830.1 seconds in the PM peak with the construction of the proposed development. The
Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) states that if the level of service in the existing (or
background) condition fails to meet the level of service set for that zone, there cannot be an
increase in average delay for the affected intersection (measured in its entirety). This property is
located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone" which requires a standard
of LOS D. Because the unsignalized intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens
Drive (with the extension in place) has movements that fail to meet the level of service minimum
(LOS D), experiences considerable queuing, and the delay is increased in the Combined
scenario due to the addition of Maynard Farm Place, mitigation for this increase of delay is
needed to meet the APFO requirement.

Recommended Improvements

Louis Stephens Drive and Site Driveway

The improvements are based on NCDOT's Warrant for Left and Right-Turn lanes found in
NCDOT Policy for Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways (July, 2003), and
shown in Figure ES-3.

   ·   Provision of a southbound right-turn lane with 50 feet of full storage
   ·   Provision of a northbound left-turn lane with 50 feet of full storage

McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive

Multiple improvement options were developed and tested for this intersection (while leaving the
intersection as stop-controlled). None of the options tested provided an acceptable level of
service. Next, a preliminary signal warrant analysis was performed, showing that the intersection
did meet the peak hour warrant. Based on the warrant analysis, additional improvement
scenarios were developed that tested physical improvements in addition to signalization. In
addition to signalization, the intersection configuration that is needed for the intersection to reach
a LOS D under the Combined (2016) conditions or better is the following:

   ·   One shared northbound through and right-turn lane
   ·   One southbound left-turn lane with 225 feet of storage and an exclusive right-turn lane.
   ·   One shared westbound left and right-turn lane.
   ·   Note: this laneage requires a reconfiguration of the through movement at this intersection.
       Louis Stephens Road would function as the through movement while McCrimmon
       Parkway would function as the side street. The through movement in the Existing (2011)
       and Background (2016) plus Approved Development scenarios was a northbound right-
       turn from Louis Stephens Drive to McCrimmon Parkway and westbound left-turn from
       McCrimmon Parkway to Louis Stephens Drive.

It is recommended that a full signal warrant analysis be conducted in order to determine if a
signal is warranted in the year 2016 and after the extension of Louis Stephens Drive has been
constructed. If the signal is found to be warranted, then the signal should be installed.

Aside from the Louis Stephens Drive and McCrimmon Parkway, and the Louis Stephens Drive
and Site Driveway intersections, the remaining intersections are anticipated to operate at an
acceptable level of service and no additional improvements are recommended.

 It should be noted that NCDOT Policy for Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina
Highways (July, 2003) indicates that internal roads should be located at least 100 feet away from
the site entrance. Also the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance states that a minimum
distance of 100 feet shall be required between a cross-access way and an intersection or
driveway entrance. While it appears this requirement is met, given the site plan is not to scale,
we are unable to verify adequate distance is provided.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
A new housing subdivision, initially called Maynard Farm Place, is proposed in northern Cary
along Louis Stephens Drive north of McCrimmon Parkway. See Figure 1 for a site location map.
The site will either have 98 single-family homes or 150 townhomes. Either of these scenarios will
generate more than the Town's 50 peak hour trip threshold (Land Development Ordinance,
section 3.23.4) and therefore will require a Traffic Analysis Report (TAR). This property is also
located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone". The projected build-out
year for this property is 2016. This TAR analyzes the potential impacts of the proposed Maynard
Farm Place development on the adjacent roadways and offers methods of mitigation for those
impacts.

The proposed Maynard Farm Place subdivision has one proposed site entrance, located on the
west side of Louis Stephens Drive. This entrance will form a full movement, "T-intersection" with
Louis Stephens Drive. The site plan is shown in Figure 2.

The study area for this TAR will include the following intersections (which will be analyzed during
existing and future conditions):

   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Parkside Valley Drive
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Grey Marble Road
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and Addenbrock Drive
   ·   Louis Stephens Drive and McCrimmon Parkway


2.0 EXISTING (2011) CONDITIONS
2.1 Existing Roadways
This section of the TAR describes the existing roadways within the study area.


LOUIS STEPHENS DRIVE (SR 3122)
Louis Stephens Drive is a north-south connector roadway that runs primarily parallel to NC 55
from Carpenter Upchurch Road, near High House Road, to where it now dead ends just north of
Parkside Valley Drive. The typical section of Louis Stephens Drive is a paved, two-lane,
undivided roadway until just north of Grey Marble Road where it turns into a gravel and dirt road.
Louis Stephens Drive has a 2009 AADT of 5,100 vehicles just south of McCrimmon Parkway
(based on the NCDOT traffic volume map).

                                                                                 Final 11-TAR-330
                                                                               Maynard Farm Place



MCCRIMMON PARKWAY (SR 1635)
McCrimmon Parkway is a major east-west connector that runs through both the Town of Cary's
and the Town of Morrisville's planning jurisdictions. This particular section of McCrimmon
Parkway runs from Louis Stephens Drive to NC 54 (Chapel Hill Road) and has an at-grade
intersection with Davis Drive. The typical section of McCrimmon Parkway is a two-lane undivided
roadway near its "T intersection" with NC 54 (Chapel Hill Road). McCrimmon Parkway, in the
vicinity of Davis Drive, is typically still a two-lane road but has been widened to accommodate
center turn lanes, left and right-turn lanes, and some medians. McCrimmon Parkway has a 2009
AADT of 11,000 vehicles in between Louis Stephens Drive and Davis Drive (based on the
NCDOT traffic volume map).


ADDENBROCK DRIVE
Addenbrock Drive is primarily a residential street that services McCrimmon at the Park; a nearby
single-family neighborhood.


GREY MARBLE ROAD
Grey Marble Road is primarily a residential roadway that services Breckenridge; a nearby single-
family neighborhood.


PARKSIDE VALLEY DRIVE/WALNUT W OODS DRIVE
Walnut Woods Drive is a residential street on the west side of Louis Stephens Drive that serves
as an entrance to a townhome community. On the east side of Louis Stephens Drive, Walnut
Woods Drive turns into Parkside Valley Drive. Parkside Valley Drive continues through the
Breckenridge subdivision and intersects with Davis Drive. This roadway serves as the main
roadway through the Breckenridge subdivision.


2.2 Existing Intersections
This section of the TAR describes the existing intersections within the study area.


PARKSIDE VALLEY DRIVE/WALNUT W OODS DRIVE AND LOUIS STEPHENS DRIVE
This intersection is currently unsignalized with eastbound and westbound approaches stop
controlled. At the time of the site visit, both the northbound and southbound approaches of Louis
Stephens Drive were unpaved. The current laneage configuration is as follows (and is shown on
Figure 3):

   ·   Eastbound: Shared through and left-turn lane and an exclusive right-turn lane with 50 feet
       of storage (this approach is currently not striped, but is assumed to have this
       configuration once pavement markings are added (stop-controlled)
   ·   Westbound: An exclusive left-turn lane with 400 feet of storage and a shared through and
       right-turn lane (stop-controlled)
                                               2
                                                                                  Final 11-TAR-330
                                                                                Maynard Farm Place



   ·   Northbound: Shared left, through and right-turn lane
   ·   Southbound: Shared left, through and right-turn lane

GREY MARBLE ROAD AND LOUIS STEPHENS DRIVE
This intersection is currently unsignalized with the westbound approach stop controlled. At the
time of the site visit, the southbound approach of Louis Stephens Drive was unpaved. The
current laneage configuration is as follows (and is provided in Figure 3):

   ·   Westbound: Shared left, through, and right-turn lane (stop-controlled)
   ·   Northbound: Shared through and right-turn lane
   ·   Southbound: Shared through and left-turn lane

ADDENBROCK DRIVE AND LOUIS STEPHENS DRIVE
This intersection is currently unsignalized with the eastbound and westbound approaches stop-
controlled. The current laneage configuration is as follows and can be seen on Figure 3.

   ·   Eastbound: An exclusive left-turn lane with 50 feet of storage and a shared through and
       right-turn lane (stop-controlled)
   ·   Westbound: An exclusive left-turn lane with 30 feet of storage and a shared through and
       right-turn lane (stop-controlled)
   ·   Northbound: A shared left and u-turn lane with 125 feet of storage and a through and
       right-turn lane
   ·   Southbound: A shared through and left turn lane, and a shared through and right-turn
       lane with 125 feet of storage Note: Because the right lane drops about 500 feet
       downstream at the next subdivision driveway (which was not analyzed), we analyzed this
       lane as an exclusive right-turn lane in all scenarios.

MCCRIMMON PARKWAY AND LOUIS STEPHENS DRIVE
This intersection is currently unsignalized with the southbound approach stop controlled. Since
the Louis Stephens Drive ­ McCrimmon Parkway movement is the through movement,
northbound Louis Stephens Drive was coded as the eastbound approach for analysis purposes
The current laneage configuration is as follows (and shown in Figure 3):

   ·   Eastbound: Shared through and left-turn lane
   ·   Westbound: Shared through and right-turn lane
   ·   Southbound: Shared left and right-turn lane (stop-controlled)


2.3 Turning Movement Counts
Turning movement counts were conducted in April and June, 2011. After the original counts were
performed, an additional count was taken at the intersection of Parkside Valley Drive and Davis
Drive. A count at Davis Drive and McCrimmon Parkway previously performed in April 2011 was
also used. These counts were taken to assist in determining the directional splits of existing
traffic. This data was used to estimate the effect of the Louis Stephens Drive extension project;

2.4 Level of Service Criteria for Stop-controlled Intersections
Exhibit 17-2 in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 provides the level of service criteria for stop-
controlled intersections. The criteria for level of service is described in Table 2 below.

Table 2: Level of Service Criteria for Stop-Controlled Intersections
           Level of Service                  Average Control Delay (s/veh)

The Maynard Farm Place development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone
which is described in section 3.23.3 of the Land Development Ordinance. For areas located
within the Base Benefit Zone, the level of service standard is "D". Recommendations from this
TAR are based on achieving a Level of Service (LOS) D or better for all movements located
within the study area intersections.


2.5 Existing Level of Service Analysis
The existing laneage network and the counts that were collected were input into Synchro Version
7 and analyzed for the AM and PM peak hour conditions. Since all of the existing intersections
are unsignalized, levels of service and delay were reported for each movement that experienced
delay. Also, the northbound u-turns that were counted at the intersection of Addenbrock Drive
and Louis Stephens Drive were analyzed as left-turn for reporting level of service and delay. This
is based on Highway Capacity Manual methodologies. The summary of the findings are located
in Table 3 below.

As shown in Table 3, all intersection movements operate at an acceptable level of service, D or
better, during both AM and PM peak hours of operation.



3.0 BACKGROUND (2016) PLUS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT
CONDITIONS
3.1 Background Growth and Development
A 3% annual growth rate was applied to the existing volumes (2011) to determine the projected
volumes for the 2016 Background analysis. These volumes can be found on Figure 5. There
were also additional trips added to account for approved developments that are not yet
constructed. These trips were based on other TARs provided by the Town of Cary, and
information from the Town of Morrisville. Further, this TAR estimates the effect of the Louis
Stephens Drive extension being completed; adding some traffic, and rerouting other trips as a
result. All additional developments are described in the sections below.


LOUIS STEPHENS DRIVE EXTENSION
Louis Stephens Drive Extension is currently a roadway project being designed by Town of Cary
and will consist of extending the existing Louis Stephens Drive from Grey Marble Road, where
Louis Stephens Road currently becomes an unpaved roadway, to another existing section of
Louis Stephens Drive on the north side of the new NC 540 in Research Triangle Park (RTP). This
project will be funded by both Town of Cary and RTP funds. Bob Shultes, Town of Cary
Engineer, stated that the roadway design is currently underway, with 25% plans nearing
completion. Mr. Shultes said that the typical section of the Louis Stephens Drive extension will be
a two-lane paved roadway and will have at-grade intersections with Grey Marble Road, Parkside
Valley Drive, and Little Drive (north of NC 540). At these at-grade intersections, the Louis
Stephens approach will have a shared left, through, and right-turn lane (i.e. no turn lanes). Mr.
Shultes stressed that this information is preliminary, and subject to change through the design
process.

It was assumed that, with the addition of the Louis Stephens Drive extension, out of the vehicles
that use Louis Stephens Drive, McCrimmon Parkway, and Davis Drive to reach their destinations
each day, around 35% were assumed to change their route to use the Louis Stephens Drive
extension once it is completed (based on aerial photography and knowledge of travel patterns in
the area). These rerouted volumes can be seen on Figure 6.

It was also assumed that the Louis Stephens Drive extension would attract vehicles from outside
of our study area. After reviewing the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), published by
NCDOT, of similar facilities in the area (Church St and Green Level Church Road), it was
estimated that around 5,000 vehicles per day would use this facility. It was assumed that 10% of

these vehicles would travel in the peak hour and that 60% of those trips would head north in the
AM and 40% would head south in the AM (vice versa for the PM trips). This added 300 vehicles
to the northbound through movements in the AM and 200 vehicles to the southbound through
movements for the AM (vice versa for the PM). These additional trips are shown on Figure 6.

For the Background (2016) Plus Approved Development scenarios, there are six development
plans that were submitted to the Town of Cary that may affect traffic in the study area. The TARs
for these developments were reviewed, and relevant data included into this TAR. Those
developments include:

   ·   06-TAR-210 ­ Second Old Maynard Subdivision
   ·   05-TAR-178 ­ Old Maynard Property
   ·   04-TAR-159 ­ Carpenter Property
   ·   03-TAR-147a ­ Carpenter Village
   ·   03-TAR-135a ­ Twin Lakes
   ·   Manchester Park (no TAR required)

06-TAR-210 ­ SECOND OLD MAYNARD SUBDIVISION
The Second Old Maynard subdivision was proposed to be a development of 143 single-family
detached homes and 142 townhomes, but has not been constructed. The 06-TAR-210 calculated
a total of 178 trips in the AM peak hour and 228 trips in the PM peak hour produced by the
development. The Second Old Maynard subdivision was proposed to be located adjacent to
Maynard Farm Place on the north side. This TAR assumes that the development analyzed under
06-TAR-210 will be built by the year 2016 and includes the site trips generated by the
subdivision. These site trips are shown on Figure 6, Approved Site Trips.


05-TAR-178 ­ OLD MAYNARD PROPERTY
The Old Maynard Property that was analyzed under 05-TAR-178 has been built and is now
called McCrimmon at the Park. This development has three site drives, one of which is
Addenbrock Drive, analyzed in this TAR. Since this development has already been built, the site
trips associated with this development are assumed to be included in the turning movement
counts conducted for this TAR. No additional traffic was added for this development.


04-TAR-159 ­ CARPENTER PROPERTY
Carpenter Property is a planned development on the south side of Morrisville Parkway between
Louis Stephens Drive and NC 55. The proposed mixed-use development included residential,
office, shopping center, pharmacy/ drug store, supermarket, and sit-down restaurant land-uses. It
does not appear that any phase of this development has been built. The TAR that was conducted
sends 34 trips in the AM peak hour and 7 trips in the PM peak hour north toward the intersection
of McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive, and brings 2 trips in the AM peak hour and
48 trips in the PM peak hour from the intersection of McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens
Drive toward the Carpenter Property TAR study area. Due to the presence of several

neighborhoods and other destinations that these vehicles could be going to or coming from, we
did not include these few vehicles in our Background (2016) Plus Approved Development
scenario analysis. Rather, these trips are assumed to be included in the 3% annual growth rate
that was applied to the existing turning movement counts.


03-TAR-147A ­ CARPENTER VILLAGE
The Carpenter Village TAR was required for a development consisting of 79 single-family
detached houses and 117 townhomes. The site is located on the north side of Morrisville
Carpenter Road to the east of Louis Stephens Drive. This development does appear to have
been built and it does include single-family homes and townhomes. Any trips to or from this site
that travel through this TARs analyzed intersections are assumed to be included in the turning
movement counts that were conducted.


03-TAR-135A ­ TWIN LAKES
Twin Lakes is primarily a residential neighborhood with about 425 single-family units, patio
homes, and townhomes. Currently, there are 13 single-family home sites that are uninhabited.
TAR 03-TAR-145a was completed in 2004 for this development, and included 159 single-family
homes, 662 townhomes, 234 apartment units, 150 capacity assisted living facility, 250,000
square feet of retail, 4 high-turnover restaurants, and 100,000 square feet of office space. The
non-residential land uses are assumed to be built by the year 2016. Since only a small portion of
the overall development has been constructed, and due to possible changes in the overall plan,
it was determined that all of the site trips generated by the Twin Lakes mixed-use development
should be incorporated into this TAR's analysis. The site trips incorporated are shown on Figure
6.


MANCHESTER PARK TOWNHOMES
Manchester Park Townhomes is a development with 123 townhomes located in the southeast
quadrant of the McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive intersection. This development
did not require a TAR or a TIA. Since this development is located so close to this TARs study
area, trip generation and distribution were calculated for this development and trips were routed
through the study area intersections. The trips associated with this development are shown on
Figure 6. The trip generation based for the 123 townhomes was based on the latest version of
the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation equations for land use code 230
and are located in Table 4 below.

FERRELL HATCHER PROPERTY (MAGNOLIA ESTATES)
The Ferrell Hatcher Property, now Magnolia Estates, is a single-family housing development with
58 sites located on the west side of Louis Stephens Drive south of Morrisville Carpenter Road.
This development was not required to produce a TAR. A site visit determined that this
development was mostly built and occupied. The trips associated with this development are
assumed to be included in the turning movement counts.

Also, the Town of Morrisville provided additional development information relevant to the
analysis. These developments include Davis Corners and a few unconstructed outparcels in the
Park South Village development that was analyzed under a TIA completed by Kimley-Horn in
2003. Additional information on these developments is provided below.


DAVIS CORNERS
Davis Corners is a shopping center development located in the Town of Morrisville that did not
require a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) under the Town of Morrisville's Zoning Ordinance. This
development is located in the southwest quadrant of the McCrimmon Parkway and Davis Drive
intersection. The development had been constructed but not opened at the time the traffic counts
were conducted. This development consists of 16,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space
and is projected to produce 52 trips in the AM and 186 trips in the PM. Since this development
did not require a TIA, and does not appear to directly affect any of the intersections analyzed
under this TAR, the additional trips associated with this development were assumed to be a part
of the 3% background growth that was applied to the existing volumes.


PARK SOUTH VILLAGE
Park South Village is another shopping center located on the northwest quadrant of the
McCrimmon Parkway and Davis Drive intersection. This development has been constructed and
most of it is open to the public. The remaining parcels to be opened include a 5,000 square-foot
liquor store (specialty retail), a 2,880 square-foot bank, and 10,000 square feet of general retail.
These additional outparcels are projected to produce 88 trips in the AM peak hour and 261 trips
in the PM peak hour. Based on the location of this development, the additional traffic was not
assumed to directly affect the intersections within the Maynard Farm Place study area. Thus, the
additional trips associated with this development were assumed to be a part of the three 3%
background growth that was applied to the existing volumes.

3.2 Background (2016) plus Approved Development Level of Service
Analysis
Level of Service analyses were conducted for all of the study area intersections for the
Background (2016) Plus Approved Development AM and PM peak hours. This analysis will be
used as the base case for our analysis of impacts for the site to be developed.

Based on the Synchro analysis, all intersections/movements are anticipated to operate at LOS D
or better aside from the intersection of Louis Stephens Drive and McCrimmon Parkway. Based
on the Synchro analysis and the associated traffic simulation for the Background (2016) Plus
Approved Development scenario, the southbound shared left-turn and through movement at
Louis Stephens Drive and McCrimmon Parkway intersection the will operate at LOS F and
experience considerable queuing. This simulation indicated southbound queues from this
intersection would extend beyond the intersection of Louis Stephens Drive and Parkside Valley
Drive.

The volumes that were used in the Background (2016) Plus Approved Development scenarios
analysis are shown on Figure 7. The summary of the Level of Service analysis for the
Background (2016) Plus Approved Development conditions is reported in Table 5.

As shown in the above table, all intersections operate at a LOS D or above except for
McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive in which the southbound shared left and right-
turn lane operate at a LOS F in the AM and PM peak hours.



4.0 COMBINED (2016) CONDITIONS
Maynard Farm Place is proposed to have either 98 single-family detached homes or 150
townhomes. The proposed development is located within the Town of Cary's Base Benefit Zone
and therefore recommendations for the applicant will be based on bringing Levels of Service up
to a "D" or better.


4.1 Trip Generation
The Maynard Farm Place development is proposed to be either 98 single-family homes or 150
townhomes. Trip Generation equations were used from the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 8th
Edition to determine the amount of vehicles the site would generate. Both land use's trip
generations are shown in Table 6 below.

         PM                 87            56            31


Because the 98 single-family dwelling units are expected to produce more trips than the 150
townhomes, the site trips were based on a site with 98 single-family homes. As ITE and NCDOT
recommend for land use code 210, no pass-by trips were incorporated into this analysis.


4.2 Trip Distribution
Access to Maynard Farm Place will be via a full-access driveway on Louis Stephens Drive. Trip
generation was estimated based on count data from nearby intersections, and from knowledge of
local trip attractions and destinations in the area. The site distribution data is shown on Figure 7.
The total amount of trips produced by this site can be found in Figure 8.

4.3 Combined (2016) Level of Service Analysis
The Combined (2016) scenario consists of the background plus approved development traffic as
determined in Section 3.0 of the TAR plus the site generated trips from the proposed Maynard
Farm Place development. The volumes that are used in the Combined (2016) Analysis are
shown in Figure 9.

Level of service analyses were performed for the four (4) existing intersections plus the site drive
for the Maynard Farm Place development. A summary of the levels of service are found in Table
7.

Ordinance. The recommended improvements for Louis Stephens Drive and the Site Driveway
intersection are the provision of a southbound right-turn lane with 50 feet of full storage and
northbound left-turn lane with 50 feet of storage.. While these movements operate at adequate
levels of service, based on NCDOT's Warrant for Left and Right-Turn lanes these turn lanes are
warranted. These improvements only affect the operations at the Louis Stephens Drive and Site
Driveway intersection and the resulting level of service and delay is shown in Table 8 below.

For McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive, physical improvements were analyzed
including the provision of turn lanes and the realignment of the through movement to northbound-
southbound (Louis Stephens Road) as opposed to McCrimmon Parkway, which serves as the
through movement today. None of these improvements brought the failing movements to LOS D
or addressed the considerable queuing for the stop-controlled movements. A peak hour signal
warrant analysis (warrant 3) was conducted for this intersection. The peak hour warrant (warrant
3) was met during the Background plus Approved Developments and Combined scenarios. See
Appendix H for the warrant analyses.

All movements at the site drive intersection operate at desirable levels of service. The level of
service for the eastbound approach improves slightly in both peak periods. The northbound left-
turn is expected to operate at LOS A. The delay is increased for the 2016 Combined analysis, as
compared to the Background (2016 plus Approved Development) analysis, for the shared left-
turn and through movement because the lane is no longer a shared lane.

With the addition of a signal at the McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive intersection
and the provision of a southbound left-turn lane, both AM and PM peak hours will operate at a
LOS D or better for the overall intersection. The westbound and northbound approaches to the
signal will operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour and will experience considerable queuing.

the Background (2016) plus Approved Development scenario and is signalized in the Combined
(2016) analysis, a direct comparison of delays is not appropriate. The delay for each movement
with the provision of a signal will increase delays for the once free-flow movements due to having
to stop when the signal is red for that phase.



5.0 CONCLUSIONS
When comparing the Background (2016) Plus Approved Development level of service analyses
and the Combined (2016) analyses, reviewing the Town of Cary Long Range Transportation
Plan, and NCDOT requirements, the recommended improvements are for the Louis Stephens
Drive and Site Driveway, and the McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive intersections.

Louis Stephens Drive and Site Driveway

These improvements are based on NCDOT's Warrant for Left and Right-Turn lanes found in
NCDOT Policy for Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways (July, 2003). The
improvements are listed below and are shown in Figure 12.

   ·   Provision of a southbound right-turn lane with 50 feet of full storage
   ·   Provision of a northbound left-turn lane with 50 feet of full storage



McCrimmon Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive

The Town of Cary's Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) states that if the level of
service in the existing (or background) condition fails to meet the level of service set for that
zone, there cannot be an increase in average delay for the affected intersection (measured in its
entirety). This property is located inside the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Transportation Zone"
which requires a standard of LOS D. Because the unsignalized intersection of McCrimmon
Parkway and Louis Stephens Drive (with the extension in place) has movements that fail to meet
the level of service minimum, LOS D, experiences considerable queuing, and the delay is
increased in the Combined scenario due to the addition of Maynard Farm Place, mitigation for
this increase of delay is needed to meet the APFO requirement.

Multiple improvement options were developed and tested for this intersection (while leaving the
intersection as stop-controlled). None of the options tested provided an acceptable level of
service. Next, a preliminary signal warrant analysis was performed, showing that the intersection
did meet the peak hour warrant. Based on the warrant analysis, additional improvement
scenarios were developed that tested physical improvements in addition to signalization. In
addition to signalization, the intersection configuration that is needed for the intersection to reach
a LOS D under the Combined (2016) conditions or better is the following:


                                                 16
                                                                                 Final 11-TAR-330
                                                                               Maynard Farm Place



   ·   One shared northbound through and right-turn lane
   ·   One southbound left-turn lane with 225 feet of storage and an exclusive right-turn lane.
   ·   One shared westbound left and right-turn lane.
   ·   Note: this laneage requires a reconfiguration of the through movement at this intersection.
       Louis Stephens Road would function as the through movement while McCrimmon
       Parkway would function as the side street. The through movement in the Existing (2011)
       and Background (2016) plus Approved Development scenarios were a northbound right-
       turn from Louis Stephens Drive to McCrimmon Parkway and westbound left-turn from
       McCrimmon Parkway to Louis Stephens Drive.


It is recommended that a full signal warrant analysis be conducted in order to determine if a
signal is warranted in the year 2016 and after the extension of Louis Stephens Drive has been
put in place. If a signal is found to be warranted, then a signal would need to be installed at this
location.

Aside from the Louis Stephens Drive and McCrimmon Parkway intersection and the Louis
Stephens Drive and Site Driveway intersection, the remaining intersections are anticipated to
operate at an acceptable level of service and no additional improvements are recommended.

It should be noted that NCDOT Policy for Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina
Highways (July, 2003) indicates that internal roads should be located at least 100 feet away from
the site entrance. Also the Town of Cary's LDO states that a minimum distance of 100 feet shall
be required between a cross-access way and an intersection or driveway entrance. While it
appears this requirement is met, given the site plan is not to scale, we are unable to verify
adequate distance is provided.

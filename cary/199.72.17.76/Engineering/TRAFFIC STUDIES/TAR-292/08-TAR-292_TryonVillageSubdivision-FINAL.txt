EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
This report summarizes the impacts of the proposed development of Tract 3 of the Tryon Village
Mixed-Use Development, which is located in the northwestern quadrant of the Walnut Street and
Tryon Road intersection (Figure 1). A TAR for the entire Tryon Village development was
completed and submitted to the Town of Cary in 2004; however, the build-out year shown in the
original report has expired, thus a new TAR is required for developing Tract 3. The proposed
project is to consist of 105 townhomes and is located within the Base Transportation Zone (as
defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 05-009). The project is scheduled for completion in 2010.
This report analyzes the potential traffic impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent
roadways.

Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via a driveway connection to the
Crossroads Manor Court/Macedonia Lake Drive roundabout, which connects to Walnut Street,
Centrum Plaza, and other adjoining tracts of Tryon Village (Figure 2). The following intersections
meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and
future conditions, where applicable:
      Walnut Street and Dillard Drive (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Crossroads Ford/Centrum Plaza (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Macedonia Road/Crossroads Manor Court (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Tryon Road (signalized)
      Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
      Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road (unsignalized)
      Site Access and Crossroads Manor Court/Macedonia Lake Drive (roundabout)
Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2008), Background (2010), Build (2010), and
Build (2010) with Improvements conditions. The Existing (2008) Scenario includes Saturday mid-
day and weekday P.M. peak hour analyses based on turning movement count data collected in July
and August of 2007 and January and February of 2008. The Background (2010) Scenario includes
existing traffic along with approved site traffic from ten other proposed developments within the
study area. An annual growth rate was not applied to existing volumes to account for background
growth in the area due to the high volume of traffic that will be added due to other approved
developments in the area. The Build (2010) Scenario includes the Background (2010) volumes with
the addition of site trips generated by the proposed development. In addition, future conditions
with proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a Build (2010) with
Improvements Scenario.

Existing (2008) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection turning
movement counts. As reported in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page iv, all existing
signalized intersections included in the study area are operating at acceptable levels of service during
both the Saturday Mid-day and Weekday P.M. peak hours.

Background (2010) Conditions
In the Background (2010) scenario, no annual growth rate was applied to the existing traffic due to
the high volumes expected to be added to the network by other approved developments in the area.
                                                   i
There are nine (9) developments in the study area being partially or fully constructed prior to, or at
the same time as the build-out of the proposed development. These developments include:

           Walnut Street Mixed-Use (08-TAR-283)
           Dillard Apartments (07-TAR-266)
           Swiftside Drive Office Building (07-TAR-244)
           Dillard Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-235)
           Stephens Road Residential (07-TAR-229)
           Crossroads Borders (07-TAR-227)
           Crossroads Apartments (05-TAR-185)
           CVS and Bank at Tryon Road and Walnut Street (05-TAR-176)
           Tryon Village Mixed Use (05-TAR-165)

The site traffic from these approved developments was therefore included in the Background (2010)
analysis. Any geometric improvements associated with these projects that overlap the project study
area were included in all future year analyses. Additionally, improvements associated with the
planned Town of Cary Walnut Street Widening project were included in all future year analyses.
These improvements include the widening of Walnut Street north of Dillard Drive.

Based on the Background (2010) analysis, the overall traffic operations will worsen slightly at most
study area intersections. However, the addition of background traffic will not result in a significant
traffic performance degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) at any study area
intersections. However, the westbound stop-controlled approach of Jones Franklin Road at
Macedonia Road operates at a LOS F during the Weekday P.M. peak hour.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed development is to consist of 105 residential townhomes. Based on the corresponding
trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, the proposed development
is projected to generate 612 trips on a typical Saturday with 60 of those occurring during the mid-
day peak hour (26 entering, 34 exiting). On a typical weekday, the development is projected to
generate 669 trips with 63 occurring in the P.M. peak hour (42 entering, 21 exiting).

The generated site trips were distributed in accordance with the existing traffic patterns and land
uses in the vicinity of study area. In all, the majority of the site trips were distributed to the areas
north and east of the project site.

Build (2010) Conditions
The Build (2010) conditions account for both the background traffic and the site traffic generated by
the proposed townhome development. As shown in the summary LOS table on page iv, the
addition of site trips will not result in any level of service degradation at any study intersections,
despite slight increases in traffic delay. However, the westbound stop-controlled approach of Jones
Franklin Road at Macedonia Road continues to operate at a LOS F during the Weekday P.M. peak
hour.

The newly constructed site access driveway for the proposed development is projected to operate at
acceptable levels during both the Saturday Mid-day and Weekday P.M. peak hours with the existing
roundabout configuration.

                                                   ii
Roadway Improvement Recommendations
The analyses indicate that the addition of trips generated by the proposed development will not
cause any significant traffic degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS) on the
roadway network within the study area. However, the following roadway improvements are
recommended to ensure safety and mobility at all site driveways:

Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road
The analysis indicates that this location will operate at a LOS F during the Background and Build
(2010) Weekday P.M. peak hour. This intersection has been identified in past reports as a location
that is projected to operate at failing levels in future years. Therefore, the following roadway
improvement is recommended at this location:
      Relocate the stop controlled approach to the Macedonia Road approach; realign the
       intersection in accordance with the Southeast Area Plan.
With this improvement completed, the new stop-controlled eastbound Macedonia Road approach
will operate at a LOS C during the Build (2010) Weekday P.M. peak hour.

Walnut Street and Macedonia Road/Crossroads Manor Court
The analysis indicates that this location will operate acceptably during both peak hours analyzed.
However, a queue analysis for the eastbound approach (Crossroads Manor Court) indicates that the
projected queue length for this approach has the potential to exceed the existing storage length for
the exclusive left-turn lane, which would hinder traffic operations at the roundabout. The following
roadway improvements are therefore recommended:
      Restripe the eastbound approach to accommodate dual left-turn lanes and a shared
       through/right-turn lane.
      Restripe the remaining approaches to match the existing signal plan for this location,
       including an exclusive right-turn lane and shared through/left-turn lane on the westbound
       approach and skip lines through the intersection to guide drivers through the skewed
       geometry.
      Update the existing signal and timing plans to reflect the proposed restriping on the
       eastbound approach. The improved phasing would include a protected left-turn phase for
       the eastbound approach, while the westbound left-turn approach would remain permitted
       only, with the westbound right-turn lane still allowed as an overlapping phase.
With this improvement in place, operations will remain at LOS B during both peak hours, but the
queue length for the eastbound left-turn lane is reduced to a length that can be contained within the
provided storage length.

Crossroads Manor Court and Macedonia Lake Drive/Site Access
Analysis indicates that this intersection will operate acceptably under the Build (2010) conditions
with the existing geometry at the roundabout. Therefore, no roadway improvements are
recommended at this location.

1.0    INTRODUCTION

This report summarizes the impacts of the proposed development of Tract 3 of the Tryon
Village Mixed-Use Development, which is located in the northwestern quadrant of the
Walnut Street and Tryon Road intersection (Figure 1). A TAR for the entire Tryon Village
development was completed and submitted to the Town of Cary in 2004; however, the
build-out year shown in the original report has expired, thus a new TAR is required for
developing Tract 3. The proposed project is to consist of 105 townhomes and is located
within the Base Transportation Zone (as defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 05-009).
The project is scheduled for completion in 2010. This report analyzes the potential traffic
impacts of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via a driveway connection to the
Crossroads Manor Court/Macedonia Lake Drive roundabout, which connects to Walnut
Street, Centrum Plaza, and other adjoining tracts of Tryon Village (Figure 2). The following
intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed
for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
      Walnut Street and Dillard Drive (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Crossroads Ford/Centrum Plaza (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Macedonia Road/Crossroads Manor Court (signalized)
      Walnut Street and Tryon Road (signalized)
      Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road (signalized)
      Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road (unsignalized)
      Site Access and Crossroads Manor Court/Macedonia Lake Drive (roundabout)
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the potential
traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary roadway
improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes the trip generation,
distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed development.

      2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
      Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
      traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
      Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
      vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
      the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
      Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
      ranges.

          A               Little or no delay         <= 10 sec.            <= 10 sec.
          B              Short traffic delay         10-20 sec.            10-15 sec.
          C             Average traffic delay        20-35 sec.            15-25 sec.
          D              Long traffic delay          35-55 sec.            25-35 sec.
          E            Very long traffic delay       55-80 sec.            35-50 sec.
          F             Unacceptable delay            > 80 sec.             > 50 sec.

The proposed Tryon Village East subdivision is located within the Town of Cary's "Base
Benefit Zone". Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the
average peak hour (as defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, ITE) with LOS
D considered acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized stop-controlled
approaches. For signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a level of
service worse than LOS D, then no drop in overall intersection delay is acceptable under
build conditions. For unsignalized intersections, where the stop-controlled approach is
below a level of service LOS D under background conditions, then no drop in level of
service is acceptable.

2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical Saturday mid-day and
weekday P.M. peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity
Software (HCS+). A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be
found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, all existing signalized intersections included in the study area are
operating at acceptable levels of service during both the Saturday Mid-day and Weekday
P.M. peak hours.

3.0    BACKGROUND CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
No general background growth rate was applied to the study area roadways or intersections
volume counts due to the high volumes expected to be added to the network by other
approved developments in the area. There are nine (9) developments in the study area being
constructed at the time as or prior to the build-out of the proposed development. These
developments are:

          Walnut Street Mixed-Use (08-TAR-283)
          Dillard Apartments (07-TAR-266)
          Swiftside Drive Office Building (07-TAR-244)
          Dillard Drive Office Complex (07-TAR-235)
          Stephens Road Residential (07-TAR-229)
          Crossroads Borders (07-TAR-227)
          Crossroads Apartments (05-TAR-185)
          CVS and Bank at Tryon Road and Walnut Street (05-TAR-176)
          Tryon Village Mixed Use (05-TAR-165)

Tryon and Walnut Development - Also referred to as Tryon Village, this is a mixed-use
development currently under construction in the northwest quadrant of the Tryon Road at
Walnut Street/Holly Springs Road intersection. The proposed townhome development is
part of this development. However, because the build year for TAR-165 has expired, a new
TAR is being prepared for the tract of land on which the townhomes will be built. The
original site plan for the entire development shows two primary full movement access
points: one on Walnut Street opposite Macedonia Road and the other along Tryon Road
opposite a church driveway. Currently, there are also right-in/right-out access points along
Tryon Road and Walnut Street. The land use is expected to include 368 apartment units,
150 townhouse units, 169,000 square-feet (s.f.) of commercial/retail use, an 8,000 s.f.
restaurant, a 4,500 s.f. bank and 125,600 s.f. of office space. A Traffic Analysis Report (04-
TAR-165) was prepared by Stantec and submitted to the Town of Cary in 2004. Trip
generation for the proposed development indicates a total of 1,610 weekday P.M. peak hour
trips  an estimated 964 of which are new trips. 1,861 new trips will be generated during the
Saturday peak hour, 1441 of which are new trips. The site trips expected to be generated by
the Tryon Village Subdivision townhomes were subtracted out of these calculated trips by
means of a reduction ratio. The remaining trips were assigned to the study intersections
based on the distribution used in the Stantec report. The report distributed all of the
development trips to the two signalized driveways to account for worst case conditions. A
portion of this traffic may actually access the surrounding roadway network via Tryon
Manor Drive, interconnected driveways (i.e., connection to BJ's Shopping Center), partial
access driveways to the development, or the new public road. Figure C-1 in Appendix C
depicts the assigned trips. There are no mitigation recommendations associated with the
Tryon and Walnut Development that overlap study intersections in this TAR that have not yet
been completed.

CVS and Bank at Tryon Road and Walnut Street  This development, located in the
southeastern corner of the Walnut Street/Holly Springs Road at Tryon Road intersection,
has been recently completed. A Traffic Analysis Report (05-TAR-176) was prepared by

                                             12
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson and submitted in June 2005. This development consists of 11,970
s.f. of CVS/pharmacy drugstore with a drive-through window and a 3,500 s.f. bank with
three drive-through windows. The TAR for this project estimates 2,289 additional daily
weekday trips will be added to the existing network due to the development. During the
P.M. peak hour, 134 new trips will be generated (66 entering and 68 exiting). Currently, the
CVS is built and open, and the bank has recently opened. To maintain a conservative
approach, the trips generated by the CVS were removed from the generated trips; however
the trips generated by the bank were added to the network, as the majority of the counts
used in this project were taken prior to the opening of this bank. After this reduction, the
generated trips were estimated at 1,234 daily weekday trips, 82 of which will occur during the
P.M. peak hour (44 entering and 38 exiting). There was no Saturday peak hour analysis
performed in the TAR for this project, so a trip generation for the Saturday mid-day peak
hour was completed. The trips generated during this time period are found in Table 4.

These trips were distributed based on the same distribution patterns as used for the P.M.
peak hour. Figure C-2 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips. There are no mitigation
recommendations associated with this development that overlap study intersections in this
TAR.

Crossroads Apartments  This development, which will be located in the northwest quadrant of
the Jones Franklin Road and Crossroads Boulevard intersection, was originally planned to be
completed in 2006 and is to consist of 350 apartments and 30,000 s.f. of office space. As
such, a Traffic Analysis Report (05-TAR-185) was completed by HNTB in 2005. Trip
generation for this development indicates 2,682 new weekday trips, 262 of which occur in
the P.M. peak hour (148 entering, 114 exiting). A typical Saturday will yield 2,562 new daily
trips, 558 of which occur during the peak hour (301 entering, 257 exiting). These trips were
distributed in the same manner as assumed in the HNTB report. Figure C-3 in Appendix C
depicts the assigned trips. There are no mitigation recommendations associated with this
development that overlap study intersections in this TAR.

Borders Book Store  This retail establishment will be a redevelopment of existing stores in the
Crossroads Shopping Center. This project was originally slated for completion in 2008.
According to a traffic analysis report (06-TAR-227) performed by HNTB in 2006, this
redevelopment will produce 392 new trips in the P.M. peak hour (204 entering, 188 exiting).
During the Saturday peak hour, 427 new trips are expected (226 entering, 201 exiting).
These trips were distributed in the same manner as assumed in the HNTB report. Figure C-
4 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips. There are no mitigation recommendations
associated with this development that overlap study intersections in this TAR.

  Stephens Road Residential Development  This subdivision, planned by Buxbaum Real Estate
  Company, LLC, is located on the south side of Stephens Road, west of Piney Plains Road.
  The project will consist of 48 single family dwelling units and is planned for completion in
  2008. Martin/Alexiou/Bryson prepared a Traffic Analysis Report (07-TAR-229) for this
  development which was submitted in February 2008. Trip generation for this project
  indicates an additional 529 daily trips will be added to the network on a typical weekday, 55
  of which will occur in the P.M. peak hour (35 entering, 20 exiting). There was no Saturday
  peak hour analysis required for this report, so a trip generation for the Saturday mid-day
  peak hour was completed. The trips generated during this time period are found in Table 5.

  These trips were distributed based on the same distribution patterns as used for the P.M.
  peak hour. Figure C-5 in Appendix C depicts the assigned trips. There were no off-site
  roadway improvements associated with this development that overlap the study area for this
  TAR.

  Dillard Drive Office Complex  This office development is to be located adjacent to the Holiday
  Inn in the northeast quadrant of the Dillard Drive and Columbus Street intersection and will
  consist of 24,000 s.f. of general office space. It is planned for completion in 2008.
  According to the Traffic Analysis Report (07-TAR-235) completed by Wilbur Smith
  Associates in 2007, the development will generate 445 weekday trips with 106 occurring
  during the P.M. peak hour. Eleven (11) trips are expected to enter or exit the development
  during the Saturday mid-day peak hour. The site trips were distributed to the roadway
  network in accordance with the distribution used in 07-TAR-235. Figure C-6 in Appendix C
  depicts the assigned trips. There are no mitigation recommendations associated with this
  development that overlap study intersections in this TAR.

  Swift Side Office Condominiums  This commercial development is to be located near the
  intersection of Tryon Road and Jones Franklin Road. The development, consisting of
  approximately 31,500 s.f. of general office space, is planned for completion by 2008.
  According to the Traffic Analysis Report (07-TAR-244) prepared by HNTB for this
  development, 348 new trips will be added to the roadways on a typical weekday, with 47 of
  these occurring during the P.M. peak hour (8 entering, 39 exiting). There was no Saturday
  peak hour analysis required for this report, so a trip generation for the Saturday mid-day
  peak hour was completed. The trips generated during this time period are found in Table 6.
  These trips, along with the P.M. peak hour site trips were distributed to the study area
  network in accordance with the distribution used in the HNTB report. Figure C-7 in
  Appendix C depicts the assigned trips. This report recommended the realignment of Jones
  Franklin Road at Macedonia Road to allow Jones Franklin to be the major through
  movement; however, this improvement is not yet in place. Therefore, it is not included in
  future year analyses.

Dillard Apartments  This 340-unit apartment complex is to be located in the southwest
quadrant of the Dillard Drive and Piney Plains Road intersection. It is planned for
completion in 2009. According to the Traffic Analysis Report (07-TAR-266) prepared by
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, this development will generate 2,413 trips on a typical Saturday,
with 159 of those occurring during the mid-day peak hour (71 entering, 88 exiting). On a
typical weekday, the apartments will generate 2,194 daily trips with 205 occurring during the
P.M. peak hour (133 entering, 72 exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area
network in accordance with the distribution used in 07-TAR-266. Figure C-8 in Appendix C
depicts the assigned trips. There are no mitigation recommendations associated with this
development that overlap study intersections in this TAR.

Walnut Street Mixed-Use Development  This development is to be located in the southeastern
quadrant of the Walnut Street and US 1/64 Ramps/Donaldson Drive intersection and is
scheduled for completion in 2009. There are three possible land use scenarios for this
development. To remain conservative, trips generated by Scenario A were included in the
background analysis for this project as that Scenario generates the highest volume of traffic
of the three scenarios. In Scenario A, the development is to consist of a 6,000 square foot
restaurant, a 7,800 square foot retail building, 27,600 square feet of office space and two
hotels totaling 240 rooms (110 and 130 each). The existing Hardee's building and a 125-
room Days Inn motel will be demolished. According to the Traffic Analysis Report
prepared by Martin/Alexiou/Bryson (08-TAR-283), this development will generate 5,992 net
new trips on a typical Saturday, with 512 of those occurring during the mid-day peak hour
(271 entering, 241 exiting) and 5,995 net new trips on a typical weekday, with 511 occurring
during the P.M. peak hour (224 entering, 287 exiting). These trips were distributed to the
study area network in accordance with the distribution used in 08-TAR-283. Figure C-9 in
Appendix C depicts the assigned trips. There are no mitigation recommendations associated
with this development that overlap study intersections in this TAR.

The projects previously discussed are in varying stages of construction and occupancy. In
order to account for these variances, completion ratios were applied to the distributed site
trips based on current completion and expected completion by the build year for the Tryon
Village Subdivision (2010). The figures in Appendix C illustrate the full build site trips for
each development, while Figure 5 illustrates the site trips with ratios accounting for current
and projected completion percentages as shown in the following matrix. An inclusion ratio
was not used for the Tryon Village Mixed-Use Development (04-TAR-165) trips. Because
of the complexity of the build-out schedule and the inclusion of the Tryon Village
Subdivision townhomes in the original TAR, the trips for this approved development were
reduced by hand at each driveway for Tryon Village and the surrounding intersections. In
this way, the original TAR projections are used, but the added trips do not account for the
townhomes or other parcels that have not yet been approved for construction. Therefore,

   development, without the townhome subdivision.

   3.2 FUTURE STUDY AREA IMPROVEMENTS
   Improvements associated with the planned Town of Cary Walnut Street Widening project
   were included in all future year analyses. These improvements are discussed below:

   Town of Cary Walnut Street Widening  Town of Cary plans to add a northbound through-lane
   from Dillard Drive to the US 1/64 interchange. With the completion of this widening and
   the recently completed interchange enhancements, Walnut Street will become a six-lane,
   median-divided road from Tryon Road to Donaldson Drive. The construction was
   tentatively set to begin in Spring 2008 and end in Fall 2008. As a result of this widening, the
   northbound continuous right-turn lane at the Walnut Street and Dillard Drive intersection
   will become a shared through/right-turn lane. This additional capacity along Walnut Street
   was assumed in all future year analyses.

   SE Area Plan, Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan - First adopted in 1998, the SE Area Plan
   is designed to guide land uses and transportation in the area south of US 1&64, north of SE
   Cary Parkway and west of Holly Springs Road and Jones Franklin Road. The project is to
   reexamine The Town's land use vision for the area in light of its growth and the
   accompanying traffic impacts and to evaluate whether or not there are better alternatives for
   the development or redevelopment of the remainder of this area. As shown in Appendix D,
   the SE Area Plan recommends the realignment of Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia Road
   to allow Jones Franklin Road to be the major through movement, resulting in a stop-
   controlled Macedonia Road approach. This realignment is accounted for in all future year
   scenarios. Additionally, the Plan shows Jones Franklin Road as ultimately being a 4-lane
   facility; however, because of the short project timeline, this improvement was not
   incorporated into the future year scenarios.




                                                                16
3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday Saturday mid-
day and weekday P.M. peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway
Capacity Software (HCS+). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as
part of the future year analysis. A summary of the findings for the Background (2010)
scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 8 below and the full Synchro/HCS output can
be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2010) analysis, the overall traffic operations will worsen slightly at
most study area intersections. However, the addition of background traffic will not result in
a significant traffic performance degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable
LOS) at any study area intersections. However, the westbound stop-controlled approach of
Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia Road operates at a LOS F during the Weekday P.M. peak
hour. Table 8 summarizes the LOS results for the Background (2010) analysis.

           4.0     BUILD ANALYSIS
           The proposed project is to consist of 105 townhomes and is located within the Base
           Transportation Zone (as defined in the Town of Cary Ordinance 05-009). The project is
           scheduled for completion in 2010. This report analyzes the potential traffic impacts of the
           proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

           Vehicular access to the proposed development is proposed via one full access driveway on
           Crossroads Manor Court. In addition, the proposed development has indirect access to
           Centrum Plaza, Dillard Drive and Tryon Road through interconnection with adjoining tracts
           (Figure 2).

           4.1 TRIP GENERATION
           Trip generation for the proposed Tryon Village Subdivision was based on the corresponding
           trip generation codes included in ITE Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition. Table 9 summarizes
           the assumed trip generation for the development during typical Saturday mid-day and
           weekday P.M. peak hours.

           4.2 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION AND ASSIGNMENT
           The site trips for the proposed Tryon Village Subdivision townhome development were
           distributed based on existing traffic patterns and future land use patterns, generally as
           follows:
                  30% along Walnut Street to the north
                  5% along Dillard Drive to the west
                  15% along Dillard Drive to the east
                  10% along Jones Franklin Road to the northeast
                  5% along Tryon Road to the west
                  10% along Tryon Road to the east
                  15% along Walnut Street/Holly Springs Road to the south
                  10% to Centrum Plaza, Dillard Drive and Tryon Road through interconnection with
                   adjoining tracts

           The site trip distribution percentages for the development are shown in more detail in Figure
           7 and the resulting site trips are shown in Figure 8.




                                                              21
4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2010) analysis scenario includes the background traffic as described in Section 3.0
of this report as well as site generated trips from the proposed development as described
previously. Figure 9 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2010)
scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical Saturday mid-day and
weekday P.M. peak hour using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 6 and Highway Capacity
Software (HCS+). Signal cycle lengths and splits were optimized within Synchro as part of the
future year analysis. Table 10 summarizes the findings of the LOS analysis and Appendix B
contains the full Synchro/HCS reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 10 on page 26, the addition of site trips will not result in any level of
service degradation at any study intersections, despite slight increases in traffic delay.
However, the westbound stop-controlled approach of Jones Franklin Road at Macedonia
Road continues to operate at a LOS F during the Weekday P.M. peak hour.

The newly constructed site access driveway for the proposed development is projected to
operate at acceptable levels during both the Saturday Mid-day and Weekday P.M. peak hours
with the existing roundabout configuration. However, the analysis projects an eastbound
queue that is longer than the existing storage length. This spillback has the potential to
hinder operations at the roundabout.

5.0    FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
5.1 ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
The analyses indicate that the addition of trips generated by the proposed development will
not cause any significant traffic degradation (i.e., from acceptable LOS to unacceptable LOS)
on the roadway network within the study area. However, the following roadway
improvements are recommended to ensure safety and mobility at all site driveways:

Jones Franklin Road and Macedonia Road
The analysis indicates that this location will operate at a LOS F during the Background and
Build (2010) Weekday P.M. peak hour. This intersection has been identified in past reports
as a location that is projected to operate at failing levels in future years. Therefore, the
following roadway improvement is recommended at this location:
      Relocate the stop controlled approach to the Macedonia Road approach; realign the
       intersection in accordance with the Southeast Area Plan.
With this improvement completed, the new stop-controlled eastbound Macedonia Road
approach will operate at a LOS C during the Build (2010) Weekday P.M. peak hour.

Walnut Street and Macedonia Road/Crossroads Manor Court
The analysis indicates that this location will operate acceptably during both peak hours
analyzed. However, a queue analysis for the eastbound approach (Crossroads Manor Court)
indicates that the projected queue length for this approach has the potential to exceed the
existing storage length for the exclusive left-turn lane, which would hinder traffic operations
at the roundabout. The following roadway improvements are therefore recommended:
      Restripe the eastbound approach to accommodate dual left-turn lanes and a shared
       through/right-turn lane.
      Restripe the remaining approaches to match the existing signal plan for this location,
       including an exclusive right-turn lane and shared through/left-turn lane on the
       westbound approach and skip lines through the intersection to guide drivers through
       the skewed geometry.
      Update the existing signal and timing plans to reflect the proposed restriping on the
       eastbound approach. The improved phasing would include a protected left-turn
       phase for the eastbound approach, while the westbound left-turn approach would
       remain permitted only, with the westbound right-turn lane still allowed as an
       overlapping phase.
With this improvement in place, operations will remain at LOS B during both peak hours,
but the queue length for the eastbound left-turn lane is reduced to a length that can be
contained within the provided storage length.

Crossroads Manor Court and Macedonia Lake Drive/Site Access
Analysis indicates that this intersection will operate acceptably under the Build (2010)
conditions with the existing geometry at the roundabout. Therefore, no roadway
improvements are recommended at this location.

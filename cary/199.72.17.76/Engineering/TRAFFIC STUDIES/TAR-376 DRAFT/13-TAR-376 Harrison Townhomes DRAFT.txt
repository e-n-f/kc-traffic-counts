Project Background
                                           A residential development is being proposed between N Harrison Avenue and
                                           Sudbury Drive, just north of the Harrison Pointe Drive Extension in Cary, NC
                                           (Figure 1). The development is expected to be complete by 2015 and consists of the
                                           following land use:
                                                 111 Townhomes

                                           The parcel is currently zoned for office with 25% maximum of commercial. The
                                           proposed zoning would be to allow for townhome uses. Note that this traffic study
                                           is prepared for the rezoning application and assumes the above land use as the worst
                                           case for trip generation purposes.

                                           Vehicular access to the development is proposed via two driveways ­ one full access
                                           along Sudbury Drive and one full access along Harrison Pointe Drive Extension
                                           (Figure 2). In addition, the development will construct the Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension from Sudbury Drive, as a stop-controlled intersection, to N Harrison
                                           Avenue, forming the fourth leg of the N Harrison Avenue and Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           signalized intersection.

                                           The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study
                                           area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
                                                 N Harrison Avenue and Dynasty Drive (signalized)
                                                 N Harrison Avenue and Harrison Pointe Drive (signalized)
                                                 N Harrison Avenue and NW Maynard Road (signalized)
                                                 NW Maynard Road and Sudbury Drive/Northwoods Drive (unsignalized)
                                                 NW Maynard Road and Gregory Drive (signalized)
                                                 W Dynasty Drive and Sudbury Drive (unsignalized)
                                                 Sudbury Drive and Gorecki Place/Access #1 (unsignalized)
                                                 Harrison Pointe Drive Extension and Access #2 (future unsignalized)
                                                 Harrison Pointe Drive Extension and Sudbury Drive (future unsignalized)

                                           Analysis was performed under three scenarios: Existing (2013), Background (2015),
                                           and Build (2015) conditions. The Existing (2013) scenario includes AM and PM peak
                                           hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in May 2013. The
                                           Background (2015) scenario includes existing traffic with three approved

                                           developments and projected annual growth. The Build (2015) scenario includes
                                           Background (2015) volumes with the addition of site trips generated by the proposed
                                           development and planned roadway geometrics.



Existing (2013) Conditions
                                           Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and
                                           intersection turning movement counts.

                                           As reported in the Summary Level of Service (LOS) table on page vi, all of signalized
                                           intersections and unsignalized approaches in the study area are currently operating
                                           at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours.

                                           As for transit operations, C-Tran provides multiple routes along the study area
                                           roadways, with Route 3 serving N Harrison Avenue and Routes 1 and 2 serving
                                           NW/NE Maynard Road. In addition, Triangle Transit provides service via Route 301
                                           which runs along N Harrison Avenue.



Background (2015) Conditions
                                           In the Background (2015) scenario, an annual growth rate of two percent (2%) was
                                           applied to the existing traffic to account for the normal growth between the base year
                                           (2013) and the build year (2015). Furthermore, there are three (3) approved
                                           developments in the vicinity projected to be constructed prior to, or at the same time
                                           as the build-out of the proposed development. Site traffic associated with these
                                           approved developments was individually included in the Background (2015)
                                           analysis.

                                           Based on the Background (2015) analysis, the study area intersections are projected to
                                           continue operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours.
                                           In fact, two signalized intersections are projected to operate better in the Background
                                           (2015) scenario when compared to the Existing (2013) scenario, due to optimized
                                           signal timings.



Trip Generation and Assignment
                                           The development is proposed to consist of the following land use:
                                                 111 Townhomes

                                           Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
                                           generation code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and the
                                           suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.




P:\38312.11 13_TAR376 Harrison Town\reports\DRAFT Report.docx   ii   Executive Summary
                                           As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 704 daily site trips
                                           with 56 trips (10 entering, 46 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 65 trips (44
                                           entering, 21 exiting) in the PM peak hour. The generated site trips were distributed
                                           in accordance with the existing turning movement counts and land uses.



Build (2015) Conditions
                                           The Build (2015) conditions account for both the Background (2015) traffic and the
                                           site traffic generated by the proposed development. In addition, traffic diversion due
                                           to the construction of Harrison Pointe Extension was estimated based on adjacent
                                           intersection turning movement volumes and assumed diversion percentages.

                                           As shown on the Summary LOS table on page vi, the addition of site trips and traffic
                                           diversion will lead to traffic delay increases at several study area intersections.
                                           However, all the study area intersections are projected to continue operating at
                                           acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours. One signalized
                                           intersection is actually projected to experience traffic delay decreases due to traffic
                                           diversion with the new roadway connection. In addition, both access points to the
                                           site, as well as the Harrison Pointe Extension at N Harrison Avenue and Sudbury
                                           Drive intersections are projected to operate acceptably during the AM and PM peak
                                           hour, based on the planned geometrics.



Roadway Improvement Recommendations
                                           As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed rezoning is projected to
                                           have minimal impact on the traffic operations of the surrounding roadway network
                                           and intersections. The following roadway improvements are recommended based
                                           on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP), the Town of
                                           Cary's transportation adequacy ordinance, and NCDOT requirements.

                                           Harrison Pointe Drive Extension
                                           In conjunction with the construction of the proposed townhome development,
                                           Harrison Pointe Drive Extension will be constructed, connecting N Harrison Avenue
                                           to Sudbury Drive, and providing access to the proposed development. Per the site
                                           plan, the Harrison Pointe Drive Extension is expected to be a 2-lane cross-section,
                                           within a 70-foot right-of-way. At the western terminus, Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension will tie into Sudbury Drive as a stop-controlled approach, forming a three-
                                           leg unsignalized intersection. At the eastern terminus, Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension will form the fourth leg of the signalized N Harrison Avenue and Harrison
                                           Pointe Drive intersection. Therefore, the following is recommended for Harrison
                                           Pointe Drive Extension:

                                                           Construct Harrison Pointe Drive Extension based on the design control and
                                                           cross-section requirements included in the Town of Cary Engineering
                                                           Standard Specifications and Details.

                                           Frontage Widening
                                           The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the
                                           frontage of their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive
                                           Transportation Plan. The proposed development will front Sudbury Drive and N
                                           Harrison Avenue in addition to the newly constructed Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension. Sudbury Drive is planned to be a 2-lane residential collector avenue
                                           within 58' of right-of-way, and N Harrison Avenue is planned to be a 4-lane median-
                                           divided major thoroughfare within 100' of right-of-way. The existing cross-sections
                                           of Sudbury Drive and N Harrison Avenue along the subject property frontage have
                                           already satisfied the ultimate cross-section requirements; therefore, no further
                                           widening is recommended.

                                           N Harrison Avenue and Harrison Pointe Extension (signalized)
                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location to accommodate the Harrison Pointe
                                           Drive Extension:
                                                 Construct the eastbound Harrison Pointe Drive Extension approach to
                                                     provide one departure lane and two approaching lanes including a shared
                                                     thru/left-turn lane and an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of
                                                     full storage and appropriate taper.
                                                 Modify the signal phasing and timings to accommodate the geometric
                                                     improvements.

                                           Sudbury Drive and Harrison Pointe Extension (unsignalized)
                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location to accommodate the Harrison Pointe
                                           Drive Extension:
                                                 Construct the westbound Harrison Pointe Drive Extension approach to
                                                     provide one approach lane and one departure lane.

                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location to accommodate the proposed
                                           development's driveway:
                                                 Construct Access #1 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

                                           Harrison Pointe Drive Extension and Access #2 (unsignalized)
                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location:
                                                 Construct Access #2 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

                                           The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of
                                           service under both the Background (2015) and Build (2015) conditions. Traffic
                                           analysis indicates that sufficient storage length has been provided at all turn lanes at
                                           the study intersections. Therefore, no further improvements are recommended.

                                                                                               Introduction


                                           A residential development is being proposed between N Harrison Avenue and
                                           Sudbury Drive, just north of the Harrison Pointe Drive Extension in Cary, NC
                                           (Figure 1). The development is expected to be complete by 2015 and consist of the
                                           following land use:
                                                 111 Townhomes

                                           The parcel is currently zoned for office with 25% maximum of commercial. The
                                           proposed zoning would be to allow townhome uses. Note that this traffic study is
                                           prepared for the rezoning application and assumes the above land use as the worst
                                           case for trip generation purposes.

                                           Vehicular access to the development is proposed via two driveways ­ one full access
                                           along Sudbury Drive and one full access along Harrison Pointe Drive Extension
                                           (Figure 2). In addition, the development will construct the Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension from Sudbury Drive, as a stop-controlled intersection, to N Harrison
                                           Avenue, forming the fourth leg of the N Harrison Avenue and Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           signalized intersection.

                                           The following intersections meet the Town's requirements for inclusion in the study
                                           area and were analyzed for existing and future conditions, where applicable:
                                                 N Harrison Avenue and Dynasty Drive (signalized)
                                                 N Harrison Avenue and Harrison Pointe Drive (signalized)

                                                 NW Maynard Road and Gregory Drive (signalized)
                                                 W Dynasty Drive and Sudbury Drive (unsignalized)
                                                 Sudbury Drive and Gorecki Place/Access #1 (unsignalized)
                                                 Harrison Pointe Drive Extension and Access #2 (future unsignalized)
                                                 Harrison Pointe Drive Extension and Sudbury Drive (future unsignalized)

                                           VHB Engineering NC, P.C. was retained by the Town of Cary to analyze the
                                           potential traffic impacts of the proposed development and to identify any necessary
                                           roadway improvements. This Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) summarizes trip
                                           generation, distribution, traffic assignment, and traffic analyses for the proposed
                                           development.

Level of Service Criteria
                                           Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection
                                           geometrics and traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given
                                           turning volumes. Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average
                                           control delay experienced by vehicles traveling through the intersection during the
                                           peak hour. Control delay represents the portion of total delay attributed to traffic
                                           control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs). Table 2 provides a general description of
                                           various levels of service categories and delay ranges.

                                           The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone"
                                           as defined in the Town of Cary Land Development Ordinance (LDO). Level of
                                           service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based on an analysis of the average peak hour
                                           with LOS D considered acceptable for both signalized intersections and unsignalized
                                           approaches. For signalized intersections, when the background analysis yields a
                                           level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall intersection delay is allowed
                                           under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where the stop-controlled
                                           approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the installation of a traffic
                                           signal shall only be required when the intersection meets required warrants for a
                                           signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the surrounding
                                           roadway system.

Level of Service Analysis
                                           Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                                           and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing
                                           (2013) scenario analysis utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the Town
                                           of Cary, which are included in Appendix B. A summary of the findings for the
                                           Existing (2013) scenario LOS analysis can be found in Table 3 and the full
                                           Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix C.

Background Growth and Development
                                           Based on a review of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) collected by
                                           NCDOT in the area, a two-percent (2%) growth rate was applied to the study area
                                           roadways intersections. In addition, three (3) approved developments in the vicinity
                                           are expected to be completed prior to, or at the same time as the build-out of the
                                           proposed development. Therefore, traffic generated from those approved or planned
                                           project was individually included, partially or wholly, in the Background (2015)
                                           scenario, where appropriate. These projects include:

                                           Fifth Third Bank (10-TAR-309A): Located in the Harrison Pointe Shopping Center, this
                                           development was planned to consist of a 2,885-square foot bank (3 drive-thru lanes)
                                           and be constructed by 2011. A traffic analysis report was prepared by HNTB and
                                           submitted to the Town in November 2010. As detailed in the report, the
                                           development is projected to generate 418 daily trips, 28 AM peak hour trips (16
                                           entering, 12 exiting) and 82 PM peak hour trips (40 entering, 42 exiting). These trips
                                           were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed distribution
                                           patterns in the report. Field visits indicate that this development has not been
                                           constructed; therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with the Fifth Third Bank
                                           development was included in the Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-1 depicts the
                                           assigned trips.

                                           RBC Bank at Harrison Pointe (11-TAR-324): Located in the Harrison Pointe Shopping
                                           Center, this development was planned to consist of 3,475-square foot bank (3 drive-
                                           thru lanes) and be constructed by 2012. A traffic analysis report was prepared by
                                           HNTB and submitted to the town in October 2011. As detailed in the report, the
                                           development is projected to generate 558 daily trips, 38 AM peak hour trips (22
                                           entering, 16 exiting) and 110 PM peak hour trips (54 entering, 56 exiting). These trips
                                           were distributed to the study area intersections based on the assumed distribution
                                           patterns in the report. Field visits indicate that this development has not been
                                           constructed; therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with the RBC Bank at Harrison
                                           Pointe development was included in the Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-2
                                           depicts the assigned trips.

                                           Meridian Apartments at Harrison Pointe (11-TAR-329): Located adjacent to the
                                           Harrison Pointe Shopping Center, this development is to consist of a 248-dwelling
                                           unit apartment complex and be constructed by 2013. A traffic analysis report was
                                           prepared by HNTB and submitted to the Town in July 2011. As detailed in the
                                           report, the development is projected to generate 1,626 daily site trips, 125 AM peak
                                           hour trips (25 entering, 100 exiting) and 154 PM peak hour trips (100 entering, 54
                                           exiting). These trips were distributed to the study area intersections based on the
                                           assumed distribution patterns in the report.        Field visits indicate that this
                                           development has not been constructed; therefore, 100% of the traffic associated with
                                           the Meridian Apartments at Harrison Pointe development was included in the
                                           Background (2015) analysis. Figure D-3 depicts the assigned trips.

                                           The total trips from the approved developments included in the Background (2015)
                                           analysis are included in Figure D-4 in Appendix D. The Background (2015) peak
                                           hour trips are shown in Figure 5.




Level of Service Analysis
                                           Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                                           and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. Signal cycle
                                           lengths and splits were optimized with Synchro as part of the future year analysis. A
                                           summary of the findings for the Background (2015) scenario LOS analysis can be
                                           found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix C.

                                           As reported in Table 4, the study area intersections are projected to continue
                                           operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours. In fact,
                                           two signalized intersections are projected to operate better in the Background (2015)
                                           scenario when compared to the Existing (2013) scenario, due to optimized signal
                                           timings.

                                           A residential development is being proposed between N Harrison Avenue and
                                           Sudbury Drive, just north of the Harrison Pointe Drive Extension in Cary, NC
                                           (Figure 1).



Trip Generation
                                           The development is proposed to consist of the following land use:
                                                 111 Townhomes

                                           Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip
                                           generation code included in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, 9th Edition, and the
                                           suggested method of calculation in the NCDOT's "Rate vs. Equation" Spreadsheet.

                                           As a result, the proposed development is projected to generate 704 daily site trips
                                           with 56 trips (10 entering, 46 exiting) occurring in the AM peak hour and 65 trips (44
                                           entering, 21 exiting) in the PM peak hour. The generated site trips were distributed
                                           in accordance with the existing turning movement counts and land uses.

                                           Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for
                                           typical weekday AM and PM peak hours.

Level of Service Analysis
                                           The Build (2015) analysis scenario includes the Background (2015) traffic as well as
                                           site generated trips from the proposed development as described previously. In
                                           addition, with the construction of the Harris Pointe Drive Extension, traffic
                                           diversions are projected to occur on several study area roadways. The specific
                                           diversions are shown in Figure 8, with details included in Appendix E. Figure 9
                                           depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Build (2015) scenario analysis.

                                           Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM
                                           and PM peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7 and Highway
                                           Capacity Software (HCS 2010). Signal cycles lengths and splits were optimized within
                                           Synchro/SimTraffic as part of the build year analysis. Table 6 summarizes the findings
                                           of the LOS analysis and Appendix C contains the full Synchro/HCS reports of the
                                           analyses.

                                           As reported in Table 6, all the study area intersections are projected to continue
                                           operating at acceptable levels of service during the AM and PM peak hours. One
                                           signalized intersection is actually projected to experience traffic delay decreases due
                                           to traffic diversion with the new roadway connection. In addition, both access points
                                           to the site, as well as the Harrison Pointe Extension at N Harrison Avenue and
                                           Sudbury Drive intersections are projected to operate acceptably during the AM and
                                           PM peak hour, based on the planned geometrics.

                                           As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed rezoning is projected to
                                           have minimal impact on the traffic operations of the surrounding roadway network
                                           and intersections. The following roadway improvements are recommended based
                                           on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP), the Town of
                                           Cary's transportation adequacy ordinance, and NCDOT requirements.

                                           Harrison Pointe Drive Extension
                                           In conjunction with the construction of the proposed townhome development,
                                           Harrison Pointe Drive Extension will be constructed, connecting N Harrison Avenue
                                           to Sudbury Drive, and providing access to the proposed development. Per the site
                                           plan, the Harrison Pointe Drive Extension is expected to be a 2-lane cross-section,
                                           within a 70-foot right-of-way. At the western terminus, Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension will tie into Sudbury Drive as a stop-controlled approach, forming a three-
                                           leg unsignalized intersection. At the eastern terminus, Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension will form the fourth leg of the signalized N Harrison Avenue and Harrison
                                           Pointe Drive intersection. Therefore, the following is recommended for Harrison
                                           Pointe Drive Extension:
                                                 Construct Harrison Pointe Drive Extension based on the design control and
                                                    cross-section requirements included in the Town of Cary Engineering
                                                    Standard Specifications and Details.

                                           Frontage Widening
                                           The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the
                                           frontage of their property to the standards specified in the Cary Comprehensive
                                           Transportation Plan. The proposed development will front Sudbury Drive and N
                                           Harrison Avenue in addition to the newly constructed Harrison Pointe Drive
                                           Extension. Sudbury Drive is planned to be a 2-lane residential collector avenue
                                           within 58' of right-of-way, and N Harrison Avenue is planned to be a 4-lane median-
                                           divided major thoroughfare within 100' of right-of-way. The existing cross-sections
                                           of Sudbury Drive and N Harrison Avenue along the subject property frontage have
                                           already satisfied the ultimate cross-section requirements; therefore, no further
                                           widening is recommended.

                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location to accommodate the Harrison Pointe
                                           Drive Extension:
                                                 Construct the eastbound Harrison Pointe Drive Extension approach to
                                                     provide one departure lane and two approaching lanes including a shared
                                                     thru/left-turn lane and an exclusive right-turn lane with at least 100 feet of
                                                     full storage and appropriate taper.
                                                 Modify the signal phasing and timings to accommodate the geometric
                                                     improvements.

                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location to accommodate the Harrison Pointe
                                           Drive Extension:
                                                 Construct the westbound Harrison Pointe Drive Extension approach to
                                                     provide one approach lane and one departure lane.

                                           Sudbury Drive and Gorecki Place/Access #1 (unsignalized)
                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location to accommodate the proposed
                                           development's driveway:
                                                 Construct Access #1 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

                                           Harrison Pointe Drive Extension and Access #2 (unsignalized)
                                           The traffic analysis indicates that this intersection is projected to operate acceptably
                                           during the AM and PM peak hours. Therefore, the following intersection
                                           configuration is recommended at this location:
                                                 Construct Access #2 to provide one egress lane and one ingress lane.

                                           The rest of the study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable levels of
                                           service under both the Background (2015) and Build (2015) conditions. Traffic
                                           analysis indicates that sufficient storage length has been provided at all turn lanes at
                                           the study intersections. Therefore, no further improvements are recommended.

                                           A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 7, and the resulting
                                           future lane configurations and traffic control for 2015 are shown in Figure 10.

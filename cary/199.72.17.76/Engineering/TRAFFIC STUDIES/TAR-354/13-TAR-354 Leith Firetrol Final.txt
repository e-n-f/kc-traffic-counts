EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Background
The Town of Cary has received a request from MLC Automotive, LLC to provide a traffic
analysis report (13-TAR-354) for the proposed Leith Autopark North Firetrol Site (Leith
Firetrol), a new automobile dealership development located in the southwest corner of the
Old Raleigh Road and Mackenan Drive intersection in southern Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development is projected to be completed by 2014. Currently, there is an existing 13,558
square-foot office and a 30,846 square-foot warehouse. After expansion, the proposed
development is projected to consist of the following land uses:
       Automobile Dealership ­ 68,946 square feet (sf)
              o Warehouse ­ 30,846 sf (existing)
              o Service Area ­ 6,850 sf
              o Sales Area ­ 31,250 sf

Per the site plan (Figure 2), access to the development is proposed via two access points, as
follows:
      Access #1 ­ existing full access along Mackenan Drive, approximately 425 feet south
        of Old Raleigh Road.
      Access #2 ­ full access along Old Raleigh Road, approximately 400 feet west of
        Mackenan Drive.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" as defined in
the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Based on the Town of Cary LDO requirements, the following intersections meet the Town's
requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future
conditions, where applicable:
      US 64 Westbound and US 1 SB Off-Ramp ­ signalized
      US 64 Eastbound and US 1 SB On-Ramp ­ signalized
      US 64 and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive ­ signalized
      US 64 and Gregson Drive ­ signalized
      US 64 and Mackenan Drive/Chalon Drive ­ signalized
      US 64 and Lake Pine Drive ­ signalized*
      Mackenan Drive and Old Raleigh Road ­ signalized
      Mackenan Drive and Access #1 ­ existing, unsignalized
      Old Raleigh Road and Access #2 ­ future, unsignalized
*Intersection partially within Cary ETJ

Analysis was performed under four scenarios: Existing (2013), Background (2014), Build
(2014), and a Build (2014) with Improvements scenario. The Existing (2013) scenario
includes AM and PM peak hour analysis based on turning movement count data collected in
January 2013. The Background (2014) scenario includes existing traffic with projected
annual growth. The Build (2014) scenario includes Background (2014) volumes with the

                                              i
addition of net new site trips generated by the proposed development. Additionally, future
conditions with the proposed mitigation improvements in place were analyzed in a Build
(2014) with Improvements scenario.

Existing (2013) Conditions
Existing analyses were conducted based on current roadway geometrics and intersection
turning movement counts. For the signalized intersections, traffic signal plans and timings
were obtained from Town of Cary staff.

As shown in the summary level of service (LOS) table on page v, two signalized intersections
are currently operating at failing levels of service (LOS E or F). Specifically, the signalized
US 64 and Lake Pine Drive intersection is operating at LOS E during both the AM and PM
peak hours, and the signalized US 64 and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive
intersection is operating at LOS F in the PM peak hour. The remaining signalized
intersections and unsignalized approaches are operating at acceptable levels of service during
both the AM and PM peak hours.

Background (2014) Conditions
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed varying traffic growth
between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. To provide a conservative analysis, an annual
growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient
traffic growth between the base year (2013) and the build year (2014).

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, signal optimization will improve the two failing
intersections on US 64 at Lake Pine Drive and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive to
operate at better levels of service with less traffic delay despite background traffic increases.
However, both intersections are still projected to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour.
The rest of the signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to remain
operating at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

Trip Generation and Assignment
The proposed Leith Firetrol development consists of 68,946 square feet of automobile
dealership. Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding
trip generation code included in ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition.

In total, the proposed development is projected to generate 2,227 external daily trips with
132 trips occurring in the AM peak hour (99 entering, 33 exiting) and 155 trips occurring in
the PM peak hour trips (62 entering, 93 exiting).

The generated trips were distributed in accordance with existing and future traffic patterns
and surrounding land uses in the study area.

Build (2014) Conditions
The Build (2014) conditions account for Background (2014) traffic and site traffic generated
by the proposed development. Geometrically, the site plan proposes to widen Old Raleigh
Road across the site frontage. As a result, an exclusive left-turn lane will be provided on the

                                               ii
eastbound approach of Old Raleigh Road at Mackenan Drive and on the westbound
approach of Old Raleigh Road at Site Access #2.

As shown in the summary LOS table on page v, the addition of site trips will incur delay
increases at intersections across the study area, including the two already-failing intersections
in the Background (2014) conditions. Specifically, the signalized US 64 and Lake Pine Drive
intersection is project to continue to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay
increase of 1.3 seconds per vehicle. The signaled US 64 and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh
South Drive is projected to remain operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay
increase of 5.5 seconds per vehicle. In addition, the stop-controlled northbound approach
of Mackenan Drive at Old Raleigh Road is projected to decline to operate at LOS E in the
PM peak hour. Both site accesses are projected to operate acceptably with the proposed
geometrics and traffic control as shown on the site plan.

Roadway Improvement Recommendations
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have impact on traffic operations at three intersections within the study area. The following
roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP), Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO), and NCDOT
requirements:
Frontage Widening along Old Raleigh Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). For the section of Old Raleigh Road and Mackenan Drive in
front of the development, the CTP dictates a two-lane collector avenue cross-section with
two travel lanes, with or without a landscaped median, and bike lanes and pedestrian
sidewalks on both sides within 70 or 58 feet of right-of-way. Under Existing (2013)
conditions, Mackenan Drive is a two-lane roadway with sidewalks on both sides, meeting the
width requirement of alternative collector avenue cross-section in CTP. Old Raleigh Road is
currently a two-lane road with sidewalk on the north side opposite the site. Therefore, the
following improvements, as shown on the site plan, are required to meet the CTP standards:
        Widen the section of Old Raleigh Road along the property frontage to achieve the
        ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP.

US 64 and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, this intersection will operate at
a LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 5.5 seconds per vehicle. Therefore,
the following improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
APFO requirements:
        Restripe the northbound Edinburgh South Drive approach to provide an all-purpose
        lane and an exclusive right-turn lane.
        Modify traffic signal if necessary to accommodate the new lane geometrics.
The proposed restriping is expected to improve this intersection to better-than-background
conditions, meeting the APFO requirements. In the long term, dual right-turn lanes or a
free flowing right-turn lane on the northbound approach of Edinburgh South Drive should


                                                iii
be considered to improve this intersection to acceptable levels of service (i.e., LOS D or
better).

US 64 and Lake Pine Drive (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, this intersection will continue to
operate at a LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 1.3 seconds per vehicle.
Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the
Town of Cary APFO requirements:
        Restripe the northbound Lake Pine Drive approach to provide two exclusive left-
        turn lanes, a thru lane, and a shared thru/right-turn lane.
        Widen the northbound Lake Pine Drive approach to extend the shared thru/right-
        turn lane with at least 250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
        Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate the new lane geometrics.
The proposed restriping is expected to improve this intersection to better-than-background
conditions, meeting the APFO requirements. In the long term, dual left-turn lanes on the
eastbound or westbound approach of US 64 should be considered to improve this
intersection to acceptable levels of service.

Old Raleigh Road and Mackenan Drive (existing unsignalized with four-way stop control)
The site plan proposes to install an exclusive left-turn lane on the eastbound approach of
Old Raleigh Road at this intersection. Traffic analyses indicate that with the planned lane
geometrics and traffic control, this intersection will operate at a LOS E on its northbound
approach in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following roadway improvements are
recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
        Restripe the required widening along Old Raleigh Road along property frontage to
        provide for an exclusive left-turn lane on the eastbound approach with at least 125
        feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
        Widen the northbound approach of Mackenan Drive to provide for an exclusive left-
        turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
Alternatively, a traffic signal or roundabout, if warranted, can be installed to meet the APFO
requirements.

Old Raleigh Road and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #2 as a full movement access approximately
400 feet west of Mackenan Drive. The following roadway improvements and driveway
configurations per the site plan are recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
        Construct Site Access #2 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and
        two outbound lanes;
        Restripe the required widening along Old Raleigh Road to provide for an exclusive
        left-turn lane on the westbound approach with at least 100 feet of storage length and
        appropriate taper.

The rest of the study intersections and site accesses are projected to operate at acceptable
levels of service under both the Background (2014) and Build (2014) conditions. Therefore,
no further improvements are recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Town of Cary has received a request from MLC Automotive, LLC to provide a traffic
analysis report (13-TAR-354) for the proposed Leith Autopark North Firetrol Site (Leith
Firetrol), a new automobile dealership development located in the southwest corner of the
Old Raleigh Road and Mackenan Drive intersection in southern Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development is projected to be completed by 2014. Currently, there is an existing 13,558
square-foot office and a 30,846 square-foot warehouse. After expansion, the proposed
development is projected to consist of the following land uses:
       Automobile Dealership ­ 68,946 square feet (sf)
              o Warehouse ­ 30,846 sf (existing)
              o Service Area ­ 6,850 sf
              o Sales Area ­ 31,250 sf

Per the site plan (Figure 2), access to the development is proposed via two access points, as
follows:
      Access #1 ­ existing full access along Mackenan Drive, approximately 425 feet south
        of Old Raleigh Road.
      Access #2 ­ full access along Old Raleigh Road, approximately 400 feet west of
        Mackenan Drive.

The property is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Transportation Zone" as defined in
the Town of Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO) Chapter 3.23, requiring a
Transportation Analysis Report (TAR) to be completed. This report analyzes the potential
traffic impact of the proposed development on the adjacent roadways.

Based on the Town of Cary LDO requirements, the following intersections meet the Town's
requirements for inclusion in the study area and were analyzed for existing and future
conditions, where applicable:
      US 64 Westbound and US 1 SB Off-Ramp ­ signalized
      US 64 Eastbound and US 1 SB On-Ramp ­ signalized
      US 64 and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive ­ signalized
      US 64 and Gregson Drive ­ signalized

  Traffic volume balancing was applied along US 64.           The existing peak hour turning
  movement volumes are shown in Figure 4.

  2.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE CRITERIA
  Peak hour level of service (LOS) measures the adequacy of the intersection geometrics and
  traffic controls of a particular intersection or approach for the given turning volumes.
  Levels of service range from A through F, based on the average control delay experienced by
  vehicles traveling through the intersection during the peak hour. Control delay represents
  the portion of total delay attributed to traffic control devices (e.g., signals or stop signs).
  Table 2 provides a general description of various levels of service categories and delay
  ranges.

  The planned development is located within the Town of Cary's "Base Benefit Zone" as
  defined in the Town of Cary Land Use Ordinance 3.23, Adequate Public Facilities Planning
  and Development for Roads (APFO). Level of service in the "Base Benefit Zone" is based
  on an analysis of the average peak hour with LOS D considered acceptable for both
  signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches. For signalized intersections, when the


                                                10
background analysis yields a level of service worse than LOS D, no increase in overall
intersection delay is allowed under build conditions. For unsignalized intersections where
the stop-controlled approach is below a LOS D under background conditions, the
installation of a traffic signal shall only be required when the intersection meets required
warrants for a signal, and the new signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the
surrounding roadway system.

          A                Little or no delay          <= 10 sec.             <= 10 sec.
           B              Short traffic delay          10-20 sec.              10-15 sec.
           C             Average traffic delay         20-35 sec.              15-25 sec.
          D                Long traffic delay          35-55 sec.              25-35 sec.
           E            Very long traffic delay        55-80 sec.              35-50 sec.
           F              Unacceptable delay           > 80 sec.                > 50 sec.


2.4 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. The Existing scenario analysis
utilized the existing signal plans and timings from the Town of Cary, which are included in
Appendix C. A summary of the findings for the Existing scenario LOS analysis can be
found in Table 3 and the full Synchro/HCS output can be found in Appendix B.

As reported in Table 3, two signalized intersections are currently operating at failing levels of
service (LOS E or F). Specifically, the signalized US 64 and Lake Pine Drive intersection is
operating at LOS E during both the AM and PM peak hours, and the signalized US 64 and
Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive intersection is operating at LOS F in the PM peak
hour. The remaining signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are operating at
acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

3.0 BACKGROUND (2014) CONDITIONS
3.1 BACKGROUND GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
An analysis of historic Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) showed varying traffic growth
between 2003 and 2011 in the study area. To provide a conservative analysis, an annual
growth rate of two percent (2%) was applied to the existing traffic to account for ambient
traffic growth between the base year (2013) and the build year (2014).

As requested by the Town of Cary, two recent developments, Siemens Expansion and Lord
Corporation, were researched. Field observations indicated that both developments have
already been built-out and occupied; therefore, site trips from them were not included in the
Background (2014) analysis. The Town of Apex was also contacted, and no approved
background projects within the Town of Apex jurisdiction were required to be included.

3.2 BACKGROUND ROADWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
One roadway improvement project, US 64 Corridor Study, is planned in the study area.

US 64 Corridor Study ­ The US 64 Corridor Study was conducted as a joint effort between
the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), Capitol Area Metropolitan
Planning Organization (CAMPO), Town of Apex, Town of Cary, Town of Pittsboro, Wake
County and Chatham County for the segment of US 64 from the US 64/US 64 Business
split on the east side of Pittsboro to the US 1/US 64 interchange in Cary. The goal of the
study was to develop a master plan to preserve and enhance mobility and safety along US 64,
while balancing community access and interests. A Corridor Study Report was prepared by
URS in January 2011.

Based on the report, the master plan includes two distinct components, a short-term plan
and a long-term plan:
    The short-term plan consists of interim strategies to improve mobility, safety and
        pedestrian accessibility at major intersections. Under the short-term plan, Lake Pine
        Drive is planned to consist of a median u-turn crossover, Mackenan Drive/Chalon
        Drive is planned to consist of superstreet with direct major street left-turn with u-
        turn to eastbound US 64 at Autopark Boulevard, and both Gregson Drive and
        Edinburgh Drive are planned to consist of superstreet with direct major street left-
        turn.
    The long-term plan consists of improvements needed to serve the anticipated
        amount of traffic in the year 2035 and later. Under the long term plan, an
        interchange is planned at Lake Pine Drive, and the section of US 64 between Lake
        Pine Drive and US 1 would remain the same as the short-term solution with
        widening to six through lanes on US 64.

The US 64 Corridor Study is in the early planning stage, and construction of improvements
associated with this study is not currently funded. Therefore, the roadway improvements
were not included in this TAR.

3.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Background (2014) analysis scenario includes the Existing (2013) traffic with ambient
traffic growth. Figure 5 depicts the turning movement volumes used in the Background
(2014) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. A summary of the findings for the
Background (2014) scenario LOS analyses can be found in Table 4 and the full Synchro/HCS
output can be found in Appendix B.

Based on the Background (2014) analysis, signal optimization will improve the two failing
intersections on US 64 at Lake Pine Drive and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive to
operate at better levels of service with less traffic delay despite background traffic increases.
However, both intersections are still projected to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour.
The rest of the signalized intersections and unsignalized approaches are projected to remain
operating at acceptable levels of service during both the AM and PM peak hours.

4.0 BUILD (2014) ANALYSIS
The Town of Cary has received a request from MLC Automotive, LLC to provide a traffic
analysis report (13-TAR-354) for the proposed Leith Autopark North Firetrol Site (Leith
Firetrol), a new automobile dealership development located in the southwest corner of the
Old Raleigh Road and Mackenan Drive intersection in southern Cary, NC (Figure 1). The
development is projected to be completed by 2014.

4.1 TRIP GENERATION
Currently, there is an existing 13,558 square-foot office and a 30,846 square-foot warehouse.
After expansion, the proposed development is projected to be completed by 2014 and
consists of the following land uses:
      Automobile Dealership ­ 68,946 square feet (sf)
              o Warehouse ­ 30,846 sf (existing)
              o Service Area ­ 6,850 sf
              o Sales Area ­ 31,250 sf

Trip generation was conducted based on the most appropriate corresponding trip generation
code included in ITE Trip Generation, 9th Edition.

Table 5 summarizes the assumed trip generation for the proposed development for typical
weekday AM and PM peak hours. In total, the proposed development is projected to
generate 2,227 external daily trips with 132 trips occurring in the AM peak hour (99 entering,
33 exiting) and 155 trips occurring in the PM peak hour trips (62 entering, 93 exiting).

4.3 LEVEL OF SERVICE ANALYSIS
The Build (2014) analysis scenario includes the Background (2014) traffic, as well as site
generated trips from the proposed development. Figure 8 depicts the turning movement
volumes used in the Build (2014) scenario analysis.

Intersection levels of service analyses were performed for the typical weekday AM and PM
peak hours using Synchro/SimTraffic Professional Version 7. Table 8 summarizes the findings of
the LOS analysis for Build (2014) analyses and Appendix B contains the full Synchro/HCS
reports of the analyses.

As shown in Table 7, the addition of site trips will incur delay increases at intersections
across the study area, including the two already-failing intersections in the Background (2014)
conditions. Specifically, the signalized US 64 and Lake Pine Drive intersection is project to
continue to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 1.3 seconds per
vehicle. The signaled US 64 and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive is projected to
remain operating at LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 5.5 seconds per
vehicle. In addition, the stop-controlled northbound approach of Mackenan Drive at Old
Raleigh Road is projected to decline to operate at LOS E in the PM peak hour. Both site
accesses are projected to operate acceptably with the proposed geometrics and traffic control
as shown on the site plan.

5.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As indicated in the traffic operations analyses, the proposed development is projected to
have impact on traffic operations at three intersections within the study area. The following
roadway improvements are recommended based on the Town of Cary's Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP), Adequate Public Facility Ordinances (APFO), and NCDOT
requirements:

Frontage Widening along Old Raleigh Road
The Town of Cary requires that new developments widen the roads along the frontage of
their property to the standards specified in the Town of Cary Comprehensive
Transportation Plan (CTP). For the section of Old Raleigh Road and Mackenan Drive in
front of the development, the CTP dictates a two-lane collector avenue cross-section with
two travel lanes, with or without a landscaped median, and bike lanes and pedestrian
sidewalks on both sides within 70 or 58 feet of right-of-way. Under Existing (2013)
conditions, Mackenan Drive is a two-lane roadway with sidewalks on both sides, meeting the
width requirement of alternative collector avenue cross-section in CTP. Old Raleigh Road is
currently a two-lane road with sidewalk on the north side opposite the site. Therefore, the
following improvements, as shown on the site plan, are required to meet the CTP standards:
        Widen the section of Old Raleigh Road along the property frontage to achieve the
        ultimate cross-section as required by the CTP.

US 64 and Edinburgh Drive/Edinburgh South Drive (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, this intersection will operate at
a LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 5.5 seconds per vehicle. Therefore,
the following improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the Town of Cary
APFO requirements:
        Restripe the northbound Edinburgh South Drive approach to provide an all-purpose
        lane and an exclusive right-turn lane.
        Modify traffic signal if necessary to accommodate the new lane geometrics.
The proposed restriping is expected to improve this intersection to better-than-background
conditions, meeting the APFO requirements. In the long term, dual right-turn lanes or a
free flowing right-turn lane on the northbound approach of Edinburgh South Drive should
be considered to improve this intersection to acceptable levels of service (i.e., LOS D or
better).

US 64 and Lake Pine Drive (signalized)
Traffic analyses indicate that with the addition of site traffic, this intersection will continue to
operate at a LOS E in the PM peak hour with a delay increase of 1.3 seconds per vehicle.
Therefore, the following improvements are recommended at this intersection to meet the
Town of Cary APFO requirements:
        Restripe the northbound Lake Pine Drive approach to provide two exclusive left-
        turn lanes, a thru lane, and a shared thru/right-turn lane.
        Widen the northbound Lake Pine Drive approach to extend the shared thru/right-
        turn lane with at least 250 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
        Modify traffic signal at this intersection to accommodate the new lane geometrics.

                                                25
The proposed restriping is expected to improve this intersection to better-than-background
conditions, meeting the APFO requirements. In the long term, dual left-turn lanes on the
eastbound or westbound approach of US 64 should be considered to improve this
intersection to acceptable levels of service.

Old Raleigh Road and Mackenan Drive (existing unsignalized with four-way stop control)
The site plan proposes to install an exclusive left-turn lane on the eastbound approach of
Old Raleigh Road at this intersection. Traffic analyses indicate that with the planned lane
geometrics and traffic control, this intersection will operate at a LOS E on its northbound
approach in the PM peak hour. Therefore, the following roadway improvements are
recommended to meet the Town of Cary APFO requirements:
       Restripe the required widening along Old Raleigh Road along property frontage to
       provide for an exclusive left-turn lane on the eastbound approach with at least 125
       feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
       Widen the northbound approach of Mackenan Drive to provide for an exclusive left-
       turn lane with at least 100 feet of storage length and appropriate taper.
Alternatively, a traffic signal or roundabout, if warranted, can be installed to meet the APFO
requirements.

Old Raleigh Road and Site Access #2 (future unsignalized)
The site plan proposes to construct Site Access #2 as a full movement access approximately
400 feet west of Mackenan Drive. The following roadway improvements and driveway
configurations per the site plan are recommended to improve traffic operations and safety:
       Construct Site Access #2 at the planned location to consist of one inbound lane and
       two outbound lanes;
       Restripe the required widening along Old Raleigh Road to provide for an exclusive
       left-turn lane on the westbound approach with at least 100 feet of storage length and
       appropriate taper.

The rest of the study intersections and site accesses are projected to operate at acceptable
levels of service under both the Background (2014) and Build (2014) conditions. Therefore,
no further improvements are recommended.

A summary of LOS results across scenarios is shown in Table 8, and the resulting future lane
configuration and traffic control for 2014 are depicted in Figure 9.

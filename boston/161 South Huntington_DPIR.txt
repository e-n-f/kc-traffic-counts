General Information
1.0    GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1    Introduction

       BRG 161 South Huntington LLC, an affiliate of Boston Residential Group, LLC (the
       Proponent) proposes to construct a new approximately 193,000 square foot (sf) residential
       development that will be seeking LEED Silver certification at the current site of The Home
       for Little Wanderers (the Project). The Project will create much needed housing and
       concentrates development in an area that has existing infrastructure and excellent access to
       public transportation. The 196-unit Project will enhance an underutilized parcel of land
       close to the Longwood Medical and Academic Area (LMA) with excellent access to
       downtown Boston and other parts of the Boston metropolitan area.

       The Project's massing and design will help tie the neighborhood's varied building stock and
       uses together by respecting the fabric of the neighborhood and the use will add a residential
       presence along South Huntington which will complement the existing uses of this vibrant
       city neighborhood. The Project is a transit-oriented development which will include many
       sustainable design measures as well as provide affordable housing to the neighborhood.

       In a move announced in August, 2011 and anticipated to happen in the fall of 2012, The
       Home for Little Wanderers will relocate its programming and services from its oldest and
       most-well known facility -- the Knight Children's Center -- to a section of its 166-acre site at
       Longview Farm in Walpole that is undergoing $19-million in new construction. The Home
       for Little Wanderers, a 213-year-old nonprofit, has held other programming at other sites,
       including on former farmland in Walpole since 1940.

       The Proponent has an executed purchase and sale agreement with the current owner
       allowing The Home for Little Wanderers to benefit from the sale of the site and relocate its
       services.

       A PNF was submitted on March 27, 2012 and a Scoping Determination was issued on June
       21, 2012, attached in Appendix A. This Draft Project Impact Report (DPIR) is being
       submitted in compliance with the Large Project Review process in compliance with Article
       80 of the Boston Zoning Code

1.3    Legal Information

       1.3.1          Legal Judgments Adverse to the Proposed Project

       The Proponent is not aware of any legal judgments in effect or legal actions pending that
       are adverse to the Project.

       1.3.2          History of Tax Arrears on Property

       The Proponent is not in tax arrears on any property owned within the City of Boston.

       1.3.3          Site Control / Public Easements

       The property is currently owned by The Home for Little Wanderers, Inc. BRG 161 South
       Huntington LLC has the right to purchase the property pursuant to the Purchase and Sale
       Agreement. There are no public easements on the site.

1.4    Project Area

       1.4.1          Project Site

       The Project site is approximately 3.49 acres and is located two miles west of downtown
       Boston in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood near Brookline (see Figure 1-1). The Project site
       is bounded by South Huntington Avenue to the east; the Jamaicaway to the west; the
       Sherrill House at 135 South Huntington Avenue, a five to six story skilled nursing facility to
       the north; and the Goddard House at 201 South Huntington Avenue, a six to seven story
       skilled nursing and rehabilitation center to the south.

       The area has become increasingly popular for working, living, and playing given its close
       proximity to major employment centers, retail areas, and recreational resources. The MBTA
       Heath Street Green Line Subway is one block away for service to downtown Boston and
       points west and the #39 bus stop is nearby. Olmsted Park and Jamaica Pond are
       immediately adjacent offering gardens, athletic fields, trails and boating, the LMA is ½ mile
       away, and the commercial areas of Jamaica Plain, Brookline Village and Hyde Square are
       easily accessible.

       As envisioned, the Project will contribute to the vibrant activity in one of Boston's most
       dynamic mixed-use neighborhoods. The Project will seek LEED Certification through
       USGBC at a minimum of a Silver Level to embrace the natural setting of the Emerald
       Necklace and provide a much anticipated residential face on South Huntington Avenue.

1.5    Public Benefits

       The development at 161 South Huntington Avenue will generate a myriad of public
       benefits for the surrounding neighborhoods and the City of Boston as a whole. These
       public benefits fall into multiple categories, outlined below.

       1.5.1         Financial Benefits

       The Project will result in significant financial benefits to the City of Boston, including:

            Returning the property to the City's tax rolls following 100 years of ownership by a
            tax exempt entity;

            Creating significant additional real estate tax revenues to the City's General Fund
            commencing after Project completion, totaling over $9 million of net new tax
            revenue over the next 20 years;

            Creating approximately 30 affordable housing units or over 15% of all units in
            perpetuity located on-site;

            Creating approximately 225 construction jobs and 10 new permanent, on-site jobs;

            Providing additional customers for retail shops and markets in the neighborhood of
            the Project.

       1.5.2         Community and Urban Design Benefits

       The development of the Project will help to define the image and design quality of the
       Jamaicaway edge of the area, and will enhance the overall urban design quality and public
       realm of the corridor as a whole in the vicinity of the Project. The Project will include
       significant streetscape improvements to the pedestrian realm on both sides of the Project
       site formed by South Huntington Avenue and the Jamaicaway. In addition, the Project will
       achieve a high level of sustainability and offer a significant variety of benefits which are
       further outlined below.

       South Huntington Avenue:

            Extending Jamaica Plain's residential fabric into an area primarily made up of
            institutional uses;

            Creating a high-quality, appealing and consistently designed edge to improve the
            pedestrian environment along the side of South Huntington Avenue;

            Constructing a new concrete sidewalk with handicapped accessible access to main
            lobby entry, opposite the existing pedestrian cross-walk;

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                       Epsilon Associates, Inc.
            Replacing existing damaged fence with new continuous metal fencing integrated
            into new landscape elements;

            Developing new flush decorative paving at primary pedestrian entries;

            Planting new street trees, shrubs and seasonal perennials;

            Improving vehicular entrance to the site, roadway quality,           traffic flow, and
            pedestrian safety;

            Re-grading and reconstructing existing sidewalks to eliminate accessibility issues
            and cross-slope issues; and

            Reducing on-grade parking along South Huntington Avenue from 53 spaces to nine
            spaces and reducing impervious paving. The balance of the parking will be placed
            below the building.

       Jamaicaway:

            Maintaining, repairing and repainting the existing iron fence and brick piers;

            Maintaining and caring for the mature stand of existing oak trees, with infill of
            native shrubs, ground cover, and perennial planting, and stabilizing the eroding
            slope;

            Cooperating with The Emerald Necklace Conservancy, including support for
            programs;

            Setting back structures on the Jamaicaway in excess of the adjacent building
            setbacks; and

            Extending residential fabric of Jamaica Plain.

       1.5.3         Additional Benefits

       In addition to designing the building that will seek a minimum of LEED Silver Certification,
       the Proponent has made a personal commitment to the community by being a financial
       supporter of the Emerald Necklace and ABCD Summer Works program. In doing so, the
       Proponent has pledged as well as demonstrated a commitment to continue as an active
       member of the community.

       Finally, The Home for Little Wander's has long played an important role in the local
       community and New England. Through the sale of its property, the Project will provide the
       non-profit organization with important funding to continue its mission of helping local
       youths and achieve the organization's goal of reorganizing their operations by the fall of
       2012.

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       1.5.4        Workforce Development

       The contractor will encourage an appropriate share of new jobs and construction jobs to be
       filled by Boston residents. In addition, although modest in number, the Proponent pledges
       to consider local companies for the maintenance contracts of the property. A Boston
       Residents Construction Employment Plan will be submitted in accordance with the Boston
       Jobs Policy. The Plan will provide that the proponent will make reasonable good-faith
       efforts to have at least 50 percent of the total employee work hours be performed by Boston
       residents, at least 25 percent of total employee work hours be performed by minorities and
       at least 10 percent of the total employee work hours be performed by women.

       1.5.4.1      Smart Growth/Transit-Oriented Development

       The Project represents the epitome of smart-growth and transit-oriented development by
       concentrating new residential uses in close proximity to major regional rapid transit and bus
       lines that provide easy access to the Project site from all neighborhoods of the City of
       Boston and the City's suburbs. The Project will create many new pedestrian trips every day,
       enlivening the proximate streetscape and providing more foot traffic for local businesses
       and restaurants. The Project will likely eliminate many hours of commuter travel per year
       by residents of the Project who may have lived further away from their workplaces.

       1.5.5        Sustainable Development

       The Proponent is committed to developing a highly sustainable Project. As such,
       sustainability informs every design decision keeping in mind the end goal of seeking at least
       a certification of LEED Silver.

       Enduring and efficient buildings conserve energy and preserve natural resources. The
       Project at 161 South Huntington Avenue is designed to satisfy market demands for efficient,
       urban apartment homes with flexible layouts. Durable materials will be used throughout
       the buildings. The Project embraces the opportunity to positively influence the urban
       environment. Its urban location takes advantage of existing infrastructure while convenient
       access to mass transportation will reduce dependence on single occupant vehicle trips and
       minimize transportation impacts. Bicycle storage will be provided on-site at a ratio of one
       bike per apartment, and Zipcar access will provide residents with transportation
       alternatives. The building will seek LEED Silver Certification under the LEED rating system
       through the submission of a LEED scorecard which will include an explanation of the
       Project's approach to achieving each of the identified LEED points.

2.0    PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND ALTERNATIVES

2.1    Existing Site Uses

       The site is currently occupied by The Home for Little Wanderers, which is relocating and
       consolidating some of its operations and functions to its facility in Walpole, Massachusetts.
       The relocation to the Walpole facility is anticipated to be completed in late 2012. The
       South Huntington Avenue facility dates back to 1914 and the existing buildings currently
       house classrooms, offices, student residences, and a gymnasium. The three existing
       buildings total approximately 55,580 sf of development.

       Figure 2-1 provides an Existing Conditions Site Plan with the revised Project overlaid. The
       Locus is shown in Figure 1-1 in the previous Chapter. Photographs of existing conditions
       are provided in Appendix B.

2.2    Project Context

       The Project is bound on the north by Sherrill House, a five to six story skilled nursing
       facility, and on the south by Goddard House, a six to seven story skilled nursing and
       rehabilitation center. On the east across South Huntington Avenue is the Veterans
       Administration (VA) Hospital, a campus of buildings ranging in height from four to 14
       stories, and on the west, the Jamaicaway and then across the street, a portion of the
       Olmsted Park and Leverett Pond.

       Both adjacent nursing facility buildings are generally constructed of masonry with the
       Sherrill House having a contemporary addition closest to the site featuring bays of metal
       panel. The VA Hospital is constructed of smooth and textured white and blue metal panels.

       The contrast between the South Huntington Avenue and Jamaicaway streetscape is extreme.
       South Huntington Avenue is a wide linear and active roadway with single car travel lanes,
       bikes lanes and parallel parking on both sides of the street. The sidewalk adjacent to the
       property is approximately five feet in width set between parallel parked cars and a
       deteriorated six foot tall iron fence. In contrast, the Jamaicaway is a tree lined curve linear
       four lane roadway with wide planted green strips and eight foot sidewalks on both sides.

       The Project is consistent with the larger urban planning goals to promote smart growth by
       developing urban infill sites and discouraging building on `greenfield' sites. The Project
       will address the local need for residential use and will enhance an underutilized parcel of
       land close to the LMA and downtown. In addition, the Project concentrates development
       in an area that has existing infrastructure and excellent access to public transportation.

2.3    Project Description

       As a result of BRA, Boston Civic Design Commission and community input, the Project has
       evolved. The revised Project will include the construction of a single new residential
       building totaling approximately 193,000 sf (137,420 net new sf on the site). The new
       building will be organized into two parts, one having four and the other five stories (See
       Figure 2-2). The development will feature a range of tenant amenities located on the
       ground floor consisting of a common room and lounge, private dining room and kitchen,
       fitness center and concierge. Figure 2-3 is a Ground Floor Plan. On floors two through five,
       the Project will incorporate approximately 196 residential apartments consisting of studios,
       one, two, and three bedroom units (See Figures 2-4 and 2-5). Of these, over 15%, or 30
       units will be designated as affordable. A roof plan is provided in Figure 2-6.

       The Project will add a residential presence along South Huntington Avenue, and will
       complement the existing uses of this vibrant neighborhood. Outside and connected to the
       interior common spaces will be a landscaped terrace facing the Emerald Necklace with
       outdoor seating and lounging spaces, a pool and outdoor cooking facilities. On the South
       Huntington Avenue side, a publicly accessible courtyard will feature outdoor seating,
       landscaping, and provide additional green space along the street. The majority of the
       parking will be provided under the building and out of sight in a partially below grade
       garage (See Figure 2-7). The total number of parking spaces proposed on site will be 156
       spaces with 147 in the garage and nine spaces on-grade for visitors including Zipcar
       parking. The parking ratio provided for residents is .75/unit.

2.4    Changes Since PNF Filing

       The Proponent has worked diligently to ensure that the Project complements the variety of
       existing building stock in the surrounding area while creating a unique urban space to
       maximize the use of an underutilized transit oriented site. In response to feedback
       provided by City Agencies and community comments the Proponent has revised key
       elements of the Project such as the building massing, site plan layout, parking and exterior
       expression. The issues raised in the BRA's Scoping Determination and in the comment
       letters are addressed in the text below. The design team has also studied a conceptual
       option to maintain and incorporate a portion of the existing 1914 building which is
       discussed in greater detail in Section 2.1.6 and Chapter 6.

       Revised Massing

       In response to comments regarding the buildings apparent mass and nature along South
       Huntington Avenue, the building has been reconfigured and a number of design and
       detailing strategies have been implemented. The previous PNF Project was organized into
       an `E' shaped footprint expressed as a singular building. Both indentations of the `E' plan
       faced onto the Jamaicaway.

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                   Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       In the revised design, the building footprint has been organized into two separate masses
       with the five-story footprint configured in a `C' shape and the four story organized in an `L'.
       The building's lobby serves as a connector of the two masses and as recommended through
       the BRA Scoping Determination is expressed as a transparent `knuckle'. This `knuckle' will
       erode at the upper floors revealing the architecture of each of the two buildings.

       The `C' shaped building opens out to South Huntington Avenue breaking up the overall
       massing and reducing the apparent building length. This revised design will provide a
       `pocket park' with an additional layer of landscape buffering the building and further
       reducing the building's scale along South Huntington Avenue.

       The `L' shaped portion is primarily four stories but steps down to three stories at the corner
       closest to the neighboring Sherrill House providing variation to the façade and further
       reducing the appearance of the building's mass.

       Materials and Exterior Expression

       The separate nature of each of the major building masses is reinforced through the use of
       exterior building materials and details. The general material palette for the `C' building is
       horizontal seamed metal panel above a masonry base, and full masonry for the `L' building.
       Metal bay windows of various heights are used on both buildings on the South Huntington
       Avenue elevation. French balconies are located at key locations facing the Jamaicaway and
       the Emerald Necklace. The building incorporates recesses into the plan clad in a darker
       toned panel to further visually breakdown the building into smaller components. Variations
       in window type are used to express the scale of the interior spaces with large corner
       windows that extend from just above the floor to eight feet tall at living rooms and smaller
       windows at bedrooms providing a more interesting pedestrian view from the streetscape.
       The ground floor units at the `L' portion have taller ceilings and feature units with 12 foot
       ceilings and oversize windows with transoms. Utilizing these design techniques, the
       Proponent has created two separate building masses which offers a more residential scale
       while simultaneously reducing the proportions of the PNF Project.

       Site Plan Layout and Parking

       To engage the street more effectively, the overall building footprint has shifted
       approximately 10 feet closer to South Huntington Avenue, with a subsequent increase in
       setback from the Jamaicaway. The front building plane aligns with, or is in front of the
       adjacent neighboring buildings along South Huntington Avenue improving the pedestrian
       environment. The increase in setback at the rear of the building allows for additional site
       walls and landscaping to better mitigate the building height along the Jamaicaway in
       response to the significant grade change of the site. Because of the unique nature of the
       site, having both a significant slope from the high side of South Huntington Avenue down
       to the Jamaicaway in excess of 40 feet, and with the extensive stand of mature oak trees on
       the Jamaicaway, the building can only be accessed and serviced off of South Huntington

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                     Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Avenue. This requires a design that carefully provides for both a high quality pedestrian
       experience and urban street wall while serving the functional and service needs of the
       building.

       Basic functional considerations that need to be met at the front of the building include;
       tenant move in/move out, trash pickup, car/taxi drop off and pickups, visitor parking, and
       potential new tenant visits. A single one-way loop which ties into the two existing curb cuts
       will be utilized. As recommended in the BRA's Scoping Determination, the surface parking
       originally proposed has been reduced from 16 spaces to nine in the currently proposed
       Project. This is also a significant reduction to the existing conditions which includes 54
       surface parking spaces. The layout of the parking spaces have been further broken down
       into three areas, surrounded by new landscaping treatments and fencing to screen cars from
       view. One to two surface spaces will be reserved for Zip-Car parking. In addition, the
       garage parking spaces have been reduced by seven spaces from 154 to 147. The total
       number of parking spaces proposed on site will be 156 spaces which is a total reduction of
       14 spaces from the PNF proposal. Garage parking will be assigned for resident use with
       surface spaces for visitors. The parking ratio provided for residents is .75/unit. In addition,
       there is on-street parking along both sides of South Huntington Avenue.

       Addressing the Site's Grade Change

       As mentioned previously, the grade change from South Huntington Avenue down to the
       Jamaicaway is significant with over 40 feet at its most extreme. By incorporating the garage
       as the building base and concealing the majority of the structure below grade, the garage
       structure helps mitigate the site slope.

       On the Jamaicaway side of the site, as the site slopes, the garage structure becomes
       exposed. The design incorporates the same masonry building materials used above to skin
       the garage, and at select locations, window openings are used to provide detail and relief to
       the garage wall. In addition, a terraced masonry retaining wall running parallel out 10 to 15
       feet from the building will be filled with sloped fill at a three to one ratio and planted with
       native and adapted species to further help mitigate the visual impact of the building base.

       Options were studied that incorporated residential units within the garage area as a method
       of providing detail at that location. The physical and financial complexities of adding living
       units within the garage with a double story unit type made this option infeasible.

       The revised design improves the connectivity between the top and bottom of the site and
       addresses the grade change from the residential terrace accessed from the two story lobby
       on South Huntington Avenue down to the Jamaicaway. The terraced and landscaped open
       space facing towards the Jamaicaway is graciously connected by a stairway located on
       access with the lobby `knuckle'. The stair drops down +/- 5 feet to a mid-landing `porch'

       that supports seating and landscaping. The stair continues down to meet another lower
       `porch' that then continues in two directions leading down to gates along the existing fence
       along the Jamaicaway sidewalk.

       Unit Type and Size

       The BRA's Scoping Determination noted concerns regarding the size of units and expressed
       a desire to see more `family friendly' sized units included in the revised Project. The
       Proponent has since reexamined the Project's feasibility and layout and was able to alter the
       design to include five three-bedroom units located in a stack in the five story portion of the
       building facing South Huntington Avenue. In addition, the Proponent is committed to
       increasing the amount of on-site affordable housing from the 26 units to 30 units, over 15%
       of all units.

       Sustainability

       From the start, the Proponent has been committed to incorporating sustainable building
       practices into the Project. As the process has progressed the Proponent has worked
       diligently to examine sustainability options for the Project. As such, the building will seek
       LEED Certification through the USGBC at a minimum of a Silver level, making the Project
       one of the greenest developments in the region.

2.5    Project Alternatives

       Throughout the course of this Project, the Proponent has studied and considered several
       alternative proposals to the PNF proposal.         The alternatives considered included
       maintaining and renovating the oldest of the existing structures, the 1914 Building, paired
       with a new tower building of approximately 12 stories (See Figures 6-1 through 6-7).
       Parking would have been provided in a garage structure below the tower and at grade. The
       drawbacks included greater shadow impacts along the Emerald Necklace, significant added
       costs to both renovate the existing structure and construct a high-rise building and garage,
       conflict with the neighborhood context regarding height, and a missed opportunity to
       improve the current pedestrian environment by improving the streetwall to reflect the
       surrounding urban setting.

       Another scenario studied assumed two separate four story buildings with three story
       townhouses fronting South Huntington Avenue at the center of the site. With this
       alternative, the building and parking encroached into the zone of the existing mature trees
       on the Jamaicaway that are required to be maintained. This alternative also did not provide
       an adequate level of density, and did not improve the desired street wall mentioned above.

       As part of the BRA's PNF review process and subsequent Scoping Determination, the
       Proponent was directed to further explore alternative designs that would include the reuse
       of the 1914 Building on-site. After further analysis, detailed in Chapter 6, the reuse of the
       1914 Building continues to be infeasible.

2.6    Schedule

       Construction of the Project is estimated to last approximately 18 months, with initial site
       work expected to begin in the last quarter of 2012. There will be a one-month site
       mobilization period.

       Typical construction hours will be in compliance with the City's Construction Ordinance:
       from 7:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Monday through Friday with no work anticipated on the
       weekends. In the event that weekend work is necessary, the Proponent will obtain required
       City approvals.

   Section 3.0

Transportation
3.0    TRANSPORTATION

       The BRA's Scoping Determination specifically highlighted the following two items to be
       addressed in the DPIR's Transportation Analysis:

            The intersection of Heath Street and South Huntington Avenue; and.

            The minimization or elimination of surface parking on South Huntington side.

       Below is a list of additional requests from the BRA's Scoping Determination to be
       incorporated into the DPIR filing:

            Commitment to dedicate 5% of the total parking capacity to low-emitting and fuel
            efficient vehicle spaces for electric vehicle parking;

            Traffic study that includes the MBTA's plan to eliminate weekend service of the E
            Green Line;

            As the Project advances, the Proponent will be required to develop and submit a
            detailed Construction Management Plan (CMP);

            Submission of an engineered site will be completed as the Project advances and will
            be part of the Transportation Access Plan Agreement (TAPA); and

            Rationale for amount of parking with a possible reduction in parking. Some of the
            reduction needs to come by eliminating the perpendicular parking spaces along
            South Huntington Ave to help reduce the amount of asphalt along South Huntington
            Ave and replace it with green space.

3.1    Additional Intersection Analysis

       The Scoping Determination requested that the intersection of Heath Street and South
       Huntington Avenue be incorporated into the traffic study. The sections that follow describe
       existing, no-build, and build conditions for that intersection.

       3.1.1        Existing Traffic Operating Conditions

       South Huntington Avenue/Heath Street is an unsignalized intersection with three
       approaches. The Heath Street westbound approach, which operates under yield control, is
       approximately 23 feet wide, and is striped as one 23-foot, shared left-turn/right-turn lane;
       however, HSH's field observations indicate that motorists generally ignore the pavement
       markings and form two lanes: one left-turn lane and one right-turn lane. The South
       Huntington Avenue northbound approach consists of a 10-foot through lane and a 10-foot
       exclusive right-turn lane. The South Huntington Avenue southbound approach consists of a
       10-foot exclusive left-turn lane and a 10-foot through lane. A 6-foot bicycle lane is

       provided along each side of South Huntington Avenue south of Heath Street, and transitions
       to shared bicycle accommodations north of Heath Street. The MBTA Green E Line train
       turn-around area for Heath Street Station is located just south of the intersection. The
       striping of the intersection is generally in good condition, with the exception of a faded left-
       turn arrow pavement marking on the South Huntington Avenue southbound approach.
       Several unsignalized pedestrian crosswalks are also provided in the vicinity of the
       intersection, including two across the South Huntington Avenue northbound approach and
       two across the Heath Street westbound approach. A signalized mid-block pedestrian
       crosswalk is located approximately 150 feet north of the intersection on South Huntington
       Avenue.

       Turning movement counts were based on data collected during the weekday morning (7:00
       a.m. to 9:00 a.m.) and evening (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) peak periods on Wednesday, July
       11, 2012. Based on these counts, the weekday peak hours were identified as 8:00­9:00
       a.m. and 4:00­5:00 p.m. The existing peak-hour turning volumes for the intersection are
       shown below. Complete traffic count data are provided in Appendix C.

       Field observations were made to verify Synchro model accuracy as well as to calibrate the
       model as necessary to match existing traffic conditions as closely as possible. To depict
       behavior as observed in the field, HSH modeled the Heath Street westbound approach at
       the intersection with South Huntington Avenue as two lanes, including a 60-foot storage
       lane for left-turning vehicles and a dedicated right-turn lane.

       Only one intersection approach operates below LOS D:

                 The Heath Street westbound shared left-turn operates at LOS F during both a.m. and
                 p.m. peak hours due to the high volume of vehicles making a left onto South
                 Huntington Avenue (133 vehicles during a.m. peak hour and 221 during p.m. peak
                 hour). Traffic operations are also impacted by the MBTA Green Line train that
                 travels through the intersection and turns around at Heath Street Station just south of
                 the intersection. Observations at the intersection noted a train queuing on South
                 Huntington Avenue waiting for a train to leave the station, severely impacting
                 intersection operations, particularly the Heath Street westbound left turn which was
                 completely blocked by the train waiting in the middle of South Huntington Avenue.

       3.1.2            No-Build Conditions

       No-Build traffic conditions are independent of the proposed Project and include existing
       traffic plus any new traffic expected in the study area either from general background
       growth or identified development projects in the area.

       3.1.2.1          Additional Area Development

       Traffic generated by planned new major developments in the study area were presented in
       the PNF. Since the 161 South Huntington Avenue PNF submittal, the development
       proposal at 105 South Huntington Avenue has also been submitted to the BRA for review.
       In addition, it has come to the attention of the community, the City, and the Proponent that
       the VA Hospital is constructing a 500 space parking garage to serve the facility across South
       Huntington Avenue from 161 South Huntington Avenue. Additional traffic generated by
       the following projects as described below was included in the No-Build and Build traffic
       volumes:

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                                     Epsilon Associates, Inc.
            105A South Huntington Avenue. The proposed Project includes the construction of
            approximately 195 residential apartments, 1,600 square feet of ground floor retail
            and approximately 176 garage parking spaces.

            VA Hospital Parking Garage. The Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center, located at
            150 South Huntington Avenue began construction on a new approximately 500-
            space parking garage in April 2012. The new garage would replace approximately
            100 surface parking spaces, resulting in a net increase of approximately 400 spaces.
            Vehicular access to the parking garage will continue to be provided via an existing
            curb cut on South Huntington Avenue. According to discussions with VA staff, the
            new garage would provide free parking for veterans that currently visit the medical
            center; however, no increases in the number of staff and/or the number of patients
            served at the medical facility are expected. Thus, the project is not expected to
            result in an increase in traffic volumes on adjacent roadways. In fact, the VA noted
            that the project would improve traffic conditions in the area by alleviating on-street
            parking demand in the neighborhood and eliminating the existing vehicle queue
            onto South Huntington Avenue that occurs during peak periods as veterans wait for
            parking spaces to become available. Any increases in vehicle trips associated with
            the project as a result of additional, and more convenient, parking at the VA are
            expected to be marginal and are included in the background growth rate.

       3.1.2.2      No-Build Conditions Traffic Operations

       The 2017 No-Build capacity analysis uses the methodology described in the PNF. No-Build
       traffic volumes are shown below. The resulting No-Build capacity analysis results are
       shown in Table 3-2. Complete Synchro reports are provided in Appendix C.

       Build conditions

       3.1.3            Build Conditions

       As summarized in the PNF, the Project will result in the construction of approximately 196
       residential apartments. The trip generation and mode split for the proposed Project is
       unchanged and was summarized in Table 2-8 of the PNF. Although the MBTA recently
       implemented service reduction on weekends on the Green E Line, the weekday peak-hour
       traffic operations assessment conducted for this study will not be affected by these
       reductions in service. The project-generated trips expected to travel through this
       intersection are shown below.

         With the small number of new vehicle trips added by the Project, the intersection will
         continue to operate at the same LOS as under No-Build Conditions, and no adverse impacts
         are anticipated.

3.2      Parking

         The Project will provide approximately 147 parking spaces within the parking garage for
         the 196 residential units. Corresponding to a parking ratio of 0.75 spaces per residential
         unit, this is a reduction in parking from that identified in the PNF. This remains at the low
         end of BTD's recommended maximum parking ratio guidelines for residential use in
         Jamaica Plain of between 0.75-1.25 spaces per unit. Surface parking for visitors and zip
         cars have been reduced from 16 spaces to 9 spaces. Total parking on-site will be 156
         spaces.

         The Proponent will provide electric vehicle charging stations in the garage for up to 8
         vehicles, or approximately 5% of the total on-site parking capacity.               Additional
         infrastructure capacity will be provided in the garage that will allow for additional electric
         vehicle charging stations should demand be evident.

3.3      Public Transit

         Effective July 1, 2012, the MBTA has implemented changes to the Green Line E Branch by
         ending weekend service to Heath Street and ending the E Branch services at the Brigham
         Circle. No changes are planned for the MBTA Route 39 bus that operates adjacent to the
         site and would continue to serve as an alternative to the Green E Line. MBTA fare hikes
         will also be in effect as of July 1, 2012. Bus service costs will rise to $1.50 for Charlie Card

       and $2.00 for Charlie Ticket users, while rapid transit will increase to $2.00 and $2.50,
       respectively. No changes in service are expected during the weekday commuter peak
       periods.

       Since service cuts will only occur on weekends, the peak-hour weekday traffic operations
       assessment conducted for this study will not be affected.

3.4    Bicycle Accommodations

       Secure bicycle storage is being provided for building residents and tenants within the
       parking garage at a minimum ratio of 1 space per residential unit. Additional bicycle
       parking for employees will also be available in the garage. Short-term bicycle parking for
       approximately 12 bicycles will be available for visitors and guests and will be provided in
       convenient and secure locations near main building entrances.

       The final numbers and locations of bicycle accommodations for the site will be determined
       as part of the Transportation Access Plan Agreement (TAPA) process.

3.5    Final Permitting

       As part of the final efforts in the permitting process, the Proponent will develop a
       Transportation Access Plan Agreement.          In addition to providing an operational
       understanding and agreement between the proponent and the City, the TAPA will also
       provide an engineered site plan. This site plan will depict in detail site access, loading and
       building servicing areas, parking, and bicycle accommodation. The site plan will also
       depict both passenger car and truck maneuvering on-site.

       Prior to issuance of the building permit, the Proponent's contractor will develop a
       Construction Management Plan that will be agreed to between the contractor and BTD.
       The CMP includes descriptions and of construction staging, delivery vehicle access,
       pedestrian and vehicle controls, safety measures around the site for the general public,
       location of construction worker parking, hours of operations, and other elements specific to
       the construction activity and means and methods employed on the 161 South Huntington
       site.

Environmental Protection
4.0    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

       The PNF included studies of potential environmental impacts related to wind, shadow,
       daylight, solar glare, air and water quality, wetlands, noise, construction impacts, wildlife
       habitat, and solid and hazardous waste. The PNF Project was found to have minimal
       impacts to the environment, and will improve stormwater and water quality generally. It is
       anticipated that the proposed changes to the revised Project as outlined in Chapter 2 will
       result in similar environmental impacts and may even offer improvements over previously
       proposed conditions.

       In response to the Scoping Determination the following provides additional information on
       solid and hazardous waste, as well as an updated solid waste generation section to reflect
       project changes.

4.1    Solid and Hazardous Waste

       4.1.1          Solid Waste Generation during Operation

       The Project will generate solid waste typical of other residential projects. Solid waste
       generated by the Project will be approximately 1,004 tons per year, based on the amount of
       amenity space proposed at a generation rate of 5.5 tons per 1,000 square feet per year
       and the amount of residential space proposed at a generation rate of 4 lbs per bedroom per
       day as shown in Table 4-1.

       Solid waste will include wastepaper, cardboard, glass, and bottles. A portion of the waste
       will be recycled as described below. The remainder of the waste will be compacted and
       removed by a waste hauler contracted by building management. With the exception of
       "household hazardous wastes" typical of residential uses (for example, cleaning fluids and
       paint), the residential and ground floor uses will not generate hazardous waste. Separate
       containers will be provided for the disposal of materials such as turpentine and paints.

       Recycling

       Recycling by residents will be encouraged and coordinated. To encourage recycling, the
       proponent will implement a recycling program throughout the Project. The Project will
       include space for recycling on the ground floor, and the loading/receiving area will include
       space for the storage and pick-up of recyclable materials. Recyclable materials are expected
       to continue to include newspaper, cardboard, cans, and bottles. The residential recycling
       program will be conducted in accordance with the City of Boston's recycling regulations.

       The Project will be provided with a trash chute with access from each floor. The chute will
       terminate on the ground floor and will feature a diverter that will allow the sender to select
       whether the contents will be sent to the trash bin or the recycling bin. A private trash
       collector will pick-up trash and recyclables as needed.

       4.1.2         Solid Waste Generation during Construction

       Solid waste generated by construction will consist primarily of demolition debris related to
       the selective interior demolition of the existing building and packaging and scrap materials
       (such as corrugated cardboard, glass, aluminum, scrap metal, and cable/wire) associated
       with new construction. It is estimated that approximately 475 tons of solid waste will be
       generated during construction.

       Construction waste material from demolition and new construction will be recycled when
       possible (see below). For those materials that cannot be recycled, solid waste will be
       transported in covered trucks to an approved solid waste facility, per DEP's Regulations for
       Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00. This requirement will be specified in the disposal
       contract. If any asbestos containing materials are identified, they will be treated as a special
       waste in accordance with Massachusetts DEP guidelines and addressed and disposed of
       accordingly.

       Recycling during Construction

       The proponent will take an active role with regard to the reprocessing and recycling of
       construction waste. An evaluation of the potential for recycling will occur before the
       construction commences. Construction will be conducted so that some materials that may
       be recycled are segregated from those materials not recyclable to enable disposal at an
       approved solid waste facility. A comprehensive recycling program will be included in the
       final Construction Management Plan. The Proponent will also coordinate with the Boston
       Materials Resource Center and direct materials to them where possible to reduce the
       amount of surplus building material that is sent to landfills. Materials that cannot be reused
       or recycled will be transported in covered trucks by a contract hauler to a licensed facility,
       per the MassDEP regulations for Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00.

       4.1.3        Existing Hazardous Waste Conditions

       A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I ESA), using methods consistent with
       ASTM E1527-05, was conducted in March 2012. The site was not identified within the
       Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Waste Site/Reportable Release
       database. No Recognized Environmental Conditions such as Underground Storage tanks or
       other potential sources of release of Oil and Hazardous materials to soil and groundwater
       were identified during the 2012 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment.

       Based on the results of the Phase I ESA soils and groundwater testing was not required to
       identify potential contamination at the property and further evaluate site environmental
       conditions. At this time it is not clear if any soil will be generated requiring off site
       transport. Characterization of environmental quality of excess material to be excavated and
       generated for offsite transport will be undertaken prior to removing any material from the
       property. Chemical testing to define the environmental quality of soil for receiving facilities
       and management of soil and groundwater will be in accordance with applicable local, state,
       and federal laws and regulations. The Proponent has retained a Licensed Site Professional
       (LSP) as part of the team who will make observations during construction and provide
       guidance should any unforeseen environmental conditions be encountered.

       An Asbestos and Hazardous Material Evaluation of existing buildings on the property was
       conducted in 2009, and additional asbestos investigations were also undertaken in 2010.
       Several types of common asbestos containing materials (ACM) and hazardous materials
       were identified to be present in various building materials. The identified ACM, lead, and
       hazardous materials were in generally good condition not requiring any immediate action.
       Prior to conducting demolition activities, Massachusetts-licensed abatement contractors will
       be retained to remove the ACM and other materials from the buildings.

       4.1.4        Construction Management

       The PNF provided a detailed section related to construction period management and
       potential impacts. As the project advances, the Proponent will develop and submit a
       detailed Construction Management Plan (CMP) to the Boston Transportation Department for
       review and approval. The CMP will address measures for construction workers, proposed
       street occupancies, equipment staging, sidewalk relocations and hours of construction
       work.

4.2    Sustainable Design

       4.2.1        Article 37 Boston Zoning Code

       To comply with Article 37, the proponent intends to measure the results of their
       sustainability initiatives using the framework of the LEED (Leadership in Energy and
       Environmental Design) rating system. As a new construction residential apartment building,
       the project at 161 S. Huntington is categorized as a LEED V3 NC 2009 (New Construction)

3241 DPIR                                         4-3                         Environmental Protection
161 South Huntington Avenue                                                     Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       project. The LEED rating system tracks the sustainable features of the project by achieving
       points in following categories: Sustainable Sites; Water Efficiency; Energy Atmosphere;
       Materials and Resources; Indoor Environmental Quality; and Innovation in Design.

       The project team will demonstrate certifiable status under the LEED rating system through
       the submission of a LEED scorecard which will include an explanation of the projects
       approach to achieving each of the identified LEED points (see LEED Scorecard Appendix D).
       The scorecard will be updated regularly as the design develops and engineering
       assumptions are substantiated. Presently, 45 points have been targeted, not including any of
       the potential Boston Zoning Code Article 37 points.

       4.2.2        Sustainable Sites

       1. Construction Activity Pollution Prevention (SS prerequisite 1). A management plan will
          be created and implemented to reduce pollution from construction activity.

       2. Site Selection (SS credit 1). The Project site is currently completely developed and is
          located in a dense urban area. This development does not violate any of the established
          LEED criteria.

       3. Development Density and Community Connectivity (SS credit 2). The development is in
          a dense urban area with existing infrastructure and basic services.

       4. Alternative Transportation ­ Public Transportation Access (SS credits; 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
          &4.4). The Project is sited near several heavily served mass transit stops. The site's
          adjacency to basic services in the community and the development density of its urban
          context enable the project to satisfy both available approaches to the Development
          Density and Community Connectivity credit. The project also achieves all of the
          Alternative Transportation credits through its access to public transportation; by
          providing covered bicycle storage facilities for more than 15% of the building
          occupants; by providing preferred parking for low-emitting and fuel efficient vehicles;
          and by providing the number of parking spaces that meet, but do not exceed, the\ local
          zoning requirement. Zipcars will also be available on site.

       5. Site Development - Maximize Open Space (SS credit 5.2). Since there are no zoning no
          requirements for open space, we will provide vegetated open space & pedestrian-
          oriented hardscape equal to 20% of the site area with a minimum of 25% of the open
          space vegetated.

       6. Stormwater Design - Quantity Control (SS credit 6.1). The intent is to reduce volume of
          stormwater runoff by 25%.

       7. Heat Island Effect ­ Non-Roof (SS credit 7.1). The intent is to reduce heat islands by
          placing 95% of parking under cover in a garage below the building.

       8. Heat Island Effect ­ Roof (SS credit 7.2). The intent is to reduce heat islands by
          designing and installing a roof with an appropriate Solar Reflectance Index (SRI).

       4.2.3        Water Efficiency

       Conservation of water preserves a natural resource while reducing the amount of energy
       and chemicals used for sewage treatment.

       1. Water Efficient Landscaping (WE credit 1.1). The intent is to limit the use of potable
          water with strategies such as using adaptive plants, efficient irrigation systems and
          climate base controllers.

       2. Water Use Reduction (WE credit 3.1). The intent is to reduce potable water 30% from
          baseline by incorporating water conservation strategies that include low flow plumbing
          fixtures for water closets and faucets.

       4.2.4        Energy & Atmosphere

       The building is designed to optimize energy efficiency and will comply with the Stretch
       Energy Code, whereby energy use is reduced from the baseline energy conservation code
       by 20%. The prescriptive approach will be employed to demonstrate Stretch Energy Code
       compliance.

       1. Fundamental Commissioning of the Building Energy Systems (EA prerequisite 1). The
          intent is to verify that the building's related systems are installed and perform as
          intended, via means of a commissioning process.

       2. Minimum Energy Performance (EA prerequisite 2). The intent is to clarify the minimum
          level of energy efficiency for the building and related systems.

       3. Fundamental Refrigerant Management (EA prerequisite 3). The intent is to reduce ozone
          depletion through thoughtful use of appropriate refrigerants.

       4. Optimize Energy Performance (EA credit 1). The intent is to reduce the environmental
          impacts associated with energy use, via means of increased energy performance.

       5. Enhanced Commissioning (EA credit 3). The intent is to verify that the building's related
          systems are installed and perform as intended, via means of an enhanced third party
          commissioning process.

       6. Enhanced Refrigerant Management (EA credit 4). The intent is to reduce ozone
          depletion through thoughtful evaluation and use of appropriate refrigerants.

       4.2.5         Materials & Resources

       The materials that are used in the construction of buildings have a profound impact on the
       amount of virgin materials that are harvested and also the amount of waste products that are
       generated. Recycling diverts material waste products from landfills and reduces the demand
       for virgin materials. In addition, the extraction, processing, and transportation of materials to
       project sites consume energy and contributes to carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the
       use of locally extracted and processed materials stimulates the local economy.

       1. Storage and Collection of Recyclables (MR prerequisite 1). The intent is to reduce the
          amount of building waste that is taken to landfills, by supporting occupant recycling
          efforts.

       2. Construction Waste Management (MR credit 2.1 and 2.2). The intent is to divert
          construction and demolition debris from landfills through the use of a construction
          waste management plan.

       3. Recycled Content (MR credit 4.1). The intent is to reduce the impacts from use of virgin
          materials, by using building materials with recycled content, where appropriate.

       4. Regional Material (MR credit 5). The intent is to specify 10% of material by costs
          sourced within 500 miles of the site.

       4.2.6         Indoor Environmental Quality

       Safeguarding the comfort and well-being of the occupants is a fundamental obligation. The
       quality of indoor air, and specifically the reduction of airborne pollutants, is known to
       minimize occurrences of asthma, allergies, and other health ailments. Irritating off gassing,
       caused by the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in interior finishes, can be
       avoided by using products that release fewer and less harmful chemical compounds.

       1. Minimum Indoor Air Quality (EQ prerequisite 1). The intent is to establish minimum
          indoor air quality performance.

       2. Environmental Tobacco Smoke Control (EQ prerequisite. 2). The intent is to minimize
          the exposure of building occupants, indoor surfaces and ventilation air distribution
          systems to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS).

       3. Construction IAQ Management Plan (EQ credit 3.1). The intent is to reduce indoor air
          quality problems resulting from the construction process, through the means of a
          Construction IAQ Management Plan.

       4. Low Emitting Materials ­ (EQ credit 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3). The intent is to reduce the
          quantity of indoor air contaminants through thoughtful use of adhesives and sealants,
          paints, and carpet with low VOC content.

       5. Indoor Chemical and Pollutant Source Control (EQ credit 5). The intent is to minimize
          the exposure of building occupants to potentially hazardous particulates and chemical
          pollutants.

       6. Controllability of Systems ­ Lighting (EQ credit 6.1). The intent is to enhance the indoor
          environmental quality by providing access to lighting systems controls for 90% of
          building occupants.

       7. Controllability of Systems ­ Thermal Comfort (EQ credit 6.2). The intent is to enhance
          the indoor environmental quality by providing access to thermal systems controls.

       8. Daylight and Views ­ (EQ credits 8.2). The intent is to provide a connection between
          the indoor and outdoor spaces through the incorporation of daylight and views.

       4.2.7        Innovation In Design

       The project anticipates that several points will be achieved in the Innovation & Design
       category. One point is expected for exemplary performance on the Development Density
       credit. Additional credits will be pursued for the Green Housekeeping program and the
       Green Education and Outreach program.

       1. Exemplary Performance ­ Public Transportation Access (ID credit 1.1). The Project is
          sited near several heavily served mass transit stops.

       2. Exemplary Performance Heat Island Effect ­ Non-Roof (ID credit 1.2). The Project will
          reduce heat islands by placing 95% of parking under cover.

       3. Exemplary Performance Construction Waste Management ­ (ID credit 1.3). The goal is
          to divert construction and demolition debris from landfills through the use of a
          construction waste management plan.

       4. Innovation in Design ­ Green Housekeeping (ID credit 1.4). The intent is to engage in a
          green housekeeping policy wherein all cleaners used in common areas shall comply
          with Green Seal standards.

       5. Innovation in Design ­ LEED AP (ID credit 2). The goal is to support and encourage the
          design integration of LEED through the input of LEED Accredited Professionals.

  Section 5.0

Urban Design
5.0    URBAN DESIGN

5.1    Urban Design

       The revised Project's massing and design will help tie the neighborhood's varied building
       stock and uses together by respecting the fabric of the neighborhood. The design of the
       new building centers on simple volumes which are broken down in scale through the
       modulation of façade depth, bay windows, building heights, and varying materials of
       masonry, metal panel, and glass.

       The building footprint is organized into two separate masses with the five story footprint
       configured in a `C' shape and the four story organized in an `L'. Figure 5-1 provides east
       and west aerial views of the Project. The building's lobby serves as a connector of the two
       masses and is expressed as a transparent `knuckle' which erodes at the upper floors
       revealing the architecture of each of the two buildings. The `C' shaped building opens out
       to South Huntington Avenue reducing the apparent building length and providing a
       courtyard and an additional layer of landscape buffering the building. The `L' shaped
       portion is primarily four stories and steps down to three stories at the corner closest to the
       neighboring Sherrill House providing variation to the façade and further reducing the
       building mass. Figures 5-2 through 5-4 provide elevations of the building. Figures 5-5
       through 5-8 includes perspective images and Figure 5-9 provides cross sections of the
       Project.

       The building generally aligns with adjacent parcels to provide definition and variation to
       South Huntington Avenue. The development will enhance pedestrian access at South
       Huntington Avenue by providing new sidewalks, landscaping elements, fencing, and
       lighting and will offer an active streetscape with multiple pedestrian entry points

       The building will seek LEED Certification through the USGBC at a minimum of a Silver
       level, exceeding the requirements of Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code. The
       redevelopment of the site will promote public safety, encourage walking and transit usage
       and improve safety and the pedestrian environment.

       5.1.1        Streetscape & Landscape

       The overall character of the landscape of the Project will be enhanced through the addition
       of extensive new plantings and quality site furnishings. The unique Project site calls for a
       two-sided landscape design (See Figure 5-10). Along South Huntington Avenue the setting
       is decidedly urban and the landscape design will engage with the contemporary streetscape
       conditions. Conversely, the landscape on the Jamaicaway side of the property has the
       naturalistic character of the historic Olmsted-designed Emerald Necklace and the landscape
       design will be sensitive to that character.

       South Huntington Landscape

       The continuous yet varied orthogonal landscape design along South Huntington integrates
       the site with the new architecture and will enhance the overall image and quality of the
       public realm as a whole in the vicinity of the site area. It will appreciably upgrade the civic
       streetscape and urban design condition of the South Huntington Avenue side of the
       property. Repeated site pier, wall and picket fence elements establish an overall residential
       garden scale character, identity and coherence. At the central entry area, the design
       extends an "invitation" into the site from the sidewalk with a public plaza area with
       benches and seatwalls set amidst an architectural grove of shade trees. A new metal fence
       is continuous along the entire length of the street to ensure security, but offset at differing
       distances from the sidewalk to create visual interest, in places deliberately held back from
       the sidewalk to allow for curbed plant beds to be placed at the edge of the sidewalk for
       enjoyment by passersby and tenants alike. Orchestrated geometric "movements" of tree
       and shrub planting create an intentionally urban and sophisticated composition which
       supports the architecture's modulation and stepped massing. The landscape design carries
       into the east facing courtyard with linear bands of planting and seatwalls, visually extending
       the amount of green between building and street.

       Jamaicaway Landscape

       For the western facing Jamaicaway building façade, the intent is to continue the geometric
       planting composition established on the South Huntington side. Rectilinear drifts of native
       ornamental trees interplay with mass shrub and groundcover plantings and terraced
       landscape retaining walls along the building's edge. As the foundation plantings move
       away from the building they engage with the informal character of the Jamaicaway by
       transforming into a relaxed geometry of plant massing. At select locations on the garage
       exterior walls, "green screen" type modular vertical vine supports will reinforce the overall
       composition and soften the architecture. This landscape treatment terraces down from the
       elevated courtyard to finish grade and provides pedestrian access via a series of stairs
       integrated with the landscape walls. An intermediate landing provides an overlook
       opportunity to the Jamaicaway.

       Beyond the immediate building foundation landscape, the landscape transitions into the
       existing and enhanced Olmstedian landscape of the Jamaicaway. Between the western
       edge of the building and the Jamaicaway, 28 mature trees are preserved and protected
       while new native trees will be inter-planted to help revitalize the existing the grove,
       providing the next succession of trees. In the area of the existing grove, the ground plane
       will primarily remain as lawn to minimize disturbance to the root zone. In areas of steep
       slope and erosion, a stabilizing treatment of over-seeding with native grasses and plug
       plantings of native groundcover like low bush blueberry will be installed. The existing
       historical iron fence will be repaired and repainted and two new pedestrian gates with
       masonry piers will replace the existing dilapidated ones to restore resident access to the
       Jamaicaway.

       5.1.2         Parking & Access

       Approximately 147 parking spaces will be included in a partially below grade parking
       garage which is not visible from South Huntington Avenue while nine visitor spaces
       including handicapped accessible spaces and one or two Zip Car locations will be provided
       at grade totaling 156 spaces.

       The Project has been designed to maintain access from South Huntington Avenue much as
       it is today. Dual vehicular travel lanes leading to the north from the northern curb cut
       provide two-way access to and from the structured parking below the building, while a
       narrower one-way vehicular loop between the building entry and the southern curb cut
       provides adequate emergency vehicle passing, and will provide a drop off area with all
       service occurring off the loop drive with a dedicated service lane. A raised pedestrian table
       with ornamental pavers that passes in front of the building entry will contribute to the traffic
       calming, pedestrian comfort and safety.

       5.1.3         Massing & Height

       The buildings are generally shaped to conform to the buildable area of the site. The
       building massing provides a strong and continuous urban edge with amenities, courtyards,
       and residential uses along Huntington Avenue. Through use of varied materials, the
       stepped footprint configuration, and building heights, the revised Project's massing will
       help tie the neighborhood's varied building stock and uses together by respecting the fabric
       of the neighborhood.

       Although the building is composed of stepped building heights of one, two three, four and
       five stories, the building will be 65 as measured in accordance with the City of Boston
       Zoning Code.

6.1    Buildings on the Project Site

       6.1.1        The New England Home for Little Wanderers

       Constructed in 1914, the New England Home for Little Wanderers building is a Georgian
       Revival style red brick, three story structure set on a raised basement level. The 11 bay
       main block features a symmetrical façade with a center entrance; three story, side,
       projecting pavilions flank the main block. Designed by the Boston architecture firm
       Brainerd and Leeds, the building displays a cast stone balustrade at the roof line, bracketed
       cast stone hoods over the front and side entrances, splayed window lintels with keystones
       on the second and third floors and cast stone window surrounds on the first floor. The
       building is further detailed with a decorative iron fire escape that spans across the façade at
       the second floor level and is supported with iron scroll brackets.

       The top floors of the side pavilions feature loggia-like forms with paired columns separating
       late 20th century one-over-one replacement windows in openings once occupied by multi-
       light casement windows. On the remainder of the building, original six-over-one and nine-
       over-one sash have also been replaced with late 20th century one-over-one replacement
       windows.

       The west elevation consists of the seven bay main block and projecting three bay side
       pavilions. The main block features a cast stone balustrade at the roof line and a frieze
       between the first and second floors inscribed "THE NEW ENGLAND HOME FOR LITTLE
       WANDERERS." In the late 1950s, a single story addition was added to the raised basement
       level of the west elevation. The addition spans the full width of the main block and the
       three bays of the north pavilion. The addition altered a central classical cast stone
       entablature entry framed with engaged columns.

       Also in the late 1950s, a two story addition was added to the south elevation of the
       southern pavilion. The two additions, both designed by The Architectural Collaborative,
       feature large plate glass windows, red brick, bands of concrete and flat roofs.

       6.1.2        Modern Residential Building and Gymnasium

       Additional buildings constructed on the Project site by the Home include a 1987, red brick,
       three story residential dormitory building near the southern limits of the site. The
       residential building was constructed into the natural sloping topography of the site, such
       that the South Huntington Avenue side (east elevation) is a single story in height, whereas
       the Jamaicaway side (west elevation) is three stories in height.

       A metal clad gymnasium building, constructed by the Home in 1991, is located near the
       northern limits of the site. The gable roof structure is set on a raised concrete block
       foundation and features bands of windows set beneath the overhanging roof line.

6.2    Boston Landmarks Commission Review

       Constructed in 1914, the Home for Little Wanderers building is greater than 50 years old
       and therefore subject to review by the Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC) in accordance
       with Article 85 of the Boston Zoning Code. An Article 85 application for the proposed
       demolition of the buildings on the site was filed with the BLC on April 4, 2012.

       In accordance with BLC's requirements, an Article 85 Community Meeting was held on
       April 11, 2012. As required, the Community Meeting included a presentation of
       alternatives to the proposed demolition of the buildings, including rehabilitating and
       incorporating the existing buildings on the site into the Project. Alternatives presented at
       the April 11th Community Meeting included the following:

       6.2.1         Alternative 1: Retention of Existing Buildings with Infill Construction

       This alternative explored the feasibility of retaining the existing buildings, with the
       exception of the 1991 Gymnasium, and adding a new four story addition that would
       connect the 1950s, two story, side addition of the 1914 Building to the 1987 residential
       building (Figure 6-1). This alternative would result in a total of 72 residential units (24 units
       in the 1914 Building, 12 units in the 1950s side addition, 24 units in the newly construction
       connecting addition and 12 units in the 1987 residential building). A total of 58 surface
       parking spaces would be created as part of this alternative.

       This alternative does not meet the Project's goal for the number of residential units and
       would require significant alterations to the site's topography in order to create the terraced
       surface parking areas. In addition, the terraced surface parking areas would encroach into
       the zone of the mature trees on the Jamaicaway side of the property. For these various
       reasons, this alternative was determined to be infeasible.

       6.2.2         Alternative 2: Retention of the 1914 Building with a new Tower

       The second alternative explored the feasibility of retaining the existing 1914 Building and
       constructing a new 10 story tower (Figure 6-2). As part of this alternative the 1950s
       additions, the Gymnasium and the 1987 residential building would be demolished. This
       alternative would meet the Project's desired goal of 196 units (24 units in the 1914 Building
       and 172 units in the new tower). The tower would include a two level enclosed parking
       structure on the first two levels. Access to the garage entrance would require need to be on
       the Jamaicaway side of the site and therefore, would require significant alterations to the
       site's topography.

       While the new tower structure would allow this alternative to meet the desired number of
       residential units, the height of the structure would result in greater shadow impacts along
       the Emerald Necklace and would conflict with the neighborhood context in regard to
       height. In addition, there would be significant added costs to both renovate the 1914
       Building and construct the high-rise structure and garage. Further, this alternative would no

       have the opportunity to improve the current pedestrian environment by improving the
       streetwall to reflect the surrounding urban setting. For these various reasons, this alternative
       was also determined to be infeasible.

       6.2.3         Alternative 3: Retention of 1914 Building Façade with New Construction

       The third alternative explored the feasibility of retaining only the façade of the 1914
       Building and constructing a new four and five story building behind the façade (Figure 6-3).
       As part of this alternative, the 1914 Building would be removed (with the exception of he
       façade) as well as all other existing buildings on the site. The new structure located behind
       the façade would be four and five stories and would house 196 residential units and 156
       parking spaces in single level garage.

       While this alternative would meet the Project's desired goal for the number of residential
       units and parking spaces, there would be significant added costs associated with the
       stabilization, protection and preservation of the façade during construction. In addition,
       there would be significant technical and design challenges associated with integrating the
       façade with the new building. Specifically, there would be challenges with the new
       building aligning with the floor to floor heights established by the window openings of the
       existing 1914 façade. For these various reasons, this alternative was also determined to be
       infeasible. Also, this "facadectomy" approach is generally not considered an acceptable
       form of historic preservation.

6.3    Boston Preservation Alliance

       Since the filing of the PNF for the Project, the Proponent has met on several occasions with
       the staff and board members of the Boston Preservation Alliance (BPA) to review and
       discuss the Project. The BPA has expressed concern for the preservation of the 1914
       Building. In addition, while the BPA has expressed support for new construction on the
       site, they have expressed concerns with the scale and mass of the Project as presented in
       the PNF.

       6.3.1         BPA Alternative: Retention of 1914 Building with New Construction

       In meetings with the Proponent, the BPA representatives presented a conceptual alternative
       that would involve the retention of the 1914 Building, flanked by two new five story
       buildings. This configuration only provides 170 units which does not meet the Proponent's
       objectives. A scheme was developed adding two new six story buildings which would
       provide 192 units, closer to the 196 desired (Figures 6-4, 6-5, 6-6, 6-7). The BPA
       encouraged the Proponent to consider the possibility of state and federal historic tax credits
       to assist in the rehabilitation of the 1914 Building. The Proponent has given serious
       consideration to the BPA's alternative and has studied its feasibility extensively and the
       potential for historic tax credits as an element of the Project financing.

          _!WM.M'._                                      BPA Alternative: Retention of 1914 Building with New Construction
       The BPA alternative had the potential for approximately 170 residential units and 130
       parking spaces in a single level garage. As envisioned, the ground floor of the 1914
       Building would house the Project's amenity spaces with small residential units on the upper
       floors of the building. The two new buildings flanking the 1914 Building would house the
       remainder of the residential units. A garage level would be constructed under the two new
       buildings connected below grade along the west elevation foundation wall of the 1914
       Building. The BPA alternative provides 26 fewer units than the Project's desired number of
       residential units.    In addition there are significant technical and financial challenges
       associated with it.

       Due to the limited square footage of the ground floor, the amenity space would need to be
       reduced in size. The residential units on the upper floors of the 1914 Building would be
       small and likely difficult to market as the buildings depth is only 40' as it was designed for
       single bed dormitory use. In order to connect the existing 1914 Building with the two new
       buildings, connections would need to be made at the north and south elevations. As a
       result, the existing stairwells in the 1914 Building would need to be removed and relocated
       as would the load bearing walls. Significant structural upgrades of the 1914 Building would
       be required including new steel columns throughout the north south corridor and extensive
       shoring of the existing west elevation foundation walls, at the parking level. By increasing
       the height to six stories, a full steel frame structural system would be required. This is a
       significant cost premium above the wood frame system in the proposed design. In addition,
       the new building on the south side would not meet zoning setback requirements along the
       property line. In order to properly site the new building to comply with setback
       requirements, additional residential units would be lost, thereby furthering the gap between
       the desired number of units and the number of possible units.

       Due to the current dormitory style layout of the interior of the 1914 Building, significant
       reconfigurations would be required of the interior of the building. While state and federal
       historic rehabilitation tax credits conceivably could be available to offset the cost premiums
       associated with retaining the 1914 Building, given the extent of the modifications required
       to convert the dormitory style layout of the interior to house the Project's amenity spaces
       and residential spaces, the Project would not be able to meet the Secretary of the Interior's
       Standards for the Rehabilitation of Historic Properties, a requirement of both the state and
       federal historic tax credit programs. Specifically, this alternative would not meet the
       following Standards:

           Standard #1: "A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new
           use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its
           site and environment."

           The approximately 180 residential units and the two new buildings would not meet
           Standard 1 as it would result in a significant changes to the building character defining
           features on the interior and north and south exterior elevations of the building and its
           site and environment.

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                    Epsilon Associates, Inc.
           Standard #2: "The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
           removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a
           property shall be avoided."

           Altering the interior of the 1914 Building for the ground floor amenity spaces and upper
           floor residential units, and alterations associated with connecting the building to two
           new buildings at its north and south elevations, would not meet Standard 2.

           Standard #4: "Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
           historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved."

           The removal of the 1950 additions, which arguably have achieved significance in their
           own right as representative of the growth and expansion of the Home and its services,
           and as representative examples of modern architecture, would not meet Standard 4.

           Standard #9: "New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
           destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
           differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
           architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
           environment."

           Connecting the two new buildings to the 1914 Building to the north and south
           elevations would destroy historic materials that characterize the property, and therefore,
           would not meet Standard 9.

           Standard #10: "New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
           undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and
           integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired."

           Connecting the two new buildings to the 1914 Building would alter the essential form
           and integrity of the building and therefore, would not meet Standard 10.

6.4    Conclusion

       Due to the structural challenges noted above, the BPA alternative of retaining the 1914
       Building and adding two new buildings is not feasible. In addition, the inability to secure
       state and federal historic tax credits for the Project, due to violating the Secretary of the
       Interior's Standards noted above, further demonstrates the financial infeasibility of the BPA
       alternative.

       On May 8, 2012 the BLC held a public hearing on the Article 85 application for the
       proposed demolition of the building on the Project site. As part of the Article 85 public
       hearing presentation the Proponent presented each of the alternatives listed above,
       including the BPA's alternative. The BLC voted to invoke the 90 day delay period.

       As discussed in the previous chapters of this DPIR, the design of the Project has evolved
       significantly in response to comments raised during the public review process, the BCDC
       review process and in response to the BRA design staff. While the revised Project does not
       retain the 1914 Building, the design is more responsive to the community and its concerns.

       Mitigation Measures

       Recognizing the interest surrounding the history of The Home for Little Wanderers, the
       Proponent will commit to undertaking the following measures in connection with the
       Project's construction to mitigate the demolition activities:

           Archival Documentation: Thorough, archival-quality photographic documentation will
           be prepared of the exterior of The Home for Little Wanderers building prior to
           demolition. Copies of the documentation will be provided to the BLC and will be made
           available to the public for research or other purposes. An additional set of the
           photographs will be provided to the Home for its records.

           Cornerstone: The 1914 Building's cornerstone will be salvaged by the Proponent and
           made available to the Home prior to demolition.

           Interpretive Exhibit: The Proponent will work closely with the Home to explore
           opportunities to commemorate its history and accomplishments in providing social
           services to children and families across New England.

           Tree Preservation: The Proponent is committed to protecting the mature stand of red
           oak trees on the Jamaicaway side of the site throughout the construction process.

           Emerald Necklace Conservancy: The Proponent has met with the Emerald Necklace
           Conservancy and has solicited their input on measures to protect the site's mature trees.
           Furthermore, the Proponent will be making a contribution to the Conservancy to further
           their efforts to protect and preserve the Emerald Necklace as an important historic and
           natural resource in the City of Boston.

7.0    RESPONSE TO COMMENTS

7.1    Introduction

       In response to the Expanded PNF submitted on March 27, 2012 and the subsequent public
       process, the BRA issued a Scoping Determination and appended comment letters from local
       agencies, community groups and individuals. The Proponent is committed to working with
       the stakeholders involved in the process and looks forward to building a Project that will
       complement and benefit the surrounding neighborhood for years to come.

       Comment letters expressed support for the Project as well as concerns with certain aspects
       of the Project. Comments generally focused on transportation, historic resources, massing
       and scale, design, unit size, affordable housing, construction. Section 3.0 addresses
       transportation, Section 5.0 and Section 6.0 address historic resources, massing and scale,
       design and unit size, while construction is addressed in Section 4.0.

       The community process has brought to the forefront the opinions of many stakeholders
       within the Project's vicinity. These views are vital to shaping the future of this Project and
       its role within the community. In addition to the site's excellent location related to public
       transportation, the Proponent's plan to utilize sustainable building practices and
       commitment to include over 15% affordable housing along with other public benefits make
       this Project an attractive opportunity for both the neighborhood and the City as a whole.

       Project changes have been made and are detailed in Section 1.0. The opportunity to listen
       to constructive feedback from stakeholders has provided the Proponent with valuable
       insight on how to revise the proposed Project while maintaining its feasibility. The
       Proponent believes that the alterations made to the original proposal, as described in this
       Draft PIR, will allow for a successful Project that will become an asset to the local
       community for generations to come.

Report ("DPIR") that meets the requirements of the Scope by detailing the Proposed
Project's expected impacts and proposing measures to mitigate, limit, or minimize such
impacts. The DPIR shall contain the information necessary to meet the specifications of
Section 80B-3 (Scope of Review; Content of Reports) and Section 80B-4 (Standards for
Large Project Review Approval) as required by the Scope.



                                           - 3-
Subsequent to the end of the forty-five (45) day public comment period for the DPIR,
the BRA will issue a Preliminary Adequacy Determination (liP AD") that indicates the
additional steps necessary for the Proponent to complete in order to satisfy the
requirements of the Scope and all applicable sections of Article 80 of the Code. If the
BRA finds that the PNF / DPIR adequately describe the Proposed Project's impacts and,
if appropriate, proposes satisfactory measures to mitigate, limit or minimize such
impacts, the PAD will announce such a determination and that the requirements for the
filing and review of a Final Project Impact Report are waived pursuant to Section 80B-
5.4(c)(iv) of the Code. Section 80B-6 requires the Director of the BRA to issue a
Certification of Compliance before the Commissioner of Inspectional Services can issue
any building permit for the Proposed Project.

B.   PROTECT DESCRIPTION AND ALTERNATIVES

     1.       Project Description

              The DPIR shall contain a full description of the Proposed Project and its
              components, including its size, physical characteristics, development
              schedule and proposed uses. This section of the DPIR also shall present
              analysis of the development context of the Proposed Project. Appropriate
              site and building plans to clearly illustrate the Proposed Project are
              required.

     2.       Project Alternatives

              A description of alternatives to the massing of the Proposed Project that
              shall be presented and the primary differences among the alternatives,
              particularly as they may affect the South Huntington side of the street,
              shall be discussed. The alternatives presented in the DPIR should include
              a version of the building that keeps the 1914 structure intact; the pros and
              cons for each alternative should be listed.


C.   TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT

          ·   Commitment to dedicate 5% of the total parking capacity to low-emitting
              and fuel efficient vehicle spaces for electric vehicle parking




                                            - 6-
        ·   Traffic study that includes the MBT A' s plan to eliminate weekend service
            of the E Green Line

        ·   Include the intersection of Heath Street and South Huntington Avenue
            into the traffic study

        ·   As the project moves advances, the proponent will be required to develop
            and submit a detailed Construction Management Plan (CMP)

        ·   Submit an engineered site plan (see BTD comment letter for what site plan
            should depict in Appendix 1)

D.   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMPONENT

     Please refer to the comments and information requested by Katie Pedersen
     included in Appendix 1. In addition, the Proponent is required to provide
     further analyses of the following:



     The Proponent shall not be required to conduct a qualitative pedestrian level
     wind study, as the Proposed Project will be of similar in height and scale to the
     existing building on the Proposed Project site and will be of similar height and
     scale to the surrounding buildings. Accordingly, it is not likely that the
     Proposed Project will have an adverse wind impact on adjacent buildings or
     open space areas.



     The Proponent has stated that the Proposed Project will include rooftop
     mechanical equipment. However, the Proponent has indicated that the high
     efficiency air cooled chiller's design will ensure for its quiet operation
     nonetheless, the design includes an acoustic screen enclosure, which will serve to
     reduce the visual impact as well.

     The Proponent has stated that the anticipated noise levels to be generated by the
     Proposed Project will be less than or similar to those created by the existing
     surrounding buildings.

     Shadow
     The results of the shadow analysis indicate that the majority of the net new
     shadow predicted to be created by the Proposed Project will be cast primarily on
     the Proposed Project site. The Proponent has stated that only during one of the


                                          -7-
fourteen time periods studied will shadow be cast onto the Olmstead Park
(winter mornings) and similarly, during two of the fourteen time periods
studied will a shadow be cast on the Jamaciaway. Accordingly, no further
investigation is required.

Solar Glare

The Proponent has stated that the Proposed Project design does not include the
use of reflective glass or reflective materials, thus adverse impacts from reflected
solar glare are not anticipated to be created. However, should the Proposed
Project design change and include the use reflective glass or reflective materials,
an evaluation of potential solar glare impacts shall be required.

Sustainable Design! Green Buildings

The purpose of Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code is to ensure that major
buildings projects are planned, designed, constructed and managed to minimize
adverse environmental impacts; to conserve natural resources; to promote
sustainable development; and to enhance the quality of life in Boston. Any
proposed project subject to .the provisions of Article 37 shall be LEED Certifiable
(U.S. Green Buildings Council) under the most appropriate LEED rating system.
Proponents are encouraged to integrate sustainable building practices at the pre-
design phase. Proposed projects which are subject to comply with Section SOB of
the Boston Zoning Code, Large Project Review, shall also be subject to the
requirements of Article 37.

The Proponent has demonstrated that the Proposed Project will meet the
requirements of Article 37. The Proponent has submitted a LEED 2009 for New
Construction and Major Renovations checklist indicating that the Proposed
Project is striving to achieve a LEED certified rating (4S points). The Proponent
is encouraged to continue to work with the Proposed Project team and research
additional sustainable and energy-efficient measures as the building design
develops, with the objective of achieving a higher level of LEED certification.

Prior to the Article SOB process completion the Proponent shall be required to
submit a Final Article 37 Submission Package. This package shall include the
most current and accurate LEED Checklist, together with a supporting
comprehensive narrative detailing how each of the points will be achieved.
Please refer to the USGBC guidelines as to what is deemed necessary to
demonstrate that the point has been achieved (or will be).

Solid and Hazardous Wastes




                                     - 8-
     Any known or potential hazardous wastes or contaminants on the Proposed
     Project site must be described, together with a description of remediation
     measures to ensure their safe removal and disposal, pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter
     21E and the Massachusetts Contingency Plan. The Proponent shall identify any
     potential hazardous wastes to be generated by the Proposed Project as well as
     the existence of underground storage tanks (OUSTs"), and above ground storage
     tanks (" ASTs") on the Proposed Project site. The Proponent shall also estimate
     potential waste generation and plans for disposal. Measures to promote the
     reduction of waste generation and to promote recycling in compliance with the
     City of Boston's recycling program must be described.


     Rodent Control

     The Proponent has stated that a rodent extermination certificate will be filed with
     the City of Boston as well on-going monitoring and treatment, in compliance
     with the City's requirements.



E.   URBAN DESIGN COMPONENT

     In accordance with Section 80B-5 and Article 28 of the Code, the Proposed Project
     made an initial presentation to the Boston Civic Design Commission ("BCDC")
     on May 1, 2012 and was voted to Design Committee for further review. The
     Proponent should continue to meet with the subcommittee until such time as the
     subcommittee is prepared to make a recommendation to the full BCDC (see
     further BCDC comments in Appendix 1).
     The project team should present alternative massing approaches that reduce the
     unbroken street wall along S. Huntington Av and creates variation in the roof
     line/ overall massing.
     This might be achieved by changing the 'E' footprint to an'S' footprint and
     moving some of the units at the top floor along S. Huntington Av to the rear
     within the parking level facing Jamaicaway. These units could have a direct
     relationship to the rear yard, be townhouse style units and be a possible location
     for 3 bedroom units.
     The overall parking seems excessive and may need to be reduced. Some of the
     reduction needs to come by eliminating the perpendicular parking spaces along
     S. Huntington Av to help reduce the amount of asphalt along Huntington Av
     and replaced it with green space ..




                                         -9-
      The design will need to improve the transition from the rear terrace to the rear
      yard as well as the connectivity between the two open spaces.
      The project team will need to present alternative designs for the building that
      have a less fragmented expression while allowing it to read as a couple of
      building joined together.
      This might be achieved by incorporating a '5' footprint and treating the 'C
      portion as a whole and the 'L' portion as a whole with the "entrance portion" of
      the building mass treated differently and more as a "knuckle" between the "5
      and the C".
      The building design should have a more residential scale to it. This might be
      achieved by the use of materials, proportions and building elements that make it
      feel less monolithic.
      Finally, the project team will need to present an alternative that maintains the
      existing 1914 building and incorporates it into the new project.


 We reserve the right to add additional concerns during the course of the process of
combined BRA staff, lAG, and BCDC review which may affect the responses detailed in
the DPlR.

The following urban design materials for the Proposed Project's schematic design must
be submitted for the DPlR.

F.    HISTORIC RESOURCES COMPONENT

      The Boston Landmarks Commission held an Article 85 Demolition Delay hearing
      on May 8, 2012. After the presentation by the proponent, public comments and
      commission discussion the Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC) voted
      unanimously to invoke the 90- day demolition delay for the 1914 Knight Building
      with 1950s additions at the former Home for Little Wanderers. The 1987
      residential building and the 1991 gymnasium building are exempt from review
      under Article 85. The Commission did not find that the applicant had exhausted
      feasible alternatives to demolition. The chair of the BLC encouraged the
      developer to work with the community to develop a project that the community
      could support, and invited the proponent to return to the Commission to request
      a waiver of the delay period if such a consensus is reached. Specific comments
      relevant to the expanded PNF made at the May 8th Article 85 hearing are
      summarized as follows:
      · Building rehabilitation is the most sustainable form of development.
      · Historic preservation creates skilled construction jobs.
      · The Knight Building is an anchor for the site. The Knight Building could
      accommodate new construction on the site, as it has in the past.
      · The historic context of the site as a whole should be considered, notably the
      character of revival style institutional buildings from the same era as the Knight
      Building along South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain. Many of these
      historic properties are intact or have been rehabilitated sensitively, including the
      addition of appropriate new construction.
      · It appears that the fill for the proposed project would encroach upon the root
      balls of mature trees that need to be protected. (BLC staff note: The trees along
      the cityside of the Emerald Necklace parkways are maintained by DCR and are
      within the historic parks' Landmark boundary.)
      · The proposed project is too large for the site.
      · The proposed project will create a wall between South Huntington Avenue and
      the Emerald Necklace.

The Proponents should also respond to the comments of the Boston Landmarks
Commission outlined in Appendix 1.



G.    PUBLIC NOTICE

      The Proponent will be responsible for preparing and publishing in one or more
      newspapers of general circulation in the city of Boston a Public Notice of the
      submission of the Draft Project Impact Report (DPIR) to the BRA as required by

                                           12
Section 80A-2. This Notice shall be published within five (5) days after the
receipt of the DPIR by the BRA. Therefore, public comments shall be transmitted
to the BRA within sixty (60) days of the publication of this Notice.

A sample Public Notice is attached in Appendix 4.

Following publication of the Public Notice, the Proponent shall submit to the
BRA a copy of the published Notice together with the date of publication.

RE:            161 South Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA
               Comments on Expanded Project Notification Form
I have reviewed the Expanded Project Notification Form (PNF) dated March 27, 2012
and submit the following comments for the Environmental Protection Component.
The BRG 161 South Huntington LLC, an affiliate Boston Residential Group, LLC (the
"Proponent") proposes to develop "161 South Huntington"- a 190,000 square foot (sf)
residential development that is the current site of the Home for the Little Wanders (the
"Proposed Project"). The Proposed Project includes 196 units and 170 parking spaces,
154 of which will be partially below grade and 16 at-grade visitor spaces. The Proponent
intends to demolish the existing three buildings, which range in height from 25 feet to 50
feet.



The Proponent shall not be required to conduct a qualitative pedestrian level wind study,
as the Proposed Project will be of similar in height and scale to the existing building on
the Proposed Project site and will be of similar height and scale to the surrounding
buildings. Accordingly, it is not likely that the Proposed Project will have an adverse

 Boston, MA 02201

 RE:    161 South Huntington Avenue, Jamaica Plain, MA

 Dear Mr. Golden,

 The Boston Parks and Recreation Department has reviewed the Expanded Project Notification
 Form (EPNF) issued for the project at 161 South Huntington Avenue, Boston, (the "Project")
 and offers the following comments.

 In accordance with City Ordinance 7-4.11, the proponent will be required to obtain approval for
 the Project from the Boston Parks Commission as it is within 100' ofthe Jamaicaway and
 Olmsted Park. The Commission review will include, but may not be limited to: building mass,
 height, and setbacks, site design, project open spaces, access, connections to the Jamaica Way,
 grading and drainage, views to the project from the public ways and parkland, as well as
 vegetation impacts and new planting.

 The project is also subject to the building height restrictions outlined in City Ordinance 7-4.10
 which sets a 70' height limit for portions of the building within 100' of the Jamaicaway, as
 measured from the mean grade of adjacent parkway sidewalk.

 This Department will also consider the impacts of this project on the Jamaicaway Greenbelt
 Protection Overlay District. The Project should endeavor to protect and improve the vegetative
 cover along this section of the parkway.

 161 South Huntington is fortunate to sit within an area of the city rich with open space resources.
 Based on our staff s preliminary impact assessment, we have found that the Project's anticipated
 increase in population (and therefore increase in park usage) of approximately 350 persons will
 not have a significant indirect impact on these open space resources due to the high ratio of open
 space to population in this area. Residents of 161 S. Huntington will have easy access to the
 active and passive recreation opportunities in the historic Emerald Necklace parks, including the
 green space links these parks provide to nearby neighborhoods. Also within walking distance of
 the Project are the Back of the Hill and Nira Rock urban wilds and the active recreation uses at
 Jefferson Park and McLaughlin Playground. The naturalistic character of Olmsted Park and the

 which the Project is located. The Parks Commission will be interested in learning how the
 Project proponents will contribute to enhancing and maintaining these exceptional spaces which
 define the character of this neighborhood and provide so much value to its residents and visitors.

 We will continue to review the project plans as they develop, with an eye to coordinating the
 work of the Commission with the work of your Board. Please contact this Department with any
 questions.

             RE: 161 South Huntington ("PNF")

             Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

                     Thank you for the 0ppOliunity to comment on the 161 South Huntington -Home for Little
             Wanderers: Notice of Project Notification Form (PNF) dated March 27,2012. The Expanded
             Project Notification Form is initiating a review of the following proposed 161 South Huntington
             Project.
                       BRG 161 South Huntington LLC is proposing to construct a new single residential
             building approximately 190,000 square foot building in the place of the existing surface parking
             lot, with approximately 196 apatiment units and parking for approximately 1'70 vehicles (154
             garage and 16 surface lot spaces). The project will maintain the two driveway entry/exit from
             South Huntington- with the southemmost entry widened as a one-way/right tum only; and
             nOlihem access driveway as a two-way.

                    The Boston TranspOliation Depatiment (BTD) is required to comment on the combined
             impacts of all the components of the project. The proponent needs to address these comments
             and concems when preparing future submissions as pati of the Aliicle 80 process as well as the
             Transportation Access Plan Agreement. Please note that upon BTD's final review and approval,
             a TranspOliation Access Plan Agreement codifying the transpOliation agreements and mitigation
             reached with BTD needs to be executed.

              Parl{ing
              The proponent is not proposing any new on-street parking spots area, there is also no public of-
              street parking in the area aside from a large surface lot across. The proponent is also providing
              on-site parking existing parking lot with proposed parking for approximately 170 vehicles (154
              garage and 16 surface lot spaces. BTD strongly encourages limiting any futiher increases in
              parking in the new development. Current trends indicate that electric hybrids will soon be a
              significant percentage of all vehicles on the road. BTD is aggressively promoting the installation
            J~~0,,;::;r:~;pOliing infrastructure for these vehicles. We request a commitment to dedicate 5% of the

                  parking in addition to car-share (which is currently not in the area within a .5 mi radius) to meet
                  climate actions goals set forth by the City.

                  The area is thoroughly served by MBTA public transit lines including Heath Street Green line
                  and 39 buses in the project radius is located one-half mile from the Brookline Village MBTA D-
                  line stop as well as 4 other bus line stops. BTD would like to thank the proponent for
                  accounting for bike parking accommodations (according to the City's Bike Parking Guidelines)
                  of one in each unit as well as at spaces in front of the building. BTD requests a commitment to
                  additional parking at the garage level for visitors and residents that can no accommodate the
                  space at the apartment level.

                  Transportation Demand Management
                   BTD thanks the proponent for the described TDM measures listed in the PNF, including transit
                  information posting in the building lobby, transpOliation coordinator and its commitment to EV
                  charging.

                  Service and Loading
                  We commend the proponents for providing off-street facilities for loading, moving & garbage
                  collection activity; and particularly the appointment of a transportation coordinator to manage
                  area move-in/out activities with posted "no idling" signage in loading and parking areas to
                  assist BTD's efforts of reducing emissions & traffic congestion caused by off-street truck
                  maneuvering and loading.

                  Site Plan
                  The proponent needs to submit an engineered site plan within the context of the surrounding
                  roadways at 1:20 scale depicting:

                          Vehicular Access and Circulation           -Service and Loading*

                  * Trash compactors/dumpsters need to be depicted as well.
                  Construction Management Plan
                  As the projects in the EPNF advance, BRG 161 South Huntington LLC and the other proponents
                  will be required to develop and submit a detailed Construction Management Plan (CMP) to BTD
                  for review and approval. The CMP will address TDM measures for construction workers,
                  proposed street occupancies, equipment stating, sidewalk relocations and hours of construction
                  work. BTD will work with the proponent to execute the CMP.

      Re: 161 South Huntington Avenue, Jamaica Plain

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

       All of the 11 undersigned members of the Impact Advisory Group ("IAG") for
the project proposed for 161 South Huntington Avenue (the "project") have reviewed
the Expanded Project Notification Form for the project, dated March 27, 2012
("EPNF"). Many of us attended the BRA's "informal" meeting at Sherrill House on
February 28, 2012; attended the scoping session at the BRA in the morning of April
11, 2012; attended the Article 80 and Article 85 public meeting at the MSPCA that
evening; and participated in the IAG meeting at Sherrill House on May 3, 2012. All
of us have discussed the project with members of the organizations we represent and
with other residents of Jamaica Plain and Mission Hill.

       We have the following comments on, and issues with, the project as presently
proposed in the EPNF and, therefore, recommend to the BRA that the project, as
presented, not be accepted or approved by the BRA and that the developer be
required to make substantive and substantial changes in the project and participate in
further in-depth reviews thereof with the IAG and the BRA.

      1.     Because the site is zoned Neighborhood Institutional under
             Article 55 of the Zoning Code, height is limited to 45 feet, the
             Floor Area Ration is 1.0 with a limitation, per Table I of Article
             55, that "for any Residential Use, as defined in Article 2A, there
             shall be a minimum lot size of one (1) acre and a maximum of
             four and one-half (4.5) dwelling units per acre" and the site, at
             least in part, is in a Greenbelt Protection Overlay District, the
             proposed project is not as of right and variances from these
John M. Fitzgerald
Page 2 of 5
May 16, 2012

            Zoning Code provisions will be necessary for the project to be
            constructed.

      2.    The row of institutions along the Avenue has served a variety of
            charitable purposes over the last 100 years, a long tradition that is
            valued by the Jamaica Plain/Mission Hill community. The
            construction of for-profit housing represents a change of use that
            is inconsistent with this tradition.

      3.    The proposed building, with a façade predominantly of metal and
            glass and relatively little red brick, is ugly and clashes with the look
            and feel of the other, mostly red brick, buildings on the western
            side of Huntington Avenue; and the set back is not consistent
            with the setbacks of the neighboring buildings. The project
            should have some graciousness, a boulevard feel and, in scale,
            style and materials, complement the neighboring institutions on
            the western side of the Avenue. It does not.

      4.    Occupying virtually the entire site on the Avenue side, from
            property line to property line, the project creates an unattractive
            wall on the Avenue that deprives residents and pedestrians on the
            Avenue side, of views of the Emerald Necklace at the Jamaicaway.
            With its predominantly metal and glass exterior, it looms
            unpleasantly over the downhill portion of the site.

      5.    The project fails to include restoration or appropriate adaptive re-
            use of the 1914 building on the project site.

      6.    The building is too big, too high and too large.

      7.    Because the developer has taken the public position that all of the
            investors in the project are private and that their identities are
            confidential and will not be disclosed, with the result that the
            community, the city and the BRA do not know who are the real
            parties with an interest in the project, the developer should be
            required by the BRA to disclose the identities of all such
            investors, including lenders, and the respective amounts
            invested/lent and to be invested/lent.
John M. Fitzgerald

May 16, 2012

      8.    Because the developer has taken the public position that all of the
            196 units proposed must be approved to make the project
            financially feasible, the developer should be required by the BRA
            to produce for review and analysis all relevant financial related
            documents so that the claim that all 196 units are necessary for
            financial feasibility can be evaluated.

      9.    The project appears intended to service a relatively transient
            population of short-term residents supplied by the medical area
            and not to create or support a stable residential community on the
            Avenue. If the project is unable to attract tenants from the
            Medical Area, it may by default become student housing. This
            necessitates the need for written enforceable provisions that will
            prevent the developer or any successor-in-interest that owns or
            controls the site, having student tenants or occupants at the site.

      10.   If any project in any form is approved for the site, institutions
            should be precluded from leasing units to be used by rotating
            casts of very short termers.

      11.   The project should be, and look like, Jamaica Plain/Mission Hill,
            not Medical Area South.

      12.   The number of units proposed (196) is too great.

      13.   There are not enough units large enough to accommodate families
            with children; the units are too small and too expensive to benefit
            the neighborhood.

      14.   The percentage of affordable units may meet the city minimum
            (13%) but the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council's
            recommended percentage (25%) makes more sense for Jamaica
            Plain/Mission Hill.

      15.   The traffic analysis to date is insufficient. The analysis should
            project conditions in the area, including the Heath Street
            intersection, to 2035, including the effect of other development
            projects that may take place in the area. Even at present, traffic
John M. Fitzgerald
Page 4 of 5
May 16, 2012

            conditions at the intersection of Heath Street and the Avenue are
            confusing and dangerous.

      16.   Both the traffic analysis and the LEED certification scoring need to be
            re-done given the recent decision by the MBTA to cease weekend E-
            Line service to Heath Street.

      17.   The project as proposed will require the removal of 53 mature trees.
            This is an unacceptable number.

      18.   There appear to be no plans for appropriate parking for
            construction workers during construction.

      19.   There should be no visitor or drop off parking in the front of any
            building on the site along the Avenue or elsewhere outside of any
            building on the site. Trash collection areas and facilities also
            should be inside any building on the site.

      20.   If any project in any form is approved for the site:

            (a)      The developer should be required to make a financial
                     donation in an amount commensurate with the size and
                     scope of any approved project at the site, to the Fund for
                     Parks and Recreation, an approved 501(c)(3) trust under
                     the direction of the Boston Parks & Recreation
                     Department, for the sole purpose of maintenance and
                     improvement of Jamaica Pond Park and the areas of the
                     Emerald Necklace on the Jamaicaway.

            (b)      There should be no signage visible from the Jamaicaway.

                                         Very truly yours,

Re:       161 South Huntington Avenue

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

Representatives of the Mission Hill Neighborhood Housing Services board and
staff and board members from the Back of the Community Development
Corporation met at a joint meeting with the developer and attorney for the
proposed 161 South Huntington Avenue. Mission Hill NHS feels that it cannot
support the project at this time and offers the following comments for further
study and discussion:

      ·   At a proposed 196 units, the project is too large. Current loning allows for
          a total of 17 units at that site,

      ·   The project fa9ade along South Huntington does not contextually fit with
          surrounding area of mostly brick, Materials and set back should be further
          reviewed, Additionally the project as currently designed creates a wall
          along South Huntington. We believe that there is opportunity to break the
          massing and allow view sheds for pedestrians through to the Emerald
          Necklace - the entrance lobby area offering one potential natural break.

      ·   The unit size, the large number of studios and small one bedroom units,
          and high proposed rent structure for these small units combine to create a
          development that will not strengthen the residential fabric of the area, The
          project appears intended to serve a relatively transient population of short-
          term residents, We believe this could be mitigated by providing fewer
          units at a size that is more likely to attract and maintain couples or families
          with children, Additionally the high rent structure does not support
          workforce housing for the LMA employees, We are concemed that these
          units will be marketed and master leased for institutional short-term
          housing. The units are too small and too expensive to benefit the
          residential neighborhoods of Mission Hill and Jamaica Plain.

      ·   The residential fabric of the Mission Hill neighborhood has been severely
          damaged economically and in terms of quality of life by the influx of
          undergraduates seeking housing. Mission Hill NHS maintains that all new
          projects in this area, including the proposed 161 South Huntington Avenue
          project, provide written enforceable provisions that will prevent the
          developer or any successor-in-interest that owns or controls the site from
          having undergraduate student tenants or occupants at the site.

      ·   The percentage of affordable units may meet the city's minimum under
          inclusionary loning (13%) but the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council's
          recommended percentage (25%) makes more sense for Jamaica
          Plain/Mission Hill.

      ·   The traffic analysis is insufficient. The intersection at Heath and South
          Huntington was not studied and at present does not function much of the
          day and is confusing and dangerous. The analysis should project
          conditions in the area, including the Heath Street intersection, and should
          show the potential cumUlative impact of other development projects that
          are antiCipated in the area ..

      ·   Both the traffic analysis and the LEED certification scoring need to be
          reviewed and adjusted given the recent decision by the MBTA to cease
          weekend E-Line service from Brigham Circle to Heath Street.

We believe the issues raised above and similar issues being raised by
neighboring groups necessitate additional review, analYSis, and substantive
modifications to the proposed project at 161 South Huntington. We request that
the BRA deny the requested expedited review and require further analysis and
community review as part of a DPIR review process.

We thank you for your consideration of our concerns.

      Re: 161 South Huntington Avenue, Jamaica Plain

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

Thank you for the opportunity to be part of the Impact Advisory Group ("lAG") for the
proposed project at 161 South Huntington Avenue (the "project").

I attended the BRA's meetings at the Sherrill House to meet with and listen to the
developer's team and the Article 80 and Article 85 public meeting here at the MSPCA.
I have discussed what I have learned from these meetings and the printed material with
others in our organization.

Overall, I can say that I was impressed with the openness of the process and what I
consider to be an honest effort on the part of the developer to listen too and be sensitive
too the community's needs and concerns.

With that said, we have serious concerns in relation to the traffic impact this and other
projects on South Huntington Avenue will have on our business (Angel Animal Medical
Center, Animal Care and Adoption Center and the SpaylNeuter Clinic).

We have done several client surveys over the past two years which clearly and
definitively point to traffic on both route 9 in Brookline and on South Huntington Avenue
as major factors in clients choosing to bring their animals to Animal Hospitals outside of
the city.
I believe the traffic study greatly underestimates the impact at the South Huntington
Avenue/Heath Street intersection, and at the Route 9/Huntington Avenue/South
Huntington Avenue intersections.

We feel that this traffic study should be revisited and that a long term traffic plan should
be part ofthis and any future proposed projects on South Huntington Avenue.

      Re: 161 South Huntington Avenue, Jamaica Plain

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:
      The Mount Pleasant Home wishes to comment on the project
proposed for 161 South Huntington Avenue (the "project"). We offer two
perspectives that inform our point of view about the proposed project:
      1) We a neighbor along the same block South Huntington Avenue
            and the owner of a $20 million project just completed on our
            property; and
      2) Two members of our governing board formerly lived in a Boston
            Residential Group owned and operated property at Church
            Park.

       Mount Pleasant I-lome considers itself fortunate to be one of several
not-For-profit institutions based on South Huntington Avenue whose
missions and purpose are to strengthen and diversify healthcare, housing,
and employment opportunities in the local neighborhood and Greater
Boston community .. We therefore have a keen interest in any proposed
changes of use and the potential impact on our work and mission these
changes may have. As an organization serving older residents who are
unable to live independently, we arc a 24/7 operation, requiring staffing at
all times of day and night. It is therefore our fondest hope that if 161
South Huntington is to become a commercial residential property, that
some of our employees could live just down the block from their work.

       Two members of the MPH Board of Trustees lived at Church Park
Apartments at the time it was announced that their affordable units were
going to become market rate. They would not be able to afford to stay.
We witnessed first hand the turmoil and disruption that this caused them.
One died before she was able to relocate. The other was suffering through
a series of medical complications and finally relocated to a new living
situation that required the financial support from her family until the end
of her life. We are deeply committed to do what we can to prevent a
reoccurrence of their unfortunate experience at the end of their lives when
having a place to live should have not been added to their challenges.

       During the twelve years of planning for the project we have just
completed, we learned first hand that there are many forces that finally
shape a project and many changes before the proper balance is found that
will allow a project to be successful. We are grateful for the input and
support from our neighbors who were very active in the extensive review
and approval of our project. We encourage the BRA and BRG to allow
for a thoughtful review of the many perspectives that the project is likely
to elicit so that the best of ideas can be combined to meet the
neighborhood's and the developer's needs. We expect to participate fully
in that process.

      MC1lll1l Pleasant Home's perspective can best be expressed in the
unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees at its April meeting to support
the eventual development of 161 South Huntington only if it includes
25% of its units as affordable and only if these affordable units will
continue to remain affordable in perpetuity. Such a commitment on the
part of 161 South Huntington would preserve the legacy of inclusiveness
shared by its neighbor institutions.


                                Sincerely,
                                Priscilla Ellis, President

               Re 161 South Huntington Avenue

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

Representatives of the Mission Hill Neighborhood Housing Services board and staff
and board members from the Back of the Community Development Corporation met
at a joint meeting with the developer and attomey for the proposed 161 South
Huntington Avenue. Back of the Hill CDC feels that it cannot support the project at
this time and offers the following comments.

    · The project is too large for the area.

    · The building does not conform to the neighborhood. A break in the maSSing
      would create a more welcoming view to the street and to the Emerald
      Necklace.

    · The unit size, and the overwhelming number of studios and small one-
      bedroom units and the proposed high rents do not support a true residential
      atmosphere. I believe the proposed number of small units and the high rents
       would serve as a trigger for short stay residents. The size and rents will not
      encourage use as workforce housing for the LMA employees with children.

    · The percentage of affordable units may meet the city's minimum under
      inclusionary zoning (13%) but the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council's
      recommended percentage (25%) makes more sense for Jamaica
      Plain/Mission Hill.

   · The traffic analysis is insufficient. The intersection at Heath and South
     Huntington was not studied and at present does not function much of the day
     and is confusing and dangerous. The analysis should project conditions in
     the area, including the Heath Street intersection, and should show the
     potential cumulative impact of other development projects that are anticipated
     in the area.



   · The traffic analysis need to be reviewed and adjusted given the recent
     decision by the MBTA to cease weekend E-Line service from Brigham Circle
     to Heath Street.


These issues raised above and similar issues being raised by neighboring groups

Subject: 161 South Huntington Avenue
Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,
As a resident of Jamaica Plain, living on Pond Street, I am writing to express my support for the
proposed project at 161 South Huntington Ave in Jamaica Plain. Having lived in Jamaica Plain for 18
years, I strongly believe that a residential complex, as proposed, is the best use for the site.
South Huntington Avenue is currently home to numerous medical institutions, offices, and institutional
buildings. The proposed pn::iect will bring much needed housing to that area of the City of Boston and
the site's proximity to public transportation will offer its residents many benefits. The project will also

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,
As a resident of Jamaica Plain, living at 16 Dresden Street, I am writing to express my support for the
proposed project at 161 South Huntington Ave in Jamaica Plain. Having lived in Jamaica Plain for
almost 6 years, I strongly believe that a residential use for the site, as proposed, is the best use for the
site.
The South Huntington Avenue location of the site is currently home to numerous medical institutions,
offices. and institutional buildings. The proposed project will bring much needed housing to that area of
the City of Boston and the site's proximity to public transportation will offer its residents many
benefits. The project will also provide the City with some new affordable rental housing opportunities

For these reasons, I encourage the Boston Redevelopment Authority to approve the proposed project at

 Subject: 161 S Huntington
 Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

I am writing in support of the proposed development at 161 S. Huntington. As a nearly 40 year resident of
Jamaica Plain, I am concerned about a rigid anti-development attitude that appears to be infecting my
community.
When I moved to JP in the 1970s, it was a troubled neighborhood with low property values and cheap rents.
Those of us who bought homes back then have seen a dramatic improvement in the community and, as a
result, an increasing pressure on housing.
I brought up three children in JP who can no longer afford to live there because real estate has become
prohibitively expensive. I was fortunate to buy when prices were low but, today, most people of average means
are priced out of Jamaica Plain due to the limited housing stock.
We need more development of residential units in order to keep Jamaica Plain thriving so that it can maintain
its special character.
Unfortunately, some people in the community have adopted the attitude "I've got mine" and oppose any further
development. This is a selfish and short-sighted approach.
Boston is successful because it's a city people want to work and live in. We need the additional units that 161
S. Huntington will bring along with the desperately needed construction jobs to help climb out of the current
economic recession.
I am urging the BRA to move forward with approvals on 161 S. Huntington. We need the units and we need the
jobs.

       RE: 161 South Huntington Ave.

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

I am writing to you in supp0l1 of the Boston Residential Group's housing development plan for
The Home for Little Wanderers' property at 161 So. Huntington Ave. in Jamaica Plain.

The Home was very pleased to have contracted with Boston Residential Group for the sale of
this propel1y as we feel they offer the highest and best use of the prope11y and at a purchase price
that will allow us to complete our plans for better serving the children who have resided there
with us. We specifically did not approach hotel or medical office developers as part of our
process in the attempt to be good neighbors by minimizing traffic congestion and avoiding a
transient clientele that would be in and out of the facility all day and night.

The Home has been serving children at 161 So. Huntington Ave. since it was built in 1914.
Today it is usee! as a therapeutic residential and special education pl'Ogram for boys and girls
ages 5 to 13. While the program itself is effective, the facility at 161 So. Huntington Ave. has
deteriorated considerably and has long since outlived its usefulness to our mission. Our own
year-long feasibility study with an eye toward renovating the property proved that. In the end,
the cost to The Home was unaffordable and we instead needed to expand the existing school and
residence on our 166 acre Longview Farm facility in suburban Walpole. Longview Farm has the
potential to provide the ideal setting for a new group of children to thrive, and the revenue from
Boston Residential Group's project is a much needed component of this plan.

When we realized it was not feasible stay at 161 So. Huntington Ave., I personally called 'upon
Mayor Menino and our City Council delegation to inform them not only of our plans, but also to
reiterate our intentions to remain a Boston-based agency. Although the bricks and mortar at ~61
So. Huntington Ave. will be gone, this does not affect The Home's mission or programs and The
Horne will continue to have a strong presence in the city not just via our corporate offices but in
three other residential settings in Mission Hill and Roxbury respectively, a clinic in Roslindale,
as well as behavioral health counselors based in almost 50 Boston Public Schools. I also
expressed our confidence in finding a buyer for 161 So. Huntington Ave. who would bring much
needed housing to the neighborhood and return the property to the city's tax roll.
John Fitzgerald

Our sale of 161 So. Huntington Ave. to the Boston Residential Group will accomplish that and
allows us to continue our mission to ensure the healthy behavioral, emotional, social and
educational development and physical well-being of children and families living in at-risk
circumstances; a mission that dates back to 1799 here in the city we call home.

The Home for Little Wanderers strongly supports Boston Residential Group's current plan for
our old site and we expect that the residents that will live there will be as good as neighbors to
the Jamaica Plain community as we have been all these years. J strongly urge the BRA to grant
this project your approval.

        to men in the corrections system who then staff two dedicated maintenance crews in the parks.
    ·   The Emerald Necklace Volunteer Program which brings over 900 volunteers into the
        park to accomplish park projects.

Current Conservancy projects and programs in the area of the proposed development include:
   · A multi-year Tree Initiative to care for the historic trees in the Emerald Necklace. Last
       year resulted in extensive pruning within the park as well as along the parkways; in 2012
       we will deep feed parkway trees and plant 40 new trees along the parkways. We work
       closely with the DCR arborist and others on this $90,000 per year initiative.
   · Snmmer Sundays in the Park, a series of 6 free movies and musical performances at
       Jamaica Pond and Olmsted Park; 300-800 attendees per event; budget: $30,000. Boston
       Properties has contributed $10,000 to this initiative to date.
   · Olmsted Park Woodlands Maintenance and Management restoration project, a
       demonstration project for woodlands restoration in an urban park; budget: $50,000.
   · Spring Pond Wildflower Meadow maintenance in Olmsted Park. Under Conservancy
       direction, this former skating rink is now maintained as a meadow habitat for butterflies, bees
       and other pollinators; budget $25,000.

Additionally, the Conservancy provides visitor services, tours and educational programs at the
Shattuck Emerald Necklace Visitor Center and retains active voting membership on the 5-member
Management Cabinet for the $92 million dollar Muddy River Flood Damage Rednction and
Ecosystem Restoration Project, which will restore the Muddy River from Olmsted Park to the Back
Bay Fens.

If selected for a $25,000 award, 2.7% of our 2012 budget of $896,000, we propose to apply $20,000
to the cost of Conservancy maintenance and restoration projects and programs and $5,000 to our free
programming and park visitor services.

Subject: Apartment project proposed for Home for Little Wanderers site in Jamaica Plain
Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,

As a Jamaica Plain resident, I strongly oppose a residential development of the size proposed
for the former Home for Little Wanderers site in Jamaica Plain on S. Huntington Avenue.

Any developer should be required to keep the current historic building and renovate it.

Perhaps 50 units would be more appropriate for that site.

Along with many other problems that such a large development would cause, there is almost
traffic gridlock (and packed buses/trolleys) often even before and after rush hour along the
section of S. Huntington Avenue that runs by the Home for Little Wanderers location. Adding
many more cars and persons who will use public transit will make the traffic problem worse.

The fact that another overly-large development is proposed right down the street should also
be taken into consideration. The two projects should be considered together in terms of their
impact on Jamaica Plain. Further, a plan for rational use of that section of S. Huntington
Avenue should be developed.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,

Marsha Bennett

Subject: Home for Little Wanderers
Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,

I have been reading about the planned development at the Home for Little Wanderers & was
at the presentation to the Jamaica Pond Ass'n the first week of May. At that meeting, I
commented that while there is much to like about the project (e.g. commitment to protect the
Jamaicaway border as a historic parkway with mature trees & greenery, LEED silver, bike
parking), I object to the demolition of the 1914 building. The South Huntington Ave. corridor of
historic institutions is a character-defining feature of Jamaica Plain. Old buildings such as the
Home for Little Wanderers are part of what make Boston special and unique. If they are torn
down & replaced, the area will soon look like it could be anywhere - it would be
indistinguishable from other locations in the northeast, or other parts of the country - midwest,
the south etc. I hope the developers will consult with innovators in adaptive reuse to find a
way to preserve the old building while creating additional housing - and perhaps other uses -
on this site.

Subject: Article 80 comments for 161 South Huntington Ave Project
For almost twenty five years, the historic buildings at 161 South Huntington Ave are what I have seen
every time I looked out my window from my residence at 44 Ellingwood St on the back of Mission Hill.
The buildings are aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I don't approve of the proposed demolition of 161
South Huntington Ave. Please delay the demolition of 161 South Huntington Ave. Require more
meetings on any changes that might affect these important historic buildings. Keep Boston's historic
legacy in its historic architecture.

I want the historic buildings at 161 South Huntington Ave to remain. Any additional building at this
address should respect the historic building. The nearby HopeLodge building is a good example of
respecting our community's wants & needs ..

I question the wisdom of the Home for Little Wanderers isolating the children in the suburbs & making
it so much more difficult for so many fragile families to stay connected.

My additional concerns for new development are many: 1) design was ugly & tacky 2) non-brick
materials did not fit in to the area 3) height 4) shadow 5) traffic 6) may bring down the value of my
home 7) increased density 8) lower quality of life.

Subject: 161 S. Huntington Project
Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,

I read of the proposed plan to develop the former site of the Home For Little Wanderers into a mammoth 196 unit
building. I am writing to clearly state my opposition to this project, and to detail but a few of the many reasons the
size of this proposed building would be a determent to the neighborhood of Jamaica Plain.

First, the amount of traffic going in and out of the building will seriously impede access to the neighborhood.
Huntington is a vital passageway into Jamaica Plain. It is heavily used, both by pedestrians and riders, and
critically important, it is also a trolly line. Those who drive Huntington Avenue know the delays that already occur
riding behind a trolley which stops every block, and is boarded by lines of residents, some handicapped, some
needing wheelchair access, some elderly, and so on. Note that it is not possible to pass a trolley legally on this
road, although some do out of frustration. Add to the congestion the recently established bicycle lanes, after the
death of one bicyclist who was hit by a truck not a block from 161 Huntington Avenue. This area is already known
to be dangerous from a traffic point of view. Adding 400 or more new occupants who live directly on the street is
not going to help .

. Second, would not be enough parking for everyone, despite the 170 or so planned parking spaces that are part of
  the proposed development. Factoring in households with second cars, visits from girlfriends, boyfriends, family
  members, visits from friends, deliveries, and so on, and an area that already does not have enough parking will
  find that current residents are then unable to find parking.

Third, as is well-known to the public, the MBTA is currently in dire financial straits and has proposed serious
cutbacks to the green line, including the line that services Huntington Avenue. There are fewer cars and
increased crowding on this line already. Many of the green line trains are now only comprised of TWO cars. The
number of people that would be brought in by a project of this size will without doubt effect the quality of
transportation for those who already use this trolly line (E train).

Fourth, the special character of the Jamaica Way will be compromised by the sheer number of unit windows and
visible interiors on what is now known as a leafy and pristine drive and a special element of the Jamaica Plain
area. The effect of its loss will be a blow to the neighborhood.

Mr. Fitzgerald, I could go on, but you may already see my and other residents' point. We are OPPOSED to the
size of this project. One hundred and ninety-six units is ridiculous and unnecessary. Please join us in a
commonsense approach to this project and a dialogue with the developers to outline the need for a more
appropriately sized building project, one that does not harm our neighborhood.

Thank you.

Subject: BRG Proposed development at 161 South Huntington Avenue in J.P.

This letter is submitted on behalf of the Jamaica Pond Association Board of Directors (.IPA) in
compliance with the Article 80 process associated with the development of 161 South
Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain. It is our understanding that the BRA is to make a
recommendation based upon a determination either (a) that there are few if any issues concerned
with the development as currently proposed that can easily be resolved or mitigated by the
developer or (b) that there are significant issues that will require further review by the BRA and
interested parties, including commLmity organizations. In response to the BRA deadline of May
16, 2012, for comments, the JPA strongly encourages the BRA not to approve the project as
currently proposed for the reasons detailed below. Based on the current proposal and the
unresolved questions and issues, the JPA Board voted at the Annual Meeting Oll May 7, 2012. to
oppose the project as proposed.

Issues:
Preservation: The JPA submitted a letter. dated May 8th , to the Landmarks Commission, in
which the .lP A supported the invoking of the demolition delay of 90 days to try to support the
preservation of the 1914 architecturally significant building that is currently a part of the Home
for Little Wanderers complex. While the JPA recognizes that the Landmarks Commission voted
on May 8th to order a 90-day demolition delay, the same arguments for preservation are
appropriate to include again as a significant issue in the Article 80 process. The JPA's
comments in our May 8th letter to the Landmarks Commission are incorporated within this
response as an attachment rather than repeating them here. The JP A notes that the development
tean1 has been able to incorporate preservation in some of its other projects in the City of Boston.
The proposed project faJls far short in this regard by seeking complete demolition of the 1914
building without further review based on public opposition.

Zoning Relief: The JPA recognizes that, under current zoning. the project will require at least
three zoning variances.
Architectural design: The JPA has, at times, not opposed limited zoning relief where the
architectural design of a proposed development has been refined so as to be attractive for the site
and beneficial to the neighborhood, especially as to scale, massing, and setbacks. The "long
wall" concept of the proposed building is completely inappropriate for the architecture along
South Huntington Avenue. This concept obstructs the present site lines to the Emerald Necklace.
While any new proposal may try to eliminate some of the current sight lines, the IPA is opposed
to the obliteration of all the present sight lines without further options. The exterior of the
building with metal, glass and some brick is not attractive or appropriate to the street or the area
and. t\lIiher, creates a tunnellike effect between the proposed "wall" and the recent addition to
the front of the VA Hospital complex

Height: The proposed building is too high given its length. The building is overwhelming.

Proposed Density: The IPA believes that the proposal for 195+ units is too dense for that
location. The community has not been shown anything trom the developer that supports the
need for 195+ units from an economic development point of view. In addition, the JPA is aware
of another proposed project at 105 South Huntington Avenue for 195+ residential units so it is
likely that there is a potential of 400 total units to be built in close proximity ..

Affordable Housing: While the City of Boston requires a 13% ratio for low income housing,
the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council (JPNC) has publicly supported a level of25%. The
IPA supports the JPNC's efforts in this and t)ncourages the developer to come to an agreement
with the JPNC.

Target rental market: The developer appears to be marketing toward a transient population
tram the medical area of one or two adults per unit through offering studio, one and some 2
bedroom apartments. The JPA, however, recognizes a need for apartments for families. The
project should inc.lude more units for families, which would better serve the needs of residents of
Jamaica Plain.

Impact on Parking by contractors: The Plan description mentions briefly in two locations that
up to 150 workers will be on site for a period of a year plus during construction. There will be
very limited parking on-site. The plan listed a few generic options that would be available for
the contractors. While the developers are likely aware of a very large number of parking spaces
across the street at the V A Hospital complex that also includes a garage, it is unlikely that the
BRA is aware that many cars coming to the V A for an appointment may have to drive around on
celiain days for up to 10-15 minutes waiting for a parking spot to become available. Since the
V A complex is actually day appointments only and not a true hospital with beds, it is unfair to
veterans to have contractors take some of those spaces. This is further compounded by the VA
planning to construct another garage next to the current one where parking spaces are now, and
construction will occur over the next 12-18 months so there will be additional constI1lction in the
immediate area. In addition. visitors to Sherrill House have to park out on South Huntington
Avenue many times and parking by construction workers on the street would create a hardship.
The Development team must come up with a much more definitive and detailed plan that is
reviewed. and agreed to. by all abutters including the VA. and not just representatives of the
City.

Hours of construction: The plan identities the hours of construction allowed but does not go
into detail about early hours of construction that may significantly impact residents in
neighboring facilities. The JPA expects comments from immediate abutters regarding the impact
to their residents and clients.

Construction issues: The plan should detail a series of steps the developer will take to mitigate
and resolve issues from abutters. This should include weekly meetings with the contractor
initially and subsequently monthly so abutters are aware of upcoming work and can identify
issues that have arisen for the contractor to resolve in a timely fashion. These meetings should
also be open to a representative from the City.

Traffic studies: While there were a number of analyses regarding traffic. the studies appear to
suggest a build and no build scenario but appear to not consider any other development or traffic
impacts looking forward that one would nommlly expect to see. For instance. the proposed
development of another 195 units at 105 South Huntington Avenue and resulting impact on
traffic have not been mentioned and needs to be considered going forward. Lastly. the traffic
analyses do not mention the demolition of the Casey Overpass and resulting ground solution
which may increase traffic along Centre St. and South Huntington Avenue as it is ~mother
alternative roadway to construction delays. In so far as any traffic studies assume subway
service at Heath St.. it needs to be re-examined due to the MBTA cutback of subway service
back to Brigham Circle etTective July 1,t on weekends.

Other developments: The BRA intentionally is planning to keep the 161 and 105 South
Huntington Avenue projects on separate tracks. Based on comments from several speakers,
which were endorsed by the JPA at the public meeting under the Article 80 process, it clearly
would be more appropriate to recognize that both of these projects, which appear to be on
similar time tracks and of similar size. must be considered together given their proximity to one
another. In this same regard. the JPA has recently heard of a third potential development on a
vacant lot on South Huntington Avenue slightly closer to Huntington Avenue. If this is likely to
come along in the near future, South Huntington Avenue may have three developments under
construction at the same time. This should be considered in any studies.

Support of Jamaica Pond Park and neighboring parkland: During the JPA meeting on May
7th, the developer was advised of the JPA's position that developers of major projects bordering
parkland in this area, make a contribution to the Foundation for Boston Parks and Recreation, an
approved 501 (c )(3) trust under the direction of the Boston Parks and Recreation Depaltment. In
this case. the JPA has asked that the donation be at least fifty thousand dollars. The neighboring
parklands and Jamaica Pond Park provide a great marketing opportunity that benefits its
residents and also the developer.

Summary: For the above reasons, the JPA believes it is appropriate that the BRA slow down the
proposed development of 161 South Huntington Avenue to allow the community and
neighborhood associations to have more input into the project and that additional time be
allowed for the developer and all interested parties to resolve the many significant and
substantial differences of opinion concerning aspects of this development that exisL The
Jamaica Pond Association wants whatever development is approved for the site to be a project
that both the developers and the Jamaica Plain and Mission Hill communities will be proud of,
To allow this process to go forward quickly in a very short time period with the number of
neighborhood organizations opposed to the project as presented would be both inappropriate and
wrong.

Ms. Ellen Lipsey
Executive Director
Boston Landmarks Comm ission
I City Hall Square
Boston, MA 0220 I

Dear Ms. Lipsey,

As chairperson ofthe Jamaica Pond Association, I am writing this letter on behalf of the Jamaica
Pond Association to request that the Boston Landmarks Commission invoke the Demolition
Delay associated with the 1914 building at the Home for Little Wanderers site at 161 South
Huntington Avenue, Jamaica Plain. At our monthly meeting of the Board of Directors held this
evening, the JPA Board of Directors voted to support the efforts of the Boston Preservation
Alliance by submitting this letter.

Five members of the Jamaica Pond Association's Board of Directors attended the public meeting
held on April 11th, for the Article 80 process along with the Article 85 process relating the
proposed development of 161 South Huntington Ave. site in Jamaica Plain. The al1icle 85
process related to the proposed demolition of the three buildings currently on the site of the
Home for Little Wanderers. Based on the number of comments at that public meeting in favor of
this delay and also at the JPA meeting held with the developer on May 7th, it is appropriate that
the Commission invoke this delay to allow time for further review.

During this tirst public hearing, there were a number of comments from residents and
organizations who spoke on behalf of the preservation of older buildings in the Boston area. The
main building at the site was built ill 1914 and is part of a group of early 20 th century buildings in
this area on South Huntington Avenue that brings great character and history to South
Huntington Avenue and Jamaica Plain.

It is both appropriate and necessary for the Landmarks Commission to invoke this delay and to
require the developer to review the comments about preservation and to come up with an
alternative that maintains the character of that site. If the 1914 building is demolished quickly
without the requested delay, this would preclude the ability to incorporate the architecture that
has existed for nearly 100 years at this location. Many of the institutions along South Huntington
Avenue have successfully made improvements and renovations that allowed the ability to
maintain some of the older character of South Huntington Avenue. In contrast, the developer of
this site has proposed an extremely long "building wall" along South Huntington Ave. with a
design of some brick but with metal and glass that does not appear to blend in with any other
architecture and is not appropriate for Jamaica Plain.
Notably, the four story hotel that is set to open in June located next to 105 South Huntington
Avenue maintained some of the original building.

The JPA respectfully requests the Landmarks Commission to invoke the demolition delay at the
site for fthe 1914 building. Incorporating the 1914 building into the project will break up the
extremely long "street wall" building now being proposed. This delay will allow all parties, and
most imp0l1antly the community, more time and input to the project. The development team
should have another public meeting to discuss its review and other alternatives. In closing. since
May is preservation month in the City of Boston as announced by the Mayor, it is only
appropriate that the Commission invoke this delay at this time.

Subject: Proposed development at 161 South Huntington Avenue in J.P.
My name is Pamela Bender and I live at 15 Wayburn Road in Jamaica Plain. I urge the BRA not to approve the
proposed development at 161 South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain for the following reasons:

    · The size of the rental units proposed is very small and will clearly be marketed to wealthy, single people
      who will most likely be transient. Families, which are an important part of the fabric of JP will not be able
      to live in this development.
    · The rental price of the units is very high. The rents in this development will be beyond the reach of the
      majority of people who currently live in JP.
    · The design of the building does not fit in with the neighborhood. It will be essentially a gated community
      within the Emerald Necklace.


In summary I feel that this development will not contribute anything to my community. It will provide housing to
wealthy people who will live there for a short period of time while working in the Longwood Medical area or
downtown who will not be committed to the long-term well-being of the neighborhood .

I would like to see housing on this part of South Huntington Avenue but it should be housing that is affordable for
people who work or who may have family members at the Mt. Pleasant Home or the Sherrill House. I hope the
BRA will not approve the current proposed development and work with the community so that we may have a
development on this site that will be beneficial to us and the city as a whole.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

 I write to you on behalf of the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Council concerning the Article
 80 large project review of 161 South Huntington Street in Jamaica Plain, formerly the
 Home for Little Wanderers, We ask that the BRA conduct a more extensive community
 process in the case of this property by hosting additional community meetings that are
 well-publicized, with the goal of achieving consensus in the neighborhood. Given the
 scope and importance of this property, we feel it is important that the community has
 ample opportunities to have a voice in the review process.

 Re: 161 South Huntington Avenue

 Dear Mr. Russell and Mr. Fitzgerald,

 There are altemativesto demolition that should be considered. The
 residential proposal would be so much more creative and environmentally
 sensitive if elements from the existing structures were included.

 The property has an authentic relationship to the landscape from the
 parkway but also from South Huntington, the heavily treed and hilly lot
 offers glimpses of the historic Olmsted Park and visually connects too with
 the conservation land closer.to Heath Street. Instead of a monolith
 apartment building there could be options providing a variety of residential
 experiences. The current proposal is clearly based on efficiency of
 construction with the goal of maximizing the number of units many of which
 are very small.

.. Enclosed is a copy of the 1930 frontispiece illustration from The Advocate,
   New England Home for Little Wanderers newsletter. The 1914 fa«ade
   illustrated appears to be the SO\lth wing facing towards Jamaica Plain;
   interesting that the side view and not South Huntington Avenue would be
   the organization's public image. This face of the building however was
   obscured with the 2-story office addition designed by The Architectural
   Collaborative in 1959.
.   '




           The enclosed material from NEHLW archives also includes details on the
         1959 additions, further research at the Rotch Library special collections
         gives the information that architects John and Sarah Harkness were the
         principals in charge. The Feb, 1960 Advocate refers to the TAC designed
         additions, costing $446,000 [equivalent to approx.$3.5 mil in 2012].
         The masonry and glass horizontal "international" style of the single story
         dining room wing is like other TAC designed residential spaces of the period
         and feels integrated into the landscape. Could there be a development that
        reuses both the TAC dining room wing and theoriginal19l4 south wing-
         the iconic 1930 NEHLW fa~ade?

        . There are additional issues with the proposed project, several related to
          South Huntington Avenue and the pedestrian experience-
          the loss of so many large trees, the widened driveways adjacent to narrow
          sidewalks, the parking in the front. The traffic consultants did not study the
          Heath and South Huntington Avenue intersection, an odd omission.

        The Jamaicaway is a very heavily traveled roadway, the bucolic image is
        deceiving, the daily traffic is very urban and congested. The large trees
        (the inventory lists dozens) should be preserved, not just for the drive by
        experience from the Jamaicaway but for the views from South Huntington as
        well.

                                          Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

                                          The Boston Preservation Alliance has reviewed the Project Notification
                                          Form for a new 196-unit residential development project by Boston
                                          Residential Group at 161 S. Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain and we
                                          offer the following comments.

                                          Proposed Demolition
'o/\'dlurr. C         r· ,II   '1 >~I'\   The Alliance is greatly concerned about the proposed demolition of the
                                          1914 Knight Children's Center on the New England Home for Little
                                          Wanderers campus. The project as proposed would destroy what the
                                          Alliance feels is an important part of the area's architectural heritage and
                                          replace it with a development that is unsympathetic to the site and to the
                                          neighborhood.

                                          The Alliance does not object to new residential development at this
                 'r "                     location. We also do not oppose demolition of the other buildings that
                                          make up the campus or the 1950s addition to the historic building.
                                          However, we strongly oppose the developer's rush to demolish the
(.:nl Jav                                 historic Knight Children's Center without fully exploring alternatives that
                                          would preserve it and sensitively integrate it into the proposed new
                                          development. For this reason, we urge the Boston Redevelopment
                                          Authority not to approve the Project Notification Form as submitted.

                                          For over 100 years the west side of South Huntington Avenue has been
                                          home to a group of non-profit charitable institutions that have contributed
                                          greatly to the city's quality of life. With their backs to Frederick Law
                                          Olmstead's leafy Jamaicaway, these four to five story brick buildings were
                                          designed in a dignified Colonial Revival style to complement each other
                                          and provide a graceful transition to the denser settlement of central
                                          Jamaica Plain. Known locally as "institution row," most of these buildings
                                          are still intact or have been adaptively repurposed to serve new uses in a

                               Mr. John Fitzgerald
                               May 16, 2012
                               Page 2

                               keeping the original buildings intact while improving their environmental
                               performance dramatically.

                               The New England Home for Little Wanderers was constructed in 1914
                               according to designs by the architects Brainerd and Leeds of Boston. Like
                               its neighbors, it is a sturdy brick building of human scale that is eminently
                               adaptable for residential use.

                               Alternatives to Demolition
                               The Alliance believes that the original building can be re-used, with
                               adjacent elements of new construction that connect to it carefully in such
                               a way as to preserve the majority of the developer's proposed program.
                               However, it should be noted that the proposal's Floor Area Ratio and
                               height exceeds that allowed by right.

                               Representatives of the Alliance met with the developer several times to
                               discuss what we believe to be viable alternatives. At the most recent
                               meeting the Alliance presented a specific proposal that preserves the
                               1914 building with only a modest reduction in the number of units, and
                               with comparable construction costs. While our proposal was by no means
                               intended to resolve all issues for the project. we believe it is a starting
                               point for a conversation about how the developer can make a good faith
                               effort to preserve the building. The developer told us in that meeting that
                               he would not further consider this alternative due to its cost implications,
                               but he has not shared with us financial information to support this claim.

                               At the May 8 Boston Landmarks Commission hearing, the Commission
                               unanimously and enthusiastically voted to invoke, and not waive,
                               demolition delay. Several Commissioners spoke eloquently in support of
                               the Alliance's position that this piece of Jamaica Plain's history should not
                               be demolished if that can be avoided.

                               Need for More Community Input
                               A great deal of alarm and dismay has been expressed by Jamaica Plain
                               residents and community groups about the speed with which construction
                               plans are moving forward. The Article 80/85 community meetings were
                               compressed into a single event that was attended by about 40 people, not
                               one of whom spoke in favor of the project.

                               In light of this, the BRA must ensure that there is adequate time to review
l.hllltyH'll!                  viable alternatives that are more respectful of the architectural heritage of

                                                                    Project Overview


                             On behalf of BRE/CPD, LLC (an Equity Office affiliate and referred to
                             hereinafter as Equity Office), the current site owner, and The McKinnon
                             Company, the developer, Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. (VHB) has conducted a
                             Transportation Impact Study (TIS) for the development of a portion of 180
                             Cambridgepark Drive, together with a portion of 150 Cambridgepark Drive (the
                             "Property"). The proposed development includes a multi-family residential
                             development with 398 units in a single building of approximately 441,000 GFA,
                             supported by auto and bicycle parking (the "Project").

                             In 2008, the Planning Board approved a 372,000 SF R&D/Office project at 150
                             and 180 Cambridgepark Drive. Equity Office is now seeking to amend the
                             Planning Board's approval of the R&D/Office development as well as
                             amendments to previously issued permits for the existing office buildings at 125
                             and 150 CambridgePark Drive, to allow the Project.

                             The project review process was initiated by holding an informal meeting with
                             City Staff in January, 2012. Members of the development team, consulting team,
                             and City officials met to review the Project as it is generally proposed.
                             Subsequently, VHB prepared a request for a scoping letter for the Transportation
                             Impact Study, submitted to the City of Cambridge Traffic, Parking and
                             Transportation (TP&T) Department on January 11, 2012.

                             A Draft TIS was submitted to TP&T on February 17, 2012, and comments were
                             received in TP&T letter dated March 1, 2012. This TIS responds to those
                             comments in conformance with the current City of Cambridge Guidelines for
                             Transportation Impact Study required under Article 19 Special Permit Project
                             Review of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The TIS document
                             comprises three components, as follows:

                                 Project Overview, describing the transportation characteristics of the proposed
                                 project and presenting the required Planning Board Criteria Performance

Project Overview
                             The Project includes a multi-family residential development with 398 units in a
                             single building of approximately 441,000 SF, supported by auto and bicycle
                             parking.

                                 Figure A presents a site location map
                                 Figure B presents an aerial view of the proposed site and its context
                                 Figure C presents the existing site plan

                             The approximately 4.2 acre project site, shown in Figure C, includes a portion of
                             the 150 Cambridgepark Drive parcel and the majority of the 180 Cambridgepark
                             Drive parcel, which abuts the 180R Cambridgepark Drive parcel, also owned by
                             Equity Office. In addition, Equity Office owns 125 Cambridgepark Drive,
                             bringing its total ownership to 7.95 acres. There are two existing office buildings
                             within the Equity Office ownership, 125 and 150 Cambridgepark Drive, which
                             are approximately 184,000 SF and 250,000 SF, respectively.

                             The site plan for the proposed residential project is presented in Figures D.1
                             through D.5. As a result of the Project, there will be an overall reduction of
                             approximately 30 spaces on the 125, 150, 180 and 180R parcels. While the Project
                             will include the construction of 398 residential units on the project site, together
                             with 398 parking spaces, the reduction in parking will be accomplished by
                             sharing of some of those spaces with the nearby office uses. In order to
                             accomplish this reduction in parking and sharing, a reduction in the existing
                             parking ratio for the buildings owned by Equity Office (125 and 150
                             Cambridgepark Drive) is required and is part of the special permit amendment
                             request being submitted to the Planning Board.

                             The project program is summarized in Table A, and the parking demand and
                             supply analysis is presented in Section 9 of the TIS.

                             A total of 1,623 parking spaces are currently registered at the Existing Property,
                             allocated as follows:

                             323 spaces allocated to 100 Cambridgepark Drive

                             558 spaces allocated to 125 Cambridgepark Drive

                             742 spaces allocated to 150 Cambridgepark Drive

                             As noted above, the Residential Building's parking facility will contain 398
                             parking spaces. In addition, however, the following parking changes will be
                             implemented:

                             (i) the Project will displace 428 existing surface parking spaces;

                             (ii) 125 Cambridgepark Drive's right to use spaces on the Existing Property will
                             be reduced from 558 to 370 spaces; and

                             (iii) 150 Cambridgepark Drive's right to use spaces on the Existing Property will
                             be reduced from 742 to 502 spaces.

                             Because 100 Cambridgepark Drive is not owned or controlled by the Applicant,
                             323 spaces must be maintained for 100 Cambridgepark Drive. In fact, pursuant
                             to a recorded easement in favor of 100 Cambridgepark Drive, the owners of 150,
                             160 and 180R Cambridgepark Drive are required to provide a total of 339 spaces
                             for 100 Cambridgepark Drive. Nonetheless, since only 323 are registered with
                             the City, the Applicant is using 323 as the number of required parking spaces for
                             100 Cambridgepark Drive, resulting in the additional 16 spaces being absorbed
                             into the number of spaces available for 125, 150 and 160 Cambridgepark Drive.

                             In addition, it is noted that there is another legally binding easement for 110
                             parking spaces in favor of 200 Cambridgepark Drive that is binding on 150 and

                             160 Cambridgepark Drive. After construction of the Residential Building,
                             approximately 70 of those will be made available on the 160 Cambridgepark
                             Drive site and approximately 40 of those will be made available on the 150
                             Cambridgepark Drive site.

                             These 110 spaces also must be absorbed into the number of spaces available for
                             125, 150 and 160 Cambridgepark Drive. The easements are in favor of unrelated
                             third parties and have no expiration date, and therefore are legally binding in
                             perpetuity.

                             Upon construction of the Project, a total of 1,593 parking spaces will remain on
                             the Existing Property. Accordingly, the Project will create 398 new units of rental
                             housing in addition to the existing office uses, but will result in a net reduction of
                             30 parking spaces. As a result, the parking spaces dedicated for existing office
                             uses will be reduced from 1623 to 1195 (428 space reduction).

                             A total of 204 bicycle parking spaces will be provided in two bike rooms located
                             inside the front of the building adjacent to the pedestrian lobby, with direct
                             access from Cambridgepark Drive. Access to the bicycle parking, and layouts of
                             the bicycle rooms, are shown in Figures D.3 through D.5. In addition, bicycle
                             racks for approximately 10 bicycles will be provided outside of the buildings to
                             accommodate short-term visitor bicycle parking. The proponent has begun
                             discussions with the City of Cambridge TP&T Department to look for ways to
                             increase the amount of bicycle storage in the Project.

                             As shown in Figure C, the parcels currently owned by Equity Office have three
                             existing vehicular access points on the south side of Cambridgepark Drive
                             (parcels 180, 150 and 180R), and one vehicular access point on the north side
                             (parcel 125). The latter driveway will remain unaffected by the Project.

                             As shown in Figures D.1 and D.2, the project site will be served by the existing
                             driveway on the west side of the 150 Cambridgepark Drive building and a
                             slightly modified existing driveway located at approximately the mid-point of
                             the existing surface parking fronting Cambridgepark Drive. The existing
                             driveway on the east side of the 100 Cambridgepark Drive building would
                             remain. In addition, a gated emergency access point will be provided at the
                             western end of the Cambridgepark Drive frontage.

                             The TIS study area for the proposed project, as defined by the City of Cambridge,
                             is shown in Figure E.

                             Based on the TIS analysis, the Project has been evaluated within the context of
                             the Planning Board Criteria to determine if the Project has any potential adverse
                             transportation impacts. Exceeding one or more of the Criteria is indicative of a
                             potentially adverse impact on the City's transportation network. However,
                             pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Board will consider mitigation
                             efforts, their anticipated effectiveness, and other information that identifies a
                             reduction in adverse transportation impacts.

                             The Planning Board Criteria consider the Project's vehicular trip generation,
                             impact to intersection level of service and queuing, as well as increase of volume
                             on residential streets. In addition, pedestrian and bicycle conditions are
                             considered. A discussion of the Criteria set forth by the Planning Board is
                             presented in the final section of this TIS, and the Planning Board Criteria
                             Performance Summary is presented below.

                                             Transportation Impact Study

                             This Transportation Impact Study for the proposed development of 180 and a portion
                             of 150 Cambridgepark Drive in Cambridge, MA (the project) describes existing and
                             future transportation conditions in the study area in accordance with the City of
                             Cambridge Fifth Revision (April 7, 2004) of the Transportation Impact Study
                             Guidelines. The study area for the TIS includes Cambridgepark Drive and Alewife
                             Brook Parkway, and consists of five study-intersections, as previously shown in Figure
                             E.

                             This section includes inventories of physical and operational conditions in the study
                             area including roadways, intersections, crosswalks, sidewalks, on-street and off-street
                             parking, transit facilities, and land uses in the study area. Transportation data that
                             were collected and compiled are presented, including automatic traffic recorder counts,
                             intersection turning movement counts, pedestrian and bicycle counts, vehicle crash
                             data, and transit service data.



           1. Inventory of Existing Conditions
                             a. Roadways

                             The site is located on Cambridgepark Drive, which provides direct access to the
                             existing office buildings on the parcels owned by Equity Office, as well as other office
                             buildings and a residential building. Cambridgepark Drive intersects Alewife Station
                             Access Road and Alewife Brook Parkway east of this location. Figure C, previously
                             shown, shows the roadway layout near the project site on Cambridgepark Drive.

                             b. Intersections

                             The project study area includes the following five study intersections which are
                             illustrated in Figures 1.B.1 through 1.B.5.

                             1.   Alewife Brook Parkway / Route 2
                             2.   Alewife Brook Parkway / Cambridgepark Drive

                             5.   Alewife Station Access Road / Route 2 Ramp (Un-signalized)

                             The Alewife Brook Parkway/Route 2 intersection is complex, and is controlled by four
                             (4) separate, but coordinated, traffic signals, all of which are evaluated.

                             On-Site Parking

                             A total of 1,623 parking spaces are currently registered at the Existing Property,
                             allocated as follows:

                             323 spaces allocated to 100 Cambridgepark Drive
                             558 spaces allocated to 125 Cambridgepark Drive
                             742 spaces allocated to 150 Cambridgepark Drive.

                             As noted above, pursuant to a recorded easement in favor of 100 Cambridgepark
                             Drive, the owners of 150, 160 and 180R Cambridgepark Drive are required to provide a
                             total of 339 spaces for 100 Cambridgepark Drive. Nonetheless, since only 323 are
                             registered with the City, the Applicant is using 323 as the number of required parking
                             spaces for 100 Cambridgepark Drive.

                             The existing parking supply is summarized in Table 1.c.1. It should be noted that the
                             easement for 110 parking spaces in favor of 200 Cambridgepark Drive (that is binding
                             on 150 and 160 Cambridgepark Drive) is excluded from Table 1.c.1.

                             To determine current use of these parking spaces, parking occupancy counts were
                             performed on Thursday, November 17, 2011. The counts were taken at 10 AM and 12
                             PM to reflect the peak period of parking occupancy associated with office use. The
                             total numbers of vehicles parked were 539 and 569 at 10 AM and 12 PM, respectively.
                             Approximately 25 occupied parking spaces comprised users from 200 Cambridgepark
                             Drive, and these spaces were eliminated from the 569 parking space peak utilization,
                             resulting in a peak occupancy of 544 spaces for 100, 125 and 150 Cambridgepark Drive.

                             These three buildings are only partially occupied, however, and it is necessary to
                             adjust the observed peak parking occupancy to reflect demand for the buildings when
                             fully occupied. For 125 and 150 Cambridgepark Drive, actual building occupancies
                             based on leasing information and a walkthrough survey performed by Equity Office on
                             January 31, 2012, indicate that 125 Cambridgepark Drive is currently 38 percent%
                             occupied, and 150 Cambridgepark Drive is currently 29 percent occupied. According
                             to the owner of 100 Cambridgepark Drive is currently 89 percent occupied. The
                             resulting weighted average building occupancy (based on building gross floor area) of
                             all three buildings is 46 percent.

                                 As summarized in Table 1.c.2, the parking demand for 125, 150 and 100
                                 Cambridgepark Drive adjusted for building occupancy is 1,184 parking spaces, or 2.10
                                 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of office space. Because of the pre-existing
                                 easement and registration, notwithstanding the actual occupancy rate, the Applicant is
                                 required to provide at least 323 spaces for 100 Cambridgepark Drive, and the resultant
                                 ratio of 2.48 is also shown in the table.

                                 Upon construction of the Project, a total of 1,593 parking spaces will remain on the
                                 Existing Property. Accordingly, the Project will create 398 new units of rental housing
                                 in addition to the existing office uses, but will result in a net reduction of 30 parking
                                 spaces. As a result, the parking spaces dedicated for existing office uses will be
                                 reduced from 1623 to 1195 (428 space reduction).

                                 Off-Site Parking

                                 On-street parking is not available on any of the study area streets, and all parking in
                                 the area is accommodated in private lots or the MBTA garage. The MBTA Alewife
                                 Station parking garage, which provides approximately 2,733 parking spaces, is
                                 regularly closed on most week-days before 10 AM because it is full. This was the case
                                 on the day of the parking survey, and overflow MBTA parking is currently provided
                                 south of Cambridgepark Drive on the east side of Alewife Station Access Road.

                                 Figure 1.D illustrates existing Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)
                                 services in the study area. The site is located within a quarter of a mile of Alewife
                                 Station, the terminal for the Red Line and several MBTA Bus routes.

                             Buses terminating at Alewife Station include MBTA routes 62, 67, 76, 79, 84, 350 and
                             351. The passenger pickup and drop-off areas are inside the MBTA parking structure
                             and provide shelter and scheduling information for all of the buses. These routes
                             provide access to and from the west along the Route 2 corridor. Only routes 62, 76 and
                             350 operate during the weekends and most routes run on 20 to 30 minute headways
                             during the weekday peak periods. Routes 62, 76 and 351 provide service through
                             Lexington towards Hanscom and Bedford. Routes 67, 79 and 84 provide service into
                             Arlington while Route 350 provides service to Burlington.

                             The Red Line subway line runs on 4.5-minute headways during peak hours, with south
                             eastbound trains destined for both Braintree and Ashmont. The Red Line connects
                             with the Green Line at Park Street and the Orange Line at Downtown Crossing.
                             Connections to all southern branch commuter rail lines and the Silver Line are made at
                             South Station. In addition, a connection with the Fitchburg commuter rail line is
                             available at Porter Square station. Commuter parking spaces are available at Alewife
                             at a rate of $7.00 per day. Bicycle parking is also available with approximately 174
                             spaces in the garage.

                             Three Zipcar vehicles are available inside the garage at Alewife Garage, while two
                             others are available on Cambridgepark Drive.

                             e. Land Use

                             Figure 1.E illustrates land uses in the Cambridgepark Drive area surrounding the site,
                             which also shows the proposed project uses. The area is largely characterized by
                             commercial, R&D and office land use, and the presence of the Alewife MBTA terminal.
                             In addition, there is a residential development, constructed relatively recently, at 30
                             Cambridgepark Drive, and restaurant land uses within the MBTA station structure.




           2. Data Collection
                             a. ATR Counts

                             Automatic traffic recorders (ATR) were installed on December 6, 2011 for a period of 48
                             consecutive hours on Alewife Brook Parkway and Cambridgepark Drive. These
                             ATR's, shown in Figure E, were located as follows:

                             1.   Alewife Brook Pkwy north of Cambridgepark Dr
                             2.   Cambridgepark Dr west Alewife Station Access Rd

                             Traffic volume summaries for these ATR locations are presented in Tables 2.a.1 and
                             2.a.2. These data, representing the averages of data collected over two weekdays,
                             illustrate the daily variations of traffic demands and the directional flow of traffic over
                             the course of an average weekday. Electronic ATR data collection files are submitted
                             on the CD accompanying this document.

                             Twelve-hour pedestrian and bicycle counts were performed on April 17, 2008 between
                             7AM and 7PM at three locations within the study area as a basis for the Certified TIS
                             for the previously proposed Office/R&D project. Due to the unsuitable time of year,
                             these counts were not repeated for the current TIS. The 2008 counts include the
                             following locations:
                             Cambridgepark Drive west of Alewife Station Access Road (near 100 Cambridgepark
                             Drive)
                             Cambridgepark Drive east of Alewife Station Access Road (at crosswalk)
                             Alewife Station Access Road at Route 2 eastbound off-ramp

                             2008 Peak hour pedestrian volumes are summarized in Tables 2.b.1, 2.b.2 and 2.b.3.
                             Peak pedestrian activity occurred between 7:45 and 8:45AM during the morning peak
                             period and between 5:00 and 6:00PM during the evening peak period.

                             The highest pedestrian volumes were observed at the midblock crosswalk across
                             Cambridgepark Drive near the Alewife Brook Parkway intersection and at the
                             intersection of the Alewife Station Access Road and Route 2 eastbound off-ramp. This
                             location experienced between 150 and 200 pedestrian crossings during the peak hour.
                             The midblock crosswalk does not experience high vehicle speeds due to its proximity
                             to the signals on either end of the block.

                             The Alewife Station Access Road and Route 2 eastbound off-ramp location has recently
                             been reconfigured to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety. 2008 Peak hour bicycle
                             volumes are summarized in Tables 2.b.4, 2,b,5 and 2.b.6.

                             Bicycle volumes were highest at the Minuteman Bicycle Path, with over 100 bicycles
                             observed using the path during the peak hours. The eastside crosswalk at the Alewife
                             Station Access Road and Route 2 eastbound off-ramp also had high bicycle volumes.

                             Manual turning movement counts, including pedestrians and bicycles, were conducted
                             at study intersections on Thursday December 8, 2011. Detailed count data is provided
                             in the Appendix. The results of these counts indicate that the peak hours for traffic in
                             the study area are generally 7:30AM to 8:30AM and 5PM to 6PM on weekdays. Figures
                             2.C.1 and 2.C.2 summarize these counts for the AM and PM peaks, respectively.

                             Pedestrian volumes at study intersections are shown in Figure 2.C.3 for the AM and
                             PM peak hours. Bicycle volumes are presented in Figures 2.C.4 for the AM and PM
                             peak hours.

                             Study-area crash data were obtained from Mass Highway records for the three-year
                             period from January 2007 through December 2009 (the most recent data available). A
                             summary analysis of the crash data is summarized in Table 2.d, and includes
                             calculated crash rates (number of reported crashes per million entering vehicles) based
                             on the traffic volumes counted in 2012. A detailed summary by crash type is presented
                             in the Appendix.

                             None of the study intersections have a calculated crash rate that exceeds the District 6
                             average for signalized intersections of 0.77 crashes/million entering vehicles with the
                             exception of Alewife Brook Parkway at Route 2 which has a crash rate of 0.79
                             crashes/million entering vehicles, just over the District 6 average.

                             Overall, all but one of the accidents was non-fatal and most were angled or rear-end
                             collisions. The fatality was recorded at the Alewife Brook Parkway and Route 2
                             intersection.

                             Daily weekday ridership, operating hours, peak-hour headways and route destinations
                             are provided in Table 2.e for the seven bus routes terminating at Alewife Station (62,
                             67, 76, 79, 84, 350 and 351) and the MBTA Red Line heavy rail service. Generally, the
                             bus routes provide service to the west along the Route 2 corridor towards Arlington
                             and beyond while the Red Line provides service to the southeast through Cambridge
                             and connecting with the rest of the MBTA subway and rail system.

                                     a. Mode Share and Average Vehicle Occupancy

                                     Mode-share and average vehicle occupancy (AVO) characteristics for the project are
                                     based on 2000 Census data. Table 3.a presents mode-shares used as a basis for
                                     estimating project trip generation. Drive-alone and rideshare were combined to
                                     determine overall automobile mode share. The AVO of all automobile trips based on
                                     the 2000 Census data is 1.10.

                                     Trip-generation estimates were developed based on Institute of Transportation
                                     Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (8th Edition) using the average rates for Land
                                     Use Code 220 (Apartment). ITE vehicle-trip rates were converted to person-trip rates
                                     by application of a 1.08 AVO, to reflect the national basis for ITE data, as recommended
                                     by city staff.

                                     The resulting project trip generation by mode for the proposed project is summarized
                                     in Table 3.b.1.

                                As shown in the table, the counts at 30 Cambridgepark Drive yielded lower residential
                                vehicle trip generation compared to the ITE-based generation. The difference was very
                                significant for the evening peak hour. The count data indicates that the peak hours for
                                the 30 Cambridgepark driveways is from 7:45 ­ 8:45 AM and 4:30 ­ 5:30 PM. In order
                                to provide a consistent and conservative analysis, ITE trip rates were utilized for the
                                purposes of this TIS analysis.

                                The parcels currently owned by Equity Office have three existing vehicular access
                                points on the south side of Cambridgepark Drive (parcels 150, 180 and 180R), and one
                                vehicular access point of the north side (parcel 125). The latter driveway will remain
                                unaffected by the proposed project.

                             of the 100 Cambridgepark Drive building would remain. In addition, a gated
                             emergency access point will be provided at the western end of the Cambridgepark
                             Drive frontage.

                             Primary pedestrian and bicycle access will be provided along the Cambridgepark
                             Drive frontage.

                             Project-generated traffic was distributed through the study area intersections based on
                             the 2000 US Census journey-to-work data as shown in Table 3.d and Figure 3.D.1. Trip
                             assignments at study area intersections are shown in Figures 3.D.2 and 3.D.3 for the
                             weekday AM and PM peak-hour conditions, respectively.

                             The resulting vehicular project-generated trips are shown in Figures 3.D.4 and 3.D.5 for
                             the weekday AM and PM peak-hour conditions, respectively.

                             As shown in Figure D, Site Plan, the trash room will be located on the northwest side of
                             the building adjacent to the access gate on the ground level. Typically, residential trash
                             will be picked up two times per week.

                             The proposed residential project will generate limited numbers of delivery trips over
                             the course of a normal day. Typical deliveries will include mail and trash collection for
                             the building as a whole. Move-in/move-out activity will take place on-site at a
                             dedicated area at the southeast corner of the building, adjacent to the stair and elevator
                             core.

                             Background traffic growth was assumed to occur at one-half (0.5) percent per year over
                             a five year period to 2017. Additionally, traffic growth associated with the 70 Fawcett
                             Street residential development, the 603 Concord Avenue residential development, and
                             the Faces Site project was added to the Build scenarios to develop the Future 2017

                             counts at the study area intersections as previously presented in Section 2.

                             b. Build Condition
                             The Build (2012) Condition assumes full occupancy of the 398 unit residential building.
                             Project-generated traffic is added to the study area to create the Build networks shown
                             in Figures 5.B.1 and 5.B.2.

                             c. Future Condition
                             Background traffic growth was assumed to occur at one-half (0.5) percent per year for
                             five years to 2017. Volumes for this scenario, which include project trips generated by
                             the 398 unit residential building as well as future growth (0.5% background growth
                             and other developments), are shown in Figures 5.C.1 and 5.C.2.




           6. Vehicle Capacity Analysis
                             a. Existing and Build Conditions
                             Synchro 7 software is used to determine the vehicle level of service (VLOS) for
                             signalized and unsignalized study intersections. Synchro software is based on the 2000
                             Highway Capacity Manual.

                             Results for the Existing (2012) and Build (2017) conditions are presented in Tables 6.a.1
                             and 6.a.2 (AM peak hour) and Tables 6.a.3 and 6.a.4 (PM peak hour) for signalized and
                             unsignalized intersections, respectively. A summary of the analysis results follows.

                             1(a),(b) & (c) Alewife Brook Parkway and Route 2 (including ramps):
                             This intersection, under the control of DCR, currently operates at a level-of-service F
                             during the morning and LOS F during the evening peak periods, with morning and
                             evening delays greater than 80 seconds. The failing condition is due to fact that
                             vehicles from the Alewife Station Access Road have to merge with Route 2 westbound
                             traffic. The merge initially occurs from three lanes of traffic immediately into two lanes,
                             prior to widening to four lanes on Route 2. This short span of a couple of hundred feet
                             decreases the processing capacity, thereby causing backups at the intersection. The
                             saturation flow was observed during the peak hours in the week commencing July 14,
                             2008 (for the TIS for the previous Office/R&D project). The field data and evaluation of
                             saturation flow are included in the Appendix, indicating that the westbound lanes
                             processed an average of approximately 3,800 vehicles.

                             The north ramp with southwest right and westbound through movements operates at
                             LOS F during both peak periods and for all analyzed conditions. The south ramp from
                             Route 2 onto the Alewife Brook Parkway provides a southwest right movement and an
                             eastbound left movement, and operates at LOS B under existing conditions in both
                             peak hours. With the proposed project the LOS will remain at B.

                             1(d) Alewife Brook Parkway and Alewife Station Access Road:
                             This intersection is also under the control of DCR. Under existing conditions, the
                             intersection experiences approximately 20 seconds of delay (LOS C) during the
                             morning peak hour and 25 seconds of delay (LOS D) during the evening peak hour.
                             The proposed project will not increase delays during the morning or evening peak
                             hours. The overall LOS will remain at C in the morning and C in the evening.

                             2. Alewife Brook Parkway, and
                             3. Cambridgepark Drive/Rindge Avenue:
                             These two intersections, again under the control of DCR, operate together under one
                             controller and should be evaluated as a pair. Field observations confirm that both
                             intersections are extremely congested during the PM peak hour due to queues that
                             back up from the Alewife Brook Parkway/Route 2 intersection. When the queue in the
                             channelized right-turn lane from Cambridgepark Drive to Alewife Brook Parkway
                             southbound backs up, drivers frequently bypass the queue to make the right-turn
                             around the outside of the channelizing island. Since the queuing significantly reduces
                             the number of cars which can enter the intersection, the volumes counted do not reflect
                             actual demand. Accordingly, the saturation flow was observed during the peak hours
                             in the week commencing July 14, 2008. The field data and evaluation of results for
                             saturation flow are included in the Appendix, indicating that the saturation flow was
                             approximately 1,775 vehicles for both eastbound lanes on Cambridgepark Drive.

                             The Synchro analysis for existing conditions indicates that during the morning peak
                             hour, the intersections operate at a LOS D (at Rindge Avenue) and LOS C (at
                             Cambridgepark Drive). In the evening, both intersections operate at LOS F. When the
                             volumes are increased to take into account the proposed project, the overall
                             intersection delay at the Rindge Avenue and Alewife Brook Parkway intersection
                             increases to over 64 seconds during the morning peak hour resulting in a LOS E.

                             The intersection of Alewife Brook Parkway with Rindge Avenue will degrade to LOS D
                             from a LOS C during the evening peak. In the evening peak hour, both intersections
                             will remain at LOS F.

                             4. Alewife Station Access Road and Cambridgepark Drive:
                             This intersection, controlled by the City of Cambridge, operates at a level-of-service C
                             and D during the existing morning and evening peak hours, respectively based on
                             Synchro analysis. The proposed project is expected to increase delays by
                             approximately one second during the morning peak hour. During the evening peak
                             hour, the intersection will continue to operate at LOS D.

                             5. Alewife Station Access Road and Route 2 Ramp:
                             This intersection is unsignalized with the northbound Alewife Station Access Road
                             operating freely at a LOS A during both the existing and build conditions during the
                             morning and evening peak hours. The Route 2 Ramp in the southbound direction
                             must yield to northbound traffic and operates at a LOS F during both conditions
                             during both the morning and evening peak hours.

                             b. Future conditions

                             The Synchro analysis for the Future (2017) Condition are summarized and compared to
                             the Build (2012) Condition in Tables 6.b.1 and 6.b.2 (AM peak hour) and Tables 6.b.3
                             and 6.b.4 (PM peak hour) for signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively.
                             No Mitigation associated with the Project is proposed that would affect the signal
                             timings or geometry of the Future Conditions.

                             During Future (2017) Conditions, overall LOS will remain the same as under Build
                             Conditions, with the exception of the morning peak hour at the intersection of Alewife
                             Brook Parkway at Rindge Avenue which will degrade from a LOS E to a LOS F with
                             the addition of over 15 seconds of delay. This is due to background growth (at 0.5
                             percent per year) as well as the traffic generated by the background projects assumed
                             in this analysis (Faces Development, 603 Concord Avenue and 70 Fawcett Street.)

                             It should be noted, however, that MassDOT is designing improvements for safety and
                             traffic operations at the intersections of Alewife Brook Parkway and Route 2. The
                             design is currently being advanced from 25 percent to the 75 percent stage. In addition
                             to addressing the current un-safe merging movements within the intersection, lane
                             geometry and signal timing improvements are expected to reduce queuing and
                             congestion. The proposed changes include the following:

                                      1.   Widening of Route 2 westbound to accommodate a third lane through the
                                           intersection

                                      2.   Widening of Route 2 eastbound to provide two travel lanes onto Route 16
                                           northbound

                                      3.   Widening of Route 16 southbound to provide two channelized right turn
                                           lanes to Route 2 westbound

                                     4.   Replacement of outdated mast arms and signal heads at the intersection
                                          of Route 2 and Route 16

                                     5.   Re-establishment of coordination between this intersection and the
                                          intersection of Alewife Brook Parkway and Cambridgepark Drive. GPS
                                          units will be installed in both traffic signals on Cambridgepark Drive, and
                                          all three will be coordinated

                                     6.   Elimination of existing signal Phase 1 and modifying which legs run
                                          during proposed Phases 2 & 3 (existing Phases 3& 4)

                             These signal improvements are expected to be implemented in 2016. Therefore, the
                             MassDOT project is expected to improve traffic operations and safety at TIS Study
                             Area intersections under the Future (2017) Condition.

           7. Queue Analysis
                             Queue analysis was performed in conjunction with the level-of-service analysis.
                             Additionally, field queue counts/observations were performed to verify/ validate the
                             modeled results in April 2008 (for the previous Office/R&D Project TIS) and December
                             2011. Tables 7.a.1 and 7.a.2 present results for each modeled scenario during the AM
                             Peak and PM Peak hours, respectively.

                             * Queue backed up into Cambridgepark Drive /Alewife Station Access Road Intersection, could not count demand

                             Queuing observations were performed at study area locations with a particular focus
                             on operations on Cambridgepark Drive during the evening peak hour.

                             The Synchro model reveals significant queuing throughout the whole corridor under
                             all analyzed scenarios and especially during the evening peak period.

                             The Route 2 and Alewife Brook Parkway intersection experiences significant queuing
                             during both peaks. Northbound queues on Alewife Brook Parkway extended to 38
                             vehicles during the morning peak hour and 50 vehicles during the evening peak hour.

                             Queuing of 40 vehicles was observed on the Alewife Station Access Road approach to
                             the intersection during the evening peak hour.

                             At the Alewife Brook Parkway at Cambridgepark Drive and Rindge Avenue
                             intersection, extensive queuing was observed on the Alewife Brook Parkway
                             southbound and northbound approaches during the morning peak hour. During the
                             evening peak hour, the northbound queues often extended back past the shopping
                             center.

                             Between Alewife Brook Parkway and the Alewife Station Access Road, the entire
                             length of Cambridgepark Drive was routinely queued during the evening peak hour in
                             the eastbound direction. This queue resulted from extensive queuing on Alewife Brook
                             Parkway, which reduces the throughput of vehicles out of Cambridgepark Drive. In
                             turn, this queue causes extensive queuing on the Alewife Station Access Road north of
                             Cambridgepark Drive as well as on Cambridgepark Drive west of the Alewife Station
                             Access Road.

                             Queuing of approximately 12 vehicles was also observed during the evening peak
                             period on the eastbound approach of Cambridgepark Drive at the Alewife Station
                             Access Road.

                             Clearly, the greatest addition of project traffic under the full build scenario will be on
                             Cambridgepark Drive, west of Alewife Station Access Road where 101 new trips are
                             projected in the AM peak hour and 123 new trips are projected during the PM peak
                             hour, reflecting a 32 percent and 37 percent increase over existing volumes,
                             respectively.

                             East of Alewife Station Access Road, Cambridgepark Drive will experience 81 new
                             trips during the AM peak hour and 103 new trips during the PM peak hour due to the
                             proposed project, reflecting an 11 percent and 9 percent increase over existing volumes,
                             respectively. On Alewife Station Access Road itself, the increase is limited to 3 percent
                             (20 trips) in both peaks.

                             Increases in traffic on Route 2 and Alewife Brook Parkway are 3 percent or less during
                             both peak periods. On Rindge Avenue, the increase varies between 2 percent in the
                             AM peak and 6 percent in the PM peak.

                             There are no streets in the study area that satisfy criteria for residential streets in the
                             context of the Planning Board criteria.




           9. Parking
                             As noted in Section 1.c (Parking, Existing Conditions), a total of 1,623 parking spaces
                             are registered currently by the City of Cambridge on the Existing Property for office
                             use.

                             In addition to the office buildings owned by Equity Office (125 and 150 Cambridgepark
                             Drive), those parking spaces support the approximately 130,000 SF office building at
                             100 Cambridgepark Drive (by way of a parking easement for 339 spaces, 323 of which
                             are included in the 1,623 registered spaces), and a parking easement for 110 spaces for
                             the office building at 200 Cambridgepark Drive.

                             In the January 23, 2012 Scoping letter, TP&T asked that existing residential and office
                             parking demand in the area be determined, as a basis for potential shared parking
                             opportunities, by conducting parking utilization counts at intervals throughout the day
                             at the residential building at 30 Cambridgepark Drive and in the existing office parking
                             lots. As 30 Cambridgepark Drive has a private parking garage for residents, it was not
                             possible to execute surveys within that garage for all time intervals over the course of
                             the day. It was possible, however, to perform mid- to late-morning residential parking
                             occupancy counts on two occasions, along with corresponding counts for the office
                             parking.

                             The potential for sharing of residential and office parking is governed by the peak
                             office demand in the late-morning to mid-day period and the corresponding vacancy
                             of residential parking at the same time.

                             On Thursday November 17, 2011, VHB performed occupancy counts in the 125, 150,
                             180 and 180R parcels at 10 AM and 12 PM. To determine building occupancy, Equity
                             Office requested information from its management staff and performed a walk-
                             through of the office buildings under its ownership on January 31, 2012. Based on
                             these surveys, and as presented in Table 1.c.2, the parking demand for 125, 150 and 100
                             Cambridgepark Drive adjusted for building occupancy is 1,184 parking spaces, or 2.10
                             parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of office space. Also as presented in Table 1.c.2,
                             because of the pre-existing easement and registration, notwithstanding the actual
                             occupancy rate, the Applicant is required to provide at least 323 spaces for 100
                             Cambridgepark Drive, yielding a ratio of 2.48 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of
                             office space.

                             On Wednesday December 7, 2011, 155 of the total 306 parking spaces at 30
                             Cambridgepark Drive were occupied at 10 AM, reflecting a 51 percent parking
                             occupancy mid-morning. On Wednesday January 11, 2012, 134 of the total 306 parking
                             spaces at 30 Cambridgepark Drive were occupied at 12 PM, reflecting a 44 percent
                             parking occupancy at mid day. The 30 Cambridgepark Drive building is almost fully
                             leased at 96 percent. Therefore the adjusted lowest parking occupancy was 46 percent,
                             at 12 PM.

                             The parking plan for the proposed project seeks to limit the addition of parking
                             through sharing of some of the spaces by the residential and office uses, as well as a
                             reduction in the existing parking ratio for the office buildings owned by Equity Office
                             (125 and 150 Cambridgepark Drive). As a result, even with the addition of 398
                             residential units on the project site, there will be an overall reduction of approximately
                             30 parking spaces on the 125, 150, 180 and 180R parcels and a reduction of 428 spaces
                             in the total dedicated to the existing office uses. A discussion of the parking demand
                             and supply analysis follows.

                             Also, as described above, if the existing Peak Parking Occupancy Ratio (2.10) is applied
                             to the office uses at 125 and 150 Cambridgepark Drive to calculate future demand, the
                             Project would require a total of 1,632 spaces to accommodate the existing office and
                             new residential (386 for 125 Cambridgepark Drive, 525 for 150 Cambridgepark Drive,
                             323 for 100 Cambridgepark Drive (per easement/registration) and 398 for the
                             Residential Building).

                             As described in this TIS and depicted in Table 9.a.3, a total number of 1,593 spaces is
                             proposed. The reduced total to 1,593 spaces is possible because of the unique shared
                             parking opportunities presented by this Project. Rather than simply subdivide 160
                             Cambridgepark Drive from the Existing Property, and sell it to a third party for a
                             completely separate and stand alone project (leaving the existing office status quo in
                             place), Equity Office is working with its lender and development partners to create a
                             sharing arrangement that benefits all parties, including the City's interest in reducing
                             parking.



           10. Transit Analysis
                             The project is anticipated to generate 81 new transit trips (16 entering, 65 exiting)
                             during the AM peak-hour and 98 new transit trips (64 entering, 34 exiting) during the
                             PM peak hour. It is assumed that 95percent of the transit trips generated by the project
                             will be accommodated by the Red Line while the remaining 5percent of transit trips
                             will utilize MBTA bus service available at Alewife Station. Table 10.a summarizes the
                             breakdown of project generated transit riders by transit mode.

                             As a result of the project, 62 boardings are projected during the morning peak hour
                             (equivalent to approximately 5 boardings per train), and 61 alightings are projected
                             during the evening peak hour (also equivalent to approximately 5 boardings per train).
                             Although no peak load data is available for MBTA Red Line trains, it is assumed that
                             project generated trips will not have a significant impact to Red Line operations at
                             Alewife station.

                             During the peaks, the seven bus routes terminating at Alewife operate on 20-30 minute
                             headways providing service every 3.5 minutes on average. As a result of the project, 4
                             additional riders during the morning peak, and 5 additional riders during the evening
                             peak will be distributed among all routes, with no perceptible impact.

                             As previously noted, 12-hour pedestrian counts were performed in March 2008. The
                             turning movement counts performed in December 2011 also included pedestrian
                             movements. A comparison of the 2008 and 2011 pedestrian and bicycle data is
                             included in the Appendix. Pedestrian volumes within the study area are presented in
                             Figure 2.C.3 while a comparison of Existing, Build and Future signalized pedestrian

                             Pedestrian level-of-service at signalized intersections is dictated by the portion of the
                             signal cycle dedicated to pedestrian crossings as well as the distance pedestrians have
                             to cross. Accordingly, increasing pedestrian volumes does not alter pedestrian level of
                             service at signalized intersections.

                             All pedestrian movements through the Alewife Brook Parkway and Rindge Avenue
                             intersection experience a level-of-service grade E due to long cycle lengths, short
                             crosswalk times and long crosswalk distances. These are the same during both peaks
                             since cycle lengths and crosswalk times are fixed during these two time periods. The
                             other signalized study area intersections operate at PLOS D or better.

                             The determination of pedestrian level-of-service at unsignalized intersections differs
                             from signalized intersections. Under Massachusetts State Law, vehicles are required to
                             stop for pedestrians in crosswalks. However, the unsignalized intersection pedestrian
                             LOS summary analysis has been performed as required by the TIS Guidelines using
                             HCM equation 18-21. The PLOS results provided in Table 11.a.2 assume that the
                             pedestrian experiences delay due to waiting at the crosswalk, and therefore provides a
                             significantly more conservative analysis than what is actually experienced in the field.

                             Pedestrian operations at the un-signalized crosswalk on Cambridgepark Drive west of
                             Alewife Brook Parkway are significantly impacted by vehicle queuing. However, as a
                             result, vehicle speeds tend to be lower, and stationary queues frequently yield effective
                             gaps for pedestrians. Also, as noted above, the methodology for calculating PLOS at
                             un-signalized crosswalks is very conservative,

                             Within and around the project site, pedestrian facilities will be designed to meet
                             appropriate safety and accessibility standards. The proponent is aware of the City's
                             longer-term plans in the Concord-Alewife Plan for a pedestrian/bicycle bridge across
                             the railroad tracks connecting the "Quandrangle" with the "Triangle" and the Alewife
                             MBTA station. While the proposed garage in the previously approved office project on
                             the site was able to provide a landing for such a bridge, the now-proposed residential
                             project provides no similar feasible opportunity, especially in light of the currently
                             proposed reduction, rather than previous increase, in parking. As and when the City
                             advances plans for a bridge, however, the Proponent will cooperate with the City in
                             identifying a suitable landing, if the bridge location falls within the Proponent's
                             ownership.



           12. Bicycle Analysis
                             The project area is well-served by several multi-use/bicycle paths and bicycle lanes.
                             Multi-use/bicycle paths are distinguished by their physical separation from vehicular
                             traffic and by the various types of modes that utilize them. Bicycle facilities in the area
                             are shown in Figure 12. In the future, Cambridgepark Drive will benefit from the
                             direct pathway connection to the Belmont path, to be built by the City of Cambridge
                             and MassDOT. The project is currently under construction and is anticipated to be
                             complete by the end of 2012.

                             Multi-use path connections to the area include the Belmont path to the west, the
                             Minuteman Trail to the north, and the linear path to the east. In addition, the path on
                             the east side of Alewife Brook Parkway (part separate path/part shared sidewalk)
                             connects with the Fresh Pond Parkway and Fresh Pond Reservation paths, and the bike
                             lanes on Concord Avenue.

                             There are bicycle lanes on a short section of Cambridgepark Drive west of its
                             intersection with Alewife Station Access Road. Peak period queuing, particularly in
                             the PM peak, hampers bicycle access, and vehicle queuing often blocks access to the
                             bicycle lane on Cambridgepark Drive.

           13. Transportation Demand Management Plan
                             The project proponent will support a program of transportation demand management
                             (TDM) actions to reduce automobile trips generated by the project. The goal of the
                             project's TDM plan is to reduce the use of single occupant vehicles (SOVs) by
                             encouraging carpooling and vanpooling, bicycle commuting and walking, and
                             increased use of the area's public transportation system by residents.

                             The following TDM programs will be implemented as part of the proposed project to
                             encourage residents to use alternatives to SOV travel:

                             The proponent will contact a car sharing provider (such as Zipcar) to determine the
                             feasibility of establishing a car share program for tenants and will provide parking
                             spaces on site for at least one car share vehicle, subject to demand.

                             The proponent will join a local Transportation Management Association (TMA) if one
                             is established in the area.

                             The proponent will designate a transportation coordinator to oversee all transportation
                             matters for the project, including vehicular operations, servicing and loading, parking
                             and the TDM programs. The transportation coordinator will act as the contact and
                             liaison for the City of Cambridge, the TMA and the tenants of the project.

                             The proponent will make available transit maps, schedules and other information
                             relevant to commuting options in the residential building lobby.

                             The proponent will provide a coupon for a MBTA Subway & Bus Charlie Card for one
                             month to each new resident, to introduce them to and encourage use of transit.

                             The proponent will charge for parking separately from apartment rent.

                             Board" of the City of Cambridge "Transportation Impact Study Guidelines," Fifth
                             Revision dated April 27, 2004; this section presents a summary of potential impacts to
                             the transportation network as a result of the proposed project.

                             According to the guidelines, exceeding one or more of the criteria shall be indicative of
                             a potentially adverse impact on City's transportation network; however, the Planning
                             Board will consider mitigation efforts, their anticipated effectiveness, and other
                             information that identifies a reduction in adverse traffic impacts.




Criterion A - Project Vehicle Trip Generation
                             Table A-1 presents the project vehicle trip generation criterion. Project vehicle trip
                             generation is based on ITE trip rates, adjusted for local mode split and vehicle
                             occupancy rates as discussed previously.

                             The project is not expected to exceed the Planning Board criteria for daily, morning
                             peak and evening peak project vehicle trip generation under the Build program.




Criterion B - Vehicular LOS
                             The criteria for a project's impact to traffic operations at signalized intersections are
                             summarized in Table B-1 below. These criteria are evaluated for each signalized study-

                                     Project-induced vehicle level-of-service criteria are exceeded for the intersection of
                                     Alewife Brook Parkway at Rindge Avenue during the morning peak hour, and
                                     Cambridgepark Drive at Alewife Station Access Road during the evening peak hour.




    Criterion C ­ Traffic on Residential Streets
                                     This criterion considers the increase of traffic on residential streets generated by the
                                     proposed project. The threshold for this criterion is dependent on the existing street
                                     volume and the amount of residential land use frontage. None of the study-area
                                     roadways analyzed have first floor residential frontage which makes up more than 1/3
                                     of the total street frontage. Accordingly none of the segments exceed the criteria of
                                     vehicles on residential streets.




    Criterion D ­ Lane Queue
                                     The criteria for a project's impact to queues at signalized intersections are summarized
                                     in Table D-1 below. These criteria are evaluated for each lane group at study-area
                                     signalized intersections and presented in Table D-2.

Criterion E ­ Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
                             The pedestrian and bicycle criterion has the following three components:

                             a. Pedestrian Delay

                             Pedestrian delay is a measure of the pedestrian crossing delay on a crosswalk during
                             the peak hour as determined by the pedestrian level of service analysis in the HCM
                             2000.

                             Table E-1 presents the indicators for this criterion. Table E-2 presents the evaluation of
                             PLOS criteria for each crosswalk at study area intersections under existing, full-build
                             and future conditions.

                             b. Safe Pedestrian Facilities

                             The project site is well connected to existing pedestrian facilities along all surrounding
                             streets providing access to the proposed development. Signalized crosswalks are
                             located at the intersection of Cambridgepark Drive and Alewife Station Access Road as
                             well as Cambridgepark Drive/Rindge Avenue and Alewife Brook Parkway. There is
                             an unsignalized crosswalk on Cambridgepark Drive midway between Alewife Brook
                             Parkway and Alewife Station Access Road. In addition, there are unsignalized
                             crosswalks across Cambridgepark Drive at locations connecting # 30 and #125 on the
                             north side with #125 and #150 on the south side, respectively.

                             Within the project site, pedestrian facilities will be designed to meet appropriate safety
                             and accessibility standards. The building setbacks on the north side will facilitate
                             significantly widened sidewalks along the Cambridgepark Drive frontage.

                             The proponent is aware of the City's longer-term plans in the Concord-Alewife Plan
                             for a pedestrian/bicycle bridge across the railroad tracks connecting the
                             "Quandrangle" with the "Triangle" and the Alewife MBTA station. While the
                             proposed garage in the previously approved office project on the site was able to
                             provide a landing for such a bridge, the now-proposed residential project provides no
                             similar feasible opportunity, especially in light of the currently proposed reduction,
                             rather than previous increase, in parking. As and when the City advances plans for a
                             bridge, however, the Proponent will cooperate with the City in identifying a suitable
                             landing, if the bridge location falls within the Proponent's ownership.

                             c. Safe Bicycle Facilities

                             The project area is well-served by several multi-use/bicycle paths and bicycle lanes, as
                             shown in Figure 12. In the future, Cambridgepark Drive will benefit from the direct
                             pathway connection to the Belmont path, to be built by the City of Cambridge and the
                             Commonwealth of Massachusetts. However, while there are bicycle lanes on a short
                             section of Cambridgepark Drive west of its intersection with Alewife Station Access
                             Road, access to the project site for bicycles is impacted by traffic conditions in the
                             vicinity of that intersection and its approaches. Peak period queuing, particularly in
                             the PM peak, hampers bicycle access, and vehicle queuing often blocks access to the
                             bicycle lane on Cambridgepark Drive.

                             Currently there are no existing bicycle parking spaces or storage units on the project
                             site itself. The proposed development will include 204 covered bicycle spaces,
                             equivalent to approximately 1 space per 2 units, in two conveniently located bicycle
                             rooms. In addition, bicycle racks for approximately 10 bicycles will be provided
                             outside of the building to accommodate short-term visitor bicycle parking. The
                             proponent has begun discussions with the City of Cambridge TP&T Department to
                             look for ways to increase the amount of bicycle storage in the Project.

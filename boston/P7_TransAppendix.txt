Study Area Intersection Descriptions
                      Intersection geometry and physical characteristics are presented in this
                      section.
1. Beacon Street/Park Drive (Audubon Circle) is a four-way
intersection under four-phase traffic signal control. Beacon Street runs
east/west and Park Drive runs north/south at this intersection. Three of
the four right turns from this intersection are unsignalized (the exception
is the eastbound Beacon Street right turn movement, which is
signalized). All four approaches are divided by medians. The MBTA
Green Line (C Line) runs within the median of Beacon Street west of the
intersection, going underground immediately to the west of Park Drive.

In addition to the channelized right turns, each approach consists of two
general-purpose lanes, operating effectively as a shared left/through
lane and an exclusive through lane; the exception is the eastbound
Beacon Street approach, consisting of three general-purpose lanes.
Sidewalks are provided along all intersection approaches. On-street
parking is permitted on all approaches. Crosswalks are provided in all
directions, crossing by way of the medians and the islands separating the
channelized right turns. Pedestrians are permitted to cross during a
protected pedestrian signal phase, during which no vehicular
movements are permitted.

2. Riverway/Park Drive (Sears Rotary) is a signalized intersection with
two approaches. The southbound approach (Riverway) consists of two
through lanes and a channelized right-turn lane. The westbound
approach (Riverway) consists of three through lanes and two
channelized left-turn lanes, also under the same traffic signal control.
On-street parking is prohibited on all approaches.

Crosswalks are provided across all approaches except the westbound
approach. Islands are provided between the channelized right-turn lane
and the through lanes on the southbound approach, between the
channelized left-turn lanes and the through lanes on the westbound
approach, and between River Way and Park Drive to serve as pedestrian
refuges.

3. Brookline Avenue/Fenway (Sears Rotary) is a complex five-leg
intersection (the fifth leg is the left-turn loop to Park Drive). It operates
under two-phase traffic signal control, coordinated with the adjacent
intersection of Brookline Avenue, Park Drive and Boylston Street.
Brookline Avenue runs north/south, and it approaches from the north
with two exclusive through lanes. These continue as two lanes departing
the south side of the intersection. From the south, it approaches with
two exclusive through and a shared through/right-turn lane. These
expand to four lanes on the north side of the intersection, to provide
queue storage for the adjacent intersection at Park Drive and Boylston
Street.
The Riverway runs eastbound and consists of an exclusive left-turn lane,
a shared through/left-turn lane, an exclusive through lane, and an
exclusive right-turn lane. On the far side of the intersection, they
continue as three lanes eastbound on the Fenway and one diverge lane,
looping left to Park Drive. On-street parking is prohibited on all
approaches. Sidewalks are provided along Brookline Avenue and the
south side of the Fenway, and pathways are provided within the Fens
north of the Fenway. Crosswalks are provided across all legs except the
northern leg across Brookline Avenue. Pedestrians are permitted to
cross during a protected pedestrian signal phase, during which no
vehicular movements are permitted.

4. Brookline Avenue/Park Drive/Boylston Street (Sears Rotary) is a
signalized intersection making up part of the Sears Rotary. The
intersection has five legs and four approaches: Brookline Avenue, from
the northeast, consists of two general purpose lanes and one right-turn
only lane; Brookline Avenue, from the southwest, consists of two
through-only lanes (no left-turns are permitted on this approach) and
two right-turn only lanes; Park Drive, from the south, consists of four
general purpose lanes; and Boylston Street, from the east, consists of two
general purpose lanes and one right-turn only lane leading into a right-
turn channel. Park Drive is one-way northbound and hence, the fifth leg
at this intersection is the receiving leg of Park Drive approach.

On-street parking is permitted along the east side of the Park Drive
approach and along both north and south sides of the east Boylston
Street leg. Sidewalks are provided along both sides of Brookline Avenue
southbound, both sides of Boylston Street, and the east side of Park
Drive. Islands are provided at the northwestern and southwestern
corners of the intersection (on the west side of Park Drive) providing
either sidewalks or pedestrian pathways. Pedestrians are accommodated
in concurrent pedestrian phases. No crosswalk is provided on the west
Brookline Avenue leg, since traffic is always traversing that portion of
the intersection and it does not serve as a strong pedestrian desire line.

5. Beacon Street/Arundel Street/Miner Street is a four-leg unsignalized
intersection. Beacon Street is the major street traveling in the east/west
direction. Both approaches on Beacon Street consist of two general-
purpose lanes with adjacent on-street parking. The Arundel Street
approach, from the north, consists of one general-purpose lane
approaching Beacon Street with stop-control at Beacon Street. The Miner
Street approach, from the south, consists of one general-purpose lane,
and is stop-controlled at its intersection with Beacon Street. Sidewalks
are provided adjacent to all approaches, and crosswalks are provided at
all approaches except the eastern Beacon Street leg.
6. Beacon Street/Mountfort Street/Maitland Street is a four-leg
unsignalized intersection. Beacon Street is the major street traveling in
the east/west direction. Both approaches on Beacon Street consist of two
general-purpose lanes with adjacent parking. Both Mountfort Street,
approaching from the south, and Maitland Street, approaching from the
north, consist of one general-purpose lane approaching Beacon Street
and are each under stop-sign control. The Maitland Street approach is
on an approximate 7.4 percent upgrade. Even though sidewalks are
provided adjacent to all approaches, crosswalks are not provided at any
of the approaches at the intersection.

7. Brookline Avenue/Fullerton Street/Kilmarnock Street is a four-leg
intersection under traffic signal control. Brookline Avenue is the major
roadway traveling in the east/west direction. Both approaches on
Brookline Avenue consist of one through/right lane and one left-turn
storage bay with curb-side parking. Fullerton Street, approaching from
the north consists of an exclusive right-turn lane and a shared left-
through lane. Kilmarnock Street (recently added as the fourth leg to this
intersection), approaching from the south, consists of one general-
purpose travel lane. Sidewalks and crosswalks are provided on all
approaches. A bus stop is located at the northwest corner of the
intersection.

8. Brookline Avenue/Yawkey Way is a three-leg unsignalized
intersection. Yawkey Way approaches Brookline Avenue from the
south, consisting of separate left- and right-turn lanes, and is under stop-
sign control. The east/west approaches on Brookline Avenue consist of
one general-purpose lane with adjacent parking. Sidewalks are provided
adjacent to all approaches. Crosswalks are provided on the western leg
across Brookline Avenue and on the southern leg across Yawkey Way.
During Red Sox game day, Yawkey Way is closed to all vehicular traffic.

9. Brookline Avenue/Lansdowne Street is a three-leg intersection with
Lansdowne Street providing one-way eastbound travel, away from
Brookline Avenue. Brookline Avenue traveling north/south consists of
one lane in both directions with parking on both sides on the southern
leg of the intersection. Sidewalks are provided adjacent to all
approaches, and a crosswalk is provided on the eastern leg across
Lansdowne Street. During Red Sox game days, parking around Fenway
Park is prohibited.
10/11. Beacon Street/Brookline Avenue/Commonwealth Avenue/Deer
field (Kenmore Square) is a five-leg signalized intersection with four
approaches to the intersection. The Beacon Street approach, from the
west, consists of two general-purpose lanes with metered parking.
Brookline Avenue approach, from the south, consists of two right-turn
lanes with no adjacent parking. Commonwealth Avenue, from the east,
consists of two right-turn lanes, two through lanes, and a left-turn lane.
Commonwealth Avenue, from the west, consists of two through lanes
and a right-turn lane. Deerfield Street approaches from the north, and
consists of one travel lane, restricted to right turns only at
Commonwealth Avenue. Meter parking is provided on both
Commonwealth Avenue approaches, and metered angular parking is
provided on the east side of Deerfield Street. Sidewalks are provide
adjacent to all approaches.

12. Brookline Avenue/Newbury Street is a three-leg unsignalized
intersection. Brookline Avenue, approaching from the north and south,
consists of a single travel lane. The Newbury Street, approach from the
east, consists of a single general-purpose lane with parking permitted
only on the south side. Sidewalks are provided adjacent to all
approaches, and a crosswalk is provided across Newbury Street.

13. Commonwealth Avenue westbound/Kenmore Street/Beacon
Street/Raleigh Street is a five-leg signalized intersection with four
approaches into the intersection (Commonwealth is one-way westbound
at this intersection, hence, the fifth leg are the receiving lanes of the
Commonwealth westbound approach.). Commonwealth Avenue
westbound approach consists of two travel lanes with adjacent parking.
The Beacon Street, approaching from the northeast, consists of three
travel lanes with metered parking on both sides of the street. The
Kenmore Street, approaching from the south, consists of three travel
lanes with no parking on either side of the street. The Raleigh Street,
approaching from the north, consists of a single general-purpose lane.
Sidewalks are provided adjacent to all approaches, and crosswalks are
provided across all approaches except the Kenmore Street approach.

14. Commonwealth Avenue eastbound/Kenmore Street is a four-leg
signalized intersection with two approaches into the intersection. The
Commonwealth Avenue eastbound approach consists of two travel lanes
with adjacent parking. The Kenmore Street northbound approach
consists of a single general-purpose lane. Sidewalks and crosswalks are
provided on all four legs. Pedestrians are permitted to cross during a
protected pedestrian signal phase, during which no vehicular
movements are permitted.
15. Newbury Street/Kenmore Street is a three-leg unsignalized
intersection. The Kenmore Street approach, from the north, consists of a
single lane with parking permitted on the east side. Newbury Street,
from the east, accommodates one-way travel from Charles Gate to
Kenmore Street and consists of one travel lane with parking permitted
on both sides of the street. Newbury Street, from the west, permits two-
way travel with parking permitted on the south side of the street.
Sidewalks are provided along both sides of Kenmore Street approach,
and along the northern side of Newbury Street. A crosswalk is provided
on the northern leg across Kenmore Street.

16. Lansdowne Street/Ipswich Street is a three-leg unsignalized
intersection. Ipswich Street travels in the north/south direction, and is a
wide street (approximately 50 feet, curb to curb) without lane
designation striping. Since traffic on this street is fairly light on a typical
day, vehicles approach forming one travel lane each direction. However,
there is capacity on Ipswich to operate as two travel lanes if the demand
increases. Both northbound and southbound approaches consist of a
single lane with adjacent parking. The Lansdowne Street approach from
the west consists of a single travel lane with parking permitted on both
sides of the street. Sidewalks are provided adjacent to all approaches
and a crosswalk is provided across Lansdowne Street.

17. Brookline Street/Overland Street is a three-leg unsignalized

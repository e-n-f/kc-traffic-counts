Executive Summary

The LEAD group has completed an analysis of a proposed bicycle corridor that will
provide a much needed connection between existing bicycle facilities within the City of
Boston. The proposed route extends from the intersection of the University of
Massachusetts (UMASS) Boston entrance and Morrissey Boulevard, continuing through
the heart of Dorchester, and terminating at the intersection of Melnea Cass Boulevard and
Southampton Street. Connections to existing bicycle facilities include the Neponset River
Trail to the south, the Harbor Walk to the east and the South Bay Harbor Trail to the
north.

Streets that will be included as part of the accommodation of bicycle facilities include:
Morrissey Boulevard, Mount Vernon Street, Old Colony Avenue, Preble Street, and
Southampton Street.

An inventory of existing conditions was taken throughout the corridor and subsequent
traffic analysis was performed at major intersections. Intersections were analyzed based
on whether there were higher than average crash rates and/or modifications were
necessary to implement bicycle facilities. All intersections that had approach and/or
signal timing improvements maintained or improved the intersection level-of-service
(LOS).

Throughout the corridor, the selected design will implement the use of a separated bike
facility (cycle track) to be incorporated with several intersection improvements. One
particularly unique improvement being proposed at an intersection incorporates a modern
roundabout at the existing rotary at the intersection of Old Colony Avenue and Preble
Street. The proposed design drastically decreases the footprint of the intersection and
creates all around safer traffic movements for roundabout approaches. These bicycle and
pedestrian facilities encircle the roundabout to create shorter and safer crossings. This
redesign also allows for the reclamation of approximately 9,000 square feet of accessible
green space for groundwater infiltration and recharge.

The analysis allowed for the incorporation of bike facilities that have easy and safe
connection throughout the corridor. The majority of the route incorporates a two-way
cycle track with a minimum three foot buffer area that allows for separation between
cyclists and vehicular traffic. The cycle track alternates between being raised above the
road grade (i.e., at the same grade as the existing sidewalk) and at the same grade at the
roadway. The buffer area incorporates the use of bollards and angled pavement markings
to enforce the separation between cyclists and vehicles.

The proposed route was selected based on creating a bicycle facility that minimizes
crossings while creating enough separation from vehicular and pedestrian traffic to
appeal to bicycle users of all levels.

1.0 Background

1.1 Introduction

There has been a tremendous shift in the philosophy of local and state government when
it comes to bicycles in the City of Boston. Previously, incorporating bicycle facilities into
the overall designs of roadways was hardly considered a priority when it came to space
and monetary considerations. But today, Boston is poised to be at the forefront of this
philosophical shift with the incorporation of many bicycle facilities and corridors
allowing for increased accessibility throughout the City. As the City increases its
bicycling network, there is a critical connection which needs to be made in the
Dorchester area. (Figure 1.1-A)

The creation of a bicycle corridor from the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and
Melnea Cass Boulevard to the University of Massachusetts (UMASS) Boston entrance
will provide an attractive connection for all types of cyclists. These include connections
to the South Bay Harbor Trail in the west and the Harbor Walk in the east. There is also
a planned Harbor Walk extension which will incorporate a connection to the south with
the Neponset River Greenway. There is also a hope that residents south of Boston will
forgo their cars and use this new comfortable separated facility. While the main objective
of this report is to address the main connection between UMASS Boston and
Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, it will also allow for numerous other
bicycle facility connections throughout its route that will allow for future bicycle network
expansions and also tie into several existing facilities.

 1.1.1           Purpose of Project and Objectives

In an effort to create a critical connection between cyclists on the South Bay Harbor Trail
and those on the Harbor Walk, a design has been created to integrate these facilities into a
corridor from Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass to UMASS Boston. The
objectives of the project include the following:

    Creation of a critical link between existing bicycle facilities

    Design of a bicycle corridor to facilitate rapid and easy transportation between
    both ends as well as destinations within the corridor

    Design of a safe, separated and comfortable facility, for use by bicyclists of all
    abilities

    Significant modifications to the UMASS Boston and Morrissey Boulevard
    intersection to incorporate bicycle facilities and better manage traffic within the
    existing right of way

    Incorporation of facilities for connections to South Boston and other points of
    interest (e.g. UMASS Boston, MBTA Stations, South Bay Center), from proposed
    bicycle corridor

    Significant improvements to the traffic circle at the intersection of Preble Street,
    Columbia Road, and Old Colony Avenue to better manage traffic flow,
    incorporate anticipated bicycle traffic and increase safety.

1.2 Proposed Route & Study Area

The proposed route was identified as a critical link to complete the cycling network in the
City of Boston. The proposed route is approximately 2.3 miles long. For 1.1 miles it is
orientated in the East/West direction and the North/South for 1.2 miles, as listed below
(Figure 1.2-A):

            o Southampton Street (East/West)

            o Preble Street (East/West)

            o Old Colony Avenue (North/South)

            o Mt. Vernon Street (North/South)

            o Morrissey Boulevard (North/South)

In selecting a route to accommodate cyclists, the limiting factor was the crossing of
Interstate 93 (I-93). Of the available crossings, Preble Street/Southampton Street gave
the most acceptable alternative, with its expansive right of way and lower traffic
volumes. Other considered crossings included Columbia Rd and residential roads west of
                                            7
4/23/2009
Moakley Park. These connections were unacceptable due to high traffic volumes and the
use of a rotary, in the case of Columbia Road, and an indirect route in the case of the
residential streets. Based on this selection the rest of the proposed route was chosen to
create the most direct corridor for cyclists.

Using the proposed route, the study area was identified to include all roadways and
intersections along this corridor bounded by Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass
Boulevard in the northwest, Old Colony Avenue and Preble Street in the northeast and
UMASS Boston and Morrissey Boulevard in the south. Along this route there are many
significant intersections defined by being a signalized intersection or a decision point for
cyclists using the facility. Major intersections include the following:

           o Southampton Street at Massachusetts Avenue

           o Southampton Street at Allstate Road (South Bay Center)

           o Dorchester Avenue at Preble Street/Southampton Street

           o Preble Street at Old Colony Avenue

           o Old Colony Avenue at Columbia Road

           o Morrissey Boulevard at Mt. Vernon Street

           o Morrissey Boulevard at UMASS Boston

1.3 Report Organization

The report begins by providing some historical context to the project area. Thereafter, the
report is broken up into sections by significant links of the proposed route. These
significant links were chosen because each link contains similar characteristics such as
roadway width and function type. These links include the following from the west to east
and north to south:

            - Southampton Street

            - Preble Street

            - Old Colony Avenue

            - Morrissey Boulevard

Each section describing the major links discusses existing conditions as well as proposed
modifications. The existing conditions section of the report has a broad overview of the
proposed corridor. This is followed by a section detailing design elements that are
common throughout the corridor. Design alternatives, which were not chosen as part of
the final design, are also mentioned. Following this is a detailed description which
includes proposed modifications to the existing roadways to create the bicycle corridor.
The report concludes with a closing and acknowledgement sections.

1.4 History

Southampton Street was originally laid out in 1877 by the City of Boston under the name
of Swett Street. The name was changed in 1901 to Southampton Street and is currently
maintained by the City of Boston. The right of way has remained the same. Preble Street
was laid out in 1879 by the City of Boston and is still maintained by Boston. It was built
to create a connection between the City of Boston Back Bay and Dorchester via Old
Colony Ave. Old Colony Ave was originally built as a City of Boston Street but was then
transferred to the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) which has since become the
Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) in 1956. It was built to create an
entrance for residents of Dorchester into the City of Boston. Morrissey Boulevard was
constructed in the 1950's and has had some capacity improvements by way of adding
lanes. It was scheduled to have a complete reconstruction in the 1990's which has yet to
take place.

1.5 Need for Bike Route

The need for a separated bike route through this area is to provide a safe corridor for all
of cyclists. A few historic connections for both tourist and permanent residents along to
this route include Moakley Park, Castle Island, Bay Side Expo Center, University of
Massachusetts Boston, Boston Medical Center, South Bay Center, and the City of Boston
tow lot. This path also provides a necessary connection in the Boston bike path network.
These connections include the Neponset River Greenway to the south and the South Bay
Harbor trail to the west.

2.0 Existing Conditions

2.1 Introduction

In order to create a design for the proposed bikeway, an accurate analysis of the existing
conditions was conducted. To do this, necessary traffic and field data had to be collected.
These data were then analyzed at intersections along the proposed corridor. These key
locations were defined by locations where roadway geometries were proposed to be
changed (e.g. lane elimination). Such data includes crash data, turning movement counts,
signal timings and field observations. These locations include (Figure 2.1-A):

       - Southampton at Massachusetts Avenue
            - Four-legged signalized intersection

       - Southampton at Allstate Road
            - Three-legged signalized intersection

       - Preble Street at Old Colony Avenue
            - Rotary with four approaches

       - Morrissey Boulevard at Shaw's Supermarkets
           - Three-legged signalized intersection

2.2 Data Collection
 2.2.1           Crash Data

Analysis of crash data has been completed for the five previously stated intersections in
the corridor. Data from the Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) database for the
most recent available years, 2004-2006 were compiled for the applicable intersections.
At each intersection the crashes were stratified according to year, type, severity, weather,
and time of day. (Table 2.2-A) Additionally, crash rates at each of the intersections were
calculated and compared to the District 4 Average and State Average. (Appendix A).
This comparison serves the purpose of observing how safely the intersection is operating
in comparison with those throughout the district and the state.

This data is very important to review when proposing changes to an existing roadway or
intersection. Looking at the types of crashes and the conditions surrounding them can
help inform and mold a future design. The importance of incorporating crash data is
found in the need to constantly improve safety on the roads and intersections.

Of the five analyzed intersections, two were of interest because the crash rates exceeded
the state and district average. The other intersections, Southampton at Theo Glynn Way,
Southampton at Allstate Road, and UMASS at Morrissey Boulevard, which were
analyzed for crash data had calculated crash rates well below their respective averages.
Although it is important to constantly improve safety for our roadways and intersections,
analysis of these intersections was not furthered due to their satisfactory performance.

For this section of the corridor, special attention must be drawn specifically to the crash
analysis conducted at Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard. In the 2004-
2006 Statewide Top 200 Intersection Crash List (Appendix I), compiled by MHD, this
intersection ranked the nineteenth highest. With 89 crashes over a three year period and a
crash rate of 1.43 crashes per million vehicles, it is much higher than the District 4
average of 0.88 and the Statewide average of 0.87. Most significantly, 2 of these 89
crashes were of a fatal nature, strongly suggesting a redesign of this intersection is
needed.

Another intersection of interest, from a crash perspective, is the intersection of
Southampton Street, Dorchester Street, Boston Street, Preble Street and Dorchester
Avenue. This intersection's crash rate is 0.90, which is slightly above both the District 4
average and the statewide average for signalized intersections. The most apparent reason
for this slightly raised number of crashes is the odd geometry of the intersecting streets.
This geometry leads to a wide variety of crashes including angle, rear-end, head-on, and
sideswipe collisions.

The final intersection, where calculated crash rates were above the averages, is at the
intersection of Preble Street, Old Colony Avenue and Columbia Road, known from here
on as Preble Circle. This intersection currently operates as a rotary. As with many
rotaries, the expansive pavement and ambiguous traffic movements create an unsafe
situation which causes crashes. The crash rate of 0.66 is slightly above the District 4
average, 0.63, and is equal to that of the State average for unsignalized intersections.

 2.2.2           Turning Movement Counts

In order to prepare a sufficient analysis of the existing and future conditions along the
corridor, traffic volumes were collected at four major intersections on the roadway
(Figure 2.2-A):

            o Southampton at Massachusetts Avenue

            o Southampton at Allstate Road

            o Preble Street at Old Colony Avenue

            o Morrissey Boulevard at UMASS Boston




                                            14

Turning movement counts were conducted at intersections where a geometric
reconfiguration was being considered. As part of this data collection, turning movement
counts were conducted at these intersections during both the AM and PM peak periods
during the weekdays. (Appendix B) Also, due to the seemingly high volume of trucks
and other heavy vehicles in the Southampton Street area, heavy vehicles were counted
and percentages were calculated. In this area, approximately 6% of all traveling vehicles
are considered heavy vehicles. This is important to point out due to the danger which they
pose to pedestrians and cyclists.

 2.2.3            Signal Timings

A final element of the data collection for this design was the collection of signal timings
at the intersections where analysis was needed. These intersections are the same as listed
previously. From these signal timings, phase diagrams were able to be completed and
used to analyze the existing conditions along the corridor (Appendix J).

2.3 Analysis of Existing Conditions

With the turning movement counts and signal timings collected, an analysis of the
existing conditions was completed. This analysis evaluated the existing Level of Service
(LOS), capacity, and delay at each of the analyzed intersections. The analyses of these
intersections were in accordance with methods established in the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) (Table 2.3-A). The HCM defines LOS as "a qualitative measure
describing operation conditions within a traffic stream, and their perception by motorists
and/or passengers. It also defines capacity, "the maximum rate of flow that can
reasonably be expected to pass a point on a uniform section of a lane or roadway under
prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions." Delay can be defined as the average
amount of time, in seconds, a driver is waiting at an intersection. A summary of these
characteristics creates a picture of how the intersections currently operate. (Table 2.3-B)
This analysis was completed using Synchro, traffic analysis software. Synchro analysis
creates a realistic representation of the LOS, capacity, and delay, existing at each of the
analyzed intersections (Appendix C). These analyses will be used as a basis for
comparison for future improvements throughout the corridor.

2.4 Southampton St
  2.4.1           Overview of Section

Cyclists and pedestrians, who are heading east on the South Bay Harbor Trail, have no
option to continue east at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass
Boulevard. Towards the east, there is no continuation of a separated path and they are
forced to merge and utilize the sidewalks. Currently, Southampton Street is a four-lane
street. West of Theo Glynn Way, vehicular traffic is one way (Figure 2.4-A), and east of
Theo Glynn Way the road supports two directions of travel. There are sidewalks on both
sides of Southampton Street with many driveway crossings. Also, because there is no
designated area for cyclists and a section of Southampton is one-way (in a westerly
direction), cyclists are forced onto these crowded sidewalks or travel on the southern side
of the street. This southern side of the street has many high volume driveways and
intersections, which bicyclists would have to cross. (Figure 2.4-B).

                Figure 2.4-B: Example of South Side Intersection Bicycle Crossing
One noteworthy vehicular movement that causes queues during peak periods is the
vehicular traffic heading westbound along Southampton Street who are turning left onto
Melnea Cass Boulevard. Here drivers encounter limited storage space for the two left
turning lanes and are unable to access the lanes without blocking traffic that is trying to
head north onto Massachusetts Avenue Figure 2.4-C

Figure 2.4-C: Inadequate Storage Space for Left Turning Vehicles at the Intersection of
Massachusetts Avenue/Melnea Cass Boulevard and Southampton Street


Heading east on Southampton, from Melnea Cass and Massachusetts Avenue, the street
switches to two-way vehicular traffic with two lanes in each direction (Figure 2.4-D).
The southern side of Southampton Street serves as a very busy loading area for large
vehicles at various businesses. These loading docks on the southern side create a situation
where loading trucks block lanes of traffic (Figure 2.4-E). Due to the industrial nature of
the area, there are many heavy vehicles that use this section of roadway, approximately
6% of all vehicles. For both cyclists and vehicles traveling eastbound, this means
dangerously weaving through traffic to continue towards the east.

            Figure 2.4-E: Inadequate Loading Bay on South Side of Southampton Street


Continuing to the east, Southampton Street approaches Dorchester Avenue, the street
again narrows as it crosses the Southeast Expressway and rail road tracks, east of
Interstate 93. (Figure 2.4-F). Very narrow sidewalks force cyclists into the road to travel
as they approach the Dorchester Avenue intersection. At this location there is an
intersection of six legs of traffic: Dorchester Avenue, Dorchester Street, Preble Street,
Boston Street, and Southampton Street. At this intersection there are two lanes in the
eastbound direction on Southampton Street and one lane in the westbound direction
(Figure 2.4-G).Close to the intersection there is the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority
(MBTA) Andrew Station, where waves of pedestrians leaving the facility create possible
conflicts with cyclists. Crossing this intersection towards the east on the corridor brings a
traveler to Preble Street.

2.5 Preble Street
 2.5.1            Overview of Section

Preble Street, east of the Dorchester Avenue and Southampton Street intersection, is a
two-lane, two-way roadway with parallel parking on both the north and the south side
(Figure 2.5-A) It is a wide street that functions as a connector road but is very residential.
Cyclists leaving the Dorchester Avenue intersection, much like Southampton Street, are
forced to either ride with traffic or on the sidewalks. Both present challenges with
parking on both sides of street and a heavier pedestrian presence than on Southampton
Street. As cyclists come to the eastern end of Preble Street, they are faced with the task of
traversing a very large rotary regardless of their destination (Figure 2.5-B).

       Figure 2.5-B: Example of Rotary Approach at Preble Street and Old Colony Avenue



This rotary is the intersection of Preble Street, Old Colony Avenue and Columbia Road,
and is the northern boundary of the final two sections of the corridor (Figure 2.5-C). The
rotary in its current condition provides several "straight-shots", where drivers can travel
at rates of speed through the rotary that are higher than desirable. Desirable speeds would
consist of speeds that are low (15-25 mph) and consistent with other modern
roundabouts. These high speeds also make it very difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to
cross. There is also a high volume of traffic that travels north and south on Old Colony


                                              23

Avenue. Between these high volumes and high speeds, there is less opportunity for
drivers heading eastbound on Preble Street to enter the circulating traffic volume.

2.6 Old Colony Avenue
 2.6.1           Overview of Section

Travelling south of the rotary, there is Old Colony Avenue. This avenue has ample space
to accommodate vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians safely due to the wide existing right-
of-way (approximately 148'). Old Colony Avenue is an expansive thoroughfare with
wide sidewalks, parking on both sides, and six lanes of traffic that is divided by a large
median (Figure 2.6-A). The three lanes in each direction create a situation where there are
under utilized lanes for the extent of the roadway. On the eastern side of Old Colony
Avenue is Joseph Moakley Park.




                   Figure 2.6-A: Old Colony Avenue - Existing Cross Section




                                                                      24
4/23/2009




There are several bus stops along the route that service the #5 & #16 MBTA bus lines.
The presence of these bus routes makes it more challenging to integrate bicycle facilities.
Old Colony Avenue also has one pedestrian bridge approximately 1000 feet south of the
rotary, which connects the residential complex west of Old Colony Avenue to the Joseph
Moakley park on the east. This bridge allows pedestrians to cross the large number of
travel lanes on a separated path, although it is rarely used. Several pedestrian crossings
also compliment this pedestrian bridge throughout, several of which have their own
signal to expedite pedestrian crossings.

Continuing south on Old Colony Avenue, the roadway splits. Old Colony Avenue
continues south, west of Columbia Road. Columbia Road continues to the east and
connects with Kosciuszko Circle, an intersection of William J. Day Boulevard and
Morrissey Boulevard. Old Colony then changes names and becomes Mount Vernon
Street as it continues south under Columbia Road. It then ends at the MBTA
JFK/UMASS Subway Redline Stop (Figure 2.6-B). This brief section of Mount Vernon
Street contains a single lane of traffic in each direction with sidewalks on both sides of
the street. Cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers all have ample room to maneuver as needed
in a safe manner with limited potential conflicts.

2.7 Morrissey Boulevard
 2.7.1          Overview of Section

Morrissey Boulevard is another expansive roadway with a large right of way and at its
widest it has seven lanes (4 through and 3 left turning) in the southbound direction and
six lanes (4 through and 2 on a carriage road) traveling northbound (Figure 2.7-A). The
area also contains narrow sidewalks on either side of the roadway that are available for
pedestrian use. A carriage lane exists on the northbound side of Morrissey Boulevard,
from south of Mount Vernon Street to UMASS Boston, to allow for access to several
business' and Boston College high school without impeding on the main flow of traffic.




                  Figure 2.7-A: Morrissey Boulevard Existing Cross Section


At the northern end of Morrissey Boulevard, in front of the JFK/UMASS MBTA station,
there is a median separated road which services the MBTA Station, Shaw's Supermarket,
small offices buildings, and the Boston Globe. This section of roadway has two
southbound lanes and a single northbound lane that continues until the end of the Shaw's
Supermarket building, after which drivers can only travel southbound (Figure 2.7-B).
These lanes continue south all the way to the intersection of UMASS Boston and
Morrissey Boulevard, where they turn into three left turning lanes and one through lane.

of the left turn lanes.

3.0 Future Conditions: Alternatives Considered

3.1 Introduction to the Designs

As part of the design process, a large variety of design options were explored. These
designs are outlined below with descriptions as to why they were unacceptable as a final
design choice. The main focus of the objectives was to provide a safe and comfortable
bicycle facility for all types of users. These characteristics require adequate separation
and space to allow all users to maneuver easily and safely along the corridor. For these
reasons, many of the alternatives were rejected and not followed through to the final
design. Some other objectives, which these alternatives did not achieve, include minimal
roadway crossings, available right of way, and cost.

3.2 Design Alternatives Considered
 3.2.1           Southampton Street (Melnea Cass Boulevard to Allstate Road)



Alternatives considered for this section of the proposed route:

   ¾ Alternative A: Add Bike Lane in Each Direction

   ¾ Alternative B: Cycle Track, South Side of Southampton Street



Alternative A: Add Bike Lane in Each Direction

Alternative A would incorporate four foot bike lanes in each direction to better
accommodate cyclists along Southampton Street (Figure 3.2-A). This would involve the
reduction of lane widths along this section of Southampton Street, while maintaining the
same number of lanes.




                 Figure 3.2-A: Southampton Street Alternative A Cross Section



                                             28
4/23/2009




Viability

While this alternative is feasible, it is in conflict with the main objectives of the project.
This type of facility does not provide the necessary separation from vehicles, which
would create a safe and comfortable cycling area. Due to the age of the buildings on the
south side, modern trucks are unable to fit entirely on the property while making
deliveries (Figure 2.4-E). The bike lane on the south side of the roadway would have a
high potential for conflicts with heavy vehicles making deliveries to buildings on this
side of the street. They are often found blocking one or even two lanes of traffic while
parked. This essentially renders the bike lane on the south side useless.

Alternative B: Cycle Track, South Side of Southampton Street

This alternative would involve the implementation of a cycle track on the south side of
the street (Figure 3.2-B). A cycle track is a bike facility which follows the direction of the
roadway, but has physical separation from travelling motor vehicles. This cycle track
would be two-way allowing bicycle traffic to travel in both directions. This cycle track
would need the elimination of a lane or the narrowing of lanes to obtain the necessary
right of way.




                  Figure 3.2-B: Southampton Street Alternative B Cross Section
Viability

While feasible, this alternative has a high potential for conflicts with many heavy
vehicles that utilize the south side of Southampton Street. This cycle track would also
create an awkward and unsafe crossing at the intersections of Melnea Cass Boulevard and
Massachusetts Avenue & Southampton Street and Theodore Glynn Way. This crossing at
Theodore Glynn Way would be an unsafe crossing due to the large number of travel lanes
and lack of a traffic signal.




                                              29
4/23/2009


 3.2.2           Southampton St (Allstate Road to Dorchester Avenue)



Alternatives considered for this section of the proposed route:

   ¾ Alternative A: Extend Sidewalk and Add Sharrows



Alternative A: Extend Sidewalk and Add Sharrows

Alternative A included extending the existing sidewalk to give pedestrians more room to
maneuver while crossing narrow sections of Southampton Street. This would allow
pedestrians, such as those leaving the MBTA's Andrew Station, to move more easily to
points west such as the South Bay Center. Facilities for bicycles included the addition of
Sharrows to the outermost lane in both directions (Figure 3.2-C). This would mean that
cyclists would share the road with any vehicle traveling along this section of
Southampton Street.




         Figure 3.2-C: Southampton Street (Narrow Section) Alternative A Cross Section
Viability

Although this option addresses the needs of the pedestrians, it does not adequately
address the needs of the cyclist. By placing cyclists in the roadway, they will be forced to
negotiate for space with heavy vehicles and fast moving traffic. This would leave this
section of the bike facility usable to only the most advanced riders. Since all of the other
sections (e.g., Old Colony Avenue and Morrissey Boulevard) have space to provide more
separated bike facilities, this alternative would also not be cohesive with the remaining
sections of the proposed bike facility.




                                              30

 3.2.3           Preble Street

Alternatives considered for this section of the proposed route:

   ¾ Alternative A: Wide Bike Lane in Each Direction
   ¾ Alternative B: Bike Lane between Sidewalk and Parking
   ¾ Alternative C: Sidewalk Extension with Bike Lanes


Alternative A: Wide Bike Lane in Each Direction

In this option, the existing wide travel lanes are reduced in both directions and a bike lane
in each direction would be incorporated between the travel lanes and parking (Figure
3.2-D). The wide bike lanes allow for bicycle users to move within the marked lane to
avoid any potential conflicts without having to travel directly in the travel lane. Parking
would be maintained.




                     Figure 3.2-D: Preble Street Alternative A Cross Section



Viability

This option creates ample space for cyclists; however, the facilities in the road do not
make it appealing to users of all levels. Also, by having a wide lane next to traffic with
little separation offers limited protection from drivers who decide to use the bike lane to
their advantage. Having this configuration also creates problems when connecting to
other sections of the path at Dorchester Avenue and also at the Old Colony Avenue
rotary.

Alternative B: Bike Lane between Sidewalk and Parking

Alternative B moves the single bike lane between the existing sidewalk and the parked
cars (Figure 3.2-E). This allows for more protection for the users of the bike lanes from
moving vehicles, but does not provide protection from parked cars. There are also many
driveways due to the residential nature of the street.



                                               31
4/23/2009




                    Figure 3.2-E: Preble Street Alternative B Cross Section



Viability

Although this alternative offers much more protection for path users from vehicles in the
travel lanes, it does not offer much protection from people accessing parked cars and
blocking the cycle track. Another consideration for this section is the number of
driveways that are present. With the large number of driveways trying to access Preble
Street, there are many cars pulling out to check for a break in traffic. By having the
parked cars beyond the cycle track, this creates a situation where the car will need to pull
forward in order to view traffic on Preble Street. This means that drivers pulling out
would be blocking the cycle track and making cyclists wait for the car to vacate. Given
the number potential conflicts this option is undesirable.

Alternative C: Sidewalk Extension with Bike Lanes

Alternative C addresses the residential nature of the street and incorporating the needs of
pedestrians while also considering bike facilities (Figure 3.2-F). This alternative would
extend the sidewalk on both sides to allow for increased space for pedestrians. At the
same time, parking would be maintained and located next to the extended sidewalk. Two
bike lanes would be added between the vehicular travel lanes and the parked cars.




                    Figure 3.2-F: Preble Street Alternative C Cross Section



                                              32
4/23/2009


Viability

Similar to Alternative B, having two one way bike lanes on either side of the street
provides challenges when cyclists try to connect to other sections of the path. Also, it
would require several street crossings, which creates potential conflicts between cyclists
and drivers. Although this option provides space for pedestrians, having bike lanes in the
street makes the path uncomfortable for lower level users, such as children. This
alternative also does not provide sufficient space for cyclists to avoid potential conflicts
with the parked cars to their right and would force them further into the vehicular travel
lane at times.

 3.2.4           Old Colony Avenue



Alternatives considered for this section of the proposed route:

   ¾ Alternative A.1 & A.2: Cycle Track on Western Side

   ¾ Alternative B: Bike Lane on Western Side and Shared Use Path on Eastern Side

   ¾ Alternative C.1 & C.2: Angled Parking on SB Side with Path on NB



Alternative A.1 & A.2: Cycle Track on Western Side

Two similar alternatives were considered for this section of the proposed route that both
are able to fit within the existing roadway width.

   ¾ Alternative A.1 would reduce the lane widths on the west side of Old Colony
     Avenue and add a two-way shared use path, located on the wide existing sidewalk
     along Moakley Park (Figure 3.2-G).

   ¾ Alternative A.2 would be similar to Alternative A.1 except move the 2-way cycle
     track on the west side of Old Colony Avenue would be on the other side of the
     parked cars on the southbound side (Figure 3.2-H).

These alternatives kept the number of travel lanes and parking spaces the same. Old
Colony Avenue also is the route for MBTA bus lines creating potential conflicts with
cycling facilities.

                 Figure 3.2-H: Old Colony Avenue Alternative A.2 Cross Section
Viability

These alternatives, although able to completely fit within the existing roadway width,
were not chosen because they did not fulfill the stated objectives. The buffer zone
between the cycle track and the parked cars does not provide adequate space to prevent
conflicts with people entering and exiting their vehicles. This is especially true due to the
proximity to the park; people entering and exiting their vehicles will need a prolonged
period of time and additional space than is available in this alternative. Alternative A.2
moves cyclists closer to the roadway, which does not appeal to all levels of riders.

Alternative B: Bike Lane on Western Side and Shared Use Path on Eastern Side

In Alternative B, a wide single bike lane is utilized on the southbound side of the
roadway next to the travel lanes and a single bike lane is incorporated in the northbound
side on the existing sidewalk (Figure 3.2-I). To accommodate the bike lane on the
southbound side, the lane widths would be reduced and the northbound travel lanes are
left untouched. The number of travel lanes and parking would be maintained with this
alternative.




                  Figure 3.2-I: Old Colony Avenue Alternative B Cross Section




                                              34
4/23/2009


Viability

This option allows for cyclists to move in the same direction as the flow of traffic,
creating some comfort for more advanced users. But similar to earlier alternatives, this
might not be appealing to all levels of users. Also, this alternative does little to protect
cyclists from the parked cars and any potential conflicts that they may encounter.



Alternative C.1 & C.2: Angled Parking on SB Side with Path on NB

Two similar alternatives were considered for this section of roadway that explore the use
of angled parking to maintain the number of parking spaces, but move all of the parking
to one side of the roadway (Figure 3.2-J & Figure 3.2-K).

   ¾ In Alternative C.1, angled parking would fit into the existing curb on the
     southbound side while still allowing for three travel lanes in both directions.
     Moving all of the parking to the southbound side creates an opportunity on the
     northbound side. A two-way cycle track on an extended sidewalk could be used in
     place of the parking as seen in Alternative C.1.

   ¾ In Alternative C.2, one lane is eliminated in both directions. The extra space
     would be used for cyclists on a single bike lane headed south on the western side
     and a two-way cycle track on the eastern side. Back in angled parking would be
     provided, to create greater visibility for exiting vehicles.

By utilizing angled parking, the total number of parking spaces is maintained with this
plan. Additional space creates the opportunity for additional green space.

4/23/2009




   Figure 3.2-K: Old Colony Avenue Alternative C.2 Cross Section with Separated Cycle Track



Viability

These options, although feasible (i.e., maintaining the number of travel lanes and parking
spaces) creates several concerns. The main concern is that Moakley Park is located on the
eastern side of the roadway. With the position of the parking, park users would be forced
to park their vehicles on one side of the roadway and then cross, creating a greater
number of crossing pedestrians and potential conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles.
Another concern is with the enforcement of back-in-only angled parking. There is the
possibility that drivers will ignore the back-in-only regulations. This creates an unsafe
situation for people trying to back their cars onto Old Colony Avenue after parking. Also,
this alternative does not allow for easy connection with other sections of the proposed
path: it would require additional street crossings (e.g., crossing the intersection at
Columbia Rd on the southern end of Old Colony Avenue). This leads to additional
conflicts between cyclists and motorists, decreasing the level of comfort and increasing
delay experienced by the cyclists.

 3.2.5           Morrissey Boulevard



Alternatives considered for this section of the proposed route:

   ¾ Alternative A: Cycle Track on Both Sides of Roadway



Alternative A: Cycle Track on Both Sides of Roadway

In this alternative, a new carriage road would be constructed on the southbound side to
mimic the one that exists on the northbound side (Figure 3.2-L). This would increase the
number of southbound lanes to three. In the carriage lane, there would be one vehicular
travel lane next to a two-way cycle track. On the northbound side, the situation would be
the same with a carriage road and two-way cycle track. The existing northbound carriage
lane would be reduced to one travel lane and the added area would be allotted to the two-
way cycle track to better accommodate users traveling to and from South Boston.

                Figure 3.2-L: Morrissey Boulevard Alternative A Cross Section


Viability

Although this option would provide ample separation from the main travel lanes, it
proves difficult for connections of the 2-way cycle track on the northbound side of the
Morrissey Boulevard. It was determined that it was not safe to connect two way cycling
traffic that is crossing Mount Vernon Street.

4.0 Future Conditions: Design Elements

4.1 Introduction

The intent of this section is to provide a basic understanding of concepts that are going to
be employed throughout the proposed corridor. The items mentioned in this section are
necessary at multiple locations and will be identified in plans but will not necessarily be
discussed in detail under the individual sections.

4.2 Cycle Track, Cycle Track Pavement Markings & Separation
 4.2.1           Cycle Tracks

Cycle tracks, widely used throughout countries such as the Netherlands, are separated
bicycle ways (Figure 4.2-A). The separation is from both vehicular and pedestrian traffic
through the use of visual and physical separations (e.g., paint and curbing). Due to their
separation and protection from other modes of transportation, they were chosen and
implanted for the entire design corridor. A cycle track was utilized for this design
because it allowed for bicycle movements in two directions while minimizing the
necessary width required for the bicycle facilities. Below is the range of width which the
cycle track will vary between along the corridor.

               Minimum Width:         8'

               Maximum Width:         12'

For sections where the right of way is constrained, the cycle track will not narrow to less
than 8', to allow for a minimum level of comfort for cyclists that would be passing each
other. Similarly, for areas where there is a large amount of space, the cycle track will not
be greater than 12'.

                       Figure 4.2-A: Typical Cycle Track Configuration



 4.2.2           Pedestrian and Cyclist Separation

Where there are no grade separations between pedestrians and cyclists, it is
recommended that separation indicators be installed and incorporated into the proposed
design. Two elements of the design will delineate the pedestrian area from the bicycle
area. The first of these is a change in material. The pedestrian sidewalk will be concrete,
while the cycle track will be paved with asphalt. Additionally, the asphalt will be formed
over a concrete base to avoid movement of the flexible material over the years.

The cycle track shall also be properly marked to indicate two-way bicycle traffic. This
will be indicated by a dashed yellow line, down the center of the cycle track for the
length of the cycle track. In addition to the center line, bicycle legends will be added at
intersections to emphasize the intended direction of travel (Figure 5.2B).

4/23/2009




        Figure 4.2-B: Typical Bicycle Legends to be Used on Cycle Track at Intersections

4.3 Bus Stops

Bus stops will be maintained to include all existing signage, markings, and waiting
structures. These facilities will be moved or replaced at the edge of all new curbing. Bus
stops located on roadways where the cycle track is at grade with the roadway, a bulb out
will be used (Figure 4.3-A). This bulb out allows pedestrians to cross the cycle track,
wait, and board the bus without a change in grade, aiding those who may have difficulties
boarding the buses. Bus stop locations and typical details are included in the plans.

4/23/2009


4.4 Catch Basins, Fire Hydrants & Trees

All catch basins and fire hydrants are to be moved to the edge of any extended sidewalks
to facilitate the necessary drainage and ease of use for emergency personnel. Trees and
shrubbery are to be removed at locations where they will impede on the proposed
facilities and there is no evident method for avoiding them. Otherwise, they are to be
preserved wherever possible.

Catch basins and fire hydrants that need to be moved will be called out in the proposal
and included in the cost estimate. Tree removal has been estimated but not called out in
the proposal.

4.5 Intersection Approaches

At all driveways and intersections, cyclists and pedestrians will have separate crossings,
discussed further in Section 4.9. In many locations, identified on the plans, existing
pedestrian ramps will be maintained. However, in locations where this is not possible,
alternative ramp design was applied. This design includes the lowering of the entire
sidewalk and bicycling facility, until they are at grade with the roadway. This design
facilitates the crossings of all users by spreading the waiting area and point of exit and
entrance onto the facilities. Generally, despite ability, all users utilize the ramps at
crossings. The proposed design will avoid this bottle neck and allow users more comfort
and an easier crossing.

An important aspect of this design is to deter drivers from encroaching on this at grade
waiting area for those crossing. Two methods of keeping vehicles from intruding upon
this area will be used. The first is a change in material. The newly lowered area shall be
made of concrete. This change in material provides a visual barrier delineating the
difference in space. A second delineation between the two areas will be bollards placed
at the change in material, providing a physical barrier between vehicles, and the
pedestrians and cyclists. The bollards will deter cars but allow free movement of
pedestrians and cyclists.

4.6 Signage
 4.6.1           Destination Signage

Because the proposed corridor route is over two miles in length, there is an opportunity to
direct facility users to the numerous attractions located along the route. The final designs
of these signs will be completed by others, but a list and potential location are to be
included in the proposal. Below is a list of potential sites to call attention to:

             South Boston

             UMASS Boston

             MBTA Andrew Station


                                            42

             MBTA JFK/UMASS Station

             South Bay Center

             Bayside Exposition Center

             Moakley Park

             South Bay Harbor Trail [Existing Path]

             Neponset River Greenway [Existing Path]

Distances and travel times for these locations and others have been calculated for the use
of destination sign design (Appendix G).

 4.6.2           Beginning/End of Path

At the two biggest intersections (Southampton Street at Melnea Cass Boulevard &
UMASS Boston at Morrissey Boulevard) along the proposed route, it is recommended
that signage be included to indicate to potential path users where they are able to enter the
corridor.

4.7 Vehicular Signage/Markings

Additional signage and pavement markings will be necessary for vehicular traffic at
several locations on the corridor to address limited sight lines and other safety concerns.
One particular area where this will be necessary is at the rotary at the intersection of
Preble Street and Old Colony Avenue. At this location, typical signage for roundabouts
(Section 6.0) will need to be included. This includes yield signs and yield line pavement
markings, also known as shark's teeth. At locations where sightlines are limited, warning
signs will be installed on side streets to indicate to drivers that they are approaching a
bicycle path.

4.8 Cycle Track Buffer Area

Along the majority of the proposed route, where ever a cycle track is to be located at
grade with the roadway, significant separation between vehicles and cyclists is required
to create a sense of comfort for users of the proposed bike facilities. The buffer will
include the use of planters near residential areas and bollards elsewhere to enforce
separation. These planters would be placed in the allotted buffer, in sections where the
buffer is greater than four feet. These planters include small plants and other flowers that
are intended to help beautify a section of roadway (Figure 4.8-A). Where the buffer is
less than this, the use of paint and bollards will be implemented. The paint will consist
of a solid white line delineating the edge of the buffer zone with angled hatching (Figure
4.8-A). The spacing of the bollards and planters shall be at 25 feet. The exception to this
is in buffer zones which are shorter than 25 feet shall the divider (bollard or planter) at
each end of the areas.

4.9 Crossings

All pedestrian crosswalks will be 10' wide ladder crosswalks (Figure 4.9-A). A cyclist
crossing area will be located adjacent to the pedestrian crossings. The width of the cycle
crossing varies and will be consistent with the width of the cycle track at the location of
the crossings (Figure 4.9-B). The bicycle crossing markings are inspired by those
commonly used in the Netherlands. Each crossing will have a border along its limits to
identify the path's continuation to cyclists, pedestrians and drivers.

5.0 Future Conditions: No Build 2014

5.1 Introduction to Future Conditions

The future conditions section of the report focuses on adjusting the traffic flows and
Level-of-Service at the analyzed intersections to what they are expected to become by
2014. By utilizing the average daily traffic (ADT) values provided by the MHD data
base, a growth rate of 1.8% per year was calculated. This growth rate was applied to
each of the collected turning movement counts to anticipate conservative traffic volumes
for the year 2014.

5.2 Growth Analysis and Level-of-Service

After growing the existing volumes to the estimated volumes of the year 2014, analyses
were run on the same intersections as the existing analysis with the new volumes
(Appendix D). The purpose of this analysis is to compare a baseline (existing) to the
future designs (proposed). Similar to the existing conditions analysis a summary of the
LOS, capacity and delay at each intersection, gives an impression of how the corridor
operates as a whole (Table 5.2-A).

6.0 Future Conditions: Selected Design

6.1 Introduction to the Selected Design

The selected design section of the report details the chosen design for the length of the
corridor. Several improvements have been proposed for pedestrians, cyclists, and
vehicles along the proposed route. Many of these improvements have been outlined in
Section 5.0. This section will present the locations and integration of the noted
improvements throughout the corridor. The description will begin at the intersection of
Melnea Cass Boulevard and Massachusetts Avenue, continue east down Southampton
Street until Preble Circle, and then will continue south to Old Colony Avenue and
Morrissey Boulevard, ending at the intersection of Morrissey Boulevard and UMASS
Boston.

6.2 Southampton Street (Melnea Cass Boulevard to Allstate Road)
 6.2.1           Overview of Selected Design

Currently, Southampton Street is a four-lane roadway, including a one-way section,
between Theodore Glynn Way until Massachusetts Avenue. The selected design includes
a two-way cycle track on the north side of Southampton Street. As specified below, the
cycle track will be either grade separated or at grade with the roadway with a buffer
depending on the available space and the proximity to bus stops.

 6.2.2           Massachusetts Avenue Intersection Improvements

The improvements at this major intersection involve a reconfiguration of the
Southampton Street approach (Figure 6.2-A). The proposed design would utilize a
section of the existing island that is located on the south side of Southampton Street and
extend the storage lane length of the far left turning lane an additional 130'. This will
allow more storage for left turning vehicles to eliminate wasted green time for drivers
which are too far back in the queue to utilize it. This added lane length will also aide in
decreasing the queue length for the entire approach. This is especially necessary because
the existing channelized right turn lane's storage will be eliminated. The right most lane
will be eliminated for the transition of the beginning of the proposed cycle track on the
north side of Southampton Street.

Figure 6.2-A: Proposed Massachusetts Ave. and Melnea Cass Boulevard Intersection Improvements


Since the proposed design will be altering the configuration of the Southampton approach
to the intersection analysis of the proposed conditions is necessary. Similar to the
existing conditions, anticipated traffic volumes of the year 2014 have been analyzed with
the proposed reconfiguration (Appendix E). The proposed design also modifies the
existing signal timings to better manage the expected traffic and maintain the existing
LOS (Table 6.2-A).

The comparison between existing LOS, capacity, and delay for each approach of the
intersection and the proposed (Table 6.2-A) clearly shows how the new signal timings
and configuration improve conditions.      The proposed design provides a slight
improvement for many approaches. The other movements, which have not improved, are
maintained at the existing LOS.

 6.2.3             Roadway Improvements

Continuing east from the Massachusetts Avenue intersection, this portion of
Southampton Street includes the elimination of one westbound travel lane. The
elimination of a vehicular travel lane allows for the incorporation of improved pedestrian
and bicycle facilities (Figure 6.2-B & Figure 6.2-C). Justification for removal of one
travel lane is described later in this section. Beginning on the north side of the right of
way, there will be the pedestrian area, which on average is 10 feet and is adjacent to
buildings and property lines. The pedestrians will utilize the existing sidewalk.
Continuing toward the center of the cross-section is a two-way cycle, as described in
Section 5.0. The cycle track is going to be at grade with the existing roadway and will be
separated by a minimum three foot wide buffer. Within this buffer are flexible bollards
which provide physical separation from opposing vehicular traffic. Next to the proposed
buffer is a one foot off set, three 11 foot vehicular travel lanes, followed by another one
foot offset and the existing sidewalk on the southern side of Southampton Street.

         Figure 6.2-C: Southampton Street Selected Design 3-Lane 2-Way Cross Section


In a few sections of this portion of roadway, identified in the plans, the cycle track
narrows from 12 feet to 10 feet wide and the pedestrian area to 6 feet in width to
accommodate bus stops. At these locations the cycle track is brought to grade with the
sidewalk. This is to allow easy crossing and loading for those who may have difficulties
boarding the buses.

As the roadway approaches the South Bay Center intersection, at Allstate Road, there is a
transition from a single westbound lane to two westbound lanes. During this transition
the cycle track is brought up to the same grade as the sidewalk. The grade transition, for
the cyclists, provides sufficient space and separation due to the limited space with the
second westbound travel lane. This lane elimination is unable to be carried through the
intersection with Allstate Road due to queuing restrictions in the westbound movement
during the AM peak period. The two lanes are continued at the western side of the
intersection in order to properly store vehicles which pass through the signal. This is


                                               50
4/23/2009


important because if there were an obstruction further west of the intersection, the
vehicles passing through the intersection on a green signal are clear of the intersection
while being stopped.

In order to justify the elimination of a lane, it must be shown that vehicle operations can
continue to function at an acceptable level. A single lane of traffic can generally process
1800 vehicles per hour, and some estimate with Boston drivers it can be as high as 2100
vehicles per hour. This being said traffic heading westbound during the AM peak hour
(the highest measured traffic volume) contained 948 vehicles. This is far below the 1800
vehicles per hour it is able to process (Figure 6.2-D). Lane capacity in urban areas is
determined by the amount of green time given during a signalized cycle. However
between the intersection of Allstate Road and Massachusetts Avenue there are no signals,
clearly showing that lane elimination is a viable design option.

Figure 6.2-D: Critical Volume Analysis for Westbound traffic along Southampton Street between
South Bay Center and Melnea Cass Boulevard

The westbound travel lane was also chosen to be eliminated because of a loading dock
facilities located on the south side of the roadway near New Market Square. Because of
the location of the building, there is inadequate space to allow for trucks to pull into the
loading dock. This creates a situation where large trucks often block roadway traffic (2
lanes in some cases). The constant blocking of large sections of the roadway eliminated
the possibility of locating any bicycle facilities on the south side of the roadway.

Locating the cycle track on the north side of the road provides the safest cycling facilities
for this area. This location avoids the continuous conflict with the trucks utilizing the
loading docks on the south side of Southampton Street. The separation between cyclists
and heavy vehicles is extremely important when designing a safe bicycle facility. The
north side cycle track maximizes this separation in this industrial and heavy vehicle
saturated area. This cycle track location also eliminated an awkward and potentially
dangerous connection at Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard. A south
side cycle track would have ended/began in a median refuge next to left turning traffic
from Southampton Street. This would leave cyclists stranded and unable to easily join
traffic, connect to the South Bay Harbor Trail or continue on the sidewalk. The north
side track creates an easy transition with the use of existing intersection facilities.

6.3 Southampton Street (Allstate Road to Dorchester Avenue)
  6.3.1            Allstate Road Intersection Improvements

At this point in the corridor, the proposed two-way cycle track is still located on the north
side of Southampton Street, continuing through the Allstate Road intersection. The cycle
track is at grade with the pedestrian facilities. This was achieved through narrowing each
of the four travel lanes. As mentioned before, lane elimination was not a design option
for this intersection, especially in the west bound direction. This is so because of the long
queues which build up and interfere with traffic signals east of Allstate Road. Syncrho
analysis of the 2014 conditions confirms the impossibility. Therefore, the general
configuration of the intersection remained the same and was analyzed with the expected
2014 traffic volumes (Appendix D). A comparison between the existing conditions and
proposed show that operations will continue to operate at an acceptable LOS in the future
(Table 6.3-A). Modifications to the signal timings were also completed in order to
accommodate bicycle and pedestrian crossings, through the implementation of an all
pedestrian phase.

The current LOS for this intersection is B for both AM & PM peak hour. Calculating the
anticipated traffic flow in 2014, the LOS of the intersection is maintained at B. The
reason for the slight increase in overall delay is due to the addition of a pedestrian phase
which does not exist currently. This is extremely important to allow safe crossing for a
highly desired destination.

 6.3.2            Roadway Improvements

Continuing east on Southampton Street, the two-way cycle track remains on the north
side of the road through the Allstate Road intersection to the intersection with Dorchester
Avenue (Figure 6.3-A). This section of the cycle track is located on an extended sidewalk
next to the pedestrian facilities. In this area, unlike when the cycle track is at grade with
vehicular traffic, there will be no bollards due to the grade separation provided by the
curb. The raised curb, along with the buffer for street furniture will provide an adequate
separation.




       Figure 6.3-A: Southampton Street Selected Design Cross Section at Railroad Crossing


As the cycle track approaches the intersection of Frontage Road, it is slightly deflected to
the north to properly align for the crossing at the intersection. This allows for maximum
visibility between the drivers and the cyclists and pedestrians. The cycle track and
pedestrian facilities are brought down to grade to make the crossing. The refuge islands
will contain cuts so that the crossing can be made entirely at grade. After the crossing, the
path is again raised and proceeds at grade with the sidewalk as it crosses the railroad
tracks towards Dorchester Avenue.

At the intersection of Southampton Street and Dorchester Avenue, the bike facility curves
towards the north. Pedestrians and bicycles cross at a new crosswalk that is being
proposed as part of a separate project for improvements along Dorchester Avenue. This
crossing will continue on to the cycle track on Preble Street.

6.4 Preble Street
         6.4.1   Overview of Selected Design

From the intersection with Dorchester Avenue heading east, the two-way cycle track
continues on the north side of Preble Street. For the majority of this section the cycle
track is located at grade with the roadway with a buffer zone separating the cycle track


                                               53

from the parked cars. A lane diet, or the narrowing of travel lane widths, will allot a large
amount of space to implement the proposed cycling facilities.

       6.4.2    Roadway Improvements

The lane diet conducted on this road, created an acceptable amount of space for a new
bicycling facility on the north side of Preble Street. This cycle track will be located
between the existing pedestrian facilities and the new location of the on street parking
(Figure 6.4-A). This location provides an easy connection to the proposed cycle track to
the west of Preble Street. This easy connection creates a safe transition for cyclists to the
east of Preble Street. On the west end at the proposed roundabout, Section 7.4.3,
connections will not be a limiting factor in the placement of the cycle track on Preble
Street.




               Figure 6.4-A: Preble Street Selected Design Cross Section Looking East


East of the Dorchester Avenue intersection the cycle track begins at grade with existing
sidewalk. The cycle track is located at this grade in order to accommodate the bus stop.
After the cycle track passes a bus stop, the cycle track is then brought down the grade of
the existing roadway. The cycle track is continued at this grade towards the east until
100 feet west of Vinton Street. At this point the cycle track will be brought back up to
sidewalk grade to accommodate another bus stop.

Despite the lane diet all movements and roadways facilities have been maintained. There
is still a single lane of traffic in each direction, reduced from 19 feet to 12 feet. The
narrowing of the lanes not only provides adequate space for cyclists but also implements
a method of traffic calming. With a narrower travel lane drivers will be forced to travel
at a lower speed. This is desirable due to the large number of residential buildings along
Preble Street. Parking is maintained throughout Preble Street along both sides of the
roadway. Approximately two parking spaces will be eliminated on the southern side and
eastern end of the roadway to accommodate the bus stop and additional roundabout lanes.

       6.4.3   Preble Circle Improvements

At the eastern end of Preble Street is a rotary of the intersection of Old Colony Avenue
and Columbia Road. This rotary is inadequate in terms of safety due to the expansive
pavement and "straight shots" conducive to high speeds. In place of this rotary is a
proposed modern roundabout (Figure 6.4-B). This will increase the safety of the
intersection and will continue exemplary operations.

The inscribed diameter of the proposed roundabout is 130 feet. Beginning from the
center of the roundabout is a central island, 30 feet in diameter. Surrounding this central
island is 24 feet of mountable apron. This allows heavy vehicles to traverse the
roundabouts with ease and safety. This apron will be made of granite rumble block
pavement. This will discourage passenger cars and smaller vehicles from using this area.
Surrounding the mountable apron are two 12 foot circulating travel lanes. At the
outermost limits of the roundabout are the pedestrian and cycling facilities.

            56
4/23/2009


These facilities are located at grade with the roadway to avoid frequent changes in grade
and to add to the comfort and continuity of the facility (Figure 6.4-C). The cycle track is
two-way and 12 feet wide, and the pedestrian walkway is eight feet wide. Continuing the
two-way track will allow for an easy connection to the facility which continues south on
Old Colony Avenue. These facilities on the outside of the roundabout also created ideal
connections to points north and further east for cyclists and pedestrians. Locating the
crossing at the legs of the intersections also allows for easy and short crossings through
the use of refuge medians between entrances and exits. Crossings will be marked as
described in Section 5.0. Bollards will be placed at each end of the roadways in order to
discourage vehicles from encroaching upon the pedestrian and bicycle facilities.

The pedestrian and cycling facilities are offset 25 feet from the circulating lanes. This
provides many opportunities to promote pedestrian and bicycle safety. The 25 feet
allows entering vehicles to wait to enter the roundabout and not block the crossings. This
same area allots exiting vehicles a sufficient amount of space to yield to a pedestrian or
bicyclist without blocking the circulating traffic.

Each approach contains two lanes. The exits northbound and southbound on Old Colony
Avenue each have two lanes while the exits at Preble Street and Columbia Road have
one. A single exit lane is safer because it eliminates an additional conflict between
exiting vehicles and circulating vehicles. It also reduces the crossing distance for
pedestrians and cyclists. The reason the exits on Old Colony Avenue are not single lanes
is due to the necessary capacity. The majority of exits occur on this road, and therefore a
single exit lane would work efficiently enough to continue with the implementation of the
roundabout. The Preble Street approach begins as a single lane and is flared to two lanes
over 160 feet. This increase to two lanes is necessary to maintain an acceptable LOS for
this approach. The additional lane allows for more storage and also allows two vehicles
to enter in an acceptable gap instead of just one.

With the implementation of the roundabout, all of the approaches will be realigned. This
alignment is necessary to deflect vehicles utilizing the intersection. The realignment will
bring each approach to almost a 90 degree angle with the intersection. This deflection is
the most important element of the modern roundabout. This is the element which results
in the traffic calming effect and decreases the speed of approaching vehicles, circulating
vehicles and exiting vehicles. This reduction in speed is very desirable for an area where
vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists will be interacting. Slower speeds will result in more
acute awareness of surroundings and adequate time to react to any unordinary situation.
Slower speeds will also create gaps within the circulating traffic that will allow for easier
merging from approaching vehicles.

After designing all the parameters of the roundabout, analysis was conducted to
anticipate the operation of the roundabout. Unfortunately, due to the unique nature of the
existing rotary, analysis was unable to be completed for the existing conditions. The
analysis of the proposed roundabout was completed with software called Rodel
(Appendix F). The program allows the input of the various geometric parameters of the
roundabout and outputs an HCM equivalent delay and LOS. This analysis was conducted
for both the AM and PM peak hour (Table 6.4-A). During both peaks the roundabout
performs exceptionally. The only exception is the northbound movement on Old Colony
Avenue during the AM peak. This is due to the extremely high traffic volume, but still
operates at an acceptable level of service.

The final benefit of implementing a roundabout at the location of the rotary is the amount
of pavement which can be "reclaimed" for green space. Although the additional green
space is only approximately 9,000 square feet, due to the loss of the large center island, it


                                               59

is now far more accessible. The green space in the center of the old rotary was
completely inaccessible due to the high speed of circulating traffic. The proposed green
space will be related to the perimeter of the roundabout, for the enjoyment of the users
and community.

6.5 Old Colony Avenue
       6.5.1   Overview of Selected Design

Beginning at the proposed roundabout, the cycle track continues south onto Old Colony
Avenue. The selected design along Old Colony Avenue involves the continuation of the
two-way cycle track on the west side of the roadway. This was achieved, again through a
lane diet and also lane elimination. The placement of the cycle track on the west side
provides connection benefits at the southern end of Old Colony Avenue. Included in the
proposed design of the cycling facilities are roadway improvements to the northbound
traffic movements in order to create a comprehensive design for the roadway.


       6.5.2   Roadway Improvements

The selected design along Old Colony Avenue involves the continuation of the two-way
cycle track on the west side of the roadway. The additional space for the cycle track was
achieved through the elimination of a travel lane (Figure 6.5-A). As mentioned
previously, a single travel can process about 1800 vehicles per hour. Critical link
volumes of 1110 & 1290 vehicles per hour during the peak AM & PM hour clearly
show the underutilization of the lanes and justify the elimination of one (Figure 6.5-B) In
addition to the elimination of a lane, the travel lanes have been narrowed from 14 feet
each to 12. This also acts as a traffic calming measure, ultimately decreasing vehicular
speeds. A travel lane on the northbound movement will also be eliminated for the same
reason. The extra space can be used at the discretion of the community and other
decision makers. There is abundant opportunity to utilize the space in a way that will
benefit all users.

Figure 6.5-B: Critical Volume Analysis for Old Colony Avenue Proposed Modifications


The allotted space on the west side will be used for the two-way cycle track and buffer
zone. The cycle track will be 12 feet wide and will be at grade with the roadway.
Pavement markings and intersection applications are as outlined in Section 5.0.
Pedestrians are to utilize the existing 11 foot sidewalk at the western most edge of the
right of way. At the locations of the bus stops, the sidewalk will be extended to the edge
of the roadway to allow for easy access on and off the bus.

The cycle track will be bounded by the sidewalk on the west side and a buffer zone on the
east side. This buffer zone will be implemented in concurrence with Section 5.0. In this
section of roadway the delineation between the cycle track and parking will be the use of
planters in the buffer. These planters provide vertical separation and also beautify the
area, which is important because of the residential nature on this side of the roadway.
This buffer also provides ample space for drivers and passengers to enter and exit their
vehicles without impeding the cycle track. All on street parking will be maintained on
both sides of the roadway.

Continuing south, at the split of Old Colony Avenue and Columbia Road, the bicycle
facility continues to the southwest and utilizes an existing road which bypasses the
Kosciuszko Circle (Figure 6.5-C). This roadway approaches the MBTA JFK/UMASS
subway station. The facility continues to be a 12 foot wide two-way cycle track at grade
with the roadway with a large buffer. The location of MBTA station justifies the western
location of the cycle track. Eliminating the crossing of the intersection achieves the goal
of maintaining a safe bicycle facility, due to the elimination of conflict with vehicles.

        Figure 6.5-C: Old Colony Avenue Selected Design Cross Section at Roadway Split


At the MBTA JFK/UMASS station the cycle track is transitioned to be at grade with the
sidewalk. This is necessary due to the narrow right of way at this particular location.
Despite the narrow cross-section a separate bicycle facility and pedestrian facility will be
separately maintained.

6.6 Morrissey Boulevard
       6.6.1   Overview of Selected Design

At the MBTA JFK/UMASS station the proposed design continues on an extended curb
from along Mount Vernon Street and heads towards the south along the entrance to
Morrissey Boulevard. The proposed cycle track will be located on the west side of
Morrissey Boulevard down to the intersection with UMass Boston. This end point
creates opportunity for future connection to the Neponset River Trail.

       6.6.2   Roadway Improvements (Southbound Side)

The two-way cycle track continues south on the western edge of Morrissey Boulevard.
This location allows for easy connection to the northern section of the corridor on Old
Colony Avenue (Figure 6.6-A). It also creates a comfortable setting for pedestrian and
cyclists, being located away from heavy, high speed traffic volumes. Although this
western location is not ideal for the connection into UMASS Boston, a proposed
intersection reconfiguration will safely integrate a crossing for cyclists.




                                             62
4/23/2009




                 Figure 6.6-A: Cross-Section at Two-Way Morrissey Boulevard
For the length of Morrissey Boulevard, the cycle track will be at grade with the sidewalk.
Necessary ramps and crossings will be implemented in coordination with Section 4.0, to
allow safe and easy crossing of driveways. Locating the cycle track at grade with the
sidewalk creates a more comfortable and separated environment for cyclists. This grade
separation is particularly desirable in the northern section of Morrissey Boulevard, where
there is only room for the minimum buffer between bicycle and vehicular traffic. South
of the existing two way portion of the western section of Morrissey Boulevard there is an
acceptable amount of space to implement a tree belt between the cycle track and travel
lanes. This separation creates a more park-like feel improving the aesthetics of the path.

To obtain this additional space for bicycle and vehicle separation a southbound travel
lane was eliminated and the existing travel lanes were narrowed (Figure 6.6-B). In
addition to the removal and reduction of the travel lanes, the existing median separating
the two southbound movements will be removed. South of the two-way section of
Morrissey Boulevard there will be four lanes and undivided southbound traffic. This will
allow vehicles from the western two section and vehicles traveling southbound from the
rotary at Kosciuszko Circle. This allows ample space for vehicles to align themselves
into the appropriate lanes for the movements on the UMass Boston intersection. The
maximum section of the proposed southbound side of Morrissey Boulevard, there are
four lanes of southbound moving vehicles.

Figure 6.6-B: Critical Volume Analysis for Morrissey Boulevard Southbound


Since this section of roadway is governed by traffic signals, Syncrho analysis was
conducted to determine the operations of the proposed roadways and intersection.
Sections 6.6.3 and 6.6.5, describe the reconfiguration and analysis for the two signalized
intersections on Morrissey Boulevard at Shaw's Supermarket and UMass Boston. There
is a third signal located on this section of the roadway which is located at the middle
driveway of the Boston Globe. The proposed design eliminates this signal. This signal is
currently used to allow delivery trucks and vehicles to exit the Boston Globe Driveways.
However, this signal is unnecessary due to the fact that only right turns are allowed onto
Morrissey Boulevard and southbound traffic, in the AM, is not significant enough to
hinder these exiting vehicles.

       6.6.3      Shaw's Driveway Improvements

The selected design eliminates a southbound lane in the two-way section on the western
side of Morrissey Boulevard (Figure 6.6-C). To justify the elimination of this lane,
Synchro analysis was conducted to prove that roadway and intersection operations will
continue to operate unhindered (Table 6.6-A & Figure 6.6-D). As is evident by the
comparison between the proposed design and the no build conditions of 2014, the
operations will be completely unaffected, Levels of Service of A for every movement.

        6.6.4    Roadway Improvements (Northbound Side)

Along the northbound side of Morrissey Boulevard, the selected design incorporates a
single bike lane in the carriage road (Figure 6.6-E). This modification takes the two lane
access road on the eastern side of Morrissey Boulevard and creates a single vehicular
travel a lane and a generous bike lane. The intent of this bike lane is to allow for a more
direct path for cyclists that intend to travel to points east of Moakley Park or to
destinations in South Boston. The bike lane starts along the access road at UMASS
Boston and continues north to the intersection of Morrissey Boulevard and Mount
Vernon Street. At this point cyclists are expected to either join vehicular traffic or cross
with pedestrians and utilize existing crosswalks/sidewalks for the remainder of their
journey.

       6.6.5   UMASS Boston Intersection Improvements

The selected design incorporates significant changes at the Morrissey Boulevard and
UMASS Boston intersection (Figure 6.6-F). The current configuration locates left turning
vehicles to the right of through traffic movement, separated by a small median. The
selected design eliminates the intermediate median along the south side of the roadway to
create a more traditional intersection with the through traffic to the right of the left
turning vehicles. This reconfiguration eliminates one through lane, which was used to
incorporate the cycle track and green areas.




               Figure 6.6-F: Proposed UMass Boston Intersection Improvements


The lane assignments for the southbound traffic include the preservation of three left
turning lanes and three through lanes, all 11 feet wide. The selected design cuts into the
existing median for one of the storage lanes for left turning vehicles. Additional lane
assignment markings have also been included for southbound vehicles to better
coordinate lane assignments as they properly align themselves north of the intersection.

The other approaches of this intersection remain fairly untouched. On the southern side
of the intersection, the medians are the only items being altered. The crossings will be

maintained at grade through the medians for both pedestrians and bicyclists. The
crossing has also been streamlined to entice all users to utilize the selected the design.

To ensure that this selected design will not negatively affect the operations of the
intersection, a Synchro analysis was conducted and summarized (Table 6.6-B). The
selected design shows the improved LOS for both the AM and PM peak hour for the year
2014. As congestion in this area becomes more of a problem it is important to maintain
operations, especially at intersections such as this.

7.0 Cost Estimate

The cost estimate detailed in Table 6.6-A is based off of plans generated by Livable
Engineering And Design. A detailed breakdown of the cost estimate is included in
Appendix H. Item numbers and descriptions were compiled from the 1988 Standard
Specification for Highways and Bridges and unit prices were taken from the weighted bid
averages located in the Massachusetts Highway Department website. 10% of the
estimated cost is added to the calculated total to account for associated engineering costs.

Introduction
MassHighway obtains crash data from the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) and uses it
for a number of purposes. The primary function, however, is that it provides the foundation for
developing safety improvement projects. The Top High Crash Locations Report is one of the tools used
in this process. Previously, MassHighway, with the assistance from Central Transportation Planning
Staff (CTPS), produced a Top 1000 Highway Crash Locations Report which included all types of
locations (interchanges, intersections and rotaries). Last year, MassHighway developed a new report type
where the locations identified were crash clusters at intersections (no grade separated locations and no
locations with weaving sections). In the report it was noted that in the near future the top bicycle and
pedestrian clusters would be identified and reported as well. This year, MassHighway is again preparing
a Top High Crash Locations Report which includes the top 200 high crash intersection locations using
crash data from 2004-2006 and also includes the highest frequency bicycle-motor vehicle and pedestrian-
motor vehicle crash locations for 2002-2006.

The Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) obtains crash data from State and local police reports and from
motor vehicle operators (motorists) who are involved in crashes. The RMV Crash Records Section
collects, enters and maintains crash data records, which are the source of the MassHighway crash data.

To produce this high crash locations listing, MassHighway, with the assistance of Geonetics, has
developed an automated procedure for processing, standardizing, matching and aggregating the crash data
by geographical location using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and procedures. This
automated process replaced the previous largely-manual process used by CTPS in developing the
integrated Top 1000 High Crash Locations Report.

This report, like last year's report, is based on the new Registry of Motor Vehicles crash system which
has been operational since 2002 and collects crash information in a different format. The new Crash
Data System (CDS) was designed, built and tested over a period of several years involving assistance and
input from a number of State, Federal and local agencies, including MassHighway and the Federal
Highway Administration. Due to the difficulty of obtaining complete and accurate information on crash
locations, one of the key parts of the CDS project was working with the police and the RMV to attempt to
obtain more accurate crash location data. New crash data forms for both police and operator reports were
designed to correspond to the new data entry system at the RMV. The CDS includes new data entry tools
to assist analysts attempting to validate the crash location data. Improved accuracy of the crash data along
with the standardization of street names is allowing MassHighway to do a better job of evaluating crash
locations. Generally, the geocoding rate (the rate at which crashes can be located to a specific
geographical point) has jumped from 62% to nearly 80% of crashes in the statewide system. However,
the geocoding rate is not uniform for all crashes nor for all types of crash locations. Some crashes may be
more difficult to geocode because of multiple intersections between the same roadway names within a
community, inconsistencies in roadway names between E911 files and the Road Inventory File or a host
of other reasons.

Furthermore, the reporting levels of some communities have changed dramatically between the old
reporting format (pre-2002) and the new format. As an example, one community has dropped reporting
levels by nearly a factor of 10, while another community has dramatically increased their reporting levels


                                                     i
so that they are now reporting nearly 10 times the number of crashes. Obviously, these reporting changes
significantly impact the results of the Top High Crash Locations Report.

Due to the many difficulties in obtaining precise, useable crash location data and many issues involved in
variations in crash reporting rates by some jurisdictions, this report should be used as a general purpose
screening tool rather than as a precise listing of crash frequencies by individual locations.

Methodology ­ Intersection Locations
The intersection crash cluster analysis method, developed by Geonetics, is a comprehensive method
designed to locate crash clusters. At the heart of the method is a 25 meter fixed search distance around
each crash. In basic terms, this radius controls how far the application will search for adjacent crashes.
Using a 25 meter radius, the analysis method found nearby crashes and merged their areas together, thus
creating clusters. If two distinct clusters are found to share a common crash, the two clusters are merged
into a single cluster. This method of search-and-merge results in a set of many distinct clusters of
different sizes. The application then stores these clusters to the GIS output file, along with the count of
crashes within the cluster. The clusters were then ranked by the number of Equivalent Property Damage
Only (EPDO) crashes contained within their boundaries. As in previous Top Crash Lists, fatal crashes are
weighted by 10, injury crashes are weighted by 5 and property damage only or non-reported is weighted
by 1. These are the same weights that were used to generate the previous Top 1000 High Crash Locations
Report.

The crashes were then named based on the highest functional classification roadway within the cluster,
followed by the roadway with the second highest functional classification. In instances where there were
two roadways with the identical classification, the first street name selected was the street with the longest
segment contained within the cluster. Some cluster naming was modified to insert the name of a private
way or site drive, rather than leaving it as unnamed (such as at an intersection of a roadway with a site
drive). Note that the area encompassing the crash cluster may be more broad than just the intersection.

The module to automatically determine whether the location was an intersection, rotary, interchange or
other, has not yet been developed. Therefore, a review of each location was required to make that
determination. Generally, a location was determined to be an "intersection" if the cluster did not contain
roadways with grade separation (interchange) nor weaving sections (rotaries or ramps). The clusters were
reviewed in descending EPDO order until 200 locations were obtained. A sample of the top 2 ranked
intersection locations is included in this report to illustrate the concept of the intersection clustering. The
actual crash clusters can be viewed on the interactive maps at mass.gov/mhd/topcrashclusters.
Furthermore, a shape file of the top crash intersection locations is available upon request.

The above method was used to develop the top 200 intersection crash locations for crashes occurring
during the three year period from 2004 to 2006. As with previous editions, the crash location analysis has
been scored over a three-year period. By using crash experience over the three-year period, anomalies in
the individual years of data tend to be reduced.

Methodology ­ Pedestrian and Bicycle Locations
New for this year, the top locations where reported collisions occurred between pedestrians and motor
vehicles and bicycles and motor vehicles have been identified. The crash cluster analysis methodology
for both the top pedestrian and the top bicycle crashes is similar to the top intersection location
methodology in that it uses a fixed meter search distance (for both pedestrian and bicycle crashes it is 100
meters compared to 25 meters for intersection locations) to merge crash clusters together. Crashes
involving collisions between motor vehicles and pedestrians or bicycles were identified by using the non-
motorist type code within the CDS database (which may yield different results from using most harmful
event, first harmful event, or sequence of events data fields). Furthermore, the methodology uses the


                                                      ii
Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO) weighting to rank the clusters. However, because of the
relatively small number of reported pedestrian and bicycle crashes in the crash data file, the clustering
analysis used crashes from the five year period from 2002-2006, instead of the three year analysis for
intersection locations. Additionally, due to the larger geographic area encompassed by both the
pedestrian and the bicycle crash clusters, it was difficult to name them so they were left unnamed but can
be viewed spatially. The top 10 ranked pedestrian crash locations and the top 10 bicycle crash locations
are included in this report. The actual crash clusters can be viewed on the interactive maps
mass.gov/mhd/topcrashclusters.

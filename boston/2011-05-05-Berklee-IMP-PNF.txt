Introduction / Mission and Objectives
1.0    INTRODUCTION/MISSION AND OBJECTIVES

1.1    Introduction

       Boston's Berklee College of Music (Berklee), the world's leading independent music college
       for the study of contemporary music, as well as the world's largest music college, is pleased
       to provide this Institutional Master Plan (IMP) as a framework for its campus planning
       initiatives and development strategies through the next decade. Berklee alumni have won a
       total of approximately 200 Grammy Awards and 19 winners of 54 Latin Grammy Awards.
       Musicians such as Quincy Jones, John Mayer, Branford Marsalis, Diana Krall, and over
       30,000 other career musicians and music professionals started their career trek at Berklee.
       The college now seeks the City of Boston's support to guide its much needed campus
       expansion.

       Berklee has an enrollment of approximately 4,000 full time equivalent (FTE) on-campus
       students (as defined in Section 3.1.1), with approximately 1,000 coming from 79 countries
       outside the United States. Approximately 800 students are currently housed in dormitories
       on campus. Berklee employs approximately 1,100 faculty and staff, 30% of whom are
       Boston residents. Berklee contributes approximately $3.25 million annually to the City of
       Boston via PILOT, property taxes, and community service programs.

       The projects included in the IMP, as well as potential future projects, will supplement
       Berklee's approximately 785,000 square feet (sf) presently owned and leased in the Back
       Bay, Fenway and one building in Allston/Brighton. Creating new space will also enable
       Berklee to address present critical space shortages, meet new needs for its increasingly
       technology-based curriculum and create a better sense of campus community for both its
       students and its neighbors.

       The college has been encouraged by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), its own
       team of experienced advisors, and the Berklee College of Music Community Task Force (the
       Task Force) to develop its campus plans in a flexible and open manner so as to integrate the
       needs of the City and the college early in the IMP process. Berklee has voluntarily worked
       with city agencies and neighborhood groups for the past four years in advance of this
       submission to accomplish this goal.

       Berklee's plans include three larger construction projects and a number of smaller campus
       improvement projects (IMP Projects or Proposed Institutional Projects). The IMP Projects
       include the following three projects:




2798/Berklee/IMP/PNF                            1-1               Introduction/Mission and Objectives
                                                                               Epsilon Associates, Inc.
               168 Massachusetts Avenue, an approximately 155,000 sf1 building with dormitory
               housing (approximately 370 beds), a new dining hall and student performance
               venue, music technology space, retail space, and common space;

               161-171 Massachusetts Avenue, which includes the renovation of existing space
               and an approximately 20,280 sf addition to the building to be used for academic
               and administrative space; and

               Berklee Crossroads, an approximately 290,000 sf building at the corner of
               Massachusetts Avenue and Boylston Street with dormitory housing, theatre space
               and student life and academic space.

          The IMP Projects also include smaller projects and campus improvements, as well as future
          space needs for which specific projects are not yet proposed as described in Chapter 5.

          Berklee is submitting this 10-year IMP to allow for improved academic facilities, an increase
          in college-owned residential space, and an increase in space to meet other demands of the
          Berklee community while also decreasing the constraints that currently exist.

          Berklee filed an Institutional Master Plan Notification Form (IMPNF) in January 2009. A
          Scoping Determination was issued by the BRA on April 6, 2009, providing the information
          required for the IMP. Due to the acquisition of the 168 Massachusetts Avenue site, Berklee
          filed a Notice of Project Change (NPC) to the BRA on December 7, 2010 adding the
          proposed project on the 168 Massachusetts Avenue site to the IMPNF and requesting a
          revised Scoping Determination. The BRA issued a letter revising the Scoping Determination
          for the IMP on December 24, 2010. The Scoping Determination and the letter in response
          to the NPC are provided in Appendix A.

          With this IMP, Berklee is also submitting a Project Notification Form (PNF) for the 168
          Massachusetts Avenue project (see Chapter 12). This project includes the construction of a
          new building with a dormitory, dining hall, academic and retail space. Please see Chapter
          12 for further details on the 168 Massachusetts Avenue project and a discussion of impacts.
          A subsequent PNF will be submitted for Berklee Crossroads as the design is further defined.

1.2       Campus Location

          The heart of Berklee's campus is in the vicinity of the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and
          Boylston Street, between two neighborhoods within the City of Boston, the Fenway and the
          Back Bay, and adjacent to a mixed-use district surrounding the Prudential Center (see Figure
          1-1). The neighborhoods reflect differences in character and demographics, but they
          remain two of Boston's most desirable neighborhoods for residents, retailers and companies

       seeking office space. Each neighborhood sustains a variety of uses, a strong sense of history
       and is home to many of Boston's finest cultural, entertainment and sports venues. Both
       neighborhoods are products of visionary planning. Architect Arthur Gilman is credited with
       designing the filled lands of the Back Bay, and Fredrick Law Olmsted's Emerald Necklace
       created the green spine for the Fenway neighborhood.

       Berklee College of Music is located within an area rich with public resources and private
       institutions that have a public mission. Resources contributing to the public realm that are
       located within a ten-minute walk of campus include the green space at Charlesgate, the
       Back Bay Fens portion of the Emerald Necklace, the Charles River Esplanade, the
       Commonwealth Avenue Mall, Hynes Convention Center, and the Boston Public Library.
       Private institutions with a public mission include The First Church of Christ, Scientist, the
       Boston Symphony Orchestra, Northeastern University, The Boston Conservatory, New
       England Conservatory of Music, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Museum of Fine
       Arts, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and Fenway Park.

1.3    History of Berklee College of Music

       With an enrollment of approximately 4,000 FTE on-campus students, Berklee College of
       Music is the world's largest independent music college and the premier institution for the
       study of contemporary music. Berklee was founded by pianist/arranger and MIT-trained
       engineer Lawrence Berk in 1945 as Schillinger House of Music. Berk changed the name to
       Berklee School of Music in 1954, and the school granted its first bachelor of music degrees
       in 1966. In 1973, Berklee obtained accreditation and changed its name to Berklee College
       of Music. In 2004, the college inaugurated Roger Brown as its third president and
       announced a new vision for its future focused on the student experience.

       Berklee was founded on two revolutionary ideas: that musicianship could be taught through
       the music of the time; and that the college's students need practical, professional skills for
       successful, sustainable music careers. While that bedrock philosophy has not changed, the
       music around Berklee has and requires that the college evolve with it.

       For more than half a century, Berklee has demonstrated its commitment to its philosophy by
       wholeheartedly embracing change. The college continually updates its curriculum and
       technology to make them more relevant, and to attract diverse students who reflect the
       multiplicity of influences in today's music. To assure that Berklee continually attracts an
       ever-widening audience, the college strives to develop new initiatives that reflect the
       contemporary music component of its curriculum.

       More than a college, Berklee has become the world's premiere learning lab for the music of
       today--and tomorrow. As a microcosm of the music world, Berklee reflects the interplay
       between music and culture in an environment where aspiring music professionals learn
       how to integrate new ideas, adapt to changing musical genres, and showcase their



2798/Berklee/IMP/PNF                            1-4                Introduction/Mission and Objectives
                                                                                Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       distinctive skills in an evolving community. The college is at the center of a widening
       network of industry professionals who use their openness, virtuosity, and versatility to take
       music in surprisingly new directions.

       1.3.1           Berklee's Role in Boston's Music Culture

       Berklee, founded on jazz and popular music rooted in the African cultural diaspora, offers a
       comprehensive curriculum that is distinctly contemporary in its content and approach
       embracing the principal musical movements of the time. As such, the college is a vital
       Boston cultural component that aids the City in its efforts to be an energetic, diverse, and
       welcoming place for its residents and businesses. More specifically, Berklee voluntarily
       provides significant community benefits, as detailed in Chapter 11, and takes an active role
       in promoting cultural arts directly, as well as through its consortium membership in the
       Fenway Cultural District.

       The Back Bay and Fenway neighborhoods have long been known as cultural foci in the City
       of Boston. Berklee embraces the continuing opportunity to promote cultural arts within the
       city and immediate neighborhoods. In conjunction with its civic mission, Berklee is
       committed to enhancing its facilities and programs in order to augment vitality and civic life
       in Boston. Berklee also seeks to further Boston's strong cultural image with its future world-
       class music instructional space, as well as new performance spaces.

       Approximately 28,000 Berklee graduates contribute significantly to the entertainment
       industry and cultural network in Boston, thereby fostering economic growth. Locally,
       Berklee communicates with approximately 6,000 Berklee graduates who reside in
       Massachusetts. While most are performers, many of them are active in the full range of the
       growing entertainment industry, as well as non-music professions.

       1.3.2           Existing Programs of Study and Degrees

       Berklee College of Music prepares students for careers as instrumentalists, writers,
       arrangers, composers, engineers, producers, and teachers, as well as for careers in music
       therapy and music business management. Berklee offers programs leading to the degree of
       Bachelor of Music or the Diploma in Professional Music. The degree program combines
       general education courses with the study of music, while the diploma program is an all-
       music program. In either program, students may select a major in the disciplines listed
       below. Degree candidates may also undertake a five-year dual major combining music
       education with one of the other single majors. Dual majors are also available in various
       combinations. Currently, approximately 85 percent of the student body is enrolled in the
       degree program, an increase from approximately 75 percent nine years ago.

       In addition to programs on campus, the college offers an extensive array of international
       programs in a variety of its areas of study. The Berklee International Network includes 15
       partner schools in 13 countries where Berklee conducts student and faculty exchanges and
       annual information sessions, auditions and interviews. Students may also participate in
       Berklee study abroad programs in Freiburg, Germany and Athens, Greece; student
       exchange programs in Nancy, France and Kobe and Nagoya, Japan; and a number of other
       programs through collaborations with other colleges and universities. Berklee's on-campus
       summer program also includes the International Musicians' English Language Institute
       (IMELI); workshops for guitar, percussion, voice, songwriting, and strings; and professional
       development opportunities for teachers already in the classroom. A significant number of
       participants from these workshops have subsequently enrolled as full-time students at
       Berklee.

1.4    Mission and Objectives

       1.4.1           Mission

       The mission of Berklee College of Music is "to educate, train, and develop students to excel
       in music as a career."



2798/Berklee/IMP/PNF                           1-6               Introduction/Mission and Objectives
                                                                              Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Developing the musicianship of all its students is the foundation of its curriculum. Berklee
       believes that the lessons and qualities derived from that work--the self-discipline needed for
       excellence, the empathy required of music making and the openness and inquisitiveness
       essential to creativity--are critical to achievement in any pursuit, musical or otherwise; and
       that music is a powerful catalyst for personal growth that is central to any collegiate
       experience.

       The comprehensive curriculum Berklee provides is distinctly contemporary in its content
       and approach, and covers the principal musical movements of our time. Through a course
       of scholarly and practical learning experiences integrating performance and writing, the
       college's curriculum covers the variety of influential styles, relevant technologies, and
       career opportunities open to today's music professional.

       1.4.2           Objectives

       Berklee has a number of objectives related to its students, its campus and its community as
       described below:

            To define and refine the individual talents of students by providing a broad range of
            major programs offered by a distinguished faculty, and to prepare them for careers
            in music that reflect the diversity of expression and opportunities that define music
            today;

            To enable students to employ their musical educations in a global society by
            providing a coherent liberal arts curriculum that informs their thinking about issues
            that have shaped the present;

            To encourage students to appreciate and apply music's enormous force for the
            enrichment of society and intercultural understanding;

            To cultivate a supportive learning environment by actively promoting a climate of
            respect for personal and cultural differences, and by offering a range of services and

1.5    Needs of the Institution

       Berklee's growth has been accommodated by purchasing nearby properties as they become
       available, and leasing properties as needed and available. However, Berklee's student body
       grew to approximately 4,000 FTE on campus without a proportional increase in available
       facilities. This has resulted in overcrowded academic and administrative spaces, as well as
       an increased student population that can not be accommodated in Berklee-owned
       dormitories. Berklee has only 800 beds of dormitory housing available on campus,
       resulting in the college being unable to accommodate all entering students in dormitory
       housing.

       Increasing the number of available dormitories on campus will improve retention rates,
       increase the quality of life for Berklee students, and strengthen collaboration and
       community building within a highly diverse student body. More on-campus housing will
       also make the college more attractive to international students and female students.
       Developing new dormitories also will diminish the Berklee students' likelihood of
       occupying privately-owned apartments in Boston neighborhoods, thereby effectively
       increasing the supply of neighborhood resident housing. College officials, neighbors, and
       the City of Boston have agreed that Berklee should strive to house approximately half of its
       students; accomplishing this will require accommodations for an additional 1,200 people.

       At the same time that enrollment has grown, technology has become an increasingly
       integral component of contemporary music and music education, creating a greater need
       and demand for state-of-the-art studios and equipment. In order to maintain its competitive
       edge as the premier undergraduate institution for contemporary music education, it is
       crucial that Berklee build additional music technology space and update its existing
       facilities. In addition, a reliance on leased property to meet the college's space needs is
       unsustainable in the long-term.

       In summary, the campus needs guiding this IMP include the following:

            Create more student housing (approximately 1,200 beds);

            Improve the campus life experience for students;

            Upgrade academic facilities and enhance technology spaces;

            Reduce overcrowding in academic and administrative spaces;

            Accommodate prior growth in student enrollment;

            Reduce reliance on leased space and consolidate departments;

            Create a unique, contemporary campus building that signifies Berklee's stature;

Revised May 10, 2011                                                          Epsilon Associates, Inc.
            Improve performance facilities to better serve today's music; and

            Improve the Berklee Performance Center.

       In furtherance of the foregoing, Berklee now proposes three projects totaling approximately
       500,000 sf of net new space (including student housing). Chapter 5 provides a description
       of these IMP Projects.

       The projects proposed in the IMP will improve the functionality of the Berklee campus,
       enrich the student experience, and enable the college to make great strides towards
       satisfying the space needs that have been expressed. The three Proposed Institutional
       Projects will also enable many students living in apartments in Boston's neighborhoods to
       occupy college-managed housing and to otherwise help enhance the environment around
       the Berklee campus.

1.6    Institutional Master Plan Summary

       The proposed IMP Projects are 168 Massachusetts Avenue, 161-171 Massachusetts Avenue,
       and the Berklee Crossroads, as shown in Figure 1-2 along with the other campus
       improvements projects and leased space described in Section 5.2.4.

1.7    Community Benefit Summary

       During the period between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010, Berklee paid $270,304 to the
       City via Payments in Lieu of Taxes, approximately $760,000 in property taxes, and also
       provided an estimated value of $2.2 million in community programs financial support. The
       President's Office of Education Outreach supports the college in its commitment to cultural,
       artistic, and educational development through partnerships, programming, scholarships,
       and public service through music. Berklee's 2010 PILOT report is included in Appendix A.

       Berklee City Music

       Berklee City Music is the college's strategic initiative to engage musically talented urban

       provide face-to-face interaction between Berklee City Music National students at member
       sites and faculty and students at Berklee's Boston campus.

1.8    Public Participation

       The Berklee College of Music Community Task Force was initiated by the City of Boston in
       September 2006 to build a mutual understanding of college and neighborhood needs with
       community stakeholders. This open process, encouraged by the BRA and supported by
       Berklee's Trustees and Administration in advance of the IMPNF filing, fostered discussions
       of campus planning initiatives that Berklee was preparing to undertake. To date, Berklee
       representatives have engaged in a process that began four years ago. The campus plans,
       shared with the Task Force, serve as a roadmap for the future of the college and the
       development strategies that comprise the road map are the subject of this IMP. As part of
       the Task Force review process, Berklee has presented and discussed future development
       plans with community leaders and stakeholders during the following Task Force meetings.
       These meetings also included a walking tour of buildings on the campus and in surrounding
       neighborhoods.

       Berklee is committed to an open, inclusive, and transparent campus planning process via
       the Task Force. The Task Force process has been a positive experience for Berklee that has
       helped the college develop a shared vision about the kind of place Berklee could become.
       With the assistance of city and state representatives in the Back Bay and Fenway area, the
       following members of the community were invited to be the Task Force:

        Susan Ashbrook                Neighborhood Association of the Back Bay
        Tim Horn                      Fenway Civic Association
        Valerie Hunt                  Area Resident ­ Boylston Street
        Gail Korn                     Area Resident ­ Newbury Street
        Meg Mainzer-Cohen             President and Executive Director, Back Bay Association
        Kelly Brilliant               Executive Director, Fenway Alliance
        Richard Pendleton             Fenway CDC
        Karla Rideout                 149 Massachusetts Avenue Co-operative resident
        Ellen Shortell                Neighborhood Association of the Back Bay
        Barbara Brooks Simons         Acting President, Symphony United Neighbors
        Randy Kreie                   Area Resident ­ St. Stephen Street, Fenway



       In addition, elected officials who have participated throughout the Task Force process
       include City Councilor Michael Ross, State Representative Byron Rushing and State
       Representative Marty Walz.

       During of the preparation of a draft of its IMPNF in 2007, Berklee proposed its Crossroads
       project, a development plan for its 130-136 Boylston Street properties located at the
       intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Boylston Street. The college had, and still has,
       few alternatives in terms of sites on which to accommodate many of its facilities needs in a
       newly constructed building. The proposal brought forward at that time envisioned a mixed-
       use development of approximately 445,000 sf, including a new 1,600 seat performance
       venue; a smaller, 400 seat venue; 100,000 sf of academic and student life space; and 600
       dormitory beds. This proposed project would have had a maximum height of 35 stories,
       and a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of approximately 20.

       Berklee discussed the proposed master plan, including the proposed Crossroads project,
       with the Task Force before its planned filing of the IMPNF in November, 2007. The Task
       Force reviewed the draft IMPNF, and a majority of the members expressed support for
       Berklee's desire to grow to meet the needs of its students, including the desire to create a
       better center for student life, the goal to house 50 percent of Berklee students in campus
       housing and the intention to create student housing in the Fenway area. The Task Force
       also expressed support for incorporating the portion of Cambria Street between
       Massachusetts Avenue and Saint Cecilia Street into the Crossroads project. The Task Force

2798/Berklee/IMP/PNF                           1-13                Introduction/Mission and Objectives
                                                                                Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       expressed concerns regarding the scale and density of the Crossroads project as proposed,
       and encouraged Berklee to continue its efforts to acquire additional property on which to
       accommodate a portion of its facilities needs, thereby enabling the college to propose a
       project having less density and less height.

       In preparation for the submission of its IMPNF to the BRA in January, 2009, Berklee revised
       its proposal to reduce the density and height of the proposed Crossroads project in response
       to the concerns expressed. The density of the proposed project was reduced from 450,000
       sf to 300,000 sf, and the height was reduced from 35 stories to 29 stories. The number of
       dormitory beds was reduced from 600 beds to 450 beds as a consequence. Therefore, at
       the time of the filing of the IMPNF, Berklee had identified projects that would have
       achieved only 38 percent of its identified goal of creating 1,200 new beds of student
       housing.

       In April, 2009, Berklee acquired 168 Massachusetts Avenue. The acquisition of the 168
       Massachusetts Avenue property has enabled Berklee to propose the construction of a new
       building on the site that, together with the proposed Crossroads project, will enable the
       college to achieve two-thirds of its student housing creation goal. As described in Section
       1.6 and Chapter 5, 168 Massachusetts Avenue will create approximately 370 new beds
       which, when combined with the approximately 450 beds now proposed in the Crossroads
       project, will enable Berklee to create approximately 820 new beds of its expressed need of
       approximately 1,200 new beds. In addition, 168 Massachusetts Avenue will include
       additional student life, ground floor retail and music technology space.

       In the past several years, Berklee has also pursued other acquisition opportunities and
       upgrades to space. These actions are described in Section 1.9.

       With the acquisition of 168 Massachusetts Avenue and feedback from the Task Force and
       BRA officials, Berklee has once again re-evaluated its proposed Crossroads development.
       Berklee now believes it can accommodate the needed program elements in a building of
       lower overall height than originally proposed.

       As further described in subsequent chapters, Berklee has strategically reduced the setbacks
       from the base of the Crossroads building, as well as reduced the amount of program space
       allocated to new student life facilities. These changes have enabled Berklee to reduce the
       height it seeks to build for this project, and to develop a massing concept in consultation
       with the BRA's urban design staff and the Task Force that is responsive to and respectful of
       its neighbors. At the same time, the revised proposal preserves the most essential program
       components.

       Berklee appreciates the time and attention devoted to Berklee's proposed master plan by
       the dedicated volunteers on the Task Force, and trusts that Task Force members will find
       that Berklee has been responsive to their expressed concerns.

1.9    Recent Acquisitions and Upgrades

       Berklee has succeeded in acquiring additional properties recently, investing approximately
       $40 million, including two sites of proposed IMP Projects (161 ­ 171 Massachusetts
       Avenue and 168 Massachusetts Avenue). The investment also includes the purchase and
       recently completed conversion of the former Fenway Community Health Center at 7
       Haviland Street into classrooms and faculty offices. The adjacent lot was also developed
       into a landscaped open space, enhancing the college's presence on the street and creating
       additional public space for use by neighborhood residents and the college community.

       In addition, Berklee recently acquired two properties on Boylston Street between
       Massachusetts Avenue and Hemenway Street. The property at 1096 Boylston Street
       features ground-floor retail, second-floor office space, and a residential apartment on the
       third floor. Berklee invested approximately $650,000 in the ground floor of the building to
       create a "vanilla box" retail space to be occupied by the current tenant, the very popular
       Pavement Coffee House. The second floor, previously used for storage, also was renovated
       and is now being used as administrative space. The property at 1108 Boylston Street is a
       commercial building, the upper floors of which are leased to two musical instrument
       retailers and The Boston Conservatory. Berklee plans to occupy and renovate this building,
       as well as portions of its building located at 155 Massachusetts Avenue, during the term of
       the IMP to accommodate certain institutional uses displaced by the Proposed Institutional
       Projects.

Existing Campus
2.0    EXISTING CAMPUS

2.1    Introduction

       This chapter presents a summary of the history of Berklee College of Music and its campus,
       a description of its existing facilities, including owned and leased properties, as well as a
       description of properties not included in the IMP.

2.2    Campus Description

       2.2.1           Campus

       Berklee has never occupied a defined and consolidated campus. It has filled its space
       needs reactively, leasing or buying as opportunities have arisen in the open market. This
       approach has fundamentally shaped the way the campus has developed. The heart of the
       campus is in the vicinity of the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Boylston Street (see
       Figure 1-1). Many campus uses are found along Massachusetts Avenue in the four blocks
       south of the intersection, and much of the remainder lies within the first few blocks of
       Boylston Street to the intersection's east and west. In aggregate, the college owns and
       leases approximately 765,000 sf of space in the Fenway and Back Bay neighborhoods, and
       owns a 20,000-sf dedicated practice/rehearsal building in Allston/Brighton for a total of
       approximately 785,000 sf. Berklee's residence halls house approximately 800 students.
       The college also operates a 250-seat dining hall and provides limited student life space.

       Highlights among the existing academic facilities include 13 professionally equipped
       recording studios, 250 workstations and hundreds of synthesizers in the Learning Center
       and the Electronic Production and Design Labs, the Professional Writing Lab, the
       Professional Education Technology Lab, and the Professional Performance Technology Lab.
       The Film Scoring Department houses five fully equipped film/videoscoring and editing labs.
       The recently completed renovation at 7 Haviland Street has also provided the college with
       dedicated space for a Writing Center, English as a Second Language instruction, Africana
       Studies, and a home for Heavy Rotation Records, a Berklee music label operated by Music
       Business majors at the college.

       The college presents more than 1,000 faculty and/or student concerts annually in three
       recital halls, plus more than 150 student and/or faculty concerts in the 1,200-seat Berklee
       Performance Center. The performance center also hosts approximately 100 high-profile
       shows produced by major concert promoters each year. Café 939, a student-run venue,
       books approximately 200 shows per year including performances by students, faculty, staff,
       alumni, local artists, and national touring acts. In addition, the Berklee cafeteria is host to
       three or four "caf shows" per week, which are performances by students that are open to
       the public.

                                                                                Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Berklee students have access to 40 ensemble rooms and more than 250 private practice
       rooms, including approximately 50 rooms in Allston/Brighton at 25 Fordham Road.

       The Genko Uchida Building at 921 Boylston Street, to date Berklee's only "purpose-built"
       facility, houses many student-service functions, classrooms, and a recital venue.
       Administrative and faculty offices (including the President's Office on the sixth floor of 1140
       Boylston Street) are accommodated where and as space has become available in the three
       clusters described above, i.e., the Boylston Street/Massachusetts Avenue intersection, along
       Massachusetts Avenue in the blocks immediately south of the intersection, and along
       Boylston Street in the blocks just east and west of the intersection.

       2.2.2           Facilities

       Berklee owns 15 buildings that are proximate to the intersection of Boylston Street and
       Massachusetts Avenue, as well as one building in Allston/Brighton. Berklee also leases
       space in a number of properties in Boston. Figure 2-1 identifies buildings that are owned
       by Berklee and buildings where Berklee leases space. These locations are described further
       below.

       2.2.2.1         Owned Facilities

       At present, Berklee College of Music owns 16 buildings consisting of approximately
       700,000 sf. Table 2-1 provides information about each building.

       Loading and Trash Facilities

       Berklee does not currently have off-street loading facilities. For deliveries to 130, 136, and
       150 Massachusetts Avenue, trucks either pull up into a designated loading zone on Saint
       Cecilia Street, or onto the southern side of Belvidere Street next to 168 Massachusetts
       Avenue. Smaller facilities are serviced by adjacent commercial loading areas or alleys.

       The largest trash storage facility at Berklee currently is located on Cambria Street behind
       130 Massachusetts Avenue, where there are dumpsters, a trash compactor, and recycling
       bins. The trash compactor is emptied one to two times per week. Smaller facilities have
       dedicated trash dumpsters located in public alleys.

       Parking

       Berklee currently provides only a small number of parking spaces for its executives in a
       variety of locations around campus. Berklee has no other dedicated parking. Other staff
       who wish to park in the neighborhood typically use commercial garages near the Prudential
       Center and Symphony Hall.

Institutional Demographics
3.0    INSTITUTIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS

3.1    Current and Future Student Population

       The Berklee student is on average older with more life experience than a typical college
       student. Current student demographics provide a foundation to create the housing program
       of the future. The average age of the Berklee student is approximately 22 years old, while
       the average age of entering college students at Berklee is approximately 20 years old (see
       Table 3-1 for a breakdown of students by age).

       Berklee College of Music is committed to creating housing facilities and a housing program
       that meets the needs of entering and continuing students. Providing student housing for all
       first-semester students is a priority for the college. Berklee aims to provide new and
       different housing options for upper-semester students allowing them to remain in college
       housing. With additional and improved facilities, the college seeks to be more proactive
       and visionary regarding student housing. Providing state-of-the-art housing and programs
       for entering students will help increase retention of the undergraduates, and will increase
       student satisfaction with the overall Berklee experience. It is also consistent with the City's
       goal of moving more students from neighborhood residences to college-controlled facilities,
       thereby addressing the need for more affordable neighborhood housing (see Chapter 6 for
       more information about Berklee's housing plan).

       Increased student housing at Berklee also will help to address traditional student behavior
       issues. While Berklee's Student Affairs departments have actively addressed any such issues
       directly, such problems at Berklee have a much lower rate of occurrence than at other
       colleges--perhaps due to the age of Berklee students and to their career focus.

                                                                                                      Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       3.1.1           Enrollment

       Student enrollment for the past five years, including fall, spring and summer semester
       registrations, is listed in Table 3-2. Full-time enrollment has increased by approximately 11
       percent, and total enrollment by approximately 10 percent over the five-year period.
       During the same five-year period, summer enrollment in the 12-week program has not
       changed significantly.

       While enrollment often varies within a range of approximately five percent from semester to
       semester due to numbers of matriculations of accepted students, the IMP does not anticipate
       any sizeable growth above that level in its undergraduate program. The college may at
       some point during the term of the IMP establish a focused graduate program for up to an
       estimated 100 to 200 students.

       Berklee enrolls students only on a full-time basis in its accredited Degree Program and its
       all-music Diploma Program. Full-time status is generally defined as taking 16 credits in the
       Degree Program and 12 credits in the Diploma Program. Due to Berklee's credit transfer
       procedures, some full-time students occasionally choose to attend on a part-time basis
       during the summer 12-week semester to achieve a dual major, to complete graduation
       requirements, or to participate in an off-campus program/internship. In any one semester,
       up to 10 percent of the total head count frequently attends on a less than full-time basis.
       While there are various ways to count these less than full-time students, generally Berklee
       has found it most appropriate to count each as one third of a full-time equivalent (FTE)
       student. Thus, in this IMP, student enrollment is stated as approximately 4,000 FTE on-
       campus undergraduate students.

       Berklee also has a five-week, non-credit Summer Performance Program that attracts college-
       age and high school music students. It provides an opportunity for potential students to
       experience the Berklee atmosphere. In 2010, 1,017 students participated in this program
       representing 60 different countries including the United States.

       Berklee is a major draw for international students. Approximately 25 percent of the student
       body originates from 79 different countries outside the United States.

3.2    Current Employee Population

       During the academic year 2009-2010, Berklee College of Music employed 554 faculty
       members and professionals who served as chairs or assistants for the college's instructional
       departments. Of the 554 faculty/chairs, 239 were full-time faculty, 315 were part-time
       faculty and 39 were chairs/assistant chairs. Berklee also employs 470 staff members and 33
       executive personnel. Additionally, Berklee employs approximately 25 contract employees.

       Approximately half of the college's courses are offered by full-time faculty. In the fall of
       2008, 80 percent of the classes had 15 or fewer students. Many Berklee faculty members
       currently are employed as music professionals in the city and region, while others are
       traditional, academically trained faculty. Currently, approximately 30 percent of Berklee
       faculty and staff members live in the City of Boston.

       The college also offers on-campus resident and visiting artist programs that bring additional
       music professionals to Berklee to offer extensive interaction between visiting professionals
       and the college's students and faculty. In recent years, Berklee has hosted clinics featuring
       such artists as Paul Simon, Linda Ronstadt, and James Taylor, among many others.

3.3    Future Employee Population

       The IMP Projects will require additional employees to manage dormitories, staff the larger
       dining hall, monitor and maintain the music technology spaces, and provide security and
       maintenance for the buildings.

       At 168 Massachusetts Avenue, the approximately 370 new beds of student housing is
       expected to require, in addition to the existing Housing staff, one full-time Resident
       Director, one full-time clerical assistant, and 12 undergraduate Resident Assistants (one per
       floor of housing). The new space will also require two additional full-time equivalents in
       maintenance staff and eight additional full-time equivalents in security personnel.

       The new dining hall at 168 Massachusetts Avenue will be larger than Berklee's existing
       cafeteria, with 400 seats instead of 250. The hours of operation are also expected to
       lengthen, providing a more convenient setup for late dining. As a result, the space is

2798/Berklee/IMP/PNF                              3-3                      Institutional Demographics
Revised May 10, 2011                                                           Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       expected to generate a need for six part-time employees, all contracted through Berklee's
       dining services provider. Depending on how heavily the space is used for performances,
       certain other adjustments in staffing may be necessary, but this scenario needs to be further
       developed to determine if any additional jobs will be created.

       At the Berklee Crossroads, the 450 new beds of student housing are expected to require, in
       addition to the existing Housing staff, two full-time Resident Directors, one full-time clerical
       assistant, and 20 undergraduate Resident Assistants (one per floor of housing). The new
       space will also require three additional full-time equivalents in maintenance staff and 11
       additional full-time equivalents in security personnel.

       No additional staffing is expected for the Proposed Institutional Project at 161-171
       Massachusetts Avenue.

       All three IMP Projects represent a total estimated increase in staffing of 35 full-time staff, 32
       student employees, and six contract employees. Employment levels are anticipated to
       remain the same throughout the rest of the campus.

Planning and Urban Design Framework
4.0    PLANNING AND URBAN DESIGN FRAMEWORK

4.1    Introduction

       Chapter 4 includes a description of the context of the area surrounding the campus, the
       planning and urban design principles, and the future development strategy.

4.2    Existing Context

       As previously described in Chapter 1, the heart of Berklee's campus is in the vicinity of the
       corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Boylston Street, between two neighborhoods within
       the City of Boston, the Fenway and the Back Bay, and a mixed-use district surrounding the
       Prudential Center. The neighborhoods reflect differences in character and demographics,
       but they remain two of Boston's most desirable neighborhoods for residents, retailers and
       companies seeking office space. Each neighborhood sustains a variety of uses and a strong
       sense of history, and each is home to many of Boston's finest cultural, entertainment and
       sports venues. Both neighborhoods are products of visionary planning; architect Arthur
       Gilman is credited with designing the filled lands of the Back Bay, and Fredrick Law
       Olmsted's Emerald Necklace created the green spine for the Fenway neighborhood.

       Berklee College of Music is located within an area rich with public resources and private
       institutions that have a public mission. Resources contributing to the public realm that are
       located within a ten-minute walk of campus include the green space at Charlesgate, the
       Back Bay Fens portion of the Emerald Necklace, the Charles River Esplanade, the
       Commonwealth Avenue Mall, the Hynes Convention Center, and the Boston Public Library.
       Private institutions with a public mission include The First Church of Christ, Scientist, the
       Boston Symphony Orchestra, Northeastern University, The Boston Conservatory, New
       England Conservatory of Music, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Museum of Fine
       Arts, Fenway Park and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. See Figure 1-1.

       4.2.1           Adjacent Land Use

       As noted above, Berklee sits at the crossroads of two great Boston neighborhoods, the
       Fenway and the Back Bay, a situation that has shaped the campus in several ways. The
       economic, cultural, social and political qualities of both neighborhoods have influenced
       campus life and character, and Berklee recognizes that, in turn, it has a significant impact
       on its neighbors. The college's location at the juncture of the two neighborhoods also
       affects and is affected by land use, real estate prices, size of properties, and the
       appropriateness of institutional use on any given parcel of land or within any given
       building.

                                                                              Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       4.2.1.1         East Fens Neighborhood

       The residents of the East Fens neighborhood are Berklee's neighbors to the south and west.
       Shops and restaurants along Boylston Street and Massachusetts Avenue serve as key
       commercial enterprises for the East Fens and the Berklee community alike. Businesses in
       the two blocks of Massachusetts Avenue immediately south of Boylston Street including
       coffee shops, fast food restaurants, and music stores count Berklee students as an especially
       high proportion of their trade. The East Fens embodies one of the youngest populations in
       Boston, reflecting a concentration of students clustered around Northeastern University, the
       New England Conservatory, The Boston Conservatory, and Berklee College of Music. The
       neighborhood also is home to world-famous cultural institutions including the Boston
       Symphony Orchestra, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.
       Berklee owns a number of facilities in the East Fens neighborhood, including 1096, 1108
       and 1140 Boylston Street, 7 Haviland Street, 98 Hemenway Street, 22 The Fenway, and the
       recently acquired 155, 161 and 171 Massachusetts Avenue. The college also leases space
       in 1080, 1090 and 1100 Boylston Street.

       The Berklee community uses Haviland Street as a pedestrian way between the college's
       buildings on Massachusetts Avenue and 1140 Boylston Street. On this pedestrian way,
       Berklee has created a new landscaped open space at its building at 7 Haviland Street,
       enhancing the college's presence on the street and creating additional public space for use
       by neighborhood residents and the college community.

       To revitalize the formerly moribund block of Boylston Street between Massachusetts
       Avenue and Hemenway Street that included several vacant storefronts, Berklee master-
       leased the ground floors of the 1080, 1090 and 1100 Boylston Street properties, and has
       been filling these storefronts with quality new retailers, including the Berklee bookstore. In
       addition, Berklee improved its 1096 Boylston Street building and leased the ground floor
       for an attractive and successful new retail use (Pavement Coffee House). Finally, Berklee, in
       partnership with the City of Boston and other property owners, effected major
       improvements to the public realm in this area, resulting in a vibrant, attractive new
       neighborhood destination (see Section 5.4).

       The Back Bay Fens, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, is the neighborhood's most
       important open space resource. It defines the western edge of the East Fens. All of
       Berklee's facilities in the neighborhood lie less than five minutes by foot from this beautiful
       park. During the summer, Berklee and the Fenway Civic Association co-sponsor a three- or
       four-part evening concert series featuring Berklee faculty and students at Mother's Rest Park
       across from 22 The Fenway. Berklee uses the park for occasional permitted events, and has
       participated with neighborhood and other city-sponsored clean-up efforts. Berklee also is
       supporting the efforts of the Fenway Civic Association and the Emerald Necklace
       Conservancy in reintroducing native plant species in Mother's Rest Park.

                                                                               Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       4.2.1.2         Back Bay

       The Back Bay is an historic neighborhood to the north and east of Berklee. This
       neighborhood's predominantly 19th-century townhouses, occasional 20th-century
       apartment buildings, carefully tended Commonwealth Avenue central mall, and high-end
       shopping area symbolize Boston for many people around the world. Within this
       neighborhood are the college's 921 Boylston Street building, its 264-270 Commonwealth
       Avenue dormitory, and several leased spaces along Boylston Street, including the recently
       completed Café 939 offering food, beverages and live music to the neighborhood and
       college communities alike.

       The college also sub-leases space from the Boston Architectural College at 100
       Massachusetts Avenue during daytime hours on weekdays in order to help accommodate its
       continuing needs for classroom space. The Back Bay stretch of Boylston Street is home to
       many Berklee academic and administrative spaces. It functions as the neighborhood's main
       commercial street, as do the commercial blocks of Massachusetts Avenue in the East Fens.
       The Back Bay's distinctive urban character is a strong asset for the college, and the college
       likewise enlivens upper Boylston Street and its environs.

       4.2.1.3         Prudential Area

       Berklee's largest facility is comprised of three interconnected buildings, 130, 136 and 150
       Massachusetts Avenue; located between Boylston and Belvidere Streets. The college also
       recently acquired 168 Massachusetts Avenue from an affiliate of The First Church of Christ,
       Scientist that is located between Belvidere and Saint Germain Streets.

       Immediate institutional neighbors to these facilities have also exerted a strong influence on
       the Berklee experience. They include:

            The Hynes Convention Center brings more than 200,000 visitors to the Back Bay
            each year. The proximity of the Hynes Convention Center to Berklee facilities
            provides the college with a venue for special events and its students, a visibility that
            few institutions enjoy. The college and the Hynes Convention Center have
            informally enjoyed a synergistic relationship with college concerts often being
            popular among conference attendees. Berklee used the Convention Center for its
            2004 inauguration of President Roger Brown and several other times for Berklee
            career festivals and commencement ceremonies. Additionally, Berklee leases the
            Convention Center annually for its High School Jazz Festival, the largest of its kind
            in the country. Berklee has enjoyed its working relationship with the Hynes
            Convention Center, and looks forward to future opportunities to collaborate.

            The Prudential Center is an early air rights project built above the Massachusetts
            Turnpike. It is nearing the end of a long transformation from a windswept,
            suburban-style mall to a welcoming retail destination, employment center and

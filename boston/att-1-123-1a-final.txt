Executive Summary
This study looks at congestion and safety issues at the Route 1/Route 123, Route 1A/Route 123 and Route 1/Route
1A intersections in Attleboro. The study is an update of a 1998 SRPEDD safety study and a 2010 MassDOT study
of the I-95/Route 1 corridor and builds on the recommendations laid out in those studies. The Route 1/Route 123
intersection experiences congestion during the afternoon peak hour as well as a significant number of crashes
related to red-light running, driveway conflicts and unprotected left-turns. The intersection exceeds acceptable
thresholds for both the Accidents/Million Entering Vehicles (Acc/MEV) crash rate and the Equivalent Property
Damage Only (EPDO) index. The Route 1A/Route 123 intersection experiences some afternoon peak hour
congestion and also has safety issues related to red-light-running and unprotected left-turns. The intersection
exceeds acceptable thresholds for both the Acc/MEV crash rate and the EPDO index. The Route 1/Route 1A
intersection does not experience congestion or significant safety problems.

The 2010 MassDOT I-95 Corridor South Study made the following recommendations for these three intersections:

    1. Eliminate the southbound left-turn lane from Route 1 onto Route 123 eastbound.
    2. Implement access management techniques including the consolidation of driveways along Route 1
       between Route 123 and Route 1A.
    3. Optimize traffic signal timings at all three intersections.

The elimination of the southbound left-turn at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection is no longer seen as a
valid recommendation by MassDOT, given the tendency for people to continue to make left-turns at locations
where they were once allowed but are now forbidden. Optimizing traffic signal timings at the Route 1A/Route
123 intersection would result in less protection time for westbound left-turning vehicles and therefore is not
recommended either.

In order to improve congestion and safety of the three intersections in the short term the state and city should
consider the following:
     · Implement access management techniques including the consolidation of driveways along Route 1
        between Route 123 and Route 1A;
     · Optimize traffic signal timings at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection and the Route 1/Route 1A
        intersection;
     · Increase the clearance times of the through phases at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection to the following
        times:
                        Table 6:
                        Through phase clearance times at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection

                                      Southbound          4            4
                                      Eastbound           3            3
                                      Westbound           3            4



                                                                                                                   i
         · Add an additional five seconds to the westbound protected left-turn phases at the Route 123/Route 1A
           intersections in order to diminish the frequency of left-turn crashes experienced there. Add an additional
           second to the all red clearance time (from 2 to 3 seconds) at the westbound approach as well.
         · Continued maintenance of pavement markings and signage along Route 123 that notifies drivers of
           proper lane use.

     In addition to these recommendations, the city and state should consult with the property owners of the Dunkin
     Donuts, Shell Gas and CVS to see if their curb-cuts can be relocated or consolidated in order to lessen the
     conflicts with vehicles entering and exiting them. In particular, it appears as though the Dunkin Donuts and the
     Shell Gas could consolidate their curb cuts into two each: one on Route 1 and one on Route 123. Further, the
     CVS could close its curb cut on Route 123, keeping one on each of Route 1 and Route 1A.

     The city and state should investigate the cost-effectiveness of widening the Route 123 corridor at the Route 1
     intersection to provide exclusive left-turn lane as a long term solution to congestion and safety problems at this
     intersection.

 Introduction
In 1998, SRPEDD performed a safety study of the Route 1 (Washington Street),
Route 123 (Highland Avenue/Newport Avenue) and Route 1A (Newport Avenue/
Route 1A Connector) intersections in Attleboro, evaluating safety improvements
that were constructed in the years prior. These improvements included a
                                                                                     This study is an update
widening of both intersections to accommodate exclusive left-turn lanes on           of the traffic volume,
Routes 1 and 1A along with a widening of Route 123 to accommodate four lanes         operation and safety data
of traffic. The study found that with the reconstruction, the safety flaws at the    collected by MassDOT
intersections were moved from the intersection itself to the driveways close by,     in 2008 for the 2010
where entering and exiting remained difficult.
                                                                                     study to verify the

1/Route 1A intersection and the Route 1/May Street intersection. This plaza          the study.
includes a Stop and Shop and several other retail and restaurant establishments.
An increase in traffic volumes up and down the Route 1 and Route 1A corridors
has resulted from this continued development.

In 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) completed
the I-95 Corridor South Transportation Study which studied congestion and
safety issues along I-95 and sections of Routes 1 and 1A from I-93 to the Rhode
Island border. The intersections of Route 1, 123 and 1A were included in this
study, and recommendations were made as follows:

    1. Eliminate the southbound left-turn lane from Route 1 onto Route 123
       eastbound, thereby relocating these turns to the Route 1/Route 1A
       intersection.
    2. Implement access management techniques including the consolidation
       of driveways along Route 1 between Route 123 and Route 1A.
    3. Optimize traffic signal timings at all three intersections.

This study is an update of the traffic volume, operation and safety data collected
by MassDOT in 2008 for the 2010 study to verify the recommendations made by
the study.


 Existing Conditions
Route 1 @ Route 123 (Washington St @ Highland Ave)- This intersection is a
four-approach intersection with four separate signal phases. Northbound and
southbound left-turns are protected and proceed simultaneously followed by
northbound and southbound thru movements and right-turns. The westbound
approach proceeds next with a leading phase over the eastbound movements

                         allowing for westbound left-turns to be protected for a period of time. The eastbound
                         and westbound approaches then proceed simultaneously allowing for thru movements,
                         left-turns and right-turns from both directions. Figure 1 illustrates the signal phases at
                         this intersection.

                         Congestion at intersections is measured using a concept called "level of service" (LOS).
                         LOS is an A to F grading system that describes the amount of congestion present at an
                         intersection based on the average delays experienced by motorists. LOS A represents
                         minimal delay while LOS E and F represent gridlocked conditions. The most congested
                         movements at this intersection during the PM peak hour are the northbound left-
                         turn and the eastbound movements which both operate at level of service (LOS)
                         F. Southbound left-turns and westbound movements both operate at LOS D, while
                         southbound thru/right-turns and northbound thru/right-turns operate at LOS C and LOS
                         B respectively. Overall, the intersection operates at LOS E during the PM peak hour, with
                         an average delay per vehicle of 68 seconds.

                         Route 123 @ Route 1A (Highland Ave @ Newport Ave)-This intersection is also a four-
                         approach intersection with four separate signal phases. Northbound and southbound
                         left-turns are protected and proceed simultaneously followed by northbound and
                         southbound thru movements and right-turns. The westbound approach proceeds next
                         with a leading phase over the eastbound movements allowing for westbound left-turns
                         to be protected for a period of time. The eastbound and westbound approaches then
                         proceed simultaneously allowing for thru movements, left-turns and right-turns from
                         both directions. Figure 2 illustrates the signal phases at this intersection.

At this intersection, the most congested movements occur during the PM peak hour.
The northbound left-turns, southbound left-turns and eastbound movements all operate
at LOS D. All other movements operate at LOS C. Overall, the intersection operates at
LOS C during the PM peak hour, with an average delay per vehicle of 31 seconds.

Route 1 @ Route 1A(Washington St @ Route 1A/South Attleboro Square)-This
intersection has four approaches with three signal phases and offers access to Route 1A
(to I-95) and the South Attleboro Square shopping center from Route 1. Northbound
left-turns into South Attleboro Square and southbound left-turns onto Route 1A proceed
simultaneously with protected northwest right-turns from Route 1A onto Route 1 north.
Northbound and southbound thru movements and right-turns then proceed, followed
by eastbound movements exiting South Attleboro Square. Figure 3 illustrates the signal
phases at this intersection.




Figure 3:
Signal phases at the Route 1/Route 1A/South Attleboro Square intersection
The most congested movements occur during the PM peak hour. The eastbound thru/
left-turn operates at LOS D. The eastbound right-turns, the entire northbound approach
and the southbound left-turns all operate at LOS C, while the northwest-bound rights
operate at LOS B and the southbound thru/right operates at LOS A. Overall, the
intersection operates at LOS B during the PM peak hour, with an average delay per
vehicle of 19 seconds. Figure 4 illustrates the three intersections in this study.

                                congestion during the afternoon peak hour. Table 1 summarizes LOS and

                                MassDOT analyzed conditions at these three intersections as a part of its 2009
                                I-95 South Corridor Transportation Study and made recommendations for
                                improvements to congestion. Their main recommendation was to eliminate the
                                southbound left-turn lane at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection and instead
                                accommodate these lefts at the Route 1/Route 1A intersection to the north.
                                The study also recommended optimizing signal timings at all three intersections
                                as well as better access management to the businesses located within the
                                triangular land parcel between all three intersections. Figure 5 illustrates these
                                improvements.

SRPEDD analyzed these recommended improvements under 2011 and 2035
PM peak hour traffic conditions. 2035 traffic volumes were generated using
SRPEDD's Regional Travel Demand Model, which uses socioeconomic projections
to generate future traffic volumes. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results for
level of service and delay per vehicle under 2011 and 2035 traffic conditions.

As is evident from the table above, the improvements will result in decreased
delays at the Route 1/Route 123 and the Route 1A/Route 123. At the Route
1/Route 1A intersection, the overall level of service and delay will remain
the same however the most congested movement, the eastbound thru/left-
turn, will improve to LOS D from LOS E under 2035 traffic conditions. Despite
the potential to improve congestion at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection,
MassDOT has expressed some concern about eliminating the southbound
left-turn lane since the study was conducted, citing issues experienced at other
intersections in the region where similar measures were undertaken. Without
the elimination of the southbound left-turn lane and therefore with optimization
of signal timings only, level of service at the intersection would still improve to a
D with an average delay of 49 seconds per vehicle under 2011 traffic conditions.
Under 2035 traffic conditions, a signal optimization only improvement would
improve level of service to an E with an average delay of 63 seconds per vehicle.


 Safety Issues and Potential Solutions
Recommendations to increase safety at these intersections were made in
SRPEDD's 1998 study and included protected left-turns from Route 123 onto
Routes 1 and 1A. Permitted/protected left-turns were introduced in 1997 in
the westbound directions on Route 123 at both intersections. Despite these
improvements, these intersections still experience some safety issues. In order
to determine these safety issues, SRPEDD collected and reviewed motor vehicle
crash reports from the Attleboro Police Department. Two crash rates were
calculated for each intersection: the Accidents per Million Entering Vehicles
(ACC/MEV) crash rate and the Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO)
crash rate. The ACC/MEV rate indicates the overall exposure to crashes at an
intersection, while The EPDO rate measures the severity of crashes at a location,
assigning additional points for crashes resulting in injuries and fatalities.

                                   Route 1 @ Route 123 (Washington St @ Highland Ave)-This intersection
                                   experienced a total of 43 crashes from 2006 through 2008. 14 were right angle
                                   crashes both at the intersection itself and at nearby driveways. Those occurring
                                   at the intersection itself can be attributed to red-light-running. A high incidence
                                   of eastbound left-turn versus westbound through crashes is also evident. This
                                   is primarily due to the lack of left-turn protection in the eastbound direction.
                                   Same direction sideswipe crashes in the eastbound direction are also prevalent
                                   and can be attributed to confusion and last minute lane changes. Figure 6
                                   illustrates crashes at this intersection.

                                   Overall the intersection has an Accidents per Million Entering Vehicles (ACC/
                                   MEV) crash rate of 1.53, significantly above the acceptable threshold of 0.77
                                   for southeastern Massachusetts. The intersection has an Equivalent Property
                                   Damage Only (EPDO) crash rate of 25.0, also above the acceptable threshold
                                   of 17.7 for crashes resulting in injury in southeastern Massachusetts. The
                                   intersection is ranked the 27th most dangerous intersection in southeastern
                                   Massachusetts.

Crashes with vehicles existing driveways close to the intersection suggest that
the driveways are interfering with the operation of the intersection. Any and
all driveways that experience crashes should be investigated further to see if
they can be relocated further away from the intersection or closed completely
without impacting the businesses. The Dunkin Donuts alone has four curb-
cuts; the Shell gas station has three; the CVS has two and the D'Angelos has two
in close proximity to the intersection. Consolidating these curb-cuts and/or
restricting left-turns out of them could help reduce crashes at the intersection.
Figure 7 illustrates all of these curb cuts.




Figure 7:
Curb-cuts located in close proximity to the intersection of Route 1 and Route 123

The prevalence of eastbound left-turn crashes at the intersection could be
alleviated if these movements had protection (green arrow) for a portion of
their green phase. Adding a lagging protected eastbound left-turn phase would
allow these vehicles to move more safely through the intersection without
having to re-stripe the eastbound and westbound approaches with exclusive left-
turn lanes. This would be similar to the left-turn protection currently in place at
the westbound approach, however it would come at the end of the eastbound/
westbound signal phase. Figure 8 illustrates this potential phasing option.

This option would improve safety and despite the additional signal time, still
improve level of service from and E to a D under 2011 traffic conditions. The
reduction in delay per vehicle to 53 seconds, however, is slightly more than
the 49 second delay per vehicle resulting from signal optimization alone.
Additionally, this would result in westbound traffic backing up to the Route
1A/Route 123 intersection. There is only 270' between the two intersections
and the 95th percentile queue length for the westbound approach under 2011
traffic conditions is approximately 317', exceeding this distance. Due to this fact,
adding an eastbound left-turn protected phase with the existing roadway layout
is not recommended.

    Figure 8:
    Signal phasing at Route 1/Route 123 intersection with eastbound left-turn protection
                         A final option in order to allow for protected eastbound left-turns would be to widen
                         Route 123 to provide an exclusive left-turn lane. This would need to be coupled with
                         a widening of the westbound approach as well and the addition of an exclusive left-
                         turn lane there as well. This would allow for protected left-turn phases at both the
                         eastbound and westbound approaches and would also decrease congestion at the
                         intersection. Figure 9 illustrates this potential signal phasing layout.




      Figure 9:
      Route 1/Route 123 Widened, Signal Phases with Eastbound and Westbound Left Turn Protection
                        This option would also improve congestion at the intersection over existing conditions.
                        With optimized signal timings, this would improve LOS from an E to a D and the delay
                        per vehicle from 68 seconds to 36 seconds. Under 2035 traffic conditions, LOS would
                        improve from an F in a no-build scenario to a D and delay per vehicle would improve
                        from 87 seconds to 40 seconds. This option would improve safety at the intersection
                        while not resulting in vehicle queues that would block the Route 1A/Route 123
                        intersection. It would, however, require land takings along Route 123 and therefore
                        could be a costly option.

                        Table 4 summarizes overall level of service and delay per vehicle for all of the potential
                        improvements to the Route 1/Route 123 intersection discussed.

In addition to left-turn conflicts the yellow and all red clearance times in the signal
system at this intersection are not adequate for the vehicle speeds traveling through it.
Currently, each approach has a four second yellow phase and a two second all red phase.
At the southbound approach there should be a four second yellow and a four second all
red phase. At the northbound approach there should be a three second yellow and a
four second all red phase. At the eastbound approach there should be a three second
yellow and a three second all red phase. Finally, at the westbound approach there
should be a three second yellow and a four second all red phase. The effect of these
changes on the operation of the intersection would be negligible.

Route 1A @ Route 123- This intersection experienced 24 crashes from 2006 through
2008. Seven of these crashes were rear-end crashes while six were right-angle crashes
that could be attributed to red-light-running. Five crashes involved left-turning vehicles
being struck by opposing through vehicles. One crash also happened on Route 123 at
the CVS driveway where a car was exiting and was struck at a right-angle. Figure 10
illustrates the crashes experienced at this intersection. Overall the intersection has an
Accidents per Million Entering Vehicles (ACC/MEV) crash rate of 0.85, slightly above
the acceptable threshold of 0.77 for southeastern Massachusetts. The intersection
has an Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO) crash rate of 18.7, exceeding the
acceptable threshold of 17.7. It is also ranked the 61st most dangerous intersection in
southeastern Massachusetts.

     The high number of right-angle crashes suggests that the intersection needs increased
     clearance time between phases and also better enforcement of red-light-running. The
     high rate of left-turn crashes also indicates that perhaps more protection time needs
     to be given to westbound left-turning vehicles. Changing signal timings at the other
     approaches to increase the westbound left-turn lead maximum by 5 seconds and
     increasing the westbound all red clearance time from 2 to 3 seconds was analyzed
     and resulted in the same overall level of service and delay per vehicle as the no-build
     analyses for both 2011 and 2035 traffic conditions. Though the MassDOT recommended
     improvements optimize signal timings and decrease delay at the intersection, they
     do not incorporate these important safety improvements and instead result in less
     protection time for westbound left-turning vehicles. Therefore, it is recommended that
     the westbound left-turn lead be increased along with the westbound all-red clearance
     time instead. Table 5 summarizes level of service and delay per vehicle for each of the
     scenarios discussed above.

     Route 1 @ Route 1A- This intersection experienced 13 crashes from 2006 through 2008.
     Seven crashes were rear-end collisions attributed to driver inattention. The remaining
     six crashes were same-direction sideswipe collisions, four of which involved vehicles on
     or turning onto Route 1A. Overall the intersection has an Accidents per Million Entering
     Vehicles (ACC/MEV) crash rate of 0.38, well below the unacceptable threshold of 0.77 for
     southeastern Massachusetts. The intersection has an Equivalent Property Damage Only
     (EPDO) crash rate of 4.0, also well below the unacceptable threshold of 17.7. These
     crash rates suggest that this intersection does not have any significant crash problems or
     safety flaws. Figure 11 illustrates crashes at this intersection from 2006 through 2008.

The MassDOT recommendation to optimize signal timings at this location would
have little to no effect on level of service or delay at the intersection during the
peak hour (see tables two and three for details) but nonetheless should be
investigated anyway to ensure maximum efficiency.


 Conclusions and Recommendations
The recommendations for the Route 1/Route 123, Route 1A/Route 123 and the
Route 1/Route 1A intersections from the 2010 MassDOT study were as follows:

    ·   Eliminate the southbound left-turn lane from Route 1 onto Route 123
        eastbound.
    ·   Implement access management techniques including the consolidation
        of driveways along Route 1 between Route 123 and Route 1A.
    ·   Optimize traffic signal timings at all three intersections.

The elimination of the southbound left-turn at the Route 1/Route 123
intersection is no longer seen as a valid recommendation by MassDOT, given
the tendency for people to continue to make left-turns at locations where they
were once allowed but are now forbidden. Optimizing traffic signal timings at
the Route 1A/Route 123 intersection would result in less protection time for
westbound left-turning vehicles and therefore is not recommended either.
In order to improve congestion and safety of the three intersections in the short
term the state and city should consider the following:

    ·   Implement access management techniques including the consolidation
        of driveways along Route 1 between Route 123 and Route 1A;
    ·   Optimize traffic signal timings at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection and
        the Route 1/Route 1A intersection;
    ·   Increase the clearance times of the through phases at the Route 1/Route
        123 intersection to the following times:
         Table 6:
         Through phase clearance times at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection

          Approach                        Yellow               All Red
          Northbound                        3                     4
          Southbound                        4                     4
          Eastbound                         3                     3
          Westbound                         3                     4


     · Add an additional five seconds to the westbound protected left-turn
       phases at the Route 123/Route 1A intersections in order to diminish
       the frequency of left-turn crashes experienced there. Add an additional
       second to the all red clearance time (from 2 to 3 seconds) at the
       westbound approach as well.
     · Continued maintenance of pavement markings and signage along Route
       123 that notifies drivers of proper lane use.

In addition to these recommendations, the city and state should consult with
the property owners of the Dunkin Donuts, Shell Gas and CVS to see if their
curb-cuts can be relocated or consolidated in order to lessen the conflicts with
vehicles entering and exiting them. In particular, it appears as though the
Dunkin Donuts and the Shell Gas could consolidate their curb cuts into two each:

Attleboro Route 1 - Route 1A - Route 123 Intersection Study                            11
     one on Route 1 and one on Route 123. Further, the CVS could close its curb cut
     on Route 123, keeping one on each of Route 1 and Route 1A.

     The widening of Route 123 to include exclusive left-turn lanes at the Route
     1 intersection should be investigated further as a long term solution to
     the congestion and safety problems that plague the intersection. This
     recommendation would require land takings and therefore could be costly.


     Implementation Plan
     MassDOT owns all three of these intersections and therefore would be the
     primary proponent of any improvements made to them. The recommended
     improvements from this study could be categorized as short-term or long-term
     and implemented as such. Short-term improvements would include the signal
     timing changes at all three intersections and the consolidation of driveways
     in and around the Route 1/Route 123 intersection. The major long-term
     improvement would be a widening of Route 123 to include exclusive left-turn
     lanes and signal phases at the eastbound and westbound approaches to the
     Route 1/Route 123 intersection.

     The signal timing changes and driveway closures at the Route 1/Route 123
     and Route 1A/Route 123 intersections would be eligible for Highway Safety
     Improvement Program (HSIP) funding from the Transportation Improvement
     Program (TIP) since they would help correct crashes at those locations. These
     improvements could also be done without the use of TIP funds, however, if
     MassDOT were to use their own maintenance funds. The optimization of
     signal timings at the Route 1/Route 123 intersection and the Route 1/Route
     1A intersection could be done at minimal cost by MassDOT. The widening of
     Route 123 would likely require land takings that would be the responsibility of
     the city, however design and construction could be funded through HSIP or the
     Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) program on the TIP. The city should
     consult with MassDOT District 5 as well as MassDOT's Office of Transportation
     Planning in Boston to move this project forward.

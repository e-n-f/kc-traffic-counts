INTRODUCTION

This memorandum summarizes safety and operations analyses and proposes
improvement strategies for the intersections of Neponset Valley Parkway at Brush
Hill Road and Neponset Valley Parkway at Milton Street in Milton. It contains the
following sections:

        Intersection Layout and Traffic Control
        Issues and Concerns
        Crash Data Analysis
        Intersection Capacity Analysis
        Preliminary Analysis of Traffic Signal Warrants
        Analysis of Traffic Signal Alternative
        Review of Roundabout Alternative
        Improvement Recommendations and Discussion

The memorandum also includes a collection of technical appendices that contain
methods and data applied in the study and detailed reports of the intersection
capacity analyses.

INTERSECTION LAYOUT AND TRAFFIC CONTROL

The two intersections, shown in Figure 1, are owned by the Department of
Conservation and Recreation. They are located in the western portion of Milton,
near the Hyde Park section of Boston. Neponset Valley Parkway, the major street
of the two intersections, is a two-lane roadway running in the northwest-southeast
direction between Blue Hill Avenue (Route 138) and Truman Parkway; it is
categorized as an urban principal arterial. Brush Hill Road in Milton is a town-
owned roadway, classified as an urban collector. It runs north-south in direction,
north from Blue Hill Avenue (Route 138) south of the intersections, continuing

 past Milton Street, to Truman Parkway. Milton Street is an east-west street that also runs from
Blue Hill Avenue, east of the intersections, to Neponset Valley Parkway. It is also town-owned
and is an urban collector.

Figure 1 shows the intersection layouts and the area nearby. Traffic operation at the Brush Hill
Road and Neponset Valley Parkway intersection is under stop-control, with a stop sign located on
the Brush Hill Road approach. Both of the Neponset Valley Parkway approaches are
uncontrolled. All of the approaches are one lane that is shared by all movements. The traffic
operations at the Neponset Valley Parkway and Milton Street intersection is under yield control,
with a yield sign located on the northbound Neponset Valley Parkway approach.

The land use in the vicinity of the intersections is mainly residential and public open space.
Milton Health care, a nursing home and rehabilitation hospital, is located on Brush Hill Road,
south of the Neponset Valley Parkway intersection.

The two intersections are located within about 400 feet of each other. Both intersections are
skewed, and a sharp roadway curve is located between them. This limits the sight distance
between the intersections and sometimes causes driver confusion.

There are currently no paved sidewalks along either Brush Hill Road or Neponset Valley
Parkway. However, there is a pedestrian path located adjacent to Neponset Valley Parkway on the
eastern side of the roadway. This pathway leads to the parking area located adjacent to the Brush
Hill Road intersection. In addition to the path along Neponset Valley Parkway, there are
numerous recreational trails in the area. The parking area is provided to allow access to these
trails.

ISSUES AND CONCERNS

Staff met with Milton officials to discuss their concerns about the intersections. Their main
concern was the lack of safety at the Brush Hill Road intersection. Numerous crashes have
occurred at both intersections, with a majority occurring at the Brush Hill Road intersection.
Another concern is the problem of a number of large trucks encroaching into the opposite lane
(oncoming traffic) at this intersection. A review of the recent crash data indicates that the Brush
Hill Road intersection has a high number of crashes and a crash rate higher than the average for
unsignalized intersections in MassDOT Highway Division District 6 (see the next section for
further analyses).

The issues and concerns for this intersection can be summarized as follows:

       Skewed approaches of the intersections
       High number of crashes and high crash rate
       Truck traffic encroaching into the lane of oncoming traffic

CRASH DATA ANALYSIS

Staff collected crash data for the most recent three years available from the MassDOT Registry of
Motor Vehicles Division, from 2006 to 2008. Some additional crash reports were available for
both intersections. The crash report data were used to develop a crash diagram for both
intersections. This crash diagram is shown in Figure 2, and shows that there is a significant
number of angle crashes at the Brush Hill Road intersection.

Table 1 show that on average eight crashes occurred at the Brush Hill Road intersection each
year. In total, about 30 percent of the crashes resulted in personal injuries and the rest were
property damage only. The collision types consist predominantly of angle collisions and single-
vehicle collisions. There were no crashes that involved pedestrians or cyclists in that period.

were no predominant collision types. There were no crashes involving pedestrians or cyclists
during that period.

Crash rate is another effective tool for examining the relative safety of a particular
location.1Based on the 2006­2008 crash data and the recently collected traffic volume data, the
crash rate for the Brush Hill Road intersection is calculated as 1.84, and for the Milton Street
intersection the crash rate is 0.36 (see Appendix B for MassDOT intersection crash rate
worksheets). The crash rate at the Brush Hill Road intersection is over three times higher than the
average rate for the unsignalized intersections in MassDOT Highway Division District 6, which is
estimated to be 0.57 crashes per million entering vehicles.2




1
    Crash rates are estimated based on crash frequency (crashes per year) and vehicle exposure (traffic volumes or
    miles traveled). Crash rates are expressed as "crashes per million entering vehicles" for intersection locations and
    as "crashes per million miles traveled" for roadway segments.
2
    The average crash rates estimated by the MassDOT Highway Division (as of July 7, 2011) are based upon a
    database that contains intersection crash rates submitted to MassDOT as part of the review process for an
    Environmental Impact Report or Functional Design Report. The most recent average crash rates, which are updated
    on a nearly annual basis, are based on all entries in the database, not just those entries made within the past year.

INTERSECTION CAPACITY ANALYSIS

MPO staff collected turning-movement counts at the intersection on June 7, 2011. The data were
recorded in 15-minute intervals for the peak traffic periods in the morning, from 7:00 to 9:00 AM,
and in the evening, from 4:00 to 6:00 PM. The Brush Hill Road intersection had peak hours,
which occurred between 7:00 and 8:00 AM and between 5:00 and 6:00 PM. There was observed
pedestrian activity during both peak hours at this intersection--7 pedestrians and 16 pedestrians
were observed during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The Milton Street intersection
had peak hours between 7:30 and 8:30 AM and between 5:00 and 6:00 PM. There were 31 and
11 pedestrians observed during the AM and PM peak hours, respectively. The peak hour traffic
volumes are shown in Figure 3.

Based on the turning-movement counts and the signal timings measured on the site, the
intersection capacity was analyzed by using an intersection capacity analysis program, Synchro.3
The intersections were both modeled as unsignalized intersections, with stop control at the Brush
Hill Road intersection and yield control at the Milton Street intersection. Tables 3 and 4 shows the
AM and PM peak hour analyses, respectively, for the existing conditions and the two alternatives
provided.

    ALTERNATIVES

    To address the concerns about safety, two alternatives were developed to improve safety as well
    as traffic operations at both intersections. The two alternatives, described below, share common
    features.

    Alternative 1: Realignment of the Brush Hill Road and Milton Street Intersections

    Alternative 1 contains modifications to both the Brush Hill Road and Milton Street intersections,
    as shown in Figure 4. The intersection of Brush Hill Road and Neponset Valley Parkway is
    realigned to a traditional "T" intersection. The intersection is moved approximately 150 feet south
    of its current location. A Neponset Valley Parkway southbound right-turn lane is added to
    accommodate the right turns onto Brush Hill Road. A stop sign is provided on the realigned
    eastbound Brush Hill Road approach. Access to the existing parking area for the recreational trails
    is now provided via a new driveway, which uses the abandoned Brush Hill Road segment. This
    eliminates the problem of vehicles turning into the parking area from the roadway curve. The
    addition of crosswalks across Neponset Valley Parkway and Brush Hill Road are included in this
    alternative.

    The intersection at Neponset Valley Parkway and Milton Street is also realigned to provide for
    increased sight distance for entering Milton Street drivers. A left-turn lane is provided for the
    Neponset Valley Parkway left-turns onto Milton Street. The intersection is stop-sign controlled,
    with the stop sign being placed onto the Milton Street approach. This creates improved traffic
    flow through the intersection based on existing traffic volumes. The existing segment of Brush

Hill Road between Neponset Valley Parkway and Milton Street is one-way northbound. An
estimate of the construction cost is approximately $1,000,000 to $1,250,000.

Alternative 2: Roundabout at Milton Street and Realignment of Brush Hill Road

Alternative 2, the roundabout alternative, is shown in Figure 5. While the Brush Hill Road
intersection is the same as in Alternative 1, this alternative provides a roundabout at the Milton
Street intersection in place of the existing "T" intersection. This is a single-lane roundabout that
would fit into the existing area between Neponset Valley Parkway, Milton Street, and Brush Hill
Road. As shown, it has an inscribed circle with a diameter of 130 feet, and is designed to
accommodate large trucks. An estimate of the construction cost for this alternative is
approximately $1,000,000 to $1,500,000.

Conceptual Plan for Neponset Valley Parkway at Brush Hill Road

The Town of Milton provided a conceptual plan for this intersection (see Appendix E). The
conceptual plan of the intersection includes constructing a large delta island separating the
approach and departure lanes of Brush Hill Road, and maintaining the southbound movement of
Neponset Valley Parkway to Brush Hill Road on the existing roadway. This plan would either
eliminate the northbound Neponset Valley Parkway left turns to Brush Hill Road or maintain the
left turns onto Brush Hill Road at the existing problem location, on a sharp curve. In addition, the
Brush Hill Road northbound left turn onto Neponset Valley Parkway would still be located near
its current location, on a curve, which could limit sight distance for both southbound Neponset
Valley Parkway traffic and Brush Hill Road left-turning vehicles.

IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

The above safety and operations analyses indicate that either of the two alternatives would
improve the safety operations, as well as the traffic operations, at both intersections. Both of the
alternatives are longer-term projects. However, in either alternative, the Brush Hill Road and
Milton Street intersections could be designed and constructed separately. Completing either
alternative or intersection does not preclude the eventual construction of the other.

Due to the existing geometry at the Brush Hill Road intersection, there are no short-term
improvements that can be recommended. At the Milton Street intersection, consideration should
be given to removing the existing yield sign on Neponset Valley Parkway northbound and placing
a stop sign on the Milton Street approach. Based on the traffic volumes, traffic flow through the
intersection would be improved. In addition to the signing changes, Neponset Valley Parkway
southbound at the Milton Street intersection should be restriped to two-lanes: one exclusive left-
turn lane and one through lane. The estimated cost is approximately $5,000.

MassDOT Project Implementation Process
                             MassDOT Project Implementation Process

The following description of the implementation process is based on Chapter 2 of the MassDOT
Highway Division's Project Development and Design Guide (2005). The text below borrows heavily
from that document.

1   NEEDS IDENTIFICATION

    For each of the locations at which an improvement is to be implemented, the MassDOT Highway
    Division leads an effort to define the problem, establishes project goals and objectives, and defines
    the scope of the planning needed for implementation. To that end, it has to complete a Project Need
    Form (PNF), which states in general terms the deficiencies or needs related to the transportation
    facility or location. The PNF documents the problems and explains why corrective action is
    needed. For this study, the information defining the need for the project will be drawn primarily,
    perhaps exclusively, from the present report. Also, at this point in the process, the MassDOT
    Highway Division meets with potential participants, such as the Boston Region Metropolitan
    Planning Organization (MPO) and community members, to allow for an informal review of the
    project.

    The PNF is reviewed by the MassDOT Highway Division district office whose jurisdiction
    includes the location of the proposed project. The MassDOT Highway Division also sends the PNF
    to the MPO, for informational purposes. The outcome of this step determines whether the project
    requires further planning, whether it is already well supported by prior planning studies, and,
    therefore, whether it is ready to move forward into the design phase, or whether it should be
    dismissed from further consideration.

2   PLANNING

    This phase will likely not be required for the implementation of the improvements proposed in this
    planning study, as this planning report should constitute the outcome of this step. However, in
    general, the purpose of this implementation step is for the project proponent to identify issues,
    impacts, and approvals that may need to be obtained, so that the subsequent design and permitting
    processes are understood.

    The level of planning needed will vary widely, based on the complexity of the project. Typical
    tasks include: define the existing context, confirm project need, establish goals and objectives,
    initiate public outreach, define the project, collect data, develop and analyze alternatives, make
    recommendations, and provide documentation. Likely outcomes include consensus on the project
    definition to enable it to move forward into environmental documentation (if needed) and design,
    or a recommendation to delay the project or dismiss it from further consideration.

3   PROJECT INITIATION

    At this point in the process, the proponent, the MassDOT Highway Division, fills out, for each
    improvement, a Project Initiation Form (PIF), which is reviewed by its Project Review Committee
    (PRC) and the MPO. The PRC is composed of the Chief Engineer, each District Highway Director,
    and representatives of the Project Management, Environmental, Planning, Right-of-Way, Traffic,
    and Bridge departments, and the Capital Expenditure Program Office (CEPO). The PIF documents
    the project type and description, summarizes the project planning process, identifies likely funding
    and project management responsibility, and defines a plan for interagency and public participation.
    First the PRC reviews and evaluates the proposed project based on MassDOT's statewide priorities
    and criteria. If the result is positive, the MassDOT Highway Division moves the project forward to
    the design phase, and to programming review by the MPO. The PRC may provide a Project
    Management Plan to define roles and responsibilities for subsequent steps. The MPO review
    includes project evaluation based on the MPO's regional priorities and criteria. The MPO may
    assign a project evaluation criteria score, a Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) year, a
    tentative project category, and a tentative funding category.

4   ENVIRONMENTAL, DESIGN, AND RIGHT-OF-WAY PROCESS

    This step has four distinct but closely integrated elements: public outreach, environmental
    documentation and permitting (if required), design, and right-of-way acquisition (if required). The
    outcome of this step is a fully designed and permitted project ready for construction. However, a
    project does not have to be fully designed in order for the MPO to program it in the TIP.

5   PROGRAMMING

    Programming, which typically begins during the design phase, can actually occur at any time
    during the process, from planning to design. In this step, which is distinct from project initiation,
    where the MPO receives preliminary information on the proposed project, the proponent requests
    that the MPO place the project in the region's TIP. The MPO considers the project in terms of
    regional needs, evaluation criteria, and compliance with the Long-Range Transportation Plan and
    decides whether to place it in the draft TIP for public review and then in the final TIP.

6   PROCUREMENT

    Following project design and programming, the MassDOT Highway Division publishes a request
    for proposals. It then reviews the bids and awards the contract to the qualified bidder with the
    lowest bid.

7   CONSTRUCTION

    After a construction contract is awarded, the MassDOT Highway Division and the contractor
    develop a public participation plan and a management plan for the construction process.


8   PROJECT ASSESSMENT

    The purpose of this step is to receive constituents' comments on the project development process
    and the project's design elements. The MassDOT Highway Division can apply what is learned in
    this process to future projects.

1.0      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.1      Introduction

This Expanded Project Notification Form ("PNF") is being submitted by H Street Partners, LLC (the
"Project Proponent") in accordance with the Article 80 Large Project Review requirements of the Boston
Zoning Code. The proposal is for a multi-family residential development with 135 residential units and a
small 1,600 square foot retail space with associated garage parking for 206 spaces to serve these uses (the
"Proposed Project").

The Project Site sits on approximately 66,313 square feet of land (one parcel) at 2 H Street in the South
Boston neighborhood of Boston. The Project Site is located within 1.0 mile of the Broadway and Andrew
MBTA Stations and within 1/2 mile to the center of the Boston Harbor beaches. For purposes of this
proposal, the Project Site will be referred to as 2 H Street.

The Proponent will commence "Large Project Review" under Article 80 of the Code with the simultaneous
filing of a Letter of Intent to file an Expanded Project Notification Form and the Expanded PNF. The
Proponent has outreached to City agencies, neighborhood representatives and groups, elected officials, and
other interested parties over the past several months with respect to the Project. The principals of H Street
Partners LLC have attended and participated in the East & West Street Planning and Zoning over the last
24 months and look forward to continuing their collaboration throughout the Article 80 review process.


1.2      Proposed Project

         1.2.1    Project Site Description and Context

         The Project Site is located in the South Boston neighborhood of Boston along 1st and 2nd Street
         with close proximity to the Seaport District. As referenced above, the Project Site is bordered by
         East 1st Street (North), Vicksburg Street (East), East 2nd Street (South), and H Street (West). The
         parcel is 66,313 square feet of land and is currently owned by Two H Street Corporation. The
         project Site has approximately 265 feet of frontage on East 1st and East 2nd Street and
         approximately 250 feet of frontage on Vicksburg and H Streets.

         The parcel currently contains an undistinguished two-story masonry structure (approximately
         23,700 square feet) along the west part of the property and a paved parking area along the
         Vicksburg Street part of the parcel. The existing building appears to have no architectural
         significance.

         Directly across East 1st Street from the Project Site are commercial warehouse buildings and
         associated parking lots leased by Casey & Hayes Movers, and Robert N. Karpp Building
         Materials. The block across Vicksburg Street has a number of empty residential lots facing
         Vicksburg, and four to four and one-half story high residential row houses facing East 2nd Street.
         To the West of the parcel along H Street is the 6-story Distillery building housing a number of
         galleries, artist studios, and studio apartments. Facing the East 2nd Street side of the Project Site
         are 6 lots; 3 eastern lots have residential row houses three and one half stories high, and the 3
         western lots have vacant and boarded up 2-story high properties. Several of these structures have
         wood clapboard exteriors and several have brick and masonry exteriors.

         1.2.2    Surrounding Area

         The Project Site is located 2 blocks north of the East Broadway retail corridor, 5 blocks from
         Telegraph Hill (Thomas Park) and Christopher Lee playground, within ½ mile of Carson Beach,
         and within one mile of the West Broadway and Andrew MBTA stations. The Project Site is
         located in the South Boston Neighborhood of the City of Boston within the First Street
         Neighborhood Development Area (NDA).

2 H Street Residential Project                              1                               Expanded PNF
         The MBTA Routes 9 and 10 bus stop is located on West Broadway approximately 700 feet south
         of the Site; the MBTA Route 7 bus-stop is located on L Street/Summer Street approximately 1,000
         feet east of the Site; and 2 subway rail stops are located less than a 1 mile to the west and
         southwest of the Site.

         The subway line provides frequent service to South Station (2-minute ride; a regular T-pass is
         accepted), to Park Street, to Downtown Crossing through Cambridge to Alewife, or in the other
         direction thru South Boston and Quincy to Braintree.

         The immediate area is a dense urban neighborhood with gaps in the typical fabric due to various
         degrees of demolition over the years. The existing residential buildings on East Second Street are
         2 to 4-1/2 story multi-family buildings, some of which are accented with bays. The context is
         denser to the south and east of the Site and less dense north and east of the site due to large areas
         of 1 to 2-story industrial warehouses and surface parking. Other amenities in the neighborhood
         include:

             ·    Joe Moakley Park, a large neighborhood park 0.6 miles southwest of the Project Site;
             ·    Castle Island Park, a neighborhood park 0.7 miles east of the Project Site;
             ·    Medal of Honor Park, a neighborhood park 0.25 miles east of the Project Site;
             ·    Thomas Park, 0.2 miles southeast of the Project Site;
             ·    Institute of Contemporary Art and Bank of America Pavilion less than 1 mile from the
                  Project Site;
             ·    The Boston Convention and Exhibition Center;
             ·    The Distillery Gallery and Lamontagne Gallery;
             ·    South Boston Public Library;
             ·    Various churches and schools and;
             ·    The East Broadway commercial district with its many stores, restaurants and other
                  services including banks, a super market, clothing stores, theater, pharmacy, health
                  center, insurance agency, travel agency, real estate office, beauty salons and barbershops.

         The immediate site context along East Second Street has seen moderate level new development in
         the last several years. This overall project offers enormous potential for a transit-oriented
         development that can take a major step in weaving back together a more sustainable and
         invigorated neighborhood.

         1.2.3    Project Description

         The Proposed Project calls for the development of 135 residential units and garage parking for 206
         spaces within the building. Six foot setbacks will be provided at East 2nd and H Streets, and a
         continuous ten foot setback along the north end of the site extending the length of East 1st Street.
         Open space for the building residents has been provided in the form of an interior courtyard,
         balconies, and terraces. A south-facing garden will also be provided.

         The existing 2-story warehouse building will be demolished to make space for the new three story
         building, and the site will be subject to any necessary remediation.

         The parking garage, level with East 1st Street and facing the industrial side of the neighborhood,
         will be entered from East 1st Street and will accommodate approximately 206 parking spaces and a
         trash/loading zone. There is also a 1,600 square foot retail component at the corner of East 1st
         Street and Vicksburg Street. In addition, a bike storage area and associated mechanical and
         storage spaces will be provided at the garage level.

         A three-story structure will be built on top of the garage with its entrance and primary access from
         East 2nd Street. The A-shaped building will follow the setbacks of the property on the north, east

         and west streets, and create a courtyard/open air atrium in the middle of the property to bring light
         and air into the interior apartments. Along East 2nd Street, a semi-private garden will be provided
         mid-block of East 2nd Street to break the massing of the building's face to the community.

         The building will be equipped with 3 elevators, a two-elevator bank at the lobby entrance from
         East 2nd Street, and a service elevator directly accessible from the East 1st Street for loading, trash,
         and tenant moving. All elevators will be accessible from the parking garage with no more than
         one required for roof deck access. The building will be equipped with addressable fire alarm and
         full sprinkler systems.

1.3      Summary of Project Impacts and Mitigation

         1.3.1    Wind Impacts

         The Project is not expected to have any adverse wind impacts on adjacent buildings or open space
         areas since the proposed building heights are consistent with the buildings within the
         neighborhood. A wind analysis therefore for the proposed Project was not conducted. The
         Proposed Project's Street Elevations are depicted clearly in Figures 3-11 and 3-12.

         1.3.2    Air Quality Impacts

         Given the proposed Project's small scale, no adverse air quality impacts are expected. The
         proximity of the overall Project Site to public transportation and within 1 ½ mile of the Financial
         District further decreases the number of vehicle trips added to the nearby intersections. As
         discussed in Section 5.0 Transportation Component, existing bus and MBTA Commuter Rail line
         capacities are more than sufficient to handle the number of trips expected to be generated by the
         proposed Project.

         1.3.3    Noise Analysis

         The Proposed Project will not have a large-scale noise producing HVAC or other potential noise
         producing equipment. Each unit will be served by high-efficiency HVAC equipment that will fully
         comply with sound level limits set by the DEP Noise Policy and the City of Boston Noise
         Regulations at all times of the day.

         1.3.4    Shadow Impacts

         A shadow impact analysis was conducted to investigate shadow impacts from the proposed
         Project. The study tracked the sun and resulting shadow during three time periods (9:00 am, 12:00
         noon and 5:00 pm) during the vernal equinox (March 21st), summer solstice (June 21st), autumnal
         equinox (September 21st), and three time periods (9:00 am, 12:00 noon and 3:00 pm) during the
         winter solstice (December 21st).

         The shadow analysis presents new shadows from the Project, as well as shadows of the existing
         neighborhood, and illustrates the impact of the Project (see Figures 1-2 to 1-13). The analysis
         primarily focuses on the impact to the surrounding streets as no existing public spaces or major
         pedestrian areas exist adjacent to and in the vicinity of the site. New shadows from the proposed
         Project are generally limited to the streets and sidewalks surrounding the Project site. No new
         shadow is anticipated to be cast on East 2nd Street (south of the Proposed Building) except during
         June after 5:00 pm. Minimal shadow impact from the Project will fall on the fronts of neighboring
         residential buildings.

         During the vernal and autumnal equinox (March 21st and September 21st) net new shadow will
         partially extend into H Street to the East at 9:00 am. At noon, the shadows will extend onto East
         1st Street and a portion of the proposed building's internal courtyard. At 5:00 pm in the afternoon,
         new shadow will extend across Vicksburg Street to the east. No new shadow will be cast on
         existing open spaces in the vicinity of the Project site.

         In June, during the summer solstice, the building's new morning (9:00 am) shadows will partially
         fall across H Street. At noon, when the sun is at its peak, shadows will be contained within a few
         feet of the project site. By 5:00 pm, new shadows will reach across Vicksburg Street as well as
         into the project's internal courtyard.

         During winter solstice (December 21st) the sun angle is at its lowest and the days are at their
         shortest. Daylight is least, and shadows are at their longest. At 9:00 am, the new shadows will
         cross East 1st Street and impact mostly the parking lots across the street. At noon, new shadows

         will be minimal at the three residential sides of the site (H, Vicksburg and East 2nd Streets) and
         again cast partial shadows at the north parking lots. At 3:00 pm, new shadows will elongate across
         East 2nd Street. No new shadow will be cast on existing open spaces in the vicinity of the Project
         site.

         Typically, each morning the building shadow will fall over H Street and its sidewalks. At noon,
         the shadow falls across East 1St Street. As the day progresses, the shadow will cross Vicksburg
         Street.

         1.3.5    Daylight Analysis

         Daylight obstruction is expected to be limited because the Proposed Project is similar in height to
         the buildings along East Second Street, and Vicksburg Street. Therefore, daylight obstruction will
         be consistent with the area context and the Proposed Project should not have a significant impact
         on daylight in the area

         1.3.6    Stormwater Management and Water Quality Analysis

         The Proposed Project will not affect the water quality in the area. A Stormwater Management
         Plan (also see Section 6.4 Storm Drainage System) will be incorporated in compliance with the
         Department of Environmental Protection's Stormwater's Management Standards prior to being
         discharged on-site or into the Boston Water and Sewer Commission system. The Proposed Project
         will also meet or exceed standards as they relate to erosion control, discharge to sensitive areas,
         and operation and maintenance, to assure a proper functioning system during and post-
         construction.

         1.3.7    Geotechnical and Groundwater Impacts

         The Project's environmental and geotechnical consultant, Wadleigh & Associates and
         Geotechnical Consultants, Inc., has been selected as the environmental and geotechnical
         consultant for the 2 H Street project. A site specific boring program and accompanying
         environmental/geotechnical report has been completed prior to this filing, and an overview of the
         overall Project Site has been included in this document. Background information regarding the
         geotechnical characteristics of the Project Site is included in Section 4.2. No negative impact to
         groundwater is anticipated during construction of the Proposed Project.

         1.3.8    Solid and Hazardous Materials

         Section 4.3 contains information on the solid and hazardous materials located on-site.
         Environmental investigations/assessments conducted at the Project Site and submitted to the
         Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) include the following:

             ·    "Limited Subsurface Investigation Report" dated October 22, 2010 by Wadleigh &
                  Associates of Boston, MA.
             ·    "A Letter Summary" dated October 29, 2010 by Green Environmental of Quincy, MA.
             ·    "MCP ­ Limited Removal Action Report" dated March 2011 by Green Environmental of
                  Quincy, MA.

         Subsurface contamination was detected in the soils at the Project Site by Wadleigh & Associates
         in October 2010. Laboratory analyses indicated concentrations of lead, extractable petroleum
         hydrocarbons (EPH), and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were present in the Site
         soils that exceeded the applicable MADEP Reportable Concentrations for soil. During field
         activities, Wadleigh & Associates noted the presence of ash in three of the soil borings advanced
         on the property. In accordance with section 310 CMR 40.317 (9), of the Massachusetts
         Contingency Plan (MCP), oil or hazardous materials associated with the presence of coal, coal
         ash, or wood ash may be exempt from reporting under the MCP, and considered "Background".

         In an effort to establish a correlation between the presence of lead and the presence of coal, coal
         ash or wood ash in the soil, Green Environmental (GREEN) had two of the soil samples be
         examined by Polarized Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy
         Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). On October 14, 2010, soil samples DB-101, S-3, 10-
         12' & B-108, S-3, 8-12' were delivered to GREEN by Contest Laboratory. On October 15,
         GREEN submitted these samples under chain of custody to Microvision Laboratories, Inc. for
         SEM/EDS examination. The presence of tar was identified in sample DB-101, S-3, 10-12'. The


2 H Street Residential Project                            19                              Expanded PNF
         presence of coal and coal ash was identified in sample B-108, S-3, 8-12'. Based upon this
         information, GREEN believes that the presence of lead (400 mg/kg) identified in boring B-108
         can be attributed to the presence of coal and/or coal ash and is exempt from the reporting
         requirements of the MCP. It was GREEN's opinion that no further action is warranted for the B-
         108 location. The presence of coal and/or coal ash was not confirmed at boring DB-101; however
         the presence of tar may be the source of C11-C22 Aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic
         hydrocarbons (PAHs) previously identified by Wadleigh & Associates to exceed their applicable
         MCP RCS-1 Reportable Concentration. To address the petroleum and lead issues at DB-101,
         GREEN recommended completing a Limited Removal Action (LRA) in this area.

         On November 23, 2010, GREEN oversaw the excavation of approximately 20 cubic yards of soil
         on the eastern portion of the site building at the location of former boring/monitoring well DB-
         101. During excavation activities GREEN observed an urban fill layer located at a depth of
         approximately 1.2 to 14 feet below ground surface (bgs). The presence of ash, glass, and brick was
         noted in this layer. Confirmatory soil samples were collected following excavation activities and
         submitted under chain of custody to Contest Analytical Laboratory in East Longmeadow,
         Massachusetts for laboratory analysis. Three soil samples were analyzed for the presence of
         extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH), two samples for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)
         and two for total lead. On November 23, 2010, following soil excavation activities, GREEN
         collected confirmatory sidewall and excavation bottom samples as described above. Three soil
         samples were analyzed for the presence of EPH and two samples for TPH. Prior to the LRA
         activities, one soil sample collected by Wadleigh & Associates in August 2010 (DB-101, S-3, 10-
         12') revealed a concentration of C11-C22 Aromatic hydrocarbons of 1,100 milligrams per
         kilogram (mg/kg) above MCP RCS-1 Reportable Concentrations. Each of the confirmatory data
         collected by GREEN revealed petroleum concentrations below RCS-1 Reportable Concentrations.
         Two soil samples (DB-101,S-3,10-12' & B-108, S-3, 8-12') collected by Wadleigh & Associates in
         August and September 2010 revealed elevated concentrations of lead. During field activities,
         Wadleigh & Associates noted the presence of ash in three of their soil borings advanced across the
         property. In an effort to establish a correlation between the presence of lead and the presence of
         coal, coal ash or wood ash in the soil, GREEN recommended that these two soil samples be
         examined by Polarized Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy
         Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). On October 14, 2010, soil samples DB-101, S-3,10-
         12' & B-108, S-3, 8-12' were delivered to GREEN by Contest Laboratory. On October 15,
         GREEN submitted these samples under chain of custody to Microvision Laboratories, Inc.
         SEM/EDS examination. The presence of tar was identified in sample DB- 101, S-3,10-12'. The
         presence of coal and coal ash was identified in sample B-108, S-3, 8-12'. As part of LRA activities
         in November 2010, GREEN submitted soil samples for the presence of total lead and RCRA 8
         Metals laboratory analysis. These analyses revealed elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium
         in the stockpile and in excavation sidewall samples. Sidewall sample SW-2, 4-7', which revealed a
         lead concentration of 1,100 mg/kg, was selected for SEM/EDS examination. The presence of coal
         ash, tar and asphalt was identified in this sample. In an effort to further evaluate a correlation
         between the presence of ash in the urban fill and elevated concentrations of metals, GREEN
         submitted soil samples from above and below the fill layer for total lead analysis. Soil sample 12-
         10-S1, collected from 0.4 to 1.2 feet bgs, revealed a total lead concentration of 3.3 mg/kg.
         Additionally, the excavation bottom sample collected at a depth of 14'bgs revealed a total lead
         concentration of 8.7 mg/kg.

         GREEN believes that the elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium are attributable to the
         presence of coal ash in the urban fill on the Site. Elevated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic
         hydrocarbons (PAHs), detected above RCS-1, were identified in the stockpile sample. The
         presence of ash, glass and brick was visually observed during LRA excavation activities.
         Additionally, elevated PAHs were identified in sample B-108, S-3, 8-12', which revealed the
         presence of coal ash via SEM/EDS examination. Therefore, GREEN believes that the PAHs are
         attributable to the presence of coal ash in the urban fill on the Site. GREEN concluded that based
         upon their field observations and the laboratory analytical data collected, that the Limited
         Removal Action was successful in removing the elevated concentrations of petroleum

2 H Street Residential Project                            20                              Expanded PNF
         hydrocarbons identified on the eastern portion of the property. Elevated concentrations of lead and
         cadmium have been detected in the fill material across the property. The presence of coal ash in
         the fill has been confirmed via examination by Polarized Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron
         Microscopy. Additionally, the soil data collected above and below the fill layer does not exhibit
         elevated levels of lead. Cadmium concentrations are below the MassDEP Background
         Concentrations in urban fill. On March 10, 2011, 32.02 tons of soil was transported to Waste
         Management in Rochester New Hampshire under a Bill of Lading. Based upon this information
         GREEN concluded that the elevated concentrations of metals are attributable to ash, and therefore
         exempt from reporting under the 310CMR 40.0317 (9) of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan.
         Therefore, no additional environmental investigations are deemed necessary at the Project Site. A
         copy of the LRA Report, completed by Green Environmental, Inc., of Quincy, Massachusetts has
         been included in this document.

         1.3.9    Construction Impacts

         Section 4.4 describes impacts likely to result from the Proposed Project's construction and steps
         that will be taken to avoid or minimize environmental and transportation-related impacts. The
         Proponent will employ a general contractor that will be responsible for developing a construction
         phasing and staging plan and for coordinating construction activities with all appropriate
         regulatory agencies. The Project's geotechnical consultant, Geotechnical Consulting, Inc., will
         provide consulting services associated with foundation design recommendations, prepare
         geotechnical specifications, and review the construction contractor's proposed procedures.

         The Project Proponent will comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing
         construction of the Proposed Project. The Project Proponent will require that the general
         contractor comply with specific mitigation measures and staging plans to minimize impacts on
         abutters.

         1.3.10   Transportation Impacts

         The Project's transportation consultant, Howard/Stein-Hudson Associates, Inc., completed a
         transportation study (see Section 5.0) for the proposed 2 H Street residential-use development in
         accordance with the city of Boston's Transportation Access Plan Guidelines (1989). Although the
         Boston Transportation Department (BTD) has not issued a Transportation Access Plan Scope, this
         report adheres to the general format requested by BTD. The evaluation includes the following:

             ·    Definition and presentation of existing traffic, including roadway capacities, parking,
                  transit, pedestrian circulation, loading, and Site conditions;
             ·    An evaluation of the project's long-term impacts on traffic, including roadway capacities,
                  parking, transit, pedestrian circulation, loading, and Site conditions;
             ·    An evaluation of the project's short-term traffic impacts related to construction activity;
                  and
             ·    Identification of appropriate measures to mitigate project impacts including but not
                  limited to roadway improvements, pedestrian amenities, a transportation demand
                  management program, and participation in Transportation Management Associations.


         1.3.11   Infrastructure Systems Component

         Section 6.0 describes the existing utility systems servicing the Project area; discusses any probable
         impacts that the Proposed Project may have on the utilities; and identifies mitigation measures to
         address potential impacts of the proposed Project.

2.0      GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1      Proponent Information

         2.1.1    Project Proponent

         The principals of H Street Partners, LLC have a 25-year track record of acquiring and developing
         in the greater Boston community, with an aggregate value in excess of $100 million dollars. The
         principals continue to acquire, manage, and develop sites in the local area, with particular
         emphasis in the urban Boston market. As the primary investor and operating partner, the
         principals invest their own equity capital and handle all aspects of the development process
         internally, which includes, but is not limited to, acquisition; permitting; financing; construction,
         and management.

         Over the past twenty years, the principals have owned and operated several properties in and
         around the City of Boston, including:

             ·    154 West Second Street, a 75-unit apartment development in South Boston
             ·    85 Bolton Street, a 46,000 square foot bio-tech facility in Cambridge
             ·    4 Liberty Square, a 25,000 square foot office building in downtown Boston
             ·    440 Commercial Street, a 20-unit condo conversion in the North End
             ·    126 North Washington, a 6-unit condo conversion in Boston
             ·    877 Harrison Ave, a 9-unit condo conversion in the Back Bay
             ·    10 East Springfield Street, a 4-unit condo conversion in the South End
             ·    459 Massachusetts Avenue, a 4-unit condo conversion in the Back Bay
             ·    460 Massachusetts Avenue, a 4-unit condo conversion in the Back Bay
             ·    515 Centre Street, a 8-unit condo conversion in Newton
             ·    64 East Brookline Street, a 12-unit condo conversion in the South End
             ·    5-7 Station Street, a 50,000 square foot self-storage facility in Brookline

         In addition, the principals are currently involved in the permitting and construction of the
         following projects:

             ·    5-10 St. George Street, a 33-unit residential development in the South End
             ·    902 East Second Street, a 36-unit residential development in South Boston
             ·    199 West Brookline, a 9-unit residential development in the South End

         The principals have particular expertise in urban development, with their main focus on apartment
         and condominium development. With their recent success of The Signal Building, a 75-unit
         apartment project located just blocks from this site, the principals are actively involved and
         encouraging future development in this particular subsector of Boston, while maintaining and
         preserving the existing feel of the South Boston neighborhood. The principals hope to continue
         to create residential housing in the City of Boston; build on its strong economic development base;
         successfully advocate for an upgraded transportation infrastructure, bring more employment
         opportunities to the area, and insure that this community is strong and healthy for both long-term
         and new residents.

3.0      URBAN DESIGN COMPONENT

3.1      Project Description and Approximate Dimensions

The proposed as-of-right project will be a multi-family residential development to be constructed on
approximately 66,313 square feet of land located at 2 H Street in South Boston, MA. The property has
frontage on East First Street, H Street, Vicksburg Street, and East Second Street.

The existing building on the site is a two-story structure containing approximately 23,700 square feet. The
building was previously used as offices and light manufacturing but is currently vacant, although the yard
space is currently being used as equipment storage. The existing structure will be demolished to
accommodate the new residential project.

A 265 foot by 235 foot one story parking garage will be constructed. The parking garage will be entered
from East First Street and will accommodate approximately 206 parking spaces. The floor elevation of the
parking garage will be approximately 12" inches lower than the adjoining East First Street elevation.

A three story structure will be built on top of the garage; an "A" shaped building creating a court yard in
the middle of the structure and a mid-block semi private garden open to East Second Street.

The planned project will consist of 135 residential units, 1,600 square foot retail space with a total of 206
parking spaces. The proposed building heights will be within the maximum heights required by zoning; on
average 45' and 35' along East 1st and East 2nd respectively. The proposed structure is designed to be at
least 30 feet shorter than the Distillery building across H Street, and within the context height of buildings
along East 2nd.

The buildings will be equipped with addressable fire alarm systems and full sprinkler systems.

Approximate dimensions and unit counts are provided in Table 2.1 in the previous section.

3.2      Building Design

         3.2.1    Facade Design, Fenestration and Entrances

         The design of the three-story brick, metal and pre-cast masonry clad building is compatible with
         the existing industrial and residential urban scale. It will noticeably enhance the neighborhood by
         reconnecting the gaps in the urban fabric and by infilling the block.

         Facade Design
         The building will be clad with two stories of brick on a masonry base replicating traditional brick
         masonry buildings throughout Boston. The third floor of the building has been designed with a
         metal cladding in order to vary the palette of materials and contribute toward a visually reduced
         scale similar to a mansard roof building. In addition, recessed third floor balconies around the
         building are included to break the roofline of the building and reduce its massing and scale
         fronting the streets.

         Along East Second Street, terrace apartments step down to two stories towards the proposed
         garden. A similar cascading effect will occur on the north side of the building that will provide
         several benefits. It breaks away the continuous wall effect of a perceived four-story building;
         opens up the interior courtyard enclosure; creates private and open terraces at different levels for
         the building residents; and allows for views of downtown to courtyard occupants.

         Fenestration
         The windows of the building vary along the four street elevations to relate to the context fronting
         each street. The elevations incorporate large double-hung windows with brick lintels in the
         masonry facades; and double-hung and floor to ceiling fixed windows in the metal clad bays. The

2 H Street Residential Project                             28                               Expanded PNF
         east, west, and south elevations include bay windows extending vertically several floors to relate
         to the South Boston residential neighborhood. The north elevation will include protruding
         balconies and larger glazed openings to be more in relation with the industrial zone across East
         First Street. Additional storefront glazing will be incorporated on the north elevation street level
         to bring light into the garage and to reduce the impact of a blank masonry wall.

         Entrances
         The primary pedestrian entrance to the building is from East Second Street under a canopy that
         extends over the sidewalk. Vehicular access to the parking garage will be through two garage
         doors on East First Street. Trash disposal, service elevator and bicycle storage access will also be
         from East Second; as well as fire department access to sprinkler and electrical rooms. The
         potential for future retail will be accommodated thru storefront windows and glazed doors that will
         activate First Street. There will be a door each on Vicksburg and H Streets for emergency stair
         egress.

         Canopies have been designed above the residential and retail entrances.

         3.2.2    Floor Plans

         The residential units are a mix of one and two bedroom units. All units are flats; typically having
         the bedrooms defined and an open space living/kitchen/dining area. The unit sizes range from 550
         square feet to 1,400 square feet with an average of 850 square feet. Generally, the units span from
         the window line of one of the facades to the double loaded corridor of the building. Interior facing
         units have access to light and air through an open atrium courtyard. A large number of units will
         have balconies and terraces to enliven the street elevations.

3.3      Site Design

         3.3.1    Pedestrian Circulation

         The primary entry to the building is directly off the sidewalk of East Second Street. Voluntary
         setbacks are provided on all four sides of the building to provide clearance to neighboring
         buildings, as well as provide street trees and plantings, and seating to enhance the pedestrian
         environment.

         Accessibility has been designed into the site circulation and building by providing a primary
         residential entrance level with street, as well as elevators that access all floors, public zones, and
         open space areas.

         3.3.2    Open Space

         The open space designed for this development falls into either a private, semi-private, or public
         category:

             ·    Private balconies and terraces
             ·    Semi-private second floor deck recreation spaces
             ·    Semi-private common courtyard
             ·    The potential for a public retail seating area along East First Street
             ·    A semi-public garden open to the neighborhood on East Second Street

         The common courtyard in the center of the building will be developed into useable open space
         with private terraces and plantings. The courtyard will also provide lighting into many units. A
         roof deck will be created on the second floor accessible to the building occupants, and with
         uninterrupted views to downtown Boston.

         3.3.3    Parking and Vehicular Circulation

         Parking for all the residential units is provided in an enclosed parking garage. The vehicle access
         and egress will be onto East First Street and will satisfy all accessibility requirements.

         The garage will have 140 tandem and 66 single parking spaces, a trash and recycling room, a
         loading zone, and a bike storage area. All three elevators will access the garage and residential
         floors.

3.4      Sustainable Design and Energy Conservation Measures

The Project Proponent is committed to the practice of sustainable design as demonstrated by both their
work with the U. S. EPA's EnergyStar program, and the BRA. The Project Team has begun the process of
integrating sustainable strategies throughout the development to minimize building energy use, reduce
emissions, and maintain safe and comfortable indoor environments. At the same time, these strategies will
also assist in reducing maintenance and management costs. The paragraphs below outline the project's
approach to sustainable design, and identify some of the principal proposed strategies.

         3.4.1    Implementation and Evaluation

         The principal instruments for the implementation and evaluation of energy efficient and
         sustainable design practices will be the EnergyStar program.

         EnergyStar
         The U. S. EPA EnergyStar program provides financial incentives and technical assistance to
         encourage the construction of energy efficient buildings, and is overseen in the Boston area by the
         Construction Services Group ("CSG") under contract with the EPA.

         In addition to consulting with the designers on insulation and ventilation strategies to improve
         building envelope performance, the CSG provides information and training to the Contractor(s) on
         means and methods of achieving airtight construction to prevent air infiltration.

         EnergyStar provides rebates for the use of certain items when specified and installed in accordance
         with EnergyStar standards, including:

                  1.         Energy efficient windows;
                  2.         High efficiency boilers and hot water storage tanks;
                  3.         Energy efficient appliances; and
                  4.         Energy efficient light fixtures.

         Perhaps most important, on completion, CSG conducts blower door tests on a number of units and
         in common areas to insure that air leakage is below an allowable maximum value. This test
         verifies that the sealing of all penetrations through exterior wall, floors and roof has been properly
         executed and that the building envelope is performing as specified.

         Sustainable Sites

         Urban Redevelopment Sanborn Maps indicate that the proposed site was previously built upon. A
         one story industrial building is the only structure that currently exists on the site. The remaining
         two thirds of the site (about 40,000 s.f.) is a paved parking/storage lot. The Proposed Project will
         return this vacant site to the more vibrant density of an urban neighborhood.

         Alternative Transportation

         Two city bus routes are located within 700 feet from the Project Site. About a mile west and
         southwest of the site are located the Broadway and Andrew T stops of the subway Red Line which
         terminate at Alewife and Braintree. Please see Section 5.2.6 for further information on buses and
         the commuter rail.

         The use of bicycles by building residents will be promoted by the installation of a covered, secure
         indoor bicycle storage area within the development.

         The Proponent is investigating the possibility of providing a ZipCar parking space at the project's
         garage facility. This ZipCar would accommodate not only the project's residents but would also
         be available to other local residents. In addition, dedicated parking spaces and plug-in charge

2 H Street Residential Project                              43                               Expanded PNF
         stations will be provided for the use of electric vehicles, as well as preferential parking for
         alternative fuel or high efficiency vehicles.

         Stormwater Management

         The stormwater management system for the Proposed Project will increase on-site recharge and
         improve off water quality through the use of the following measures:

         ·   On-site treatment of storm water collected from parking areas and other potentially hazardous
             effluent.

         Water Efficiency

         Water conservation measures that minimize both water use and wastewater production will
         include:

         ·   Dual flush toilets that will reduce water usage project-wide, both in residential and non-
             residential areas.

         Energy and Atmosphere

         State-of-the art sustainable technologies and practices to be employed by the Proponent for the
         project's heating, cooling, and ventilation systems include:

         ·   High-efficiency gas fired boilers;
         ·   Indirect-fired, longer life domestic hot water tanks, with additional heavy insulation to save
             energy;
         ·   Variable frequency drives and high-efficiency motors for circulating pumps
         ·   Direct digital controls (DDC), also called energy management systems (EMS) with modem
             communication for each boiler plant;
         ·   Added insulation for all piping beyond that required by Code;
         ·   Carbon Dioxide sensor control for ventilation of community spaces;
         ·   High-efficiency lighting that exceeds code requirements;
         ·   Daylight and occupancy control options;
         ·   Automated light sensing set back thermostats for apartment temperature controls;
         ·   Consideration of co-generation systems for the project; and
         ·   Consideration of a solar hot water system for the Project.

         Material and Resources

         Storage and Collection of Recyclables
         A recycling program is planned for the proposed Project. The building will have a recycling
         transfer room within the building. This program will be coordinated with an outside vendor for
         weekly pick up.


         Construction Waste Management
         The Contractor will be required to develop and implement a Waste Management Plan with the
         goal of recycling or salvaging 75% of construction waste in order to divert construction and
         demolition debris from landfill disposal.

         Regional Materials
         The Project Team has established as a goal the specification and installation of materials such that
         5% of all materials used in the project will be manufactured regionally within a radius of 500
         miles.

2 H Street Residential Project                              44                                Expanded PNF
         Indoor Environmental Quality

         Construction Indoor Air Quality Management
         The contractor will be required to develop and implement an Indoor Air Quality Management
         Plan, to prevent indoor air quality problems resulting from the construction process.

         Low-Emitting Materials
         Adhesives, sealants, paints and carpets will be specified with low/no VOC content to reduce the
         quantity of indoor air contaminants

         Daylight and Views

         The building orientation, fenestration and exterior articulation will work in concert to both
         maximize daylighting and control solar heat gain. All buildings are designed to have significant
         solar access throughout the day. Larger windows will be incorporated in the facades that best
         capture and control daylight.

         Dwelling units will have large, high windows to maximize daylighting in the living spaces.

         Residential common spaces are designed to rely largely on natural light for daytime hours.




2 H Street Residential Project                            45                             Expanded PNF
4.0       ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMPONENT

This section of the PNF evaluates potential environmental impacts related to the Proposed Project in the
subject areas of water quality and stormwater management, geotechnical and groundwater conditions, solid
and hazardous waste, and construction related impacts. Since the Project Site is within the existing zoning
height allowance and is generally consistent with the residential character in the surrounding neighborhood,
the Project is not expected to have significant impact on surrounding wind patterns and pedestrian comfort
levels, or daylight impacts in the Project Site vicinity. Therefore, these specific evaluations were not
included in this PNF.

4.1       Water Quality/Stormwater Management

The Proposed Project will not affect the water quality in the area. A Stormwater Management Plan will be
incorporated in compliance with the Department of Environmental Protection's Stormwater Management
Standards providing pretreatment of the stormwater prior to being discharged on-site or into the Boston
Water and Sewer Commission system. The Proposed Project will also meet or exceed standards as they
relate to erosion control, discharge to sensitive areas, and operation and maintenance to assure a proper
functioning system during and post-construction.

4.2       Groundwater and Geotechnical Analysis

Wadleigh & Associates and Geotechnical Consultants, Inc. have been selected as the environmental and
geotechnical consultant for the 2 H Street project. A site specific boring program and accompanying
environmental report was completed by Wadleigh & Associates prior to this filing.

Based upon a review of the subsurface soils data (boring logs) collected by Wadleigh & Associates, the
overall Project Site is anticipated to contain mainly underlain by glacial outwash or ablation till soils
(predominantly loose-medium dense, fine-medium sands, silts and gravels) over hard basal till. Shallow
depths to bedrock are unlikely, as refusal was encountered at depths of 64 to 68 feet during drilling
activities at the Site, and no bedrock outcrops were observed at the Project Site or within the immediate
Site vicinity.

4.3       Solid and Hazardous Waste Analysis

Environmental investigations/assessments conducted at the Project Site and submitted to the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) include the following:

      ·   "Limited Subsurface Investigation Report" dated October 22, 2010 by Wadleigh & Associates of
          Boston, MA.
      ·   "A Letter Summary" dated October 29, 2010 by Green Environmental of Quincy, MA.
      ·   "MCP ­ Limited Removal Action Report" dated March 2011 by Green Environmental of Quincy,
          MA.

Subsurface contamination was detected in the soils at the Project Site by Wadleigh & Associates in October
2010. Laboratory analyses indicated concentrations of lead, extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH),
and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were present in the Site soils that exceeded the applicable
MADEP Reportable Concentrations for soil. During field activities, Wadleigh & Associates noted the
presence of ash in three of the soil borings advanced on the property. In accordance with section 310 CMR
40.317 (9), of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP), oil or hazardous materials associated with the
presence of coal, coal ash, or wood ash may be exempt from reporting under the MCP, and considered
"Background".

In an effort to establish a correlation between the presence of lead and the presence of coal, coal ash or
wood ash in the soil, Green Environmental (GREEN) had two of the soil samples be examined by Polarized
Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy


2 H Street Residential Project                            46                              Expanded PNF
(SEM/EDS). On October 14, 2010, soil samples DB-101, S-3, 10-12' & B-108, S-3, 8-12' were delivered to
GREEN by Contest Laboratory. On October 15, GREEN submitted these samples under chain of custody
to Microvision Laboratories, Inc. for SEM/EDS examination. The presence of tar was identified in sample
DB-101, S-3, 10-12'. The presence of coal and coal ash was identified in sample B-108, S-3, 8-12'. Based
upon this information, GREEN believes that the presence of lead (400 mg/kg) identified in boring B-108
can be attributed to the presence of coal and/or coal ash and is exempt from the reporting requirements of
the MCP. It was GREEN's opinion that no further action is warranted for the B-108 location. The presence
of coal and/or coal ash was not confirmed at boring DB-101; however the presence of tar may be the source
of C11-C22 Aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) previously identified by
Wadleigh & Associates to exceed their applicable MCP RCS-1 Reportable Concentration. To address the
petroleum and lead issues at DB-101, GREEN recommended completing a Limited Removal Action (LRA)
in this area.

On November 23, 2010, GREEN oversaw the excavation of approximately 20 cubic yards of soil on the
eastern portion of the site building at the location of former boring/monitoring well DB-101. During
excavation activities GREEN observed an urban fill layer located at a depth of approximately 1.2 to 14 feet
below ground surface (bgs). The presence of ash, glass, and brick was noted in this layer. Confirmatory soil
samples were collected following excavation activities and submitted under chain of custody to Contest
Analytical Laboratory in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts for laboratory analysis. Three soil samples
were analyzed for the presence of extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH), two samples for total
petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and two for total lead. On November 23, 2010, following soil excavation
activities, GREEN collected confirmatory sidewall and excavation bottom samples as described above.
Three soil samples were analyzed for the presence of EPH and two samples for TPH. Prior to the LRA
activities, one soil sample collected by Wadleigh & Associates in August 2010 (DB-101, S-3, 10-12')
revealed a concentration of C11-C22 Aromatic hydrocarbons of 1,100 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)
above MCP RCS-1 Reportable Concentrations. Each of the confirmatory data collected by GREEN
revealed petroleum concentrations below RCS-1 Reportable Concentrations. Two soil samples (DB-101,S-
3,10-12' & B-108, S-3, 8-12') collected by Wadleigh & Associates in August and September 2010 revealed
elevated concentrations of lead. During field activities, Wadleigh & Associates noted the presence of ash in
three of their soil borings advanced across the property. In an effort to establish a correlation between the
presence of lead and the presence of coal, coal ash or wood ash in the soil, GREEN recommended that
these two soil samples be examined by Polarized Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy
with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). On October 14, 2010, soil samples DB-101, S-
3,10-12' & B-108, S-3, 8-12' were delivered to GREEN by Contest Laboratory. On October 15, GREEN
submitted these samples under chain of custody to Microvision Laboratories, Inc. SEM/EDS examination.
The presence of tar was identified in sample DB- 101, S-3,10-12'. The presence of coal and coal ash was
identified in sample B-108, S-3, 8-12'. As part of LRA activities in November 2010, GREEN submitted soil
samples for the presence of total lead and RCRA 8 Metals laboratory analysis. These analyses revealed
elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium in the stockpile and in excavation sidewall samples. Sidewall
sample SW-2, 4-7', which revealed a lead concentration of 1,100 mg/kg, was selected for SEM/EDS
examination. The presence of coal ash, tar and asphalt was identified in this sample. In an effort to further
evaluate a correlation between the presence of ash in the urban fill and elevated concentrations of metals,
GREEN submitted soil samples from above and below the fill layer for total lead analysis. Soil sample 12-
10-S1, collected from 0.4 to 1.2 feet bgs, revealed a total lead concentration of 3.3 mg/kg. Additionally, the
excavation bottom sample collected at a depth of 14'bgs revealed a total lead concentration of 8.7 mg/kg.

GREEN believes that the elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium are attributable to the presence of
coal ash in the urban fill on the Site. Elevated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
detected above RCS-1, were identified in the stockpile sample. The presence of ash, glass and brick was
visually observed during LRA excavation activities. Additionally, elevated PAHs were identified in sample
B-108, S-3, 8-12', which revealed the presence of coal ash via SEM/EDS examination. Therefore, GREEN
believes that the PAHs are attributable to the presence of coal ash in the urban fill on the Site. GREEN
concluded that based upon their field observations and the laboratory analytical data collected, that the
Limited Removal Action was successful in removing the elevated concentrations of petroleum
hydrocarbons identified on the eastern portion of the property. Elevated concentrations of lead and
cadmium have been detected in the fill material across the property. The presence of coal ash in the fill has

2 H Street Residential Project                             47                              Expanded PNF
been confirmed via examination by Polarized Light Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy.
Additionally, the soil data collected above and below the fill layer does not exhibit elevated levels of lead.
Cadmium concentrations are below the MassDEP Background Concentrations in urban fill. On March 10,
2011, 32.02 tons of soil was transported to Waste Management in Rochester New Hampshire under a Bill
of Lading. Based upon this information GREEN concluded that the elevated concentrations of metals are
attributable to ash, and therefore exempt from reporting under the 310CMR 40.0317 (9) of the
Massachusetts Contingency Plan. Therefore, no additional environmental investigations are deemed
necessary at the Project Site. A copy of the LRA Report, completed by Green Environmental, Inc., of
Quincy, Massachusetts has been included in this document.

         4.3.1    Construction Period Waste

         The construction contractor will be required to develop and implement a Waste Management Plan
         with the goal of recycling or salvaging 75% of construction waste in order to divert construction
         and demolition debris from landfill disposal.

         4.3.2    Operational Solid Waste

         A development wide recycling program is planned for this project. Each building will have either
         a recycling transfer room within the building or an exterior recycling transfer shed. This program
         will be coordinated with an outside vendor for weekly pick-up.

         4.3.3    Recycled Materials

         The project team has established as a goal the specification and installation of materials such that
         5% of all materials used in the project will be post-consumer recycled.

4.4      Construction Impacts

The following section describes impacts likely to result from the Proposed Project's construction and steps
that will be taken to avoid or minimize environmental and transportation-related impacts. The Project
Proponent will employ a general contractor that will be responsible for developing a construction phasing
and staging plan and for coordinating construction activities with all appropriate regulatory agencies. The
Project's geotechnical consultant, Geotechnical Consulting, will provide consulting services associated
with foundation design recommendations, prepare geotechnical specifications, and review the construction
contractor's proposed procedures.

The Project Proponent will comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing construction of
the proposed project. The proponent will require that the general contractor comply will specific mitigation
measures and staging plans to minimize impacts on abutters.

Proper pre-construction planning with the neighborhood will be essential to the successful construction of
this Project. The Project Proponent will convene neighborhood meetings on the subject of minimizing
adverse construction activity impacts, including at least one prior to the start of construction and at least
two during construction, and more such meetings if feedback from the neighborhood indicates the need for
them. Signage will include general contractor and Project Proponent contact information with emergency
numbers.

         4.4.1    Construction Activity Schedule

         The construction period for his project is expected to be approximately 18 months in duration.
         Typical construction hours will be from 7:00 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Monday through Saturday.
         Second shift construction activity is expected to be kept to a minimum.




2 H Street Residential Project                              48                               Expanded PNF
         The general construction contractor will conduct a pre-construction survey of abutting properties.
         Construction excavation and other construction procedures are to be developed so as to assure that
         this work will not undermine or adversely affect these structures.

         4.4.2    Construction Staging Areas

         The proposed staging plan is designated to isolate the construction while providing safe access for
         pedestrians and automobiles during normal day-to-day activities and emergencies.

         Construction of 2 H Street project will be made easier because of the following: the Project Site
         can be accessed from any of the four adjoining streets to allow main thoroughfares to be
         maintained clear; the overall Project Site plan includes open areas outside the building footprints
         which can serve as staging areas during construction. As abutting properties and structures are
         owned by others, care will be taken to minimize construction impacts on all abutters.

         With very rare exceptions, construction vehicles well enter and exit the Project Site from gated
         entrances located along East First Street which are not major thoroughfares for the neighborhood.
         The main access point will be from East First Street. In order to minimize the impact on traffic
         flow along East Second Street, construction vehicles will enter and/or exit from East First Street
         during non-rush hour time periods.

         Gates will be provided at the construction areas to provide both entrance and exit from the overall
         Project Site. All construction activity will be kept within the overall Project Site. Appropriate
         signage will be installed along the pedestrian travel-way. The vehicular lanes on public streets
         will not be obstructed.

         Heavy trucking, such as during concrete placements, will be controlled so as not to impact the
         neighborhood around the overall Project Site more than necessary, and stacking of trucks will be
         kept to a minimum. In the event stacking of trucks does occur, such as with large concrete pours,
         the trucks reach the overall Project Site, they will be brought onto the site where materials will be
         off loaded.

         4.4.3    Demolition

         The current Site building (2 H Street) will be demolished. Access to the Project Site for demolition
         and disposal vehicles and equipment (for interior demolition debris) will be from the gated
         entrances located along East First Street.

         Demolition/construction debris will be disposed of into dumpsters and trailer dumps, which will
         be located at various locations throughout the overall Project Site. Demolition will be conducted
         so that materials that may be recycled are segregated from those materials not recyclable, to enable
         disposal at an approved solid waste facility. The Proponent will take an active role with regard to
         the processing and recycling of demolition and construction waste. The disposal contract will
         include specific requirements that will ensure that construction procedures allow for the necessary
         segregation, processing, reuse and recycling of materials. For those materials that cannot be
         recycled, solid waste will be transported in covered trucks to an approved solid waste facility, per
         DEP's Regulations for Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00.

         4.4.4    Excavation

         Shoring will be used during excavation to the extent required due to proximity to the sidewalk or
         abutting structures. Setbacks from most side and rear lot lines are such that there will probable be
         sufficient room to slope the sides of excavations at an angle that does not require shoring at these
         locations. Excavated material which is not to be reused on-site will be transported in covered
         trucks to an approved landfill or processing site.


2 H Street Residential Project                             49                               Expanded PNF
         4.4.5    Dewatering

         Dewatering will be such that all construction operations are conducted in the dry. Sump pits and
         pumps will be maintained inside the limits of excavation to collect and discharge water. Operation
         of the dewatering systems will:

             ·    Result in no damage to adjacent buildings, properties, structures, utilities and completed
                  work.
             ·    Prevent and remove any water accumulating in the excavation.
             ·    Collect and discharge surface water, seepage, groundwater, and other water which may
                  enter excavations.
             ·    Develop dry undisturbed excavation subgrades for execution of subsequent construction
                  operations in the dry.
             ·    Maintain and control the water level in backfill to minimum of two (2) feet below the top
                  of backfill placement and compaction operations.
             ·    Maintain existing groundwater levels outside the excavation limits.

         4.4.6    Construction Waste

         Normal construction debris will be disposed of into dumpsters, which will be located at various
         locations throughout the overall Project Site.

         4.4.7    Construction Traffic Impacts

         Because the construction workers will arrive and depart prior to peak traffic periods, the
         construction trips are not expected to impact traffic conditions. The general contractor and its
         subcontractor will be required to recruit workers from the neighborhood to the maximum feasible
         extent. In addition to other benefits, employing workers who live nearby will reduce the number
         of personal vehicles driving to the site.

         4.4.8    Construction Air Quality

         Impacts associated with construction activities may generate fugitive dust, which will result in
         localized increase in airborne particle levels. Fugitive dust emissions from construction activities
         will depend on such factors as the properties of the emitting surfaces (e.g., moisture content and
         volume of spills), meteorological and variables and construction practices employed.

         To reduce emissions of fugitive dust and minimize impacts on the local environment, the
         construction contractor will adhere to a number of strictly enforced mitigation measures. These
         include:

             ·    Wetting agents will be used regularly to control and suppress dust that may come from
                  the construction materials and from demolition;
             ·    All trucks for transportation of construction debris will be fully covered;
             ·    Storage of construction debris on-site will be kept to a minimum
             ·    Actual construction practices will be monitored to ensure those unnecessary transfers and
                  mechanical disturbances of loose materials are minimized and to ensure that any
                  emissions of dust are negligible; and
             ·    A wheel wash area will be established to minimize dust and mud accumulations in City
                  streets, or periods street sweeping may be utilized to maintain an acceptable
                  street/sidewalk condition.




2 H Street Residential Project                             50                               Expanded PNF
         4.4.9    Construction Noise

         The construction/renovation of 2 H Street project will require the use of equipment that can be
         heard from off-site locations. Construction is expected to commence on September 1, 2012 and be
         completed in May 31, 2013 ­ approximately a 21-month duration. The Proposed Project is
         committed to mitigate noise impacts of the construction of the project. Increased community
         sound levels, however, are an inherent consequence of construction activities. The area currently
         has significant ambient noise due to urban activities including traffic noise from East Second
         Street, East First Street and H Street, building, mechanical equipment, and aircraft flying
         overhead. Noise from construction will be kept within applicable regulations regarding time of
         the day and level.

         Construction will occur during the daytime hours as defined by the Boston Noise Regulation. In
         some instances, weekend and second shifts may be required. When these events arise, all required
         permits will be in place.

         4.4.10   Construction Noise Mitigation

         Every reasonable effort will be made to minimize the noise impact of construction activities.
         Mitigation measures will include:

             ·    Scheduling of work during daytime hours;
             ·    Using appropriate mufflers on all equipment and providing ongoing maintenance of
                  intake and exhaust mufflers;
             ·    Maintaining muffling enclosures on continuously operating equipment, such as air
                  compressors and welding generators;
             ·    Replacing specific construction operations and techniques by less noisy ones where
                  feasible ­ e.g. using vibration pile driving instead of impact driving if practical;
             ·    Selecting the quietest practical items of equipment ­ e.g., electric instead of diesel
                  powered equipment;
             ·    Selecting equipment operations to keep average levels low, to synchronize noisiest
                  operations with times of highest ambient levels, and to maintain relatively uniform noise
                  levels;
             ·    Turn off idle equipment, and;
             ·    Locating noisy equipment at locations that protect sensitive locations by shielding or
                  distance.

         4.4.11   Rodent Control

         The City of Boston has declared that the infestation of rodents in the City is a serious problem. In
         order to control this infestation, the City enforces the requirements established under the
         Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, Chapter 11, 105 CMR 410.550 and the State Building Code,
         Section 108..6. Policy Number 87-4 (City of Boston) established that extermination of rodents
         shall be required for issuance of permits of demolition, excavation, foundation and basement
         rehabilitation. The Proposed Project will develop a rodent control program prior to its
         construction start. During construction, rodent control service visits will be made by a certified
         rodent control firm to monitor the situation.

         4.4.12   Utilities

         The construction process should not affect the existing utilities. Connections to the existing
         services will be performed following approval and survey by the Boston Water and Sewer
         Commission, Nstar and Keyspan. Police details will be utilized to control traffic during street
         excavations.



2 H Street Residential Project                             51                              Expanded PNF
4.5      Sustainability

The Project will reduce energy use across systems with strategies such as energy efficient equipment and
appropriate insulation in a tight building envelope. No chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) will be used in cooling
equipment. Instead, refrigerants with low ozone depleting/global warming potential will be prioritized.

The Project will achieve compliance with Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code by being LEED Certifiable
under the LEED NC (New Construction) rating system (see Appendix C).

Sustainable highlights of the Project include:
Redevelopment of a currently underutilized transit-oriented site. The Project is in a dense urban area, close
to regional and local public transportation. The new residential building will be located proximate to public
transportation on the MBTA's Broadway Station - Red line and Bus Routes 7, 9, and 10, encouraging
minimal vehicle use.

The Project will embody urban principles encouraging public transportation and pedestrian activity. The
use of cars at this site is expected to be minimal in comparison to the public transportation and pedestrian
trips. Other transportation related characteristics include:
     · The development team will have discussions with Zipcar to potentially include shared-car
          facilities within the building.
     · The Proponent will include two electric car charging stations in the parking garage.
     · One bicycle parking space will be included for each residential unit; the majority will be covered.

Mechanical Systems:
   · No CFCs will be used in cooling equipment.
   · The Project will seek to save energy across systems with energy efficient equipment and
       appropriate insulation.
   · Energy Star appliances, lighting and low-flow fixtures will be integrated into residential units.
   · Operable and high-quality insulated glass will allow residents to control air movement within the
       units.
   · High efficiency lighting with occupancy sensors will be incorporated where suitable.

Below is a description of how the Project will achieve the anticipated credits on the LEED for New
Construction (NC) version 3.0. The proposed Project is currently estimated at a minimum, to be LEED
certifiable, as required by Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code.

contains no building of historic significance.

Other architecturally historical buildings listed by MACRIS within the immediate Project Site vicinity
include the following: Bay State Iron Company Worker Housing projects built in 1852, (591-597 East
Second Street); a small workshop building from 1899 (564-570 East First Street); the South Boston Power
Station built in 1911, located 700 feet from the Project Site (696 East First Street); the Henry Souther row
house built in 1880 (1 H Street Place). The Proposed Project will not adversely impact any historical
structures or districts.




2 H Street Residential Project                             54                              Expanded PNF
5.0      TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT

5.1      Introduction

In accordance with the City of Boston's Transportation Access Plan Guidelines (2001) and the BRA
Development Review Guidelines (2006), this chapter describes roadway, pedestrian, and bicycle conditions;
transportation issues; parking and loading; pedestrian and bicycle circulation; proposed mitigation; and
transportation goals for the Project. Although the Boston Transportation Department (BTD) has not yet
issued a formal Transportation Access Plan Scope, the Project team has had preliminary discussions with
BTD staff regarding the impacts of the Project in an effort to develop a general scope for this report.

         5.1.1     Project Description
         The Project site is located at 2 H Street in South Boston and is bounded by East First Street to the
         north, East Second Street to the south, Vicksburg Street to the east, and H Street to the west. The
         site currently consists of an approximately 20,000 square foot (sf) building and surface parking lot
         used to store and repair construction equipment. The proposed Project involves the demolition of
         the existing 20,000 square foot (sf) building and construction of a new approximately 133,000 sf
         residential building containing approximately 135 residential units and 206 parking spaces.

         The Project will simplify and improve vehicular access to the site by reducing the number of curb
         cuts, which will create additional, and/or formalize existing on-street parking. Currently,
         vehicular access to the existing site is not well defined. Primary access points are provided on H
         Street and a large curb cut on the corner of East First Street and Vicksburg Street, but there are
         numerous other curb cuts and gates within the existing chain link fence. Several of the existing
         gates do not appear to be used and are blocked by equipment stored on-site; as a result, vehicles
         generally park on-street in front of these gates. Similarly, no curbing is provided along the east
         side of East First Street adjacent to the site making it difficult for motorists to identify access
         points to the site. Vehicular access to and egress to the Project's parking garage will be provided
         via separate entrance and exit driveways on East Second Street. All other existing access points
         will be closed. Primary pedestrian access to the residential lobby will be provided on East Second
         Street.

         Given the residential nature of the project, loading and service activity is expected to be minimal
         and will occur curb-side. Residential move-in/move-out will be coordinated by building
         management and may require a temporary on-street parking permit from the City, as necessary.

         5.1.2     Methodology
         In accordance with BTD Transportation Access Plan Guidelines (2001) the study team conducted
         a transportation analysis for the proposed Project. The analysis is summarized in the following
         sections:

             The first section comprises an inventory of existing transportation conditions, including
             roadway and intersection conditions; parking, transit, pedestrian and bicycle circulation;
             loading; and site conditions.
             The second section evaluates future transportation conditions and assesses potential traffic
             impacts associated with the proposed development and other neighboring projects. Long-
             term impacts are evaluated for the year 2016, based on a five-year horizon from the 2011 base
             year. Expected roadway, parking, transit, pedestrian, and loading capacities and deficiencies
             are identified. This section includes the following scenarios:
              The No-Build Scenario (2016) includes general background growth and additional
                  vehicular traffic associated with specific proposed or planned developments and roadway
                  changes in the vicinity of the site; and
              The Build Scenario (2016) includes specific travel demand forecasts for the Project.
             A third section identifies appropriate measures to mitigate Project-related impacts identified
             in the previous phase.

             Finally, an evaluation of short-term traffic impacts associated with construction activities is
             also included.

         5.1.3   Study Area
         The Project's traffic impact study area, developed in consultation with BTD staff, includes the
         following three intersections (see Figure 5-1):

             D Street/West First Street (signalized);
             Summer Street/East First Street (signalized); and
             East First Street/H Street (unsignalized).

5.2      Existing Conditions

         5.2.1     Roadway Conditions
         The study area includes the following roadways, which are categorized according to the
         Massachusetts Department of Transportation Office of Transportation Planning functional
         classifications:

         D Street is an urban minor arterial south of Summer Street and an urban principle arterial north of
         Summer Street. D Street runs generally north­south between Sea-port Boulevard to the north and
         Dorchester Avenue to the south. Within the study area, D Street consists of one to two travel
         lanes in each direction; however, D Street is one-way northbound between West Second Street and
         West First Street. On-street parking is provided along both sides of the roadway and consists of a
         mix of South Boston resident permit and metered parking. Sidewalks are located on both sides of
         D Street throughout the study area and are generally in good condition.

         West First Street, an urban minor collector, runs generally east­west between Dorchester Street to
         the east and B Street to the west in South Boston. West First Street is one lane in each direction
         within the study area. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the roadway and are in poor
         condition and/or discontinuous in some locations.

         Summer Street is an urban principal arterial that runs between Washington Street in Downtown
         Crossing to the west and East First Street in South Boston to the east, where it then becomes L
         Street. At its intersection with East First Street, Summer Street is a north-south roadway. Within
         the study area, Summer Street various between one and two lanes in each direction with on-street
         parking provided along both sides of the roadway. Sidewalks are provided on both sides of the
         street. Pavement markings on Summer Street are generally in fair condition within the study area.

         East First Street is an east ­ west roadway that runs between West First Street and Farragut Road.
         From Farragut Road to Summer Street, East Second Street is classified as an urban principal
         arterial; from Summer Street to West First Street it is an urban minor arterial. Parking restrictions
         vary from no parking to parking on one or both sides of the roadway. A single travel lane is
         provided in each direction.

         H Street, a local roadway, runs north­south between East First Street and Columbia Road. H
         Street is one-way northbound from East Broadway to East First Street and one-way southbound
         from East Broadway to Columbia Road. On-street parking is generally provided along both sides
         of the roadway.

         5.2.2    Intersection Conditions
         D Street/West First Street is a signalized, four-leg intersection. The West First Street eastbound
         approach consists of a 9-foot, exclusive left-turn lane and a 10-foot, exclusive through lane. The
         West First Street westbound approach consists of an 11-foot exclusive through lane and a 12-foot
         exclusive right-turn lane. The D Street southbound approach consists of a 10-foot exclusive left-
         turn lane and a 10-foot exclusive right-turn lane. The D Street northbound approach is one-way
         northbound and consists of a 12-foot shared left-turn/through lane and an 11-foot exclusive right-

         turn lane. The one-way northbound block of D Street was introduced by BTD to discourage
         southbound through traffic on the street. Similarly, a one-way southbound block was created at
         Old Colony Boulevard to discourage through traffic in the other direction. No on-street parking is
         located along any approach at this intersection. Sidewalks are provided along all approaches; 10-
         foot crosswalks are provided across all approaches of the intersection.

         Summer Street/East First Street, the first major intersection on Summer Street south of the
         Boston Harbor Reserved Channel, operates under traffic signal control and has four approaches.
         The eastbound East First Street approach consists of an 11-foot, shared left-turn/through/right-turn
         lane. The East First Street westbound approach is marked as one 23-foot lane but functions as a
         shared left-turn/through lane and a right-turn lane. The northbound Summer Street approach is
         marked as a single, 27-foot lane but operates as a shared left-turn/through lane, a shared
         through/right-turn lane, and a parking lane. Summer Street southbound consists of a 12-foot
         shared left-turn/through lane and a 14-foot shared through/right-turn lane. An MBTA bus stop is
         located on the east side of Summer Street immediately adjacent to the intersection. Crosswalks
         with handicapped-accessible ramps are provided across all approaches to this intersection.
         Concrete or asphalt sidewalks are provided along approaches of this intersection. Sidewalks along
         the approaches to this intersection are in fair condition. Pavement and pavement markings are in
         fair condition, although the crosswalks are heavily worn. During field observations, a large
         number of trucks used this intersection.

         H Street/East First Street is four-leg unsignalized intersection. The East First Street eastbound
         and westbound approaches operate as free movements at the intersection and each consist of one
         approximately 12-foot multipurpose lane. The H Street northbound approach is stop controlled
         and consists of one approximately 18-foot left-turn/through/right-turn lane. A commercial
         driveway serving Comcast forms the southbound approach at the intersection and consists of an
         approximately 11-foot shared left-turn/right-turn lane; the driveway also operates under stop
         control.

         5.2.3    Traffic Conditions
         The study team collected manual vehicle turning movement counts at study area intersections in
         November 2011 during the weekday AM (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM) and PM (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM)
         peak periods. Based on these counts, the weekday peak hours vary throughout the study area, but
         generally occur between 7:45­8:45 AM and 5:00­6:00 PM. Complete traffic count data are
         provided in Appendix B.

         Figure 5-2 and Figure 5-3 show the existing peak-hour turning volumes for the study area
         intersections. The existing traffic volumes include the traffic generated by the existing, uses on
         site.

         5.2.4     Traffic Operations
         The study team used Trafficware's Synchro 6 software to analyze LOS and delay at study area
         intersections, which is based on the methodology of the Transportation Research Board's Highway
         Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM). HCM methods analyze the capacity of an intersection by
         determining the LOS, delay (in seconds), volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c), and 95th percentile queue
         length (in feet), based on the intersection geometry, traffic control, and available traffic data for
         each intersection.

         The v/c ratio is a measure of congestion at an intersection approach. A v/c ratio of 1 or greater
         indicates that the intersection approach exceeds capacity.

         The 95th percentile queue length represents the farthest extent of the vehicle queue (to the last
         stopped vehicle) upstream from the stop line during 95% of all signal cycles. The 95th percentile
         queue will not be seen during each cycle. The queue would be this long only 5% of the time.
         These queues would typically not be seen during off-peak hours.

         The Existing Conditions signal timing and phasing information was provided by the Boston
         Transportation Department (BTD). The study team also conducted field observations to verify
         Synchro model accuracy as well as to calibrate the model as necessary to match existing traffic
         conditions as closely as possible.

         Table 5-1, derived from the HCM, shows LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized
         intersections. LOS A defines the most favorable condition, with minimum traffic delay. LOS F
         represents the worst condition (over capacity), with significant traffic delay. LOS D is generally
         considered acceptable in an urban environment.

    All of the study area intersections operate at a good overall LOS (LOS D or better) during both peak
    hours. Only three individual intersection approaches operate below LOS D:

         West First Street/D Street ­ during the AM peak hour, the West First Street westbound through
         lane operates at LOS F. This is likely due to the relatively small amount of green time given to the
         westbound approach compared to the relatively large volume of westbound traffic (approximately
         170 vehicles per hour). The D Street southbound left-turn lane operates at LOS E.
         Summer Street/East First Street ­ during the AM Peak hour, the East First Street eastbound
         shared left-turn/through/right-turn approach operates at LOS E.

Off-Street Parking
        The closest public parking facility is the 1,345-space Boston Convention & Exhibition Center
        (BCEC) South Parking lot, located approximately one-half mile (10- to 15-minute walk) from the
        Project site. Parking for 400 vehicles is also provided within the Westin Boston Waterfront
        Garage approximately three-quarters of a mile from the Project site.

         5.2.6    Public Transportation
         The Project site is located within convenient walking distance to Massachusetts Bay
         Transportation Authority (MBTA) local bus service. Public transportation services within
         approximately a quarter- mile (5- to 10-minute walk) of the Project site are summarized in Table
         5-4 and illustrated in Figure 5-5.

         Bus route #5 operates between City Point and JFK UMass Station via Andrew Station and
         McCormack Housing. The #5 provides connection to Red Line and commuter rail service at JKF
         UMass Station and Red Line and local bus service at Andrew Station. The #5 operates Monday
         through Saturday with limited service, approximately every hour during the morning and early
         afternoon periods only; no service is provided on Sunday.

         Bus route #7 operates between City Point in South Boston and Otis Street/Summer Street in
         downtown Boston and provides connection to the World Trade Center; Federal Court House;
         South Station; Harbor Industrial Park; downtown business and shopping districts; and connections
         to the Red and Silver Lines. Service on this route runs approximately every 15 minutes during the
         weekday commuter period. Service is also provided approximately every 40 minutes on Saturday,
         with no service on Sundays. In the vicinity of the Project site, the #7 primarily operates along
         Summer Street but also operates an alternate route that serves the Harbor Industrial Park via
         Pappas Way and East First Street. The #7 alternate route serves a bus stop directly adjacent to the
         site in the East First Street eastbound direction; however, the MBTA bus stop sign is no longer
         legible.

         Bus route #9 operates between City Point in South Boston and Copley Square in Back Bay via
         Broadway Station. The #9 provides connection to the Red, Green, and Silver Lines and local bus
         service. Service on this route runs approximately every 10 minutes or less weekday commuter
         period. Service is also provided on Saturdays and Sundays.

         Bus route #10 operates between City Point in South Boston and Copley Square in Back Bay via
         Andrew Station and Boston University Medical Center. The #10 provides connection to the Red,
         Green, Orange, and Silver Lines and local bus service. Service on this route runs approximately
         every 20 to 30 minutes during the weekday commuter period. Service is also provided on
         Saturdays and Sundays.

         5.2.7    Existing Pedestrian Conditions
         Sidewalks are provided along all roadways adjacent to the Project site with the exception of
         Vicksburg Street, which only has a short segment of sidewalk along its east side near East First
         Street. Sidewalks adjacent to the site along East First Street, H Street, and East Second Street are
         generally in fair to poor condition. The following details the sidewalk conditions adjacent to the
         Project Site:

             East First Street ­ Sidewalks are provided along both sides of the roadway and generally
             range in width between 4 and 8 feet; however, the sidewalks are mostly in poor condition and
             discontinuous in some locations.

             H Street ­ approximately 8-foot wide sidewalks are provided along both sides of H Street
             between East First Street and East Second Street; however, curbing is generally not provided
             along the east side of H Street and is flush with the roadway surface. As a result, vehicles
             parked on-street along the east side of H Street typically block this sidewalk.

             East Second Street ­ sidewalks ranging in width between 7 and 8 feet are provided along
             both sides of the roadway. Sidewalks are generally in fair condition with the exception of a
             new segment of sidewalk that appeared to be recently constructed along the south side of the
             roadway.

         As is common in urban settings, the effective widths of the above sidewalks are narrowed due to
         the presence of light posts, fire hydrants, sign posts, and other obstacles located along the sidewalk
         path.

         The existing AM and PM peak hour pedestrian volumes at study area intersections are shown in
         Figure 5-6. As shown, pedestrian volumes are generally low throughout the study area.

         5.2.8    Existing Bicycle Conditions
         D Street, Summer Street, East First Street, and West First Street are all classified as suitable for
         "intermediate" cyclists according to the 2010 Bike Routes of Boston Map. The Project site is also
         located within approximately one-half mile of the Boston Harborwalk and within one-mile of the
         South Bay Harbor trail, which are recreational pathways for the exclusive use of cyclists and
         pedestrians. In the Project area, the Harborwalk has two branches, one following the shoreline
         from Fan Pier south to Old Harbor Reservation, and another that follows the east side of Fort Point
         Channel south to South Bay Park. The South Bay Harbor Trail begins at Fan Pier and runs south
         along the east side of Fort Point Channel to South Bay Park. This trail terminates at the MBTA
         Orange Line Ruggles Station and provides a connection to the Pierre Lallement Bicycle Trail,
         which runs down the Southwest Corridor.

         In July 2011, the City of Boston launched Hubway, a bicycle sharing program. Hubway hosts 600
         bicycles at 60 different locations across the city. As part of this program, cyclists are able to rent a
         bicycle from one location and return it to any other station, facilitating point-to-point travel within
         the City. These bicycle facilities are available to the public all year except during the winter. The
         closest Hubway station is located approximately one mile from the Project site at Proctor and
         Gamble on Dorchester Avenue.

         Bicycle volumes during the weekday AM and PM peak hour are illustrated in Figure 5-7; bicycle
         volumes in the study area are generally low. No bicycle racks are currently provided on-site.

         5.2.9   Existing Loading and Service
         Loading and service activity associated with the existing building is minimal.

5.3      Evaluation of Long-term Impacts
This section describes and evaluates the 2016 No-Build and Build Conditions. The methodology is in
keeping with the City of Boston's Transportation Access Guidelines (2001).

         5.3.1   No Build Conditions
         Background Traffic Growth
         No-Build traffic conditions are independent of the proposed Project and include all existing traffic
         and any new traffic resulting from both general background growth and any identified
         development projects in the area.

         Two procedures are generally used in combination to determine background traffic growth. The
         first procedure is to estimate traffic generated by planned new major developments and anticipated
         roadway changes. In collaboration with the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) and BTD
         staff, the study team identified 11 development projects in the area that are anticipated to be
         constructed within the five-year planning horizon. The study team developed a unique vehicular
         trip distribution pattern for each of the 11 projects based on the CA/T model overall trip
         distribution patterns, BTD origin ­ destination data for Area 13, and knowledge of the local
         transportation network. Vehicle trips associated with these projects were then assigned to the
         study area intersections using their respective distributions. The projects for which traffic
         volumes were added specifically to the network include the following and are illustrated in Figure
         5-8:

             49 ­ 63 Melcher Street ­ The project includes the conversion of 49 and 51 Melcher Street
             into approximately 185,000 sf of office space and the conversion of 61 Melcher Street into 38
             residential units.

             319 A Street Rear ­ The project includes the redevelopment of the existing 319A Street Rear
             building and construction of a new building containing approximately 202 residential units.

             371-401 D Street Residences ­ The project includes the construction of 585 residential units
             in four new buildings.

             Boston Cargo Terminal ­ The Boston Cargo Terminal is a proposed waterfront project that
             calls for creation of an approximately 510,552 sf intermodal freight facility on the North Jetty
             site, north of FID Kennedy Street. Access will be from Tide Street.

             Channel Center Phases 3 ­ Phase 3 of the project includes the construction of 75,000 square
             feet of office space, 25,000 sf of research and development space, 39 residential units, and
             5,130 sf of retail/commercial space.

             Fan Pier, Phase 1 (Parcel F) ­ This project includes the construction of a new approximately
             493,000 sf office building. Access is from Old Northern Avenue.

             Fan Pier, Vertex ­ This project includes the construction of a new approximately 1,000,000
             sf office building that will be occupied by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.

             Pier 4, Phase 1 ­ the first phase of this mixed-use project will include the construction of 383
             residential units.

             Seaport Square, Parcels A, B, C, K, and Q ­ This project includes the development of
             approximately 1,400,000 sf of development, including 483,700 sf of retail, 842,700 sf of
             residential space, 106,500 sf of hotel and 1,900 sf of cultural space.

             USPS General Mail Facility ­ This project includes the construction of approximately
             211,000 sf of office space and 480,000 sf of manufacturing space.


2 H Street Residential Project                             72                              Expanded PNF
             Waterside Place, Phase 1 ­ Phase 1 of the project includes the construction of 236 residential
             units.

         Vehicle trips generated by the above projects were distributed to study area intersections using
         unique trip distributions patterns developed for each project based on BTD Area 13 origin­
         destination data.




2 H Street Residential Project                            73                               Expanded PNF

         The second is to apply a general growth rate to account other smaller planned/approved
         development projects and changes in demographics, auto usage, and auto ownership. Based on an
         assessment of historic traffic volume data, it was determined that traffic volumes in the study area
         have increased by approximately one percent per year since 2009. Therefore, this analysis
         assumes a general background growth rate of one percent per year; the growth rate was also
         discussed with, and agreed upon by, BRA and BTD staff.

         The resulting traffic volumes for the 2016 No-Build Conditions are shown in Figure 5-9 and
         Figure 5-10.

         Gray shading indicates a reduction in LOS from Existing Conditions.

         Under 2016 No-Build Conditions, all of the study area intersections will continue to operate at the
         same LOS as under 2011 Existing Conditions, with the following exceptions:

              West First Street/D Street ­ during the AM peak hour, the overall LOS decreases just beyond
              the threshold of LOS C to LOS D as a result of an increase in delay of less than four seconds.
              The D Street southbound left-turn lane also decreases from LOS E to LOS F in the AM peak
              hour primarily due to an increase in left turn volume (from 116 to 181 vehicles per hour)
              associated with planned area development projects. In the PM peak hour, the D Street
              southbound left-turn lane decreases from LOS C to LOS D, also due to an increase in left-turn
              volume (from 275 to 410 vehicles per hour) associated with planned area development
              projects.

              Summer Street/East First Street ­ during the AM peak hour, the East First Street eastbound
              approach decreases from LOS E to LOS F as a result of an increase of delay of less than four
              seconds, pushing it just beyond the threshold; the East First Street westbound left-turn
              movement decreases from LOS A to LOS B; and the Summer Street northbound approach
              decreases from LOS C to LOS D. In the PM peak hour, overall LOS decreases from LOS B

              to LOS C, and the Summer Street southbound shared thru/right-turn lane decreases from LOS
              B to LOS C. These reductions in level of service are a result of the introduction of additional
              traffic from other planned area development projects as well as the general background
              growth rate.

         5.3.2     Build Conditions
         As summarized in Section 5.1.1 Project Description, the Project will result in construction of
         approximately 118 residential units and 206 parking spaces. The proposed site access and
         circulation plan is illustrated in Figure 5-11.

         Site Access and Circulation
         The Project will simplify and improve vehicular access to the site by reducing the number of curb
         cuts, which will create additional, and/or formalize existing, on-street parking. Currently,
         vehicular access to the existing site is not well defined. Primary access points are provided on H
         Street and a large curb cut on the corner of East First Street and Vicksburg Street; however, there
         are numerous other curb cuts and gates within the existing chain link fence. Several of the
         existing gates do not appear to be used and are blocked by equipment stored on-site; as a result
         vehicles generally park on-street in front of these gates. Similarly, no curb is provided along the
         east side of East First Street adjacent to the site making it difficult for motorists to identify access
         points to the site. Vehicular access to and egress to the Project's parking garage will be provided
         via separate entrance and exit driveways on East Second Street. All other existing vehicular
         access points will be closed. Primary pedestrian access to the residential lobby will be provided
         on East Second Street.

         Trip Generation and Mode Split
         Trip generation for the proposed residential and retail uses was derived from the Institute of
         Transportation Engineers' (ITE) publication Trip Generation (8th edition, 2008), using the
         following Land Use Codes (LUC):

         LUC 223 ­ Mid-Rise Apartment ­ are rental dwelling units located within the same building with
         between three and 10 floors. This LUC was chosen as the closest match to that of the proposed
         residential use; however, trip generation data for this LUC is only available for the AM and PM
         peak hour. Therefore, the daily trip generation was estimated using data for LUC 222 ­ High-Rise
         Apartment, since it was the next closest match. The fitted curve equations were used to estimate
         person trips associated with the residential use during all time periods.

         BTD publishes transit, walk/bike, and vehicle mode split rates for different areas of Boston; the
         Project is located within designated Area 13. Mode split assumptions based on BTD's Area 13
         data and local vehicle occupancy rates from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey and the
         2000 U.S. Census are summarized in Table 5-7.

                  (High-Rise Apartment) and LUC-223 (Mid-Rise Apartment).

         As show in Table 5-8, the Project is expected to generate only approximately 14 vehicle trips
         during the AM peak hour (6 trips in and 8 trips out) and 19 vehicle trips during the PM peak hour
         (10 trips in and 9 trips out) ­ this corresponds to just one new vehicle trip every three to four
         minutes on the adjacent roadway network.

         The trip generation of the proposed Project was also compared to that of the existing as-of-right
         use on site, an approximately 20,000 sf building used for the repair and storage of construction
         equipment. The vehicle trips generated by this use are currently on the roadway network and
         reflected within the existing traffic counts at study area intersections. Table 5-9 compares the
         vehicle trip generation associated with the proposed residential Project with that of the existing
         building.

         As shown Table 5-9, when compared to the existing as-of-right use, the proposed Project will
         generate only 8 additional vehicle trips (1 additional trip in and 7 additional trips out) during the
         AM peak hour and 13 additional vehicle trips (9 additional trips in and 4 additional trips out)
         during the PM peak hour. To provide a conservative estimate, no credit was taken for the vehicle
         trips associated with the existing use on site.

         Trip Distribution
         The vehicular trip distribution was developed using origin­destination data from BTD for Area 13
         and knowledge of the local roadway network. The resulting trip distribution is shown in Figure 5-
         12. The Project-generated vehicle trips were then assigned to the study area intersections
         according to the distribution and are illustrated in and Figure 5-13.

         Figure 5-14 and Figure 5-15 show the 2016 Build AM and PM peak-hour traffic volumes,
         accounting for background growth rate, anticipated development by others, and Project-generated
         trips.

         Gray shading indicates a reduction in LOS from No-Build Conditions.

         With the addition of the small number of new vehicle trips added by the Project, all study area
         intersections will continue to operate with the same level of service as under No-Build Conditions
         and no adverse impacts will occur. The Project will generate less than 20 new vehicle trips during
         each of the weekday commuter peak hours, equivalent to less than one new vehicle trip every
         three minutes or more. This is a negligible amount of new traffic and well within the daily
         fluctuations of normal traffic flow.

         Build Conditions Parking Supply
         The Project will provide 206 parking spaces, for the 118 residential units (63 one-bedroom units
         and 55 two-bedroom units), within an at-grade parking garage located beneath the residential
         building. The proposed parking supply corresponds to a parking ratio of approximately 1.75



2 H Street Residential Project                                    90                                     Expanded PNF
         spaces per unit, slightly higher than BTD maximum parking guidelines for the South Boston
         Waterfront area (1.0 to 1.5 spaces per unit), as applied to Article 80 projects.

         Build Conditions Public Transportation
         As shown in Table 5-8, the Project will add 138 daily transit trips; with 8 transit trips (6 boarding
         and 2 alighting) during the AM peak hour and 10 new trips (3 boarding and 7 alighting) during the
         PM peak hour. The small increase in project-generated transit trips is not expected to adversely
         affect transit services in the study area. Detailed trip generation calculations are provided in
         Appendix C.

         The Proponent is committed to promoting transit use among Project residents and visitors, as
         discussed in the Transportation Demand Management section below.

         Build Conditions Pedestrian and Bicycle Trip Generation
         On a daily basis, the Project will generate an estimated 246 new pedestrian and bicycle trips and
         an additional 138 new transit trips that will require a walk, or bicycle trip to or from the site. This
         results in a total of 384 new pedestrian or bicycle trips per day. Approximately 15 pedestrian or
         bicycle trips in and out of the site will occur during the AM peak hour, and 21 pedestrian or
         bicycle trips in and out will occur during the PM peak hour, plus 8 and 10 transit trips,
         respectively. This results in approximately one additional pedestrian trip every two to three
         minutes during the AM and PM peak hours. Pedestrian and bicycle trip generation is summarized
         in Table 5-8, with detailed trip generation data provided in Appendix C.

         The Proponent is committed to promoting bicycle use among Project residents and visitors, as
         discussed under the Transportation Demand Management section below.

         Build Bicycle Accommodations
         Secure bicycle storage will be made available for building residents within the parking area and/or
         within dedicated storage areas within the proposed building per City of Boston Bicycle Parking
         Guidelines, which require a minimum of one bicycle parking space per residential unit. The
         Proposed design currently calls for a dedicated bike room as well as additional secure bike storage
         areas within the parking garage. Additional racks for workers and guests will also be provided
         near main entrances to the new building.

         All bicycle racks, signs, and parking areas will conform to BTD standards and be sited in safe,
         secure locations. The Proponent will work with BTD to identify the most appropriate quantity and
         location for bicycle racks on the Project Site as part of the Transportation Access Plan Agreement
         (TAPA) process.

         Build Conditions Loading and Service
         Given the residential nature of the project, loading and service activity is expected to be minimal.
         Based on loading and service survey data collected by Howard/Stein- Hudson Associates at
         Tremont-on-the-Common, it is estimated that the proposed residential project will generate
         approximately 0.04 deliveries per day per 1,000 sf of residential use ­ or between 4 and 6
         service/loading vehicles per day assuming an approximately 133,000 sf building. Residential
         service/loading activities generally occur between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

         Most residential deliveries are made in smaller vehicles--cars, vans, or small panel trucks.
         Deliveries in this size of vehicle will be made within the surface parking area. Residential move-
         in/move-out may require a temporary on-street parking permit from the City (for large vehicles)
         and will be coordinated, and scheduled during off-peak periods where possible, by building
         management. Trash will be stored in a designated room within a building and serviced curb-side
         on pick-up days, as necessary.

         Evaluation of Short-term Construction Impacts


2 H Street Residential Project                              91                                Expanded PNF
         Details of the overall construction schedule, working hours, number of construction workers,
         worker transportation, and parking, number of construction vehicles, and routes will be addressed
         in detail in a Construction Management Plan (CMP) to be filed with BTD in accordance with the
         City's transportation maintenance plan requirements. The CMP will also address the need for
         pedestrian detours, lane closures, and/or parking restrictions, if necessary, to accommodate a safe
         and secure work zone.

         To minimize transportation impacts during the construction period, the following measures will be
         incorporated into the CMP:

             Construction workers will be encouraged to use public transportation and/or carpool;
             A subsidy for MBTA passes will be considered for full-time employees; and
             Secure spaces will be provided on-site for workers' supplies and tools so they do not have to
             be brought to the site each day.

         Transportation Demand Management
         The Proponent is committed to implementing Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
         measures that support the City's efforts to reduce dependency on the automobile by encouraging
         travelers to use alternatives to driving alone, especially during peak periods. TDM will be
         facilitated by the Project's proximity to public transit. The Proponent will emphasize the site's
         convenient transit and pedestrian access in marketing the Project to future residents. On-site
         management will provide transit information (schedules, maps, fare information) in the building
         lobbies for residents and visitors. Additional TDM measures may include, but are not limited to,
         the following:

             Bicycle Storage ­ The Project Proponent will provide secure bicycle storage available to
             residents and visitors. The Proposed design currently calls for a dedicated bike room as well
             as additional secure bike storage areas within the parking garage.

             Electric Vehicle Charging ­ The Proponent will explore the feasibility of providing electric
             vehicle charging stations on-site.

             Project Web Site ­ Inclusion of public transportation information for residents and visitors on
             the Project's Web Site.

             Tenant and Employee Orientation Packet ­ These packets will provide all new tenants with
             information concerning available TDM programs and public transportation in the area,
             including route maps, schedules, and fare information.

             Transportation Coordinator ­ An on-site transportation coordinator will oversee
             transportation issues, including parking, residential move-in and move-out, and service and
             loading. The transportation coordinator will also work with residents as they move in to raise
             awareness of public transportation alternatives.

6.0      INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS COMPONENT

6.1      Introduction

The following analysis describes the existing utility systems servicing the Project area, discusses any
probable impacts that the Proposed Project may have on the utilities, and identifies mitigation measures to
address potential impacts of the Proposed Project.

The Proponent has initiated contact with those responsible for the area's utility systems, including the
Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) to understand and evaluate each system and design the
Proposed Project to prevent disruption of utility services. A BWSC Site Plan and General Service
Application is required for the proposed new water, sewer and drain connections. In addition, a Pollution
Prevention Plan will be submitted specifying best management measures for protecting the BWSC drainage
system during construction. A Drainage Discharge permit will also be required prior to discharge of any
construction dewatering.

Meetings will be scheduled as necessary during building design and permitting processes. Updated design
information on the proposed utility connections, as appropriate, will be provided as the project plans
develop. Sewer, water, storm drainage, and electric utilities are discussed below.

6.2      Sanitary Sewer System

         6.2.1    Existing Sewer System

         The BWSC owns, operates and maintains the sewer system in the vicinity of the overall Project
         Site. 2 H Street is presently served by a 36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain line in H Street and a
         36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain line in East First Street which flow in a southerly direction
         from the Project Site. These combined sewer/drain lines connect to a 36 x 48-inch combined
         sewer/drain line in East Second Street that flows in a westerly direction from the Project Site (see
         Figure 6-1). The sanitary sewage system ultimately connects to the MWRA system where it is
         treated at the MWRA Deer Island Treatment Plant.

         6.2.2    Project-Generated Sewage Flow

         The Proposed Project's sanitary sewage system will connect to the area's existing BWSC sanitary
         sewage system. The Proposed Project will generate an estimated flow in gallons per day (gpd) as
         calculated below. This calculation was based on 314 CMR 7.15 (Sewer System Connection and
         Extension Permit Program), which provides design flow parameters for various building uses.

         Table 6-1         Estimated Daily Sewage Discharges

                                      Estimated Daily Sewage Discharges
            Type of Unit         # Units     # Bedrooms          Sewage Generation (gpd)
             1 Bedroom             88             1                      9,680
             2 Bedroom             47             2                      10,340
                                                  TOTAL                  20,020

         6.2.3    Sanitary Sewage Connection

         Sanitary sewage connections from the project sites will be made to the existing combined sewers
         in East Second and East First Street which currently service those areas. A Massachusetts
         Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Sewer Connection Permit will not be required for
         any of these sites since the calculated sewage flow is below 50,000 gpd. In order to obtain service
         approval, the Proponent will submit a General Service Application and Site Plan to the BWSC for
         review and approval.

2 H Street Residential Project                             93                              Expanded PNF
         6.2.4    Sewer System Mitigation

         To help conserve water and reduce the amount of wastewater generated by the Proposed Project,
         the landscaping will be designed to not require permanent irrigation systems. An additional
         reduction to 30% will be achieved with 1.28 gallon per flush toilets, 1.0 gallon per minute
         lavatories and 1.75 gallon per minute showers. Additionally, the sewage collection system will be
         constructed and operated in compliance will all applicable regulations.

6.3      Water System

         6.3.1    Existing Water Service

         The BWSC provides water service to the City of Boston through a well-developed network of
         pipes which is supplied by the MWRA transmission system. There are three existing water mains
         in the vicinity of the Project Site. There is a 16-inch low service main in East First Street and a 12-
         inch low service main in H Street. Service to the Project Site will most likely come from the low
         service main in H Street.

         6.3.2    Project Generated Water Demand

         Water demand generated by the Project has been estimated based on the projected sewage
         generation, and adding 10% to account for system losses and consumption. The heating and
         cooling systems for the building have not yet been designed; however, air conditioning make-up
         water requirements are anticipated to be minimal. The projected water demand for the Project is
         therefore 110% X 20,020 gpd = 22,022 gpd.

         Based on conversations with BWSC, the Proponent's civil engineer is confident that the existing
         water distribution system can provide the required flow to the proposed Project.

         6.3.3    Proposed Water Service

         Domestic water and fire service will be provided from the existing 12-inch low service water main
         in H Street.

         Discussions with BWSC have indicated more than adequate capacity in the water supply system to
         serve the Proposed Project. Flow tests will be performed for final design of the proposed building
         fire suppression system during the detailed design phases.

         Water service to the building will be metered in accordance with the Commission's Site Plan
         Requirements. The Project Proponent will provide for the connection of the meter to the
         Commission's automatic meter reading system consistent with current BWSC policy. Backflow
         prevention devices will be installed on all fire services where required to protect from cross-
         connection hazards. Water supply systems servicing the Project will be gated so as to minimize
         public hazard or inconvenience in the event of a water main break. The Proponent will also
         submit a General Service Application and Site Plan to the BWSC for review and approval.

         6.3.4    Water Supply System Mitigation

         The State Building Code requires the use of water conserving fixtures. Water conservation
         measures such as low flow water closets and restricted flow shower heads will help reduce the
         domestic water demand on the existing distribution system. These systems will be installed
         consistent with the code requirements.

6.4      Storm Drainage System

         6.4.1    Existing Storm Drainage System

         Storm drainage for the Project Site is provided by an existing 36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain
         line in East First Street and a 36 x 48-inch combined sewer/drain line in H Street which flow in a
         southerly direction from the Project Site. These combined sewer/drain lines connect to a 36 x 48-
         inch combined sewer/drain line in East Second Street that flows in a westerly direction from the
         Project Site (see Figure 6-1).

         6.4.2    Proposed Storm Drainage

         The overall Project site consists mostly of impervious surfaces, with some areas of planting, and
         the proposed building redevelopment is not expected to result in any significant increase in runoff
         from the overall Project Site. The Existing conditions of the project sites do not currently provide
         any meaningful recharge of runoff. The Site will be evaluated during the detailed design phase of
         the project. The Site will have connections to the existing combined sewer in East First and H
         Street.

         Any new drainage structures on the overall Project Site will be fitted with standard BWSC Type 5
         catch basin. These basins are fitted with sediment sumps and oil/gas traps. Existing structures to
         remain will be cleaned of debris and retrofitted with oil/gas traps where not already existing.
         Oil/gas traps will be permitted through BWSC and MWRA. If not already in place, BWSC
         plaques will be installed at storm drains that bear the warning "Don't Dump ­ Drains to Boston
         Harbor".

         Any sewer and drain connections that are terminated will be cut and capped in accordance with
         BWSC standards. The Proponent will also submit a General Service Application and Site Plan to
         the BWSC for review and approval.

         6.4.3    Mass DEP Stormwater Management Policy Standards

         In February of 2008, the Mass DEP revised their Stormwater Management Standards to better
         address water quality and water quantity issues associated with project sites. The revisions
         promote increased stormwater recharge, treatment of more runoff from polluting land uses, low
         impact development (LID) techniques, pollution prevention, the removal of illicit discharges, and
         improved operation and maintenance of stormwater best management practices (BMPs).

         A brief explanation of each Standard and the system compliance is provided below:

         Standard #1: No new stormwater conveyances (e.g., outfalls) may discharge untreated
         stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or waters of the Commonwealth.

         Compliance: The proposed design will comply with this Standard. No new untreated stormwater
         will be directly discharged to, nor will erosion be caused to wetlands or waters of the
         Commonwealth as a result of stormwater discharges related to the proposed Project.


         Standard #2: Stormwater management systems must be designed so that post-development
         peak discharge rates do not exceed pre-development peak discharge rates.

         Compliance: The proposed design will not increase the impervious area compared to the
         pre-development condition. Therefore, there will be no detention system needed to
         mitigate the peak rate of runoff from the site.

         Standard #3: Loss of annual recharge to ground water shall be eliminated or minimized through
         the use of infiltration measures including environmentally sensitive site design, low impact
         development techniques, stormwater best management practices, and good operation and
         maintenance. At a minimum, the annual recharge from the post development site shall
         approximate the annual recharge from pre-development conditions based on soil type. This
         Standard is met when the stormwater management system is designed to infiltrate the required
         recharge volume as determined in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook.

         Compliance: The Project will meet and exceed this standard by complying with the Boston
         Redevelopment Authority's requirement of recharging 1-inch of stormwater over the entire
         new impervious area.

         Standard #4: Stormwater management systems shall be designed to remove 80% of the average
         annual post-construction load of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). This standard is met when:
         a) Suitable practices for source control and pollution prevention are identified in a long-term
         pollution prevention plan, and thereafter are implemented and maintained;
         b) Structural stormwater best management practices are sized to capture the required water quality
         volume as determined in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook; and
         c) Pretreatment is provided in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook.

         Compliance: The Project will meet or exceed all standards.

         Standard #5: For land uses with higher potential pollutant loads, source control and pollution
         prevention shall be implemented in accordance with the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook to
         eliminate or reduce the discharge of stormwater runoff from such land uses to the maximum extent
         practicable. If through source control and/or pollution prevention, all land uses with potential
         pollutant loads cannot be completely protected from exposure to rain, snow, snow melt and
         stormwater runoff, the proponent shall use the specific structural stormwater BMPs determined by
         the Department to be suitable for such uses as provided in the Massachusetts Stormwater
         Handbook. Stormwater discharges from land uses with higher potential pollutant loads shall also
         comply with the requirements of the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, M.G.L. c. 21, §§ 26-53 and
         the regulations promulgated thereunder at 314 CMR 3.00, 314 CMR 4.00 and 314 CMR 5.00.

         Compliance: The Project is not associated with Higher Potential Pollutant Loads (per the Policy,
         Volume I, page 1-8). This Project complies with this standard.

         Standard #6: Stormwater discharges within the Zone II or Interim Wellhead Protection Area of a
         public water supply and stormwater discharges near or to any other critical area require the use of
         the specific source control and pollution prevention measures and the specific structural
         stormwater best management practices determined by the Department to be suitable for managing
         discharges to such areas as provided in the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook. A discharge is
         near a critical area if there is a strong likelihood of a significant impact occurring to said area,
         taking into account site specific factors. Stormwater discharges to Outstanding Resource Waters
         and Special Resource Waters shall be removed and set back from the receiving water or wetland
         and receive the highest and best practical method of treatment. A "storm water discharge" as
         defined in 314 CMR 3.04(2)(a)1 or (b) to an Outstanding Resource Water or Special Resource
         Water shall comply with 314 CMR 3.00 and 314 CMR 4.00.5 Stormwater discharges to a Zone I
         or Zone A are prohibited unless essential to the operation of the public water supply.

         Compliance: The Project will not discharge untreated stormwater to a sensitive area or any
         other area.

         Standard #7: A redevelopment project is required to meet the following Stormwater Management
         Standards only to the maximum extent practicable: Standard 2, Standard 3, and the pretreatment
         and structural stormwater best management practice requirements of Standards 4, 5, and 6.
         Existing stormwater discharges shall comply with Standard 1 only to the maximum extent

         practicable. A redevelopment project shall also comply with all other requirements of the
         Stormwater Management Standards and improve existing conditions.

         Compliance: The Project will meet or exceed all standards.

         Standard #8: A plan to control construction related impacts, including erosion, sedimentation, and
         other pollutant sources during construction and land disturbance activities (construction period
         erosion, sedimentation, and pollution prevention plan) shall be developed and implemented.

         Compliance: The Project will comply with this standard. Sedimentation and erosion
         controls will be incorporated as part of the design of this Project and employed during site
         construction.

         Standard #9: A long Term Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Plan shall be developed and
         implemented to ensure that stormwater management systems function as designed.

         Compliance: A long Term Operations and Maintenance Plan shall be developed and
         maintained for this Project.

6.5      Electric Systems

         6.5.1 Existing Electric Systems

         NSTAR provides electric service within the City of Boston. It is anticipated there are existing
         electric lines along East Second Street. In addition, existing street light conduits and streetlights
         are owned, operated and maintained by the Boston Public Works Department, Street Lighting
         Division. The Proponent will coordinate any modifications to the street light system with the
         Boston Public Works Department.

         6.5.2 Proposed Electric Connections

         The electrical space heating and energy systems for the proposed project have not yet been
         designed, however, it is expected that the project will require service consistent with housing units
         of this size and will not impose any excessive load burden on the existing available electrical
         system. In addition, appropriate energy-saving measures will be incorporated into the building
         design and construction.

6.6      Telephone Systems

Verizon New England provides telephone service to the Project area and the Project Site. Telephone
service is provided to the Project Site via overhead wires. It is expected that the Project will require service
consistent with housing units of this size and will not impose any excessive load burden on the existing
system.

6.7      Cable Systems

Comcast and RCN provide cable service in this area and it is anticipated to be available for the Project Site.
The Project will not impose any excessive load burden on the existing system. Any upgrades required to
the service will be coordinated with the service provider.

         National Grid provides natural gas service in the project area. Discussions with National Grid
         Energy Delivery will occur during the detailed design phase to confirm that there is adequate
         natural gas for this project.

         6.9.2 Proposed Natural Gas Connections

         The space heating system for the Proposed Project has not yet been designed. However, it is not
         expected that the Project would require excessive amounts of gas. In addition, energy-saving
         measures will be incorporated into the building design and construction.

6.10     Utility Protection During Construction

During construction, infrastructure will be protected using sheeting and shoring, temporary relocations, and
construction staging as required. The contractor will be required to coordinate all protection measures,
temporary supports, and temporary shutdowns of all utilities with the appropriate utility owners and/or
agencies. The contractor will also be required to provide adequate notification to the utility owner prior to
any work commencing on their utility. Also, in the event a utility cannot be maintained in service during
switchover to a temporary or permanent system, the contractor will be required to coordinate the shutdown
with the utility owners and Project abusers to minimize impacts and inconveniences accordingly.

Re:     Letter of Intent (LOI) to File Expanded Project Notification Form (PNF)
        Article 80-Large Project Review
        2 H Street, South Boston, MA

Dear Mr. Meade,

I am writing to notify the Boston Redevelopment Authority of the intent of H Street Partners LLC to file
an Expanded Project Notification Form ("PNF") with the BRA under Article 80-Large Project Review
requirements of the Boston Zoning Code. The proposal is for a multi-family residential development
with 135 residential units and a small 1,600 square foot retail space with associated garage parking for
206 spaces to serve these uses (the "Project").

The site sits on approximately 66,313 square feet of land (one parcel) at 2 H Street in the South Boston
neighborhood of Boston. The Project Site is located within 1.0 mile of the Broadway and Andrew MBTA
Stations and within 1/2 mile to the center of the Boston Harbor beaches. The existing use as a warehouse
and storage yard will be demolished in order to make space for the new three story multi-family
residential building.

The Project site is located within the First Street Neighborhood Development Area (NDA) of South
Boston, per Article 68 Section 39 Table B, and will be built as-of-right. The Project will meet the zoning
dimensional requirements of the Boston Zoning Code (Article 68 and Table E) and we will not be looking
for any variances or conditional uses.

The Proponent will commence "Large Project Review" under Article 80 of the Code with the
simultaneous filing of a Letter of Intent and Expanded Project Notification Form (PNF). The project
proponent has outreached to City agencies, neighborhood representatives and groups, elected officials,
and other interested parties over the past several months with respect to the Project. The principals of H
Street Partners LLC have attended and participated in the East & West Street Planning and Zoning over
the last 24 months and look forward to continuing their collaboration throughout the Article 80 review
process.

We look forward to continuing to meet with you and your staff in the coming weeks on what we feel is a
beneficial project to the South Boston neighborhood and meets the new zoning requirements implemented
recently during the East & West Street Planning and Zoning process.

Sincerely,
H Street Partners LLC

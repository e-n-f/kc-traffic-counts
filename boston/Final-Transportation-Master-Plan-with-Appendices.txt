Executive Summary
This Transportation Master Plan is a companion document to Boston University's 2012 ­ 2022
Institutional Master (IMP) for the Charles River Campus. The Transportation Master Plan
provides a comprehensive analysis and inventory of the current transportation conditions and
characteristics at the University's Charles River Campus. The Master Plan also provides
projections on what the future transportation conditions may be at the end of the Master Plan
period. The previous Transportation Master Plan was for the period of 2003 ­ 2010, and was
extended from 2010 to 2012. This Master Plan builds upon that foundation and examines many
of the same aspects that were considered in the previous Master Plan.

The following Master Plan also evaluates the topics that were outlined by the Boston
Transportation Department, The Boston Environmental Department and the Boston
Redevelopment Authority in the comment letters or scoping documents related to the IMP
Notification Form (IMPNF) filed by Boston University. In addition, this Master Plan describes
the transportation goals that the University will strive to meet over the course of this Master Plan
period, and the policies and programs the University intends to implement in order to realize the
goals.

Following is an overview of the current transportation system serving the campus, the basic
characteristics of the Charles River Campus and their influence on transportation, and an analysis
of how proposed institutional projects could impact the transport infrastructure in the future.

Transportation Goals
During the course of its past two institutional master plans, Boston University has implemented
changes to its own infrastructure and policies and has been a leading supporter and financial
partner with the city and state to improve the safety and efficiency of the area's public
transportation infrastructure. The University's role in projects such as the Kenmore Square
improvements and the Commonwealth Avenue Phase I and Phase II improvements is strong
evidence of its commitment to enhancing the area's transportation system. These projects
benefited both the University and its neighbors in Boston, Brookline, and Cambridge.

The University has identified three transportation goals for the forthcoming decade that will
shape its policies and programs. These goals and the actions or strategies that the University may
employ to achieve each of them are summarized below. Specific areas of focus or concern that
the University intends to address are also identified.

    · Campus-wide parking management plan


Campus Demographic Characteristics
Enrollment. Boston University has approximately 15,600 undergraduate students; the most
recent incoming freshman class (2011) included 4,025 students. The University projects that
enrollment will stabilize at an estimated 15,500 students with incoming freshman classes of
approximately 3,800 students.

Housing. Some 76 percent of undergraduates are housed on campus. The University's
projections indicate that 75 percent of students will reside on campus in the future.

Employment. The University employs approximately 5,400 full-time faculty, professional staff,
and tradespeople at the Charles River Campus. An additional 1,225 people (primarily faculty)
are employed on a part-time basis. Future employment at the campus is not expected to change

significantly in the future (i.e., employment levels will be stable or have a modest amount of
growth).

Campus Commuting Characteristics
Travel Modes. The most recent statistics collect by the University (December 2010) indicate
that around 44 percent of those who commute to the Charles River Campus (employees and
students) do so in single occupancy vehicles, while 31.5 percent arrive by public transportation.
Other modes used by commuters to the campus include walking (13.5 percent), cycling (6
percent), car or van pools (2.3 percent), and other miscellaneous modes (2.5 percent).

Traffic Distribution. Based on a review of existing traffic data in relation to the local roadway
network, it is estimated that about 37 percent of the campus's traffic is oriented to/from the east
of campus, 26 percent to the north/northwest, 19 percent to the west and 18 percent toward the
south.

Existing Transportation System
The transportation system serving the Charles River Campus comprises several components: the
local roadway network (with Commonwealth Avenue as the primary urban artery serving the
entire length of the campus); the pedestrian network of sidewalks and walkways; bicycle lanes
on Commonwealth Avenue and Beacon Street; the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
(MBTA); and the University-operated shuttle bus service (the BUS). Other important elements
include Boston University owned and operated parking facilities (and the parking policies
administered by the University to regulate the use of its facilities), on-street public parking in the
area, and on-campus bicycle storage installed and maintained by the University.

Traffic Volumes. The long-term traffic volume trend along Commonwealth Avenue and
adjacent streets has been downward since 1987. Daily volumes west of the BU Bridge are
approximately 17 to 18 percent lower in 2012 than in 1987. East of the BU Bridge, 2012 daily
traffic volumes are lower than 2001 volumes by 18 to 32 percent, depending upon the location.
On Bay State Road, daily volumes are down nearly 23 percent during this same time period.
Peak hour traffic is also down throughout the campus: since the 2003 Master Plan (2002 data),
peak hour traffic has decreased between 9 percent and 25 percent.

Traffic Operations. During peak periods on a typical weekday, the roadway network in the
vicinity of the Boston University campus functions reasonably well. Most of the intersections
with traffic signals along Commonwealth Avenue function at LOS D (overall) or better during
both the morning and afternoon peaks. The exception is the intersection at Kenmore Square,
which functions at LOS E (at capacity) during the afternoon peak. (Level of service [LOS] is a
measure used by traffic engineers to determine the effectiveness of elements of transportation
infrastructure. LOS standards use the letters A through F, with A being the best and F being the
worst).




Boston University Charles River Campus
Transportation Master Plan                                                                            4
Safety. Crash data from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) indicate
that none of the intersections in the area of the campus have crash rates that exceed the statewide
or district average rates. However, a limited review of available Boston Police Department
(BPD) crash data show that the MassDOT data underreport the actual number of crashes; it is
therefore likely that intersections such as Commonwealth Avenue/BU Bridge and Kenmore
Square would exceed the average rates if BPD data were considered.

Pedestrian Volumes. Safe pedestrian circulation is critically important for an urban campus,
and walking is the most popular mode of transportation on the Charles River Campus. Pedestrian
volumes are extremely high along Commonwealth Avenue and have continued to grow steadily
since pedestrian volumes were first measured in 1987. Since 2001/2002, pedestrian volumes
have increased by as much as 80 percent at the BU Bridge intersection (afternoon peak). This is a
result of the increased travel between West Campus and Central Campus; more students now live
in West Campus and travel to classes in Central Campus. Conversely, with the construction of
the Fitness & Recreation Center in 2004, many students who live in Central or East Campus now
walk to West Campus for recreation opportunities.

Pedestrian Facilities. Sidewalks are available along all public and private ways in the campus
area. An inventory of sidewalk conditions indicates that the sidewalks are of sufficient width to
accommodate the pedestrian demands in most areas. The physical conditions of the sidewalks are
generally good throughout the campus, with only a few areas where the conditions were
observed to be fair or poor.

Bicycle Volumes. Bicycling is the second most important mode of travel for students within the
campus, and use on campus is growing faster than any other mode. Bicycle use along
Commonwealth Avenue has grown by 47 percent in the morning peak and by 135 percent in the
afternoon peak since 2007 (the first year bicycle use was measured on Commonwealth Avenue).
Currently, between 500 and 600 bicyclists per hour use the bicycle lanes on Commonwealth
Avenue during the peak commuting periods.

Bicycle Storage. The increase in bicycle use has required the University to dramatically
increase bicycle storage on campus (bike racks and bike rooms). Since 2003, on-campus bike
storage capacity has been increased from 1,295 bikes to 3,930 bikes, a 205 percent increase

Public Transportation. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) has three
service modes with stops or stations within or near the University's Charles River Campus.
Those service modes are:

   ·   Green Line Trolley Service
   ·   Bus Service
   ·   Commuter Rail Service
Although the two service lines that run along Commonwealth Avenue (Green Line B Branch and
Route 57 bus) are crowded during peak periods, review of MBTA data indicates there is still
available capacity during the morning and afternoon peak periods. The University views the
MBTA's proposed improvements at the Yawkey Commuter Rail Station as having the potential
to reduce vehicle travel to the campus.

Boston University Shuttle. Boston University operates Boston University Shuttle (BUS), a
service that connects the Charles River Campus and the Boston University Medical Campus to
facilitate travel and collaboration for students and faculty at both campuses. The BUS service
was instituted in 2004. Because of its popularity with students, the BUS service has expanded to
operate six buses on 10-minute headways during peak periods Monday through Friday. To
satisfy the peak period demands, the University increased the hourly carrying capacity of the
service in 2011 by using larger articulated buses instead of standard city bus­type vehicles
during the those periods. Passenger data for the BUS collected in the fall of 2011 indicate that it
provides service to over 5,800 passengers per day, which translates to approximately 1.6 million
passenger trips per year.

On-Campus Parking Facilities. Boston University owns and operates nine major off-street
surface parking lots and four parking garages. In addition, the University regulates on-street
parking along several private alleyways and a variety of small miscellaneous off-street parking
areas located throughout the campus. In total, the University manages 3,709 parking spaces.

Parking Regulations and Policies. University-owned parking facilities are regulated by the
University through a parking permit program administered by Boston University Parking &
Transportation Services. The University issues two sets of permits, one to Boston University
faculty and staff and the other to students. The number of student permits is severely limited, and
students are strongly discouraged from bringing cars onto campus. In the 2011 Fall Semester, the
University issued only 205 permits to students for overnight parking and only 216 parking
permits for daytime commuters.
The University charges fees for the parking permits issued to employees or students. For the
2011­2012 academic year, the annual fee for daily employee commuters is $1,155. For the few
students who are allowed to bring a car onto campus and park overnight, permits are sold on a
semester basis and the fee for both the fall and spring semesters is $1,206.

Traffic Management for Special Events. The University has developed traffic and parking
management plans for a number of special events at the Charles River Campus. Some events are
annual occurrences such as "move-in/move-out periods" or Commencement; others occur more
frequently, such as spring and fall open houses, athletic events at the Track & Tennis Center, or
events at the Agganis Arena. A special events logistics plan was developed for the Agganis
Arena with input from the Boston Transportation Department (BTD) and BPD prior to the
opening of the venue in early 2005. Since then, the procedures have been refined through hands-
on experience to handle the various transportation issues associated with events as efficiently as
possible. The current version of the management plan works well, and the impact on adjacent
neighborhoods has been minimal.

Future Transportation System
The evaluation of how the University's proposed institutional projects may affect the future
transportation system at the Charles River Campus examined conditions at the end of the 10-year
Master Plan period (2022). The future analysis also considered the impact of public
infrastructure projects that are expected to be completed by 2022.



Boston University Charles River Campus
Transportation Master Plan                                                                        6
Institutional/Public Realm Projects. A total of nine institutional development projects and six
public realm projects were included in the Institutional Master Plan analysis of the year 2022.
The nine includes four previously approved projects that have not yet been constructed or on
which construction has not been completed. As the precise academic programming is not known
for many of the institutional projects for which planning has not started, or is very preliminary, a
campus-wide growth assumption was made to account for potential "new" commuting trips to
the Charles River Campus. For strictly analytical purposes, a 2.5 percent increase in employment
was assumed, although the University does expect employment levels to remain relatively stable
over the next 10 years

Roadway Network. The transportation infrastructure network in the vicinity of the Charles
River Campus is expected to undergo several changes over the period covered by this master
plan. The most dramatic changes are anticipated along Commonwealth Avenue, both west of the
BU Bridge (Commonwealth Avenue Phase 2A project) and at the BU Bridge/Essex
Street/Carleton Street/Mountfort Street/University Road nexus (Commonwealth Avenue Phase
2B). In total, six major public infrastructure projects are expected to occur in the next 10 years,
and the impact of these projects was taken into account in the Institutional Master Plan analysis..

Traffic Operations. Future traffic operations (in the year 2022) are forecast to be similar to
conditions in 2012. The University's institutional projects will not add an appreciable number of
vehicles to the area's roadways, even when using the current campus mode split to project future
traffic associated with the University. Congestion is expected to improve at the BU Bridge area
because of the Commonwealth Avenue Phase 2B project. Traffic safety is expected to be
enhanced along Commonwealth Avenue due to the Phase 2A improvements, particularly in the
westbound direction. Congestion is expected at Kenmore Square in the afternoon peak hour (not
unlike current conditions), but this congestion has as much to do with other developments in the
area as it does with Boston University. The University's Transportation Demand Management
(TDM) programs, which are expected to be expanded/enhanced over the life of this master plan,
are projected to reduce vehicle trips to the campus and congestion at Kenmore Square and along
the Commonwealth Avenue corridor.

Pedestrians. Boston University has made, and will continue to make, improvement of
pedestrian circulation and safety its foremost transportation priority. Indeed, the primary focus of
several Institutional Master Plan public realm projects is the improvement of the future
pedestrian environment. These projects include the Cummington Pedestrian Mall, Granby Street
to Silber Way pedestrian way, and sidewalk improvements on the north side of Commonwealth
Avenue between University Road and the BU Bridge.

The University is also committed to enhancing pedestrian circulation and safety at proposed
institutional development projects, such as the New Balance Field and the Admissions Reception
Center, where pedestrian roadway crossings will be shortened and physical features incorporated
into the designs of the crosswalk areas to improve pedestrian visibility and provide drivers with
visual alerts.

Finally, Boston University has partnered with BTD and MassDOT for the advancement of public
infrastructure projects, including the Commonwealth Avenue Phase 2A and 2B projects, which
will vastly improve pedestrian safety in the crosswalks at the BU Bridge and University Road

intersections (Phase 2B), as well as at each of the intersections between the BU Bridge and
Alcorn Street (Phase 2A).

Bicycles. The University has a strong appreciation of the importance of safe and convenient
bicycle facilities and is committed to working with the City of Boston and its own community to
ensure the continued improvement of the cycling environment. For its part, Boston University
will continue to incorporate an appropriate amount of bicycle storage into the design of each of
its proposed facilities, just as it has in the past decade. In addition, the University will work with
the BTD to identify opportunities to improve bicycle safety and circulation in the areas adjacent
to institutional project sites in a manner consistent with the city's Complete Streets approach to
enhancing the Boston's transportation network. A good example of this cooperative effort is the
bicycle accommodations that will be implemented along Babcock Street as part of the mitigation
for the proposed New Balance Field project.

Public Transportation. Use of public transportation as a means of commuting is critical to the
sustainability of the Charles River Campus over the life of this master plan. The most recent data
show that nearly one in three commuters travel to the campus via the MBTA, and boosting this
proportion over the next 10 years is one of Boston University's three primary transportation
goals. Converting auto trips to public transit trips helps to improve the environment and relieve
pressure on the future traffic infrastructure in the city and region.

The MBTA's plan to expand the nearby Yawkey Commuter Rail Station to a full-service station
provides an excellent opportunity to increase the use of commuter rail services by those living
west of Boston. Taking advantage of the new Yawkey Station is an important element in the
University's overall program to reduce vehicle trips to the Charles River Campus.

Boston University Shuttle (BUS). The University anticipates that the BUS will continue to be
an important part of its overall transportation strategy over the life of this Institutional Master
Plan, as it has been since 2004. It is difficult to predict ridership levels over the period covered
by this master plan, but ridership has historically increased during each year of operation and the
University does not expect this trend to change, although the rates of increase may not be as high
as in previous years. In the past, the University has added capacity to the service in order to
satisfy passenger demand and BUS usage will continue to be monitored and operational
refinements made if necessary. Potential enhancements include adding more capacity to the
service, modifying hours of operation, and changing routes or stop locations.

Parking. It is anticipated that the on-campus parking supply owned and operated by the
University will remain at approximately the same levels as today, and that these facilities will
continue to be regulated by a parking permit program administered by Parking & Transportation
Services. Boston University has determined that several of the proposed institutional projects
will impact the on-campus parking supply; three examples are the Admissions Reception Center
and the School of Law projects (-24 spaces combined) and the Granby Street to Silber Way
Pedestrian Way (-74 spaces).

In the short term, the vehicles that were using these spaces will need to shift to another on-
campus parking facility. There is available capacity within the University's parking system,
although users will likely find themselves parked at a less convenient location. In the longer

term, the potential reduction in the parking supply underscores the importance of reducing
commuter vehicle trips to campus.

The potential loss of parking will also require Transportation & Parking Services to be more
efficient and forceful in its management of the University's parking facilities. This may require
changes to the parking permit program to ensure that surrounding communities are not affected;
measures could include more aggressive permit fee increases, further limiting the ability of
students to bring vehicles on campus, or restricting the ability of employees to purchase parking
permits.

The most recent institutional projects developed by the University include little or no parking as
part of the project (e.g., East Campus Student Services Center and JHSV Phase II residence hall
at 33 Harry Agganis Way). In general, this development philosophy is expected to continue
throughout this master plan period. However, at sites where significant existing parking could be
lost, the University may include replacement parking in the project design. An example is the
development site located at 645­665 Commonwealth Avenue, where potential future academic
buildings could displace 126 existing parking spaces. The final determination on whether
parking is included at a site will be made as the building programs are advanced to a higher level
of design and through consultation with the city and the BU Task Force.
In addition to anticipated permanent impacts on parking, the University has identified temporary
impacts that will occur during project construction. The New Balance Field project is the best
example of this: During much of the project's construction period, the existing 361 parking
spaces at the site will not be available. Parking & Transportation Services has developed a
mitigation plan that will accommodate that parking demand elsewhere in the University's
system, minimizing impacts on the adjacent communities. A parking mitigation plan will be
developed for each institutional project, if applicable, and that plan would be reviewed with the
city and the BU Task Force.

Building Services. Consistent with city requirements, the designs of recently constructed
institutional projects have incorporated off-street service bays and loading docks. Institutional
projects constructed during the term of this master plan will also provide for off-street servicing.
Details of how loading and servicing will be accommodated at the proposed facilities will be
provided to the city and BU Task Force for review as the design of each proposed project is
advanced.

Mitigation/Measures to Achieve Transportation Goals
Boston University has developed three transportation objectives that seek to: (1) improve
pedestrian and bicycle safety and circulation on campus, (2) reduce the number of vehicle trips to
campus, and (3) minimize impacts on adjacent residential neighborhoods. The strategies
developed by the University to achieve transportation goals two and three serve as the basis for
the University's campus transportation mitigation program for the 2012­2022 Institutional
Master Plan. The mitigation program for the Charles River Campus has two basic components:

   ·   Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures / Sustainability Initiatives
   ·   Traffic and Parking Management for Special Events

Travel Demand Management/Sustainability. Boston University Parking & Transportation
Services has established a set of initiatives and programs with the goal of reducing the number of
vehicles on campus and increasing use of sustainable modes of transportation. Many of these
were instituted during the last master plan period and include:

   ·   Ride matching program for University employees (web-based car or van pool matching service)
   ·   MBTA pass program for University employees (pre-tax, payroll purchasing of MBTA passes)
   ·   Student MBTA semester pass program (discounted purchasing of MBTA passes)
   ·   Boston University Shuttle (BUS)
   ·   Bicycle facilities (safe and secure bike storage provided at all major BU facilities)
   ·   Bicycle safety programs (cosponsored by Boston University Police Department and Parking &
       Transportation Services)
   ·   Car-sharing (seven Zipcar vehicles are located within the campus and 15 more within short
       walking distance)
   ·   On-campus housing for undergraduates (approximately 75 percent of undergraduates are
       expected to be housed on campus)
In addition, there are several strategies employed by the University to manage parking supply
and demand on the Charles River Campus, including:

   ·   Parking permit program fees for employees and students who bring vehicles to campus
   ·   Restrict the availability of parking permits issued to undergraduate students
   ·   Limits on the construction of new parking spaces
New TDM/Parking Strategies. The University is considering a number of additional measures
to meet its goal of reducing the number of single occupancy vehicle commuters. These will also
assist in the management of future parking demand in light of expected supply reductions
resulting from institutional and public realm projects during the life of this master plan. The
strategies being considered include:

   ·   Deterring single occupancy vehicle commuting through employees parking fees
   ·   Provision of a parking permit discount for employees who are in a current car/van pool or who
       either join an existing car pool or form a new car pool
   ·   Set aside spaces for car/van pools at highly desirable parking locations; this preferential parking
       initiative will likely have the most influence on driver behavior if implemented in the central
       campus area
   ·   Provide preferential parking for drivers who drive to campus in hybrid or electric vehicles
   ·   Develop a tiered system for daily parking permits with higher charges for central campus lots and
       garages than those in West Campus
   ·   Institute a policy that makes employees living within a certain radius of the campus (one mile, for
       example) ineligible for parking permits

Special Event Management
Agganis Arena Events. When the Agganis Arena facility was opened in early 2005, a
comprehensive traffic and parking management plan was developed by Boston University and
reviewed and approved by the Boston Transportation Department and Boston Police Department.
The Agganis Arena Special Events Logistics Plan (AASELP) underwent some initial
refinements, but has functioned very well over the past seven years and minimized impacts on
adjacent neighborhoods. The University does not expect significant departures from the current
event management procedures during the life of this master plan.

However, there will be adjustments to the parking management plan for Agganis Arena during
the construction of the New Balance Athletic Field. When the New Balance Field is under
construction (summer 2012 through summer 2013), the existing Babcock Street surface parking
lot located at that site will be offline. The Babcock Street and University-owned 808
Commonwealth Avenue surface lots offer parking overflow for events at Agganis Arena when
event parking demand exceeds the capacity at the garage and surface lots at the JHSV site.
During construction of the New Balance Field, event attendees who would normally have been
directed to the Babcock Street lot will be directed to the parking lot at 808 Commonwealth
Avenue. When construction of the New Balance Field is complete, parking operations associated
with events at the Arena will return to the current system.

New Balance Field Events. The University has developed a traffic and parking management
plan for events that will be held at the proposed New Balance Field facility. A plan has also been
established for the construction period, portions of which have been described in the
management of events at Agganis Arena (above). The traffic and parking management plans
developed by the University for the construction and post-construction periods include the
following.

Construction Period
·   Overflow parking from the Agganis area (when needed) will be directed to the University-owned
    surface lot at 808 Commonwealth Avenue

·   Buses parking for events at the Track & Tennis Center that currently use the Babcock Street
    Lot will be directed to park at the following locations instead (in order of preference:

        1. The loading dock area at Agganis Arena.

        2. Curbside along Harry Agganis Way adjacent to the Nickerson Field fence (private
           portion of the street owned by Boston University)

        3. Rented parking meters along Ashford Street

        4. Leased spaces at an off-site location

Post Construction

·   Vehicle (automobile) parking will be accommodated on site by a total of 348 parking spaces;
    additional parking will be available at the Agganis Arena garage
·   Buses arriving for events at the New Balance Field will be directed to park at the following locations
    (in order of preference):

        1. On site in the surface parking area located at the western end of the site adjacent to
           Alcorn Street; an area has been designed to accommodate 8 to 10 buses for events
           and the parking spaces will be cordoned off early on event days to ensure automobiles
           are not parked in the spaces when the buses arrive

        2. The portion of Babcock Street north of Ashford Street (owned by Boston University)

        3. The loading dock area at Agganis Arena

        4. Curbside along Harry Agganis Way adjacent to the Nickerson Field fence (private
           portion of the street owned by Boston University)

        5. Rented parking meters along Ashford Street

        6. Leased spaces at an off-site location
·   Traffic (attendee and bus) approaching the site on Babcock Street from Commonwealth
    Avenue will be directed west onto Gardner Street to access the on-site parking, reducing the
    pedestrian/vehicular conflicts along Babcock Street adjacent to the field.

Because of the proposed limited spectator capacity at New Balance Field, the University does
not anticipate that police details will be needed to handle traffic before or after events. However,
if issues do arise and it is determined through experience that details are needed to manage traffic
flows, the BU Police Department will coordinate with the Boston Police Department. If police
details are required, they would likely be limited to the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue
and Babcock Street and the intersection of Babcock Street and Gardner Street.

Other Charles River Campus Events. Boston University Parking & Transportation Services
has developed operating procedures for other events and venues on the Charles River Campus.
These procedures have been refined over the years to minimize impacts on local neighborhoods.
Examples of events that have to be managed by the University from a transportation perspective
include:

        ·   Commencement
        ·   Orientation
        ·   Move-in and move-out periods
        ·   Athletic events at the Track & Tennis Center
        ·   Athletic events at Nickerson Field

1.0       Introduction
Boston University is the fourth-largest private university in the nation, home each year to more
than 33,000 students from all 50 states and 135 countries, and is a major research university that
offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degrees. The Charles River Campus (CRC) is
comprised of approximately 112 acres and 274 buildings, which contain approximately 11.8
million square feet of space. The Campus is situated along Commonwealth Avenue,
approximately between Massachusetts Avenue to the east and Packard's Corner (Brighton
Avenue) to the west. Storrow Drive, the Massachusetts Turnpike and the CONRAIL rail yard are
along the northern edge of the Campus, while Commonwealth Avenue, Massachusetts Turnpike
and Beacon Street are the approximate southern edge of the Campus.

For internal planning purposes, Boston University has defined four districts or areas within the
CRC. Those districts are:

      ·   East Campus
      ·   Central Campus
      ·   West Campus
      ·   South Campus
The West Campus area is located along Commonwealth Avenue between the Boston University
Bridge and Packard's Corner. The Central Campus is also located along Commonwealth Avenue
and is approximately bounded by the Boston University Bridge, Storrow Drive, the
Massachusetts Turnpike and Silber Way. East Campus area is located approximately between
Silber Way and Massachusetts Avenue, includes the Kenmore Square area and is north of the
Massachusetts Turnpike. The South Campus area is primarily located between Beacon
Street/Audubon Circle and the Massachusetts Turnpike.

Figure 1 illustrates the footprint of the Charles River Campus and show the buildings owned by
the University as well as the approximate borders of the four planning districts.

1.1       Guiding Principles/Transportation Objectives
Boston University has demonstrated over the course of the past two Master Plans that making the
area's transportation system safer and more efficient for all users has been one of its primary
focuses. The University has not only implemented changes to its own infrastructure and policies,
it has been a leading supporter and financial partner with the City and State to ensure that the
area's public transportation infrastructure is also made safer and more efficient for all modes.
The University's role in projects like the Kenmore Square improvements and the Commonwealth
Avenue Phase 1 and 2 improvements is strong evidence of its commitment to improving the
area's transportation system. These projects not only benefit the University, they also benefit its
neighbors in Boston, Brookline and Cambridge.

Looking forward through this Master Plan period, the University has identified three
transportation goals that will shape University policies and programs as well as guide the
University's focus related to transportation matters. The goals are:

   1. Improve safety and efficiency for all modes with particular emphasis on pedestrian and
      bicycle safety

   2. Increase the use of sustainable modes for employees and students currently commuting to
      the Charles River Campus in single occupancy vehicles.

   3. Minimize the University's traffic and parking impacts on adjacent communities.

2.0       Charles River Campus Characteristics
The following sections describe some of the fundamental characteristics of Boston University's
Charles River Campus such as enrollment, employment and on-campus residences. The
information provided below describes the existing profiles of these various attributes as well as
the historic and expected future trends.

2.1       Student Enrollment
The current Boston University undergraduate enrollment (2011-2012 academic year) is 15,540
students, which is slightly higher than expected or desired. At the time of the last two Master
Plans the undergraduate enrollment was approximately 14,976 (2003) and 14,571 (1997). Thus,
undergraduate student enrollment has only fluctuated by six percent over this 15-year period.

Looking ahead within the Master Plan period, the University is projecting a stabilized
undergraduate enrollment that is expected to average approximately 15,500 students per year,
with incoming Freshman classes of approximately 3,800 students.

Table 1 provides a summary of past undergraduate enrollment levels at the Campus. Currently
Boston University has projections for enrollment that look ahead six years, to 2017, and those
future enrollment projections are also provided in Table 1.

2.1.1     On-Campus Housing

Responding to concerns from representatives of the surrounding neighborhoods and the City of
Boston, Boston University has endeavored to increase the number of on-campus residential units
for undergraduate students. Currently (2011-2012 academic year) 76% of the undergraduate
students who require housing are housed on campus (approximately 11,060 students). Looking
back historically, this represents a significant increase from the proportion of students that were
housed when the original Boston University Master Plan was prepared in 1986, which at that
time was approximately 61% of the students requiring housing.

Since the 2003 Master Plan was completed, Boston University has added 960 new beds at the
CRC, primarily in the Phase II component of the John Hancock Student Village site (JHSV).
Looking to the next 10 years covered by this Master Plan, the University expects to add
approximately 583 new beds at the CRC (JHSV Phase III), and the proportion of students
requiring housing that are expected to live on-campus will stabilize at approximately 75 percent.
Table 2 provides a summary of the changes over time in the number of students housed on-
campus by Boston University.

2.2       Charles River Campus Employment
The University currently employs approximately 5,461 full time and 1,224 part-time people at
the Campus (6,685 total). The full-time employees include approximately 1,500 faculty
positions, 3,961 and professional staff or service/trade personnel. 1,022 of the 1,224 part-time
employees are part-time faculty positions. The University expects that future employment levels
will be similar to the current levels, or at most a modest increase in employment.

2.3       Existing Travel Characteristics
Travel characteristics have change dramatically at Boston University's CRC since the
completion of the University's early Master Plans. Through coordinated efforts over the past two
decades, the University has reduced the amount of vehicle trips to the campus. This reduction
has been realized through policies administered by the University's Parking & Transportation
Services Office and its Sustainability Office. Travel Demand Management (TDM) and
Sustainability programs have been developed with the goal of achieving one of the key
objectives laid out in the 2003 Master Plan, namely, "Objective 2: Limit of reduce trip
generation levels at the Charles River Campus".

Other actions by Boston University also have contributed to the reduction in demands on the
transportation network (roadway and transit), these actions include:

      ·   Constructing more on-campus housing for undergraduates

      ·   Constructing new academic facilities with little or no new parking

      ·   Supporting the City of Boston efforts to implement bike lanes on Commonwealth Avenue

      ·   Expanding bicycle storage capacity on campus

      ·   Severely limiting student parking on-campus

      ·   Implementing a rideshare/ride matching program (http://www.bu.edu/parking/alt/rideshare/)

      ·   Promoting use of public transportation through various MBTA Pass Programs offered to
          employees and students.

      ·   Expanding the Boston University Shuttle (BUS) service which reduces pressure on the
          MBTA Green Line

As Boston University is a significant employer in the state, the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection (MADEP) requires that a "Rideshare Report" be prepared every two
years. The MADEP Rideshare report programs requires large employers (like the University) to
conduct surveys and document how people travel to the campus. For Boston University, the data
includes both employees and students who live off-campus and travel to the campus.

The first Rideshare Report prepared by Boston University for the CRC was in 2002 and served
as the basis for the travel mode characteristics documented in the 2003 Master Plan. The most

recent MADEP rideshare report prepared by Boston University was completed in December of
2010 and serves as the basis for the mode splits documented in this Master Plan.

Based on the December 2010 Rideshare Report, 44 percent of the trips are made in single
occupancy vehicles, approximately 31 percent of the trips are public transportation trips
(MBTA), approximately 13.5 percent of the trips are pedestrian trips, approximately 6 percent
are bicycle trips, and approximately 5 percent of the total trips arrive/depart in car or van pools
or other methods. Therefore, approximately 56 percent of commuting trips to the campus are
made using sustainable modes (i.e., public transit, bicycle, walking, etc.).

The proportion of passenger vehicle trips to/from Campus (44 percent) compares very favorably
with City-wide and Fenway/Longwood area transportation mode share data published by the
Boston Transportation Department (Access Boston 2000 ­ 2010, Boston Transportation
Department, May 2002). The campus automobile mode share is below the City-wide share of 51
percent, but above the 37 percent share for the Fenway/Longwood area. The automobile mode
share in the Allston/Brighton neighborhoods, which encompasses the West Campus area, is 60
percent (well above the University's mode share of 44 percent). The current mode share data for
the Campus is summarized in Table 3.

Figure 2 provides a graphic comparison of how commuting to the campus has changed over
time. The most significant change has occurred in the number of commuters who drive alone to
campus, which has dropped from 77 percent in 1997 to 44 percent in 2010. Corresponding
increases have occurred in the number of commuters taking transit, bicycles or walking to
campus. Transit use has increased from 15 to 31 percent and the combination of bicycle and
pedestrian modes has increased from 12 to 22 percent. This trend in changing commuting modes
is the result of Boston University's implementation of trip reduction policies over the last two
Master Plan periods.

3.0       Existing Transportation Conditions
The initial step in understanding how the transportation system will function over the 10 year
period covered by this Master Plan, is to establish a comprehensive baseline condition that
includes the essential elements that comprise or influence the transportation network in and
around the CRC. Those elements are:

      ·   Roadway system and traffic operations

      ·   Traffic safety

      ·   Pedestrian circulation

      ·   Bicycle circulation and storage

      ·   Public Transportation (MBTA)

      ·   Boston University Shuttle (BUS)

      ·   Parking

      ·   Loading and Service

      ·   Traffic Management for Special Events

The following sections describe the existing 2012 conditions pertaining to these elements.

3.1       Existing Traffic Network
Through discussions with the Boston Transportation Department (BTD) that occurred during the
IMPNF review process, the traffic network to be evaluated for this Master Plan was established.
That network is primarily along Commonwealth Avenue between Kenmore Square and
Packard's Corner (Brighton Avenue), as Commonwealth Avenue is the key transportation spine
that connects the East and Central Campus areas with the West Campus. In addition, the network
includes several secondary roadways that provide access to the various Boston University
facilities located throughout the Charles River Campus. The other roadways within the Master
Plan study limits include:

      ·   Bay State Road (one-way westbound)
      ·   Deerfield Street
      ·   Silber Way
      ·   Granby Street
      ·   St. Mary's Street (one-way southbound)
      ·   Mountfort Street
      ·   Carleton Street

   ·      Buick Street
   ·      Harry Agganis Way
   ·      Babcock Street
   ·      Ashford Street
   ·      Gardner Street
The majority of these roadways are located within the City of Boston. Mountfort Street, Carleton
Street and St. Mary's Street are located in the Town of Brookline.

The traffic operations analysis performed for the Master Plan study examined intersections
located within the study limits described above. A summary of the study intersections, traffic
control and jurisdiction (Boston or Brookline) are summarized in Table 5.

3.1.1   Traffic Volumes

Peak Hour Volumes
Traffic volume data from several sources were used in this Master Plan analysis. The traffic data
sources used are:

   ·    Traffic counts commission by Boston University and performed during the week of
        March 19-23, 2012

   ·    Traffic counts performed by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation during the
        last week of January 2012 for improvements in the BU Bridge area

   ·    Traffic counts performed by the BETA Group, Inc. for Boston University during the
        week of November 16-20, 2009 for the Commonwealth Avenue Phase 2A project

In each of these data collection efforts, intersection turning movement and vehicle classification
counts were performed during the weekday morning peak commuting period (7:00 AM to 9:00
AM) and the weekday afternoon peak commuting period (4:00 PM to 6:00 PM). A list of the
intersections counted and when those counts were performed is provided below.

March 2012 peak hour counts at the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue and Buick Street/St.
Paul Street were compared to counts at that same intersection performed in November 2009. The
March 2012 count results indicate that peak hour volumes along the portion of Commonwealth
Avenue west of the BU Bridge had increased by approximately five percent since the November
2009. The lower November 2009 counts likely reflect a change in commuting habits due to
construction that was underway at that time on the Boston University Bridge.

Consequently, the peak hour traffic data at the remaining three intersections counted in
November 2009 that are noted above were increased by five percent to reflect 2012 conditions.

The existing morning and afternoon peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated in Figure 4 and
Figure 5. Copies of the original peak hour traffic count data sheets are provided in Appendix A
of the Transportation Technical Appendices.

Daily Volumes

In addition to the peak hour counts, Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) counts were conducted
on several roadways in the campus area to measure traffic for a 24-hour period during a
weekday. The ATR counts were conducted at the following locations:

March 2012
   ·   Commonwealth Avenue, west of Kenmore Square
   ·   Commonwealth Avenue, west of St. Mary's Street
   ·   Commonwealth Avenue, west of Babcock Street
   ·   Bay State Road, west of Deerfield Street
November 2009
   ·   Commonwealth Avenue, west of the B. U. Bridge
   ·   Buick Street, north of Commonwealth Avenue
   ·   Harry Agganis Way, north of Commonwealth Avenue
   ·   Babcock Street, north of Commonwealth Avenue

Table 6 provides a summary of the existing daily volumes that were measured with the ATR
machines. Similar to the peak hour traffic data, the daily volumes that were measured in 2009
were increased by 5 percent to reflect 2012 conditions. The daily volumes are also summarized
graphically on Figure 6. Copies of the original ATR count sheets are provided in Appendix A of
the Transportation Technical Appendices.

Traffic Volume Trends on Commonwealth Avenue

In addition to establishing a baseline for looking forward to the next 10 year period covered by
this Master Plan, the recently measured traffic data affords an opportunity to look back
historically to determine how traffic has changed within the CRC over time. There is an
abundance of traffic data that has been collected along Commonwealth Avenue by the University
for various Institutional Projects or previous Master Planning efforts over the past 25 years.

Despite the recent trend of volume increases west of the BU Bridge in the 2009 to 2012 time
frame, the long-term trend on Commonwealth Avenue and the adjacent streets has been stable or
a decrease in volumes since 1987. Looking first at daily volume data, which is presented in
Table 7, the long-range trend is clearly downward.

West of the BU Bridge, traffic on Commonwealth Avenue is approximately 17 to 18 percent
lower in 2012 than in 1987. On the side streets that provide access to University facilities in the
west campus area (Buick Street and Harry Agganis Way), volumes are down about 4 percent
since the 2003 Master Plan. The data shows a shift in use between the two streets, with Buick
volumes increasing and Harry Agganis Way volumes decreasing. Both roadways serve the same
Boston University facilities and are connected by a service road on the north boundary of the
JHSV site. The approximate equalization of traffic on each road indicates a natural "balancing"
of use as traffic tends to reach its own equilibrium in urban areas where drivers have choices.

East of the BU Bridge, the 2012 traffic volumes are also lower than were observed in 2001.
Indeed, volumes are down between 18 and 32 percent between Kenmore Square and Carleton
Street. On Bay State Road volumes are down nearly 23 percent in this same time period.

The decreases in volumes, particularly since the 2003 Master Plan, are likely due to several
contributing factors:

     ·    Boston University TDM programs (stabilized parking supply, more students housed on
          campus, limitations on student parking, increased transit, bicycle and pedestrian mode
          splits at the CRC, etc.)

     ·    Traffic calming effects of the Commonwealth Avenue Phase 1 improvements on the
          segment of Commonwealth Avenue between Kenmore Square and Carleton Street

     ·    Installation of bicycle lanes on Commonwealth Avenue from Kenmore Square to Packards
          Corner.

     ·    Recent economic conditions

Additionally, some of the decrease in traffic on Bay State Road may be attributable to the
construction of Boston University's East Campus Student Services Center at the corner of Bay
State Road and Deerfield Street. However, at the time of the March 2012 counts, the disruption
to traffic flows on Bay State Road were minimal and it is estimated that the impact on traffic was
correspondingly minimal as well.

Figure 7 provides a visual comparison of how daily traffic volumes have changed from 2001 to
2012 along the portion of Commonwealth Ave. that serves the CRC.

A similar comparison was performed using the peak hour turning movement data collected at
intersections along Commonwealth Avenue. That data is presented in Table 8 and is based on
traffic observations made in 1987, 1996, 2001/2002 and 2012. As Table 8 indicates, peak hour
traffic is also down throughout the corridor. Since the 2003 Master Plan (2001/2002 data), peak
hour traffic has decreased between 9 percent and 25 percent, depending upon the location and the
peak period. The most significant decreases in traffic were observed at the following
intersections:

      ·    Commonwealth Ave. at Babcock Street: (-25%) in the PM peak
      ·    Commonwealth Ave. at Harry Agganis Way: (-23%) in the PM peak
      ·    Commonwealth Ave. at BU Bridge/Essex Street: (-22%) in the AM and PM peaks

3.1.2     Traffic Operations

Level of Service

Level of Service (LOS) is a term used to describe the quality of the traffic flow on a roadway at a
particular point in time. It is an aggregate measure of travel delay, travel speed, congestion,
driver discomfort, convenience, and safety based on a comparison of roadway facility capacity to
travel demand. Operating levels of service are reported on a scale of A to F, with LOS A
representing the best operating conditions and LOS F representing the worst operating


Boston University Charles River Campus
Transportation Master Plan                                                                                             30
conditions. LOS A represents free-flow conditions with little or no traffic delays, while LOS F
represents a forced-flow condition with long delays and traffic demands exceeding roadway
capacity.

LOS C is often cited as a design standard for rural roadways and LOS D is often used for urban
roadways. However, when trying to establish minimum "acceptable" level of service thresholds
for existing roadways a number of factors must be considered. These include existing operating
levels of service at other similar and nearby facilities; the duration of the peak traffic periods; the
feasibility and cost of providing roadway capacity increases; and, applicable state and local
regulations.

Roadway operating levels of service are calculated following procedures defined in the 2000
Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board. For both signalized
and unsignalized intersections, the operating level of service is based on travel delay. Delay can
be measured in the field, but is generally calculated as a function of the traffic volume; quality of
traffic progression; the green ratio; the cycle length; the v/c (volume/capacity) ratio; and the
capacity of each intersection approach, as appropriate for signalized intersections. Delay at
unsignalized intersections is calculated for the side street or minor street approach and for left
turns from the major street. Delays at unsignalized intersections are influenced by the traffic
volume levels on the major and minor streets.

The delay-based level of service thresholds provided in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual are
summarized for signalized and unsignalized intersections in Table 9.

Existing Operations

Existing peak hour traffic operations for this Master Plan were evaluated using the SYNCHRO
6.0 software, which is the standard traffic analysis and simulation tool used by the Boston
Transportation Department. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 10, which
provides overall level of service, delay and volume-to-capacity ratio results for the signalized
intersections that were evaluated; and level of service, delay and volume-to-capacity ratio results
for the side street traffic moments at the unsignalized intersections.

A detailed tabular summary of the traffic model results, i.e., level of service, delay and volume-
to-capacity ratio results by traffic movement at each intersection, are provided in Technical
Appendix B. The tables in Appendix B also report the average and 95th percentile queues for
each traffic movement, as well as available queue storage. Appendix B also includes copies of
the SYNCHRO traffic model output sheets for each study intersection.

As review of Table 10 indicates, the roadway network in the vicinity of the campus functions
reasonable well during peak periods on typical weekdays. Most of the signalized intersections
along Commonwealth Ave. for example, function at LOS D (overall) or better during both the
morning and afternoon peak. The exception is the main intersection at Kenmore Square which
functions at LOS E during the PM peak, with a volume-to-capacity ratio of 0.98 (approaching
the capacity of the intersection).

Although the overall LOS along the Commonwealth Ave. corridor is adequate, there are
individual approaches or traffic turning movements that are above capacity or have long queues
(see Appendix B). Within the corridor these approaches tend to be the side street approaches to
Commonwealth Ave. as the BTD provides a greater portion of the signal's green time to
Commonwealth Ave because that road carries more vehicles. The street approaches to
Commonwealth Ave. that exhibit congestion during peak periods include:
   ·   Babcock Street northbound (AM)
   ·   Babcock Street southbound (PM)
   ·   St. Paul Street northbound (PM)
   ·   Carleton Street northbound (AM & PM)
Historically, the Commonwealth Ave. westbound approach to the BU Bridge was severely
congested in both peak periods because of the large amount of right turns onto the BU Bridge.
The queues on this portion of Commonwealth Ave would routinely back into the Carleton
Street/University Road intersection and impact operations for traffic and Green Line trolleys at
that intersection. However, since completion of the BU Bridge reconstruction project in
December 2011, the queuing/congestion/gridlock in this area has been reduced noticeably. The
improvement in operations is likely due to a combination of factors:
   ·   Traffic diverting to other routes to avoid construction at the BU Bridge may have not yet
       returned to the area
   ·   Adjustment to signal coordination settings between the Carleton Street signal and the BU
       Bridge signal that were implemented by the BTD in January 2012.
   ·   Generally lower volumes in the area because of the current economic conditions
With regards to the unsignalized intersections on Bay State Road and in the Babcock Street area
in west campus, all of these locations function adequately with minimal congestion during both
peak periods (LOS A, LOS B or LOS C).

3.1.3     Safety Analysis

An analysis of crash data has been performed using data available from the MassDOT Registry
of Motor Vehicles division and in accordance with BTD and MassDOT standards for safety
analysis for planning studies. Crash data from the three most recent years available from
MassDOT (2007 ­ 2009) were used for the analysis. The results of the analysis are summarized
in Table 11, which provides a breakdown of crashes per year at each intersection, as well as the
crash rate.

The crash rate, which represents the number of crashes at the intersection per million entering
vehicles, provides an indication of how the intersection compares with other similar intersections
(signalized or unsignalized) within the region or the state. MassDOT calculates the average crash
rate for intersections on a state-wide basis and for each of its six engineering districts. Boston is
in MassDOT District 6. The MassDOT average crash rates are also provided in Table 11.

It is important to note that the data summarized in Table 11 may not reflect all of the accidents
that are occurring at the study intersections, as there are some limitations on the crash data that
come from the Registry. Typically, the Registry data is lower than the data collected by the local
police departments. For example, data obtained from the Boston Police Department, Boston
EMS Department and the Boston University Police Department for use in the design of the
improvements proposed for Commonwealth Avenue west of the BU Bridge showed 67 percent
greater number crashes for that area than the MassDOT data. However, for this Master Plan
MassDOT data has been used in order to provide a fair comparison to other intersections in the



Boston University Charles River Campus
Transportation Master Plan                                                                                    34
CRC, and more importantly, for the comparison to the MassDOT state-wide and District 6 rates
which are based on crash data from the Registry. However, for comparative purposes, the
intersections for which Boston Police Department (BPD) data was available, the total number of
crashes and crash rates by location for the same three year period are presented in Table 11 (in
red).

As noted in Table 11, the intersections with the highest number of crashes between 2007 and
2009, according to the MassDOT data, were:
   ·   Kenmore Square (27 crashes)
   ·   Commonwealth Avenue/BU Bridge/Essex St (20)
   ·   Commonwealth Avenue/Babcock Street (15)
   ·   Commonwealth Avenue/Harry Agganis Way/Pleasant St.(14)
In addition, it is important to note that most intersections along Commonwealth Avenue in the
west campus area (i.e., west of the BU Bridge) had a least one reported pedestrian or bike
accident during the three years evaluated. East of Carleton Street however, there were a minimal
number of pedestrian or bicycle crashes reported. The smaller number of pedestrian/bike crashes
in the central/east campus area is most likely due to the safety improvements made in this area as
part of the Commonwealth Avenue Phase I project (Note: bicycle lanes were not installed on the
portion of Commonwealth Ave. west of the BU Bridge until 2009).
The MassDOT data also indicates that there were not many accidents of any time along Bay
State Road or in the Babcock Street area (Babcock, Gardner, Ashford, Alcorn Streets).

In terms of the crash rates, only one intersection had crash rates that exceeded the MassDOT the
District 6 rate: Ashford Street at Alcorn Street (only 1 crash but the traffic volumes are very
low). All other intersections were below the District 6 and state-wide crash rates, and in fact
many locations were well below the MassDOT rates.

Copies of the MassDOT crash data for 2007 ­ 2009 and the crash rate calculation sheets are
provided in Appendix C. Appendix C also includes copies of the BPD crash records for the
intersections west of the BU Bridge.

The count data shows that pedestrian activity in the mid-day and PM peak periods are
significantly busier than during the AM peak. However, that does not mean that the AM peak
does not have pedestrian activity within the CRC, rather this is an indication of how extremely
busy pedestrian activity is during the mid-day and afternoon periods. Indeed, some of the
crosswalk volumes in the AM peak were observed to be as much as 1,195 crossings per hour at
University Road or 1,050 crossings per hour at Babcock Street. As busy as these crosswalks are,
those volumes are dwarfed by the number of pedestrians along Commonwealth Avenue in the
mid-day and afternoon peaks. For example, the number of pedestrian crossings at the
intersections of Commonwealth Ave./BU Bridge ranges between 1,600 to 2,400 pedestrians per
hour in the mid-day and PM peaks.

The busiest crosswalks are typically on the north side of Commonwealth Avenue, particularly
west of St. Mary's Street. The activity is highest on the north side because of the concentration
of Boston University academic, residential and athletic facilities located on the north side of
Commonwealth Ave. in the west campus area. As noted above, there is a particularly large
concentration of pedestrian traffic at the BU Bridge and University Road. This is due to their
location as the "crossroads" between west campus and central and east campus areas. Students
who live in west campus walk to classes and other activities in Central campus, and then return
to their residence hall after the class/activity is completed. For students who live in the
central/east campus areas, they often walk to west campus for classes or to make use of the many
athletic or recreational opportunities in the west campus. Ultimately they make are return trip to
their residence halls in central campus. Thus, for each group of students, these walking
"roundtrips" between campus areas all funnel through the BU Bridge/University Road area.

The pedestrian activity in this "crossroads" area is further concentrated as the vast majority of
the pedestrian use occurs along the north crosswalk. Indeed, the peak volumes in the crosswalks
at the BU Bridge and across University Road were measured at 1,425 pedestrians per hour and
1,350 pedestrians per hour, respectively. The level of pedestrian activity in these two crosswalks
is comparable to intersections located in the City's downtown central business or at the core of
the Longwood Medical and Academic Area (LMA). Two examples of intersections with similar
levels of pedestrian volumes are Congress Street and State Street (downtown) and Brookline
Avenue at Longwood Avenue (LMA).

The high level of pedestrian activity at the BU Bridge/University Road area is also not just a
peak period phenomenon. Based on 12-hour pedestrian counts collected by the BTD at the BU
Bridge in the fall of 2007, the level of pedestrian activity reaches a plateau of about 1,000
crossings per hour around 11:00 AM and stays above 1,000 crossings until nearly 7:00 PM.
Because of the sustained high level of activity over a 7 to 8 hour period, these crosswalks are in
reality busier locations that crosswalks located in Boston's downtown core, which tend to have
activity levels that peak during AM and PM commuting periods and the noon lunch time period.
If the BTD's 12 hour data is extrapolated to 24 hours, it is estimated that approximately 18,000
to 20,000 pedestrians a day pass through this portion of Commonwealth Avenue.

In Central campus, between St. Mary's Street and Hinsdale Street, there are also high levels of
pedestrian activity which is concentrated on the south side of Commonwealth Ave. Pedestrian
activity is at high levels in this area because of the Warren Towers residence halls, which are

located on the south side of Commonwealth Ave. Approximately 1,750 students live at the
Warren Towers.

With such high levels of pedestrian activity along both sides of Commonwealth Ave., as well as
the high number of pedestrians crossing Commonwealth Avenue in the Central campus area, it
becomes obvious why the University was such an important contributor and supporter of the
pedestrian improvements made as part of the Commonwealth Avenue Phase 1 Improvements
project. Shortening the pedestrian crossing distances along this portion of Commonwealth Ave.
has improved safety for those pedestrians, and the streetscape improvements have enhanced the
pedestrian experience immeasurably.

The existing high level of pedestrian volumes in the BU Bridge area, coupled with a significant
number of vehicular conflicts, is essential in understanding the University's desire to improve
pedestrian safety in this critical area. As will be discussed later in this Master Plan, Boston
University's support, both political and financial, of the major roadway circulation changes
planned by the BTD and MassDOT at the BU Bridge, is driven by the need to ensure safety for
the tens of thousands of pedestrians (students) traversing through the area each day.

Pedestrian Volume Growth
The pedestrian activity along Commonwealth Avenue that was measured in 2012 was compared
to pedestrian activity measured for the 1997 and 2003 Master Plans (and from earlier
observations), to understand how pedestrian flows have evolved over time. The comparison of
pedestrian volumes is summarized in Table 12. As can be seen in reviewing Table 12, in general
pedestrian activity has increased steadily through the CRC over the past 25 years. Some of the
more dramatic changes since the 2003 Master Plan have occurred at the intersections of:

   ·   Commonwealth Ave. at Buick Street
   ·   Commonwealth Ave. at Carleton Street.
At Buick Street, for example, pedestrian flows in the Buick Street crosswalk (north side of
Commonwealth Ave.) have increased from 770 to 1,180 pedestrians per hour in the midday peak
and from 665 to over 1,300 in the PM peak. These translate to a 53 percent increase in the mid-
day peak and a 97 percent increase in the PM peak. At this particular crosswalk, the dramatic
increase in pedestrian activity is most likely due to students traveling to/from the recreation
center which opened after the 2003 Master Plan was completed.

At the Carlton Street intersection, the south crosswalk has increased from 335 to 525 pedestrian
crossings per hour during the PM peak period, a 57 percent increase since 2003. This increase
reflects a trend in activity on the sidewalks and crosswalks along the south side of this portion of
Commonwealth Avenue that has been observed over the past several years. Two factors appear
to be contributing to these increases:
   1. General increases in pedestrian movements between west campus and central/east
      campus areas
   2. Pedestrians avoiding the crosswalk at the BU Bridge due to safety concerns and
      congestion conditions at the two traffic islands (the crosswalk at Essex Street is a single
      crossing rather than the three separate crossings required an the BU Bridge).

Existing Pedestrian Facilities
With such high levels of pedestrian activity throughout the CRC, it is important to ensure that the
pedestrian facilities are adequate, and that pedestrian flows function safely and efficiently.
Because of its urban setting, pedestrian travel in the CRC occurs on a combination of pedestrian
walkways and paths on University property and along city sidewalks. In fact, observations
indicate that most of the pedestrian activity occurs on along public sidewalks. A field inventory


Boston University Charles River Campus
Transportation Master Plan                                                                                             42
confirmed that, within the campus area, every street has sidewalks on both sides. As part of the
field inventory sidewalk widths were measured and a qualitative assessment regarding sidewalk
conditions was performed. Sidewalk conditions were rated as good, fair or poor and represent an
average for the entire block. The conditions of the sidewalks and sidewalk widths are shown on
Figures 12A and 12B.

The pedestrian inventory found the following attributes within the CRC:

   ·   Streets (public or private) in the CRC area all
       have concrete sidewalks on both sides of the
       street.

   ·   Every signalized intersection has striped
       crosswalks and pedestrian WALK phases
       programed into the signal operations.

   ·   Many of the unsignalized intersections also have
       striped crosswalks

   ·   Handicapped ramps have been installed at vast
       majority of signalized and unsignalized
       intersection in the CRC campus area



In general sidewalk widths were found to be adequate to accommodate the existing pedestrian
demands, even the high levels of demand on Commonwealth Ave. As noted on Figures 12A and
12B, sidewalk widths on Commonwealth Ave. are very generous, ranging from 20 feet to 25 feet
in width in the west campus area and 14 feet to 25 feet in the central/east campus areas. There
are a couple of "pinch points" in the systems, particularly on Commonwealth Ave. in the vicinity
of the BU Bridge area.

One pinch point is on the north sidewalk just west of Carleton Street where an MBTA bus shelter
narrows the "usable" sidewalk width from 22 feet to approximately 6 to 8 feet. The University
and the BRA have discussed this pinch point and the University is committed under this Master
Plan to modify the University-owned parking lot located north of the sidewalk (the Upper Bridge
Lot/Boston Academy Lot) to provide additional space so the sidewalk can be widened and
additional landscape buffer area be provided.

A second pinch point is also on the Commonwealth Ave. north sidewalk at the intersection of the
BU Bridge. On the north side of the intersection, due to the presence of two "delta" traffic
islands, pedestrians have to make three separate crossing to get from one side of the intersection
to the other. Pedestrian storage capabilities on the traffic islands and on the outside corners are
not adequate to "store" the number of pedestrians waiting for the WALK phase to come up
during the signal cycle. This lack of storage space has safety implications for those pedestrians.

The University has worked with the BTD, and later MassDOT, for many years to implement
improvements at this intersection that would eliminate the traffic islands and expand the

Transportation Master Plan                                                                      43
pedestrian waiting areas at the northeast and northwest corners of this intersection. Recently
(March 2012), MassDOT has endorsed a long-range plan for the Commonwealth Ave./BU
Bridge/Mountfort Street/Carleton Street/University Road area that includes the pedestrian safety
improvements that have been long endorsed by Boston University.

3.3    Accessibility
The University is committed to providing equal and integrated access for individuals with
disabilities to all academic, social, cultural and recreational programs offered at the Charles
River Campus. In keeping with this commitment, the University's Office of Disability Services
has created a on-line, interactive map which illustrates the locations of accessible
features/facilities at all major buildings within the campus (www.bu.edu/maps).

As noted above, the field inventory of existing pedestrians facilities indicated that nearly all of
the intersections within the CRC have at least one crosswalk. The field inventory also found that
wheelchair ramps are also present at nearly every intersection. Thus individuals traveling to/from
the University's major facilities via the pedestrian network generally have an accessible route
available to them. Figures 13A and 13B illustrate the locations of crosswalks and wheelchair
ramps within and adjacent to the CRC.

3.4    Bicycle Circulation and Storage
After pedestrians, bicycling may be the most important mode of travel at the CRC. It is also a
mode whose use on campus has grown significantly in the past 10 years. The increase in bicycle
use at the CRC is a reflection of a larger mode shift that has occurred in Boston (and society in
general), as more and more commuters choose to use sustainable modes of transportation. The
University has increased its emphasis on bicycle facilities, circulation and safety in response to
the recent growth. As the following sections describe, the University has supported the City's
program to expand the number and length of bike lanes in Boston, and has tripled the amount of
bicycle storage capacity within the campus to accommodate the increase demands.

Existing Bicycle Volumes
The 2012 traffic count program also measured bicycle activity within the CRC during the peak
commuting periods. That data is presented on Figures 14 and 15 (Existing AM Peak Hour
Bicycle Volumes and Existing PM Peak Hour Bicycle Volumes). Bicycle activity has increased
dramatically at the CRC since the 2003 Master Plan, as has the amount of bike storage available
on-campus for the students, faculty and staff (see below). A significant contributing factor to the
increased use is the installation of bicycle lanes along Commonwealth Avenue by the City of
Boston.

As Figures 14 and 15 illustrate, the highest bicycle volumes in the area are in the Commonwealth
Avenue bicycle lanes. In the AM peak hour for example, approximately 375 bicyclists were
observed travelling east along Commonwealth Avenue at the BU Bridge from the west campus
area toward central and east campus areas. Observations further indicated that most of the
bicyclists appeared to be students. In the PM peak hour bicycle use along Commonwealth
Avenue was heavier westbound (consistent with the peak traffic flows) and was observed to be
as high as 250 bicyclists per hour at between Carleton Street and the BU Bridge.

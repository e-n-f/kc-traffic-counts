Project Description and General Information
1.0    PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1    Introduction

       BRG 161 South Huntington LLC, an affiliate of Boston Residential Group, LLC (the
       Proponent) proposes to construct a new 190,000 square foot (sf) residential development at
       the current site of The Home for Little Wanderers (the Project) (Figure 1-1). The Project will
       create much needed housing and concentrates development in an area that has existing
       infrastructure and excellent access to public transportation. The 196-unit project will
       enhance an underutilized parcel of land close to the Longwood Medical and Academic
       Area (LMA) with excellent access to downtown Boston and other parts of the Boston
       metropolitan area.

       The Project's massing and design will help tie the neighborhood's varied building stock and
       uses together by respecting the fabric of the neighborhood and the use will add a residential
       presence along South Huntington which will complement the existing uses of this vibrant
       city neighborhood. The Project is a transit-oriented development which will include many
       sustainable design measures as well as provide affordable housing to the neighborhood.

       In a move announced in August and anticipated to happen in the fall of 2012, The Home
       for Little Wanderers will relocate its programming and services from its oldest and most-
       well known facility -- the Knight Children's Center -- to a section of its 166-acre site at
       Longview Farm in Walpole that is undergoing $19-million in new construction. The Home
       for Little Wanderers, a 213-year-old nonprofit, has held other programming at other sites,
       including on former farmland in Walpole since 1940.

       The Proponent has an executed purchase and sale agreement with the current owner
       allowing The Home for Little Wanderers to benefit from the sale of the site and relocate its
       services.

       This Expanded PNF is being submitted to initiate Large Project Review under Article 80 of
       the Boston Zoning Code.

1.4    Project Description

       1.4.1         Project Site

       The Project site is approximately 3.49 acres and is located two miles west of downtown
       Boston in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood near Brookline. The Project site is bounded by
       South Huntington Avenue to the east; the Jamaicaway to the west; the Sherrill House at 135
       South Huntington Avenue, a five to six story skilled nursing facility to the north; and the
       Goddard House at 201 South Huntington Avenue, a six to seven story skilled nursing and
       rehabilitation center to the south (see Figure 1-1).

       The area has become increasingly popular for working, living, and playing given its close
       proximity to major employment centers, retail areas, and recreational resources. The MBTA
       Heath Street Green Line Subway is one block away for service to downtown Boston and
       points west and the #39 bus stop is nearby. Olmsted Park and Jamaica Pond are
       immediately adjacent offering gardens, athletic fields, trails and boating, the LMA is ½ mile
       away, and the commercial areas of Jamaica Plain, Brookline Village and Hyde Square are
       easily accessible.

       As envisioned, the Project will contribute to the vibrant activity in one of Boston's most
       dynamic mixed-use neighborhoods. The Project will be designed to embrace the natural
       setting of the Emerald Necklace and provide a much anticipated residential face on South
       Huntington Avenue.

       1.4.2         Existing Site Uses

       The site is currently occupied by The Home for Little Wanderers, which is relocating and
       consolidating some of its operations and functions to its facility in Walpole, Massachusetts.
       The relocation to the Walpole facility is anticipated to be completed in late 2012. The
       South Huntington Avenue facility dates back to 1914 and the existing buildings currently
       house classrooms, offices, student residences, and a gymnasium. The three existing
       buildings total approximately 55,580 sf of development.

       Figure 1-2 provides an existing conditions site plan with the proposed Project overlaid.
       Figure 1-3 includes the proposed Site Configuration Plan. Photographs of existing
       conditions are provided in Appendix A.

       1.4.3         Detailed Project Description

       Program

       The Project will include the construction of a single new residential building totaling
       approximately 190,000 sf (134,420 net new sf on the site). The new building will be
       organized into two parts, one having four and the other five stories. The building will
       feature a range of tenant amenities located on the ground floor consisting of a common
       room and lounge, private dining room and kitchen, fitness center and concierge. On floors
       two through five, the Project will incorporate approximately 196 residential apartments
       consisting of one and two bedroom units. These uses will add a residential presence along
       South Huntington Avenue, and will complement the existing uses of this vibrant city
       neighborhood. Outside and connected to the interior common spaces will be two
       landscaped elevated terraces with outdoor seating and lounging spaces, a pool and outdoor
       cooking facilities.

       Landscape

       The overall character of the landscape of the Project will be enhanced with extensive new
       plantings and quality site furnishings. The unique Project site calls for a two-sided
       landscape design response. Along South Huntington Avenue the setting is decidedly urban
       and the landscape design will engage with the contemporary streetscape conditions.
       Conversely, the landscape on the Jamaicaway side of the property has the naturalistic
       character of the historic Olmsted-designed Emerald Necklace and the landscape design will
       be sensitive to that character.

       On South Huntington Avenue the landscape concept is mindful of South Huntington's
       heritage and recognizes that the Project Site provides a contemporary place to live. The
       design responds to the traditional and non-traditional Boston neighborhood by engaging the
       street and civic life. Unlike the current edge of the property, in which the existing iron
       picket fence and masonry piers are a strong perimeter barrier clearly separating the public
       and private realms, the new design uses a modern interpretation of the picket fencing and
       pier elements in a less rigid way.

       The design employs a series of varied orthogonal shapes and spaces in the landscape,
       which allow for a garden ambience. The fence occasionally steps back while the landscape
       steps forward, creating visual interest and also allowing for the interplay of the landscape
       with the rectilinear modulation of the building. Curbed plant beds, maintained by the
       Proponent, are to be placed on the outer side of the fence adjacent to the sidewalk for the
       enjoyment of passersby and residents alike.

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       At the primary building entry area along South Huntington Avenue, the landscape
       consolidates several necessary functions. The design integrates the heavily used crosswalk
       and bus stop, which are both retained in their current configurations. The landscape opens
       out from the architecture by extending a broad, well landscaped "invitation" from the
       building's front door to the sidewalk and vice versa (Figure 1-4).

       The southern curb cut is maintained in its existing location while the northern curb cut is
       widened and moved approximately 16' southward, nearer to the front door. This
       configuration consolidates and reduces the mixed pedestrian and vehicular traffic area and
       helps to resolve the steep existing off-site sidewalk cross pitches, all of which contribute to a
       more garden like entry and a higher level of pedestrian comfort, safety and ADA
       compliance.

       On the Jamaicaway side, the landscape context is primarily forested, with modest sidewalks
       and walking paths which weave into and out of Olmsted Park. The Project intends to
       continue the primarily sylvan character in the Project's new landscape. There is a mature
       stand of approximately 28 existing red oak trees on the site, and they contribute to the
       visual quality of the property and the experience of the public along the Jamaicaway. The
       Proponent is intending to protect the trees throughout construction.

       Other key aspects of the landscape along the Jamaicaway include an historic existing iron
       picket fence which runs the entire length of the property which will be retained and
       restored.

       Parking and Access

       Approximately 154 parking spaces will be included in a partially below grade parking
       garage which is not visible from South Huntington Avenue while 16 visitor spaces with two
       handicapped accessible spaces will be provided at grade totaling 170 spaces.

       The proposed Project has been designed to maintain access from South Huntington Avenue
       much as it is today. Dual vehicular travel lanes leading to the north from the northern curb
       cut provide two-way access to and from the structured parking below the building, while a
       narrower one-way vehicular loop between the building entry and the southern curb cut
       provides adequate emergency vehicle passing, and will provide a drop off area with all
       service occurring off the loop drive with a dedicated service lane. A raised pedestrian table
       with ornamental pavers that passes in front of the building entry will contribute to the traffic
       calming, pedestrian comfort and safety.

       Height and Massing

       The building will be 65 feet in height as measured in accordance with the City of Boston
       Zoning Code. (Figures 1-5 through 1-10 include floor plans and sections).

       The Project's massing and design will help tie the neighborhood's varied building stock and
       uses together by respecting the fabric of the neighborhood. Over the course of the past
       several months, the Proponent has evaluated the appropriate design approach for the
       Project and has focused on the following priorities in developing the design:

            Respecting and supporting the integrity of the Emerald Necklace;

            Reflecting the context of the buildings within the Jamaica Plain neighborhood;

            Providing streetscape and public realm improvements through upgrades to
            sidewalks, street lighting, landscaping, signage, fencing, and paving;

            Locating development along a readily accessible transit line, the MBTA's Heath
            Street Green line as well as the #39 bus are both one block away

            Developing urban infill sites; and

                 Expanding the residential fabric of Jamaica Plain.

       1.4.3.1        Project Context

       The Project is bound on the north by Sherrill House, a five to six story skilled nursing
       facility, and on the south by Goddard House, a six to seven story skilled nursing and
       rehabilitation center. On the east across South Huntington Avenue is the Veterans
       Administration (VA) Hospital, a campus of buildings ranging in height from four to 14
       stories, and on the west, the Jamaicaway and then across the street, a portion of the
       Olmsted Park and Leverett Pond.

       Both adjacent nursing facility buildings are generally constructed of masonry with the
       Sherrill House having a contemporary addition closest to the site featuring bays of metal
       panel. The VA Hospital is constructed of smooth and textured white and blue metal panels.

       The contrast between the South Huntington Avenue and Jamaicaway streetscape is extreme.
       South Huntington Avenue is a wide linear and active roadway with single car travel lanes,
       bikes lanes and parallel parking on both sides of the street. The sidewalk adjacent to the
       property is approximately five feet in width set between parallel parked cars and a
       deteriorated six foot tall iron fence. In contrast, the Jamaicaway is a tree lined curvelinear
       four lane roadway with wide planted green strips and eight foot sidewalks on both sides.

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                    Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       The Project is consistent with the larger urban planning goals to promote smart growth by
       developing urban infill sites and discouraging building on `greenfield' sites. The Project
       will address the local need for residential use and will enhance an underutilized parcel of
       land close to the LMA and downtown. In addition, the Project concentrates development
       in an area that has existing infrastructure and excellent access to public transportation.

       1.4.3.2       Project Alternatives / Evolution of Design

       The Project design has evolved and several conceptual design scenarios were studied
       before arriving at the Project design. Options included maintaining and renovating the
       oldest of the existing structures, paired with a new tower building of approximately 12
       stories. Parking would have been provided in a garage structure below the tower and at
       grade. The drawbacks included greater shadow impacts, significant added costs to both
       renovate the existing structure and construct a high-rise building and garage, conflict with
       the context regarding height, and lack of maintenance of the street wall.

       Another scenario studied assumed two separate four story buildings with three story
       townhouses fronting South Huntington Avenue at the center of the site. With this scenario,
       the building and parking encroached into the existing mature trees on the Jamaicaway that
       are required to be maintained, did not provide an adequate level of density, and did not
       maintain the desired street wall.

       1.4.3.3       Design

       The site will be redeveloped from the existing condition to an active residential
       development with a robust resident amenity package. The majority of the parking will be
       provided under the building and out of sight in a partially below grade garage.

       The Project's massing and design will help tie the neighborhood's varied building stock and
       uses together by respecting the fabric of the neighborhood. The design of the new building
       centers on simple volumes which are broken down in scale through the modulation of
       façade depth, bay windows, building heights, and varying materials of masonry, metal
       panel, and glass. The building generally aligns with adjacent parcels to provide definition
       to South Huntington Avenue. The design acknowledges the sloped site by stepping the
       building and is devised into two major elements of four stories and five stories. The
       development will enhance pedestrian access at South Huntington Avenue by providing new
       sidewalks, landscaping elements, fencing, and lighting and will offer an active streetscape
       with multiple pedestrian entry points

       The building will seek LEED Certification through the USGBC at a minimum of a Certified
       level, exceeding the requirements of Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code. The
       redevelopment of the site will promote public safety, encourage walking and transit usage
       and improve safety and the pedestrian environment.

       1.4.5               Schedule

       Construction of the Project is estimated to last approximately 18 months, with initial site
       work expected to begin in the last quarter of 2012. There will be a one-month site
       mobilization period.

       Typical construction hours will be in compliance with the City's Construction Ordinance:
       from 7:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Monday through Friday with no work anticipated on the
       weekends. In the event that weekend work is necessary, the Proponent will obtain required
       City approvals.

1.5    Public Benefits

       The development at 161 South Huntington Avenue will generate a myriad of public
       benefits for the surrounding neighborhoods and the City of Boston as a whole. These
       public benefits fall into multiple categories, outlined below.

       1.5.1               Financial Benefits

       The Project will result in significant financial benefits to the City of Boston, including:

            Returning the property to the City's tax rolls following 100 years of ownership by a
            tax exempt entity;




3241 PNF/1.0-ProjectDescription.doc                       1-19                               Project Description
161 South Huntington Avenue                                                              Epsilon Associates, Inc.
            Creating significant additional real estate tax revenues to the City's General Fund
            commencing after project completion, totaling over $9 million of net new tax
            revenue over the next 20 years;

            Creating approximately 26 affordable housing units located on-site;

            Creating approximately 225 construction jobs and 10 new permanent, on-site jobs;

            Providing additional customers for retail shops and markets in the neighborhood of
            the Project.

       1.5.2         Urban Design Benefits

       The development of the Project will help to define the image and design quality of the
       Jamaicaway edge of the area, and will enhance the overall urban design quality and public
       realm of the corridor as a whole in the vicinity of the Project. The Project will include
       significant streetscape improvements to the pedestrian realm on both sides of the Project
       site formed by South Huntington Avenue and the Jamaicaway. These improvements will
       include the following:

       South Huntington Avenue:

            Extending Jamaica Plain's residential fabric into an area primarily made up of
            institutional uses;

            Constructing 26 affordable housing units on site;

            Creating a high-quality, appealing and consistently designed edge to the pedestrian
            environment along the side of South Huntington Avenue;

            Constructing a new concrete sidewalk with handicapped accessible access to main
            lobby entry, opposite the existing pedestrian cross-walk;

            Replacing existing damaged fence with new continuous metal fencing integrated
            into new landscape elements;

            Developing new flush decorative paving at primary pedestrian entries;

            Planting new street trees, shrubs and seasonal perennials;

            Improving vehicular entrance to the site, roadway quality,         traffic flow, and
            pedestrian safety;

            Re-grading and reconstructing existing sidewalks to eliminate accessibility issues
            and cross-slope issues; and

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                Epsilon Associates, Inc.
            Reducing on-grade parking along South Huntington Avenue from 53 spaces to 16
            spaces and reducing impervious paving. The balance of the parking will be placed
            below the building.

       Jamaicaway:

            Maintaining, repairing and repainting the existing iron fence and brick piers;

            Maintaining and caring for the mature stand of existing oak trees, with infill of
            native shrubs, ground cover, and perennial planting, and stabilizing the eroding
            slope;

            Cooperating with The Emerald Necklace Conservancy, including support for
            programs;

            Setting back structures on the Jamaicaway in excess of the adjacent building
            setbacks; and

            Extending residential fabric of Jamaica Plain.

       1.5.3         Smart Growth/Transit-Oriented Development

       The Project represents the epitome of smart-growth and transit-oriented development by
       concentrating new residential uses in close proximity to major regional rapid transit and bus
       lines that provide easy access to the Project site from all neighborhoods of the City of
       Boston and the City's suburbs. The Project will create many new pedestrian trips every day,
       enlivening the proximate streetscape and providing more foot traffic for local businesses
       and restaurants. The Project will likely eliminate many hours of commuter travel per year
       by residents of the Project who may have lived further away from their workplaces.

       1.5.3.1       Sustainable Development

       Sustainability informs every design decision. Enduring and efficient buildings conserve
       embodied energy and preserve natural resources. The Project at 161 South Huntington
       Avenue is designed to satisfy market demands for efficient, urban apartment homes with
       flexible layouts. Durable materials will be used throughout the buildings. The Project
       embraces the opportunity to positively influence the urban environment. Its urban location
       takes advantage of existing infrastructure while convenient access to mass transportation
       will reduce dependence on single occupant vehicle trips and minimize transportation
       impacts. Bicycle storage will be provided on-site at a ratio of one bike per apartment, and
       Zipcar access will provide residents with transportation alternatives. The building will seek
       LEED Certification at a minimum of a Certified level under the LEED rating system through
       the submission of a LEED scorecard which will include an explanation of the Project's
       approach to achieving each of the identified LEED points.

1.7    Consistency with Zoning Regulations

       1.7.1         Large Project Review

       The proposed Project is subject to the BRA's Article 80 Large Project Review process as a
       result of the new construction.

       1.7.2         Consistency with Zoning

       According to Zoning Map 9B, the Property is located within a Neighborhood Institutional
       ("NI") Subdistrict and the Greenbelt Protection Overlay District ("GPOD") of the Jamaica
       Plain Neighborhood District (Map 9B of the Zoning Districts of the City of Boston). As
       described below, it is anticipated that the Project will require a GPOD Conditional Use
       Permit and dimensional variances.

       1.7.3         Use Regulations

       Multi-family residential uses and accessory parking are allowed as of right in the NI
       Subdistrict. Therefore, no zoning relief is needed for the proposed uses at the Property.

       1.7.3.1       Greenbelt Protection Overlay District

       Article 29 requires the Board of Appeals to issue a Conditional Use Permit for any proposed
       project in excess of 5,000 square feet of gross floor area within the GPOD. The proposed
       project will have approximately 190,000 square feet of gross floor area; accordingly, a
       Conditional Use Permit will be required for the proposed project.

       1.7.4         Bulk and Dimensional Restrictions

       Table I of Article 55 contains the relevant dimensional regulations for the NI Subdistrict. It
       is anticipated that zoning relief will be required from the following bulk and dimensional
       requirements:

            Minimum Lot Size for Dwelling Units;

            Floor Area Ratio; and

            Building Height.

       1.7.4.1       Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading

       The Proponent proposes to construct 170 off-street parking spaces, 154 of which will be
       located in a garage partially underground. Under the Zoning Code, the BRA determines off-
       street parking requirements during Large Project Review.

       As stated in Section 55-40 of the Zoning Code, the BRA will determine any off-street
       loading requirements during Large Project Review.

       1.7.5         Inclusionary Housing

       The Project is also consistent with the City's inclusionary development requirement. The
       Proponent will construct 26 affordable housing units on site.

1.8    Legal Information

       1.8.1         Legal Judgments Adverse to the Proposed Project

       The Proponent is not aware of any legal judgments in effect or legal actions pending that
       are adverse to the Project.

       1.8.2         History of Tax Arrears on Property

       The Proponent is not in tax arrears on any property owned within the City of Boston.

       1.8.3         Site Control / Public Easements

       The property is currently owned by The Home for Little Wanderers, Inc. BRG 161 South
       Huntington LLC has the right to purchase the property pursuant to the Purchase and Sale
       Agreement. There are no public easements on the site.

2.0    TRANSPORTATION

2.1    Introduction

       In accordance with the Boston Transportation Department's (BTD's) Transportation Access
       Plan Guidelines (2001) and the BRA Development Review Guidelines (2006), this Section
       describes roadway, pedestrian, and bicycle conditions; transportation issues; parking and
       loading; and transportation goals for the 161 South Huntington Avenue Project ("the
       Project").

       2.1.1.         Project Description

       The Project site, located at 161 South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain, is bounded by
       Jamaicaway to the west, South Huntington Avenue to the east and institutional-use
       buildings to the north and south (see Figure 2-1). The site currently contains the former
       Home for Little Wanderers.

       The Project will include construction of approximately 196 residential apartments with 170
       parking spaces. Of the 170 parking spaces designed to support the residential units, 154
       will be located in the garage below the building and 16 in the front surface lot.

       Vehicular access to the site is currently provided via two curb cuts on South Huntington
       Avenue, including one approximately 19-foot wide curb and one approximately 18-foot
       wide curb, both providing access to surface parking lots. Access to the site will continue to
       be provided on South Huntington Avenue in approximately the same location as the current
       driveways. The northern site driveway will be widened and will shift south to accommodate
       improved access for two-way traffic. The southern site driveway will remain in its same
       location but will also be widened and will serve as a one-way, right-only exit.

       All loading, trash pick-up, and move-in/move-out activities will occur on-site from the front
       surface parking lot.

       The primary pedestrian access to the residential building will be provided along South
       Huntington Avenue.

       2.1.2          Methodology

       As described above, in accordance with Boston Transportation Department (BTD)
       Transportation Access Plan Guidelines (2001), the study team conducted a transportation
       analysis for the Project. The analysis is summarized in the following sections:

            The first section comprises an inventory of existing transportation conditions,
            including roadway and intersection conditions, parking, transit, pedestrian and
            bicycle circulation, loading, and site conditions.

            The second section evaluates future transportation conditions and assesses potential
            traffic impacts associated with the Project and other neighboring projects. Long-
            term impacts are evaluated for the year 2017, based on a five-year horizon from the
            2012 base year. Expected roadway, parking, transit, pedestrian, and loading
            capacities and deficiencies are identified. In addition to an Existing Conditions
            analysis, the study includes the following scenarios:

               o   The No-Build Scenario (2017) includes only general background growth as no
                   proposed or planned projects are close enough or large enough to impact the
                   vicinity of the site; and

               o   The Build Scenario (2017) includes specific travel demand forecasts for the
                   Project.

            A third section identifies appropriate measures to mitigate project-related impacts
            identified above.

            Finally, an evaluation of the short-term traffic impacts during construction is also
            included.

       2.1.3         Study Area

       The study area includes the following five intersections (see Figure 2-2):

       South Huntington Avenue, an urban minor arterial, runs northwest-southeast between
       Huntington Avenue to the northwest and Centre Street to the southeast. South Huntington
       Avenue consists of two vehicle and two bicycle travel lanes, one each in each direction,
       plus sidewalks on each side. In the immediate vicinity of the Project, unrestricted parking,
       and MBTA bus stops occupy the curb fronts on both sides of the street.

       Bynner Street is a local roadway running east-west between Creighton Street to the east and
       Jamaicaway to the west. Unrestricted parking is provided on both sides of Bynner Street.

       2.2.2         Intersection Conditions

       2.2.2.1       Signalized Intersections

       South Huntington Avenue/Veteran's Hospital Mid-block Crossing is a signalized mid-block
       pedestrian crossing. The South Huntington Avenue northbound and southbound
       approaches each consist of a 12-foot through lane with a 6-foot bicycle lane and 8.5-foot
       parking lane. Parking is not allowed on any of the approaches at the intersection. A
       crosswalk with wheelchair ramps on each side crosses the intersection from east to west.
       Pedestrian pushbuttons activate a pedestrian signal phase at the intersection.

       South Huntington Avenue/Bynner Street is a four-way signalized intersection. The Bynner
       Street eastbound approach consists of a 10-foot, shared left/through/right-turn lane. The
       Bynner Street westbound approach consists of a 9-foot, shared left/through/right-turn lane.
       The South Huntington Avenue northbound approach consists of a 12-foot, shared
       left/through/right-turn lane. The South Huntington Avenue southbound approach consists of
       a 12-foot, shared left/through/right-turn lane and a 14.5-foot, unmarked, exclusive right-turn
       lane with 6-foot bicycle lanes running north and south along South Huntington Avenue.
       Parking is permitted along both Bynner Street approaches. An MBTA bus stop is located at
       the approach of South Huntington Avenue northbound. Crosswalks and wheel chair ramps
       are provided at all four legs of the intersection. Pushbuttons activate pedestrian phases at
       the intersection.

       2.2.2.2       Unsignalized Intersections

       South Huntington Avenue/North Site Drive is an unsignalized intersection with three
       approaches. The North Site Drive eastbound approach, which operates under stop sign
       control, consists of a 9.5-foot, shared left/right-turn lane. The South Huntington Avenue
       northbound approach consists of a 12-foot, shared left-turn/through lane. The South
       Huntington Avenue southbound approach consists of a 12-foot, shared through/right-turn
       lane with a 6-foot bicycle lane and 8.5-foot parking lane provided along both sides of South
       Huntington Avenue.

       South Huntington Avenue/South Site Drive is an unsignalized intersection with three
       approaches. The South Site Drive eastbound approach, which operates under stop sign
       control, consists of a 9-foot, shared left/right-turn lane. The South Huntington Avenue

       northbound approach consists of a 12-foot, shared left-turn/through lane. The South
       Huntington Avenue southbound approach consists of a 12-foot, shared through/right-turn
       lane. A 6-foot bicycle lane and parking lane are provided along both sides of South
       Huntington Avenue.

       South Huntington Avenue/Hospital Entrance is an unsignalized intersection with three
       approaches. The Hospital Entrance westbound approach, which operates under stop sign
       control, consists of a 12-foot, shared left/right-turn lane. The South Huntington Avenue
       northbound approach consists of a 12-foot, shared through/right-turn lane. The South
       Huntington Avenue southbound approach consists of a 12-foot, shared left-turn/through
       lane. A 6-foot bicycle lane and parking lane are provided along both sides of South
       Huntington Avenue.

       2.2.3         Traffic Conditions

       Turning movement counts were based on data collected during the weekday morning (7:00
       a.m. to 9:00 a.m.) and evening (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) peak periods on Thursday, February
       2, 2012. Based on these counts, the weekday peak hours were identified as 7:30­8:30 a.m.
       and 4:00­5:00 p.m.

       Figure 2-3 shows the existing peak-hour turning volumes for the study area intersections.
       The existing traffic volumes include the traffic generated by the existing, approximately
       55,580-sf of institutional space located at 161 South Huntington Avenue. Complete traffic
       count data are provided in Appendix B.

       2.2.3.1       Traffic Operations

       The study team used Trafficware's Synchro 6 software to analyze Level of Service (LOS) and
       delay at study area intersections. This tool is based on the methodology specified in the
       Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). HCM methods
       analyze the capacity of an intersection by determining the LOS, delay (in seconds), volume-
       to-capacity (v/c) ratio, and 95th percentile queue length (in feet), based on the intersection
       geometry, traffic control, and available traffic data for each intersection.

       The v/c ratio is a measure of congestion at an intersection approach. A v/c ratio of 1 or
       greater indicates that the traffic volume on the intersection approach exceeds capacity.

       The 95th percentile queue length represents the farthest extent of the vehicle queue (to the
       last stopped vehicle) upstream from the stop line during 95% of all signal cycles. The 95th
       percentile queue will not be seen during each cycle. The queue would be this long only
       5% of the time. These queues would typically not be seen during off-peak hours.

       Table 2-1, derived from the HCM, provides LOS criteria for signalized and unsignalized
       intersections. LOS A defines the most favorable condition, with minimum traffic delay.
       LOS F represents the worst condition (unacceptable), with significant traffic delay. LOS D is
       generally considered acceptable in an urban environment.

       Existing Conditions signal timing and phasing information was provided by the Boston
       Transportation Department. Field observations were also made to verify Synchro model
       accuracy as well as to calibrate the model as necessary to match existing traffic conditions
       as closely as possible. To depict behavior as observed in the field, the model was modified
       to include 25-foot storage lanes on South Huntington Avenue both for right turning vehicles
       coming from the north and for left turning vehicle movements coming from the south.

       Table 2-2 and Table 2-3 summarize the existing weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak
       hour Level of Service results for the study area intersections. Capacity analysis reports are
       provided in Appendix B.

       All of the study area intersections operate at an acceptable overall LOS (LOS D or better)
       during both peak hours. In the p.m. peak hour, all approaches actually operate at LOS C or
       better. Only two individual intersection approaches operate below LOS D, in the a.m. peak
       hour only.

              South Huntington Avenue/Bynner Street ­ the Bynner Street eastbound shared left-
              turn/through/right-turn lane operates at LOS E due to the high volume of left turns at
              this approach (approximately 200 vehicles per hour); and

              South Huntington Avenue/North Site Drive ­ the North Site Drive eastbound shared
              left/right-turn lane operates at LOS F due to the high volume of traffic from the
              through movements on South Huntington northbound.

       2.2.4           Parking

       2.2.4.1         On-street Parking

       Figure 2-4 presents an inventory of existing curb use and parking restrictions along South
       Huntington Avenue adjacent to the Project site. On-street parking adjacent to the site
       consists of mainly unrestricted parking and no-stopping zones, on both sides of the street.

       2.2.4.2         Off-street Parking

       Within the study area, there is no public off-street parking. On the east side of South
       Huntington Avenue, however, there is a large surface lot used for employees, patients and
       visitors of the Veterans Administration Hospital.

       2.2.5           Public Transportation in the Study Area

       The Project site is located within convenient walking distance of the Massachusetts Bay
       Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line station at Heath Street, as well as local bus
       service. Public transportation services within the approximate quarter mile (5 to 10-minute
       walk) of the Project site are summarized in Table 2-4 and illustrated in Figure 2-5.

       The Project is also located approximately one-half mile (a 10-15 minute walk) from the
       MBTA's Brookline Village stop on the Green Riverside (D) Line, as well as many other
       MBTA bus routes.

       2.2.6           Pedestrian Access and Circulation

       Sidewalks are provided on both sides of all roadways within the study area. As is common
       in urban settings, the effective widths of sidewalks in the study area are narrowed due to the
       presence of light posts, parking meters, street trees, and other obstacles located along the
       sidewalk path. The conditions of the sidewalks within the study are described below:

            South Huntington Avenue ­ In the vicinity of the Project site, sidewalks in good
            condition between 7 and 15 feet wide are provided along both sides of South
            Huntington Avenue.

            Bynner Street ­ Sidewalks are provided along both sides of Bynner Street ranging in
            width between 7 and 10 feet. Sidewalks are generally in good condition.

       Crosswalks, handicap accessible ramps, and concurrent pedestrian phases are provided at
       all study area intersections and the midblock pedestrian crossing. Figure 2-6 illustrates
       existing pedestrian volumes during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

       2.2.7         Bicycle Accommodations

       South Huntington Avenue is classified as suitable for "intermediate" cyclists according to
       the 2010 Bike Routes of Boston Map. The Project site is also located within approximately
       one-half mile of the Jamaicaway Path, which is a recreational trail for the exclusive use of
       cyclists and pedestrians. The path travels from the southernmost part of Jamaica Pond Park
       to the MBTA Green Line Fenway Station.

       In July 2011, the City of Boston launched Hubway, a bicycle sharing program. To date,
       Hubway hosts 600 bicycles at 60 different locations across the city. As part of this program,
       cyclists are able to rent a bicycle from one location and return it to any other station,
       facilitating point-to-point travel within the City. Two Hubway stations are proposed within
       approximately one mile of the Project site, including the intersections of Brigham
       Circle/Calumet Street, and Tremont Street/Columbus Avenue. Except for the winter season,
       these bicycle facilities will be available to the public at all times

       Bicycle volumes during the weekday a. m. and p.m. peak hour are illustrated in Figure 2-7;
       bicycle volumes in the study area are generally moderate. No bicycle racks are currently
       provided on-site.

2.3    Evaluation of Long-term Impacts

       This section describes and evaluates the 2017 No-Build and Build Conditions. The
       methodology is in keeping with the City of Boston's Transportation access Guidelines
       (2001).

       2.3.1         No-Build Conditions

       No-Build traffic conditions, independent of the proposed Project, include existing traffic
       plus any new traffic expected in the study area either from general background growth or
       identified development projects in the area.

       2.3.1.1        Background Traffic Growth

       Two procedures are generally used in combination to determine background traffic growth.
       The first procedure is to estimate traffic generated by planned new major developments and
       anticipated roadway changes. In collaboration with the Boston Redevelopment Authority
       (BRA), the study team identified no development projects in the immediate area that would
       be constructed within the five-year planning horizon.

       The second part of the procedure is to apply a general growth rate to account other smaller
       planned/approved development projects and changes in demographics, auto usage, and
       auto ownership. For this study a background growth rate of approximately one-half percent
       per year was selected. No traffic improvements that would affect the analysis were planned
       within the study area by the Build year.

       2.3.1.2        No-Build Conditions Traffic Operations

       The 2017 No-Build analysis uses the methodology described under Existing Conditions.
       No-Build traffic volumes are shown in Figure 2-8. The resulting intersection operations are
       shown in Table 2-5 and Table 2-6. Complete Synchro reports are provided in Appendix B.

       Intersection and approach LOS remain largely unchanged under No-Build conditions.
       However, at South Huntington Avenue/Bynner Street one approach that that already
       operates below LOS D will experience a decrease in level of service during both peak
       periods. During the a.m. peak hour, LOS on the Bynner Street eastbound left-
       turn/through/right-turn lane will decrease from LOS E to LOS F without changing the
       acceptable LOS D for the overall intersection.

       2.3.2           Build Conditions

       As summarized in Section 2.1.1 Project Description, the Project will result in the
       construction of approximately 196 residential apartments and 170 parking spaces. The site
       access and circulation plan is show in Figure 2-9.

       2.3.2.1         Site Access and Circulation

       Vehicular access to the site is currently provided via two curb cuts on South Huntington
       Avenue, including one approximately 19 feet wide and a second approximately 18 feet foot
       wide. Both driveways provide access to a surface parking lot. Access to the site will
       continue to be provided on South Huntington Avenue in approximately the same locations
       as the current driveways. The Northern Site Driveway will be widened and shift south to
       accommodate two-way traffic. The Southern Site Driveway will remain in the same location
       but will also be widened and made one-way to act as a right-turn only exit.

       All loading, trash pick-up, and move-in/move-out activities will occur on-site from the front
       surface parking lot.

       2.3.2.2        Trip Generation and Mode Split

       Trip generation for the proposed retail uses was derived from the Institute of Transportation
       Engineers' (ITE) publication Trip Generation (8th edition, 2008), using the following Land
       Use Codes (LUC):

             LUC 223 ­ Mid-Rise Apartment ­ is used for rental dwelling units located within the
             same building of between three and 10 floors. This LUC was chosen as the closest
             match to that of the proposed residential use for the a.m. and p.m. peak hour. The
             average rates were used to estimate person trips associated with the residential use
             during all time periods; and

             LUC 222 ­ High-Rise Apartment ­ is used for rental dwelling units located within
             the same building that have more than 10 floors. Since the trip generation data for
             LUC 223 is only available for the a.m. and p.m. peak hour, the daily tip generation
             was estimated using data form this LUC, since it was the next closest match. The
             fitted curve equation was used to estimate person trips associated with the
             residential use.

       BTD publishes transit, walk/bike, and vehicle mode split rates for different areas of Boston;
       the Project is located within designated Area 5. Mode split assumptions based on BTD's
       Area 5 data and local vehicle occupancy rates from 2009 National Household Travel
       Survey and the 2000 U.S. Census are summarized in Table 2-7.

       To estimate the net new trips associated with redevelopment of the site, trip generation for
       the existing site uses was determined from the driveway counts and subtracted from the
       Project-generated trips. The adjusted net new vehicle trips for the Project are summarized in
       Table 2-9.

       Peak hour trip generation from the Project is virtually unchanged from the existing use on
       the site. During the a.m. peak hour, there will be only one more vehicle trip generated by
       the Project, while during the p.m. peak hour, vehicle trip generation at the site will
       decrease by two trips. The use of the driveways will redistribute site traffic somewhat,
       however.

       With the addition of the small number of new vehicle trips added by the Project, all study
       area intersections will continue to operate with the same level of service as under No-Build
       Conditions, and no adverse impacts from the Project will occur. During the morning peak
       hour, approaches at two intersection locations operate poorly while the overall intersection
       will function within acceptable ranges.

       2.3.2.5       Parking Supply and Demand

       With 170 combined surface and garage parking spaces for 196 residential units, the
       resulting parking ratio is 0.87 spaces per unit. The Boston Transportation Department (BTD)
       has set parking space goals and guidelines throughout the City to establish the amount of
       parking supply provided with new developments. BTD's maximum parking ratio guidelines
       for residential use in Jamaica Plain near an MBTA Station is 0.75-1.25 spaces per unit.
       Distance "near MBTA Station" is defined as within 10 minute walking distance; the site fits
       that definition, as it is within one-quarter mile (a 5-10 minute walk) from the MBTA Green
       Line Heath Street Station.

       2.3.2.6       Public Transportation

       As shown in Table 2-8, the Project will generate an estimated 178 daily transit trips; with 13
       transit trips (9 boarding and 8 alighting) during the a.m. peak hour and 17 new trips (7
       boarding and 8 alighting) during the p.m. peak hour. The small number of project-generated
       transit trips is not expected to affect transit service adversely in the study area. The
       Proponent is committed to promoting transit use among Project residents and visitors, as
       discussed under the Transportation Demand Management section below.

       2.3.2.7       Pedestrian Access and Circulation

       On a daily basis, the Project will generate an estimated 212 pedestrian and bicycle trips in
       addition to the 178 new transit trips that will require a walk to or from the site. This results
       in an additional 390 new pedestrian or bicycle trips per day. Approximately 29 pedestrian
       and bicycle trips in and out of the site will occur during the a.m. peak hour, and 37
       pedestrian or bicycle trips in and out will occur during the p.m. peak hour, plus 13 and 17
       transit trips, respectively. Pedestrian and bicycle trip generation is summarized in Table 2-8,
       with detailed trip generation data provided in Appendix B The Proponent is committed to
       promoting bicycle use among Project residents, workers and visitors, as discussed under the
       Transportation Demand Management section below.

       2.3.2.8       Bicycle Accommodations

       Secure bicycle storage will be made available for building residents and tenants within the
       parking garage area and/or within the proposed building per City of Boston Bicycle Parking
       Guidelines, which require a minimum of one bicycle parking space per residential unit.
       Additional bicycle racks for workers, visitors, and guests will also be provided near main
       entrances to the new building.




3241 PNF/2.0-Transportation.doc                   2-28                                 Transportation

       All bicycle racks, signs, and parking areas will conform to BTD standards and be sited in
       safe, secure locations. The Proponent will work with BTD to identify the most appropriate
       quantity and location for bicycle racks on the Project site as part of the Transportation
       Access Plan Agreement (TAPA) process.

       2.3.2.9        Loading and Service

       All loading, trash pick-up, and move-in/move-out activities for the Project will occur on-site
       in the front surface parking lot (see Figure 2-9).

       The expected loading and service vehicle demands of the Project, by use, are presented in
       Table 2-12.

Table 2-12       Expected Loading and Service Activity

                                                                Number of Vehicles

       1. 0.04 trucks per day/1,000 sf residential, per HSH survey of Tremont-on-the-Common


       As shown above, the loading demand for the Project is between 6 and 10 deliveries per
       day, which corresponds to between 12 and 20 total vehicle trips in and out per day; these
       trips are included in the trip generation estimates provided in Table 2-8. With the exception
       of trash pick-up and move-in/move-out activities, most residential deliveries are made via
       smaller vehicles - cars, vans, or small panel trucks. Residential deliveries typically include
       overnight packages and food deliveries.

       A Transportation Coordinator will be appointed by the Project to manage loading activity
       and to coordinate residential move-in/move-out activities. Where possible, these activities
       will be scheduled during off-peak hours. Permanent "No Idling" signs will be posted in the
       loading and parking areas.

2.4    Traffic Mitigation Measures

       As the Project will generate virtually the same number of vehicle trips as the current land
       use on the site, no off-site geometric or traffic signal mitigation measures are proposed or
       necessary. Geometric and safety improvements are proposed for the site driveways and
       within the surface parking lot. The Proponent is committed to implementing appropriate
       transportation demand management (TDM) measures, as discussed in Section 2.6, below.




3241 PNF/2.0-Transportation.doc                         2-29                                        Transportation

2.5    Evaluation of Short-term Construction Impacts

       Details of the overall construction schedule, working hours, number of construction
       workers, worker transportation, and parking, number of construction vehicles, and routes
       will be addressed in detail in a Construction Management Plan (CMP) to be filed with BTD
       in accordance with the City's transportation maintenance plan requirements. The CMP will
       also address the need for pedestrian detours, lane closures, and/or parking restrictions, if
       necessary, to accommodate a safe and secure work zone.

       To minimize transportation impacts during the construction period, the following measures
       will be incorporated into the CMP:

            Construction worker parking will be limited on-site. Workers will be encouraged to
            use public transportation and/or carpool;

            A subsidy for MBTA passes will be considered for full-time employees; and

            Secure spaces will be provided on-site for workers' supplies and tools so they do not
            have to be brought to the site each day.

       Additional information on the Project's construction-period impacts is presented in Section
       3.11 of this PNF.

2.6    Transportation Demand Management

       The Proponent is committed to implementing Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
       measures that support the City's efforts to reduce dependency on the automobile by
       encouraging travelers to use alternatives to driving alone, especially during peak periods.
       TDM will be facilitated by the nature of the Project and its proximity to public transit.

       The Proponent will emphasize the site's convenient transit and pedestrian access in
       marketing the Project to future residents and tenants. On-site management will provide
       transit information (schedules, maps, fare information) in the building lobbies for residents,
       workers, and visitors.

            Additional TDM measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:

            Bicycle Storage ­ The Project Proponent will provide secure bicycle storage for
            residents, workers, and visitors in accordance with the City of Boston Bicycle
            Parking Guidelines and will investigate the possibility of sponsoring a shared-
            bicycle location near the site.

            Constrained Parking ­ The Project does not exceed BTD district maximum parking
            ratios.



3241 PNF/2.0-Transportation.doc                   2-30                                Transportation
161 South Huntington Avenue                                                     Howard/Stein-Hudson
            Electric Vehicle Charging ­ The Proponent will explore the feasibility of providing
            electric vehicle charging stations on-site.

            Project Web Site ­ The Proponent will include public transportation information for
            residents and visitors will be included on the Project's Web Site.

            Shared-Car Service -- The Proponent will also evaluate the feasibility of providing
            shared cars on-site (e.g., Zipcar), as there are no spaces provided within a one-half
            mile radius. The Proponent will allocate spaces in the front surface parking lot for
            shared-car services to allow access to these from the neighborhood.

            Tenant and Employee Orientation Packet ­ These packets will provide all new
            tenants with information concerning available TDM programs and public
            transportation in the area, including route maps, schedules, and fare information.

       Transportation Coordinator ­ An on-site transportation coordinator will oversee
       transportation issues, including parking, residential move-in and move-out, and service and
       loading. The transportation coordinator will also work with residents as they move in to
       raise awareness of public transportation alternatives.

2.7    Summary and Conclusions

       With the addition of the small number of new vehicle trips added by the Project, all study
       area intersections will continue to operate with the same, if not better, level of service as
       under No-Build Conditions, and no adverse impacts will occur.

3.0    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

3.1    Wind

       The Project involves the demolition of three existing buildings ranging in height from 25
       feet to 50 feet. The Project will be similar in height and scale to the existing building on the
       Project site. Further, the Project is similar in height and scale to the surrounding
       neighborhood buildings including both the five - six story Sherrill House to the north as
       well as the six ­ seven story Goddard House to the south. Buildings of similar height in an
       area tend to shelter one another from wind. The Project is not expected to cause negative
       impacts to pedestrian level winds.

3.2    Shadow

       The Proponent conducted a shadow impact analysis as typically required by the BRA. The
       analysis evaluated shadow conditions during three time periods (9:00 a.m., 12:00 noon,
       and 3:00 p.m.) during the summer solstice (June 21), autumnal equinox (September 21),
       and the winter solstice (December 21). The shadow impacts from the vernal equinox
       (March 21) and the autumnal equinox would be virtually the same if studied at the same
       time periods. Therefore for this study, the vernal equinox shadow impacts are studied as if
       March 21 was still in Standard Time, meaning they are studied during the time periods of
       10:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m. In addition, shadow studies were conducted for the
       6:00 p.m. time period during the summer solstice and autumnal equinox. Shadows were
       determined using the applicable altitude and azimuth data for Boston.

       The shadow impact analysis includes net new shadow as well as existing shadow. The
       incremental impact of new shadow cast by the Project is shown in light orange in Figures 3-
       1 through 3-14, while existing shadows are shown in gray. The shadow analysis focuses on
       public open spaces, major pedestrian areas, sidewalks, and plazas in the Project vicinity.

       The studies measure the increase in shadow from existing to full-build conditions, but the
       studies do not take into consideration shadows cast by existing trees, which in this case is
       significant due to the density of the large and mature stand of trees being maintained along
       the Jamaicaway. There are approximately 12 oak trees of 34-inch caliper or greater with
       heights averaging from 60 to 80 feet along the Jamaicaway sidewalk. Inside the sidewalk
       there are 35 trees, consisting mainly of oaks ranging in size from 18 to 24 inches with
       heights averaging from 50 to 80 feet. These trees are all deciduous and cast significant
       shadows when fully leafed, and also impact shadows in the winter months.

       The shadow impact analysis shows that new shadow from the Project will mainly occur on
       the Project site. No new shadow will be cast onto Olmsted Park during 13 of the 14 time
       periods studied. No new shadow will be cast onto Jamaicaway during 12 of the 14 time
       periods studied. New shadow is cast onto small portions of South Huntington Avenue

       during the afternoon time periods; however, bus stops on South Huntington Avenue are
       free from new shadow during 12 of the 14 time periods studied. No new shadow is cast
       onto any other open spaces in the surrounding area.

       3.2.1         Vernal Equinox (March 21)

       At 10:00 a.m. on the vernal equinox, new shadow from the Project will extend in a
       westerly direction toward but not onto Jamaicaway and Olmsted Park (see Figure 3-1).
       Three fingers of new shadow will extend into the wooded area on the western side of the
       Project site.

       At 1:00 p.m., the Project will cast new shadow across a portion of the proposed elevated
       terraces (see Figure 3-2). New shadow will also extend north of the Project.

       At 4:00 p.m., new shadow from the proposed Project will extend east and northeast across
       the parking lot and access drive (see Figure 3-3). New shadow will cover a short stretch of
       South Huntington Avenue and its western sidewalk.

       No new shadows reach the Jamaicaway or Olmsted Park during the vernal equinox time
       periods studied.

       3.2.2         Summer Solstice (June 21)

       At 9:00 a.m. on the summer solstice, three fingers of new shadow from the Project will
       extend westward over the wooded area on the western side of the Project site (see Figure 3-
       4). This new shadow will not reach the Jamaicaway.

       At 12:00 noon, the Project will cast minimal new shadow over strips of land at the extreme
       southern end of each elevated terrace (see Figure 3-5). A small band of new shadow will
       also fall just north of the Project site.

       At 3:00 p.m., new shadows cast to the east will cover a portion of the parking lot and
       access way but will not reach South Huntington Avenue (see Figure 3-6).

       At 6:00 p.m., shadows will extend eastward from the Project, covering the parking lot,
       access driveway, and a stretch of South Huntington Avenue and its sidewalks (see Figure 3-
       7). However, a significant portion of this area is already covered by existing shadow. New
       shadow is also cast onto the bus stop on the eastern side of South Huntington Avenue.

       No new shadows reach the Jamaicaway or Olmsted Park during the summer solstice time
       periods studied.

       3.2.3         Autumnal Equinox (September 21)

       At 9:00 a.m., new shadows extending northwest will just reach the Jamaicaway (see Figure
       3-8). These new shadows will also cover a portion of the wooded space on the western
       side of the Project.

       At 12:00 noon, new shadows will extend north of the Project, covering portions of the
       elevated terraces. (see Figure 3-9).

       At 3:00 p.m., shadows will extend to the east and northeast, and the Project will cast new
       shadow across the parking lot and accessway (see Figure 3-10). No new shadow will reach
       South Huntington Avenue. The Project will result in minor new shadow on the
       southeastern corner of each of the two elevated terraces.

       At 6:00 p.m., shadows will extend eastward. Given the low angle of the sun, existing
       shadow is extensive at this hour. New shadow will be cast on a small portion of South
       Huntington Avenue and its sidewalks. (see Figure 3-11).

       No new shadows reach the Jamaicaway or Olmsted Park during the autumnal equinox time
       periods studied.

       3.2.4         Winter Solstice (December 21)

       The winter solstice creates the least favorable conditions for sunlight in New England. The
       sun angle during the winter is lower than in any other season, causing the shadows in urban
       areas to elongate and be cast onto large portions of the surrounding area.

       At 9:00 a.m., the Project will extend existing shadow to the northwest across portions of
       Jamaicaway and onto Olmsted Park (see Figure 3-12).

       At 12:00 noon, shadows will extend to the north. New shadow from the Project will cover
       a portion of the wooded are on the west side of the Project site (see Figure 3-13). New
       shadow will also extend over the area between the building and the existing building to the
       north of the site. The existing shadow on the two elevated terraces will be extended.

       At 3:00 p.m., the Project will cast new shadow to the northeast across South Huntington
       Avenue and onto a bus stop on the eastern side of the street (see Figure 3-14). The existing
       shadow on the proposed parking lot and accessway will be extended.

       3.2.5         Conclusions

       In order to provide a conservative shadow analysis, these studies did not take into
       consideration shadows cast by existing trees, which in this case is significant due to the
       density of the large and mature stand of trees being maintained along the Jamaicaway. The
       Project will not cast new shadow onto Olmsted Park except during winter mornings. New

          shadows resulting from the Project will generally be limited to the Project's wooded area
          located between the Project and Jamaicaway, space between the Project and the existing
          building to the north, the proposed parking lot, and a portion of South Huntington Avenue.
          New shadow will be cast onto two bus stops only during one time period each.

3.3       Daylight

          The new building is setback from both South Huntington Avenue and the Jamaicaway
          which minimizes any potential daylight impacts. The massing of the new building is also
          designed as an inverted "E" with one-story plinths breaking the massing and minimizing
          daylight obstruction when viewed from the Jamaicaway. In addition, due to the modest
          height of the new building, daylight impacts are expected to be minimal.

3.4       Solar Glare

          The Project does not include the use of reflective glass or other reflective materials on the
          building facades that would result in adverse impacts from reflected solar glare from the
          Project.

3.5       Air Quality

          3.5.1          Introduction

          An air quality analysis was conducted to determine the impact of pollutant emissions from
          mobile source emissions generated by the Project. A microscale analysis is typically
          performed to evaluate the potential air quality impacts of carbon monoxide (CO) due to
          traffic flow around the Project area.

          The impacts were added to monitored background values and compared to the Federal
          National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The standards were developed by EPA
          to protect human health against adverse health effects with a margin of safety.

          The modeling methodology was developed in accordance with the latest Massachusetts
          Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) modeling policies and Federal
          modeling guidelines.1 The air quality analysis results show that CO concentrations at the
          receptors studied are well under NAAQS thresholds.

          Modeling assumptions and backup data for results presented in this section are provided in
          the Appendix C.

        Additionally, small stationary sources such as boilers and emergency generators may
        require registration under MassDEP's Environmental Results Program (ERP) if they meet
        specified criteria. Any impacts from these small sources would be evaluated under the ERP
        program and would be expected to meet all applicable emissions and air quality standards.

        3.5.2         Microscale Analysis

        A microscale analysis is used to determine the effect on air quality of the increase in traffic
        generated by the Project. The Proponent is required to analyze local effects of the potential
        increase in traffic on ambient air quality near specific intersections. This microscale
        analysis is required for the Project at intersections where 1) Project traffic would impact
        intersections or roadway links currently operating at Level of Service (LOS) D, E, or F or
        would cause LOS to decline to D, E, or F; 2) Project traffic would increase traffic volumes
        on nearby roadways by 10% or more (unless the increase in traffic volume is less than 100
        vehicles per hour); or, 3) the Project will generate 3,000 or more new average daily trips on
        roadways providing access to a single location.2 The microscale analysis involves modeling
        of carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles idling at and traveling through signalized
        intersections. Predicted ambient concentrations of CO for the Build and No-Build cases are
        compared with federal and state ambient air quality standards for CO.

        The microscale analysis typically examines breathing-level (1.8 meter) CO impacts due to
        traffic queues in the immediate vicinity of a Project. CO is used in microscale studies to
        indicate roadway pollutant levels since it is the most abundant pollutant emitted by motor
        vehicles and can result in so-called "hot spot" (high concentration) locations around
        congested intersections. NAAQS have been established by the EPA for CO to protect the
        public health (known as primary standards). These standards do not allow ambient CO
        concentrations to exceed 35 parts per million (ppm) for a one-hour averaging period and 9
        ppm for an eight-hour averaging period, more than once per year at any location. The
        widespread use of CO catalysts on late-model vehicles has reduced the occurrences of CO
        hotspots. Air quality modeling techniques (computer simulation programs) are typically
        used to predict CO levels for both existing and future conditions to evaluate compliance of
        the roadways with the standards. The analysis followed the procedure outlined in U.S.
        EPA's intersection modeling guidance.3

        The microscale analysis has been conducted using the latest versions of EPA MOBILE6.2
        and CAL3QHC to estimate CO concentrations at sidewalk receptor locations.

       Baseline (2012) and future year (2017) emission factor data calculated from the MOBILE6.2
       model, along with traffic data, were input into the CAL3QHC program to determine CO
       concentrations due to traffic flowing through the selected intersections.

       Existing background values of CO at the nearest monitor location in Kenmore Square were
       obtained from the MassDEP. CAL3QHC and AERMOD results were then added to
       background CO values of 1.9 ppm (one-hour) and 1.5 ppm (eight-hour), as provided by the
       MassDEP, to determine total air quality impacts due to the Project. This value was
       compared to the NAAQS for CO of 35 ppm (one-hour) and 9 ppm (eight-hour).

       3.5.2.1       Intersection Selection

       An analysis of the five intersections from the traffic study was conducted (see Section 2,
       Transportation). Microscale modeling was performed for the one intersection that met the
       criteria for microscale analyses:

            the intersection of South Huntington Avenue and Bynner Street.

       The traffic volumes and LOS calculations provided in Section 2.0 (Transportation), form the
       basis of evaluating the traffic data versus the microscale thresholds. To summarize, this
       intersection is currently at a LOS D and will continue to operate at a LOS D with the
       Project.

       3.5.2.2       Emissions Calculations (MOBILE6.2)

       The EPA MOBILE6.2 computer program was used to estimate motor vehicle emission
       factors on the roadway network. Emission factors calculated by the MOBILE6.2 model are
       based on motor vehicle operations typical of daily periods. The Commonwealth's
       statewide annual Inspection and Maintenance (I&M) program was included, as well as the
       state specific vehicle age registration distribution. The input files for MOBILE6.2 for the
       existing (2012) and build year (2017) are provided by MassDEP. As is typical, minor edits
       to the files were necessary to allow the program to output emission factors for the various
       speeds used in the analysis.

       The current version of MOBILE6.2 does not explicitly calculate idle emissions. However,
       idle emissions can be obtained from a vehicle speed of 2.5 mph (the lowest speed
       MOBILE6 will model). The resulting emission rate given in (grams/mile) is then multiplied
       by 2.5 mph to estimate idle emissions (in grams/hour). Moving emissions are calculated
       based on actual speeds at which free-flowing vehicles travel through the intersections. A
       speed of 30 mph is used for all free-flow traffic. Speeds of 10 and 15 mph were used for
       right (and U-turns, if necessary) and left turns, respectively.

       Winter CO emission factors are typically higher than summer. Therefore winter vehicular
       emission factors were conservatively used in the microscale analysis.

        3.5.2.3        Receptors and Meteorology Inputs

        Sets of up to 150 receptors were placed in the vicinity of each of the modeled intersections.
        Receptors extended approximately 500 feet on the sidewalks along the roadways
        approaching the intersection. The roadway links and receptor locations of the modeled
        intersections are presented in Figure 3-15.

        For the CAL3QHC model, limited meteorological inputs are required. Following EPA
        guidance4, a wind speed of one m/s, stability class D (4), and a mixing height of 1,000
        meters was used. To account for the intersection geometry, wind directions from 0° to
        350°, every 10°, were selected. A surface roughness length of 175 cm was selected.5

        3.5.2.4        Impact Calculations (CAL3QHC)

        The CAL3QHC model predicts one-hour concentrations using queue-links at intersections,
        worst-case meteorological conditions, and traffic input data. The one-hour concentrations
        were scaled by a factor of 0.7 to estimate eight-hour concentrations.6 The CAL3QHC
        methodology was based on EPA CO modeling guidance. Signal timings were provided
        directly from the traffic modeling runs. The CAL3QHC input parameters are also described
        in Appendix C.

        3.5.2.5        Background Concentrations

        To estimate background pollutant levels representative of the area, the most recent air
        quality monitor data reported by the MassDEP in their Annual Air Quality Reports, was
        obtained for 2008 to 2010. MassDEP guidance specifies the use of the latest three years of
        available monitoring data from within 10 km of the Project site.

        The closest monitor is located at Kenmore Square, in Boston with others at One City Square
        in Charlestown, and 174 North Street in Boston. A summary of the background air quality
        concentrations are presented in Table 3-1. Observed concentrations are currently in
        compliance with applicable NAAQS.

        Background CO concentrations were determined from the closest available monitoring
        stations to the proposed Project. For use in the microscale analysis, background
        concentrations of CO in ppm were required. The corresponding maximum background
        concentrations in ppm were 1.9 ppm for one-hour and 1.5 ppm for eight-hour CO.

               3.5.3              Results

               3.5.3.1            Microscale Analysis

               The results of the maximum one-hour predicted CO concentrations from CAL3QHC are
               provided in Tables 3-2 through 3-4 for the 2012 and 2017 scenarios. Eight-hour average
               concentrations are calculated by multiplying the maximum one-hour concentrations by a
               factor of 0.7.7

               The results of the one-hour and eight-hour maximum modeled CO ground-level
               concentrations from CAL3QHC were added to EPA supplied background levels for
               comparison to the NAAQS. These values represent the highest potential concentrations at
               the intersection as they are predicted during the simultaneous occurrence of "defined"
               worst case meteorology. The highest one-hour traffic-related concentration predicted in the

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                                                Epsilon Associates Inc.
         area of the Project, for the modeled conditions (1.1 ppm) plus background (1.9 ppm), is 3.0
         ppm for the existing morning peak hour case. The highest eight-hour traffic-related
         concentration predicted in the area of the Project for the modeled conditions (0.8 ppm) plus
         background (1.5 ppm), is 2.3 ppm, again for the existing morning peak case. Both
         concentrations are well below the one-hour NAAQS of 35 ppm and the eight-hour NAAQS
         of 9 ppm.

         It would be expected that any other mitigation measures implemented to improve traffic
         flow at any of the modeled intersections would result in further improved air quality
         conditions.

         3.5.4             Conclusions

         Using conservative estimates, the CO concentrations at the nearest receptors for impacts
         from the intersection, plus monitored background values, are well under the CO NAAQS
         thresholds for the Existing, No Build and Build conditions. CO concentrations under
         existing conditions are typically higher than future years due to ongoing improvements in
         vehicle emission rates. The increase in traffic volumes attributed to build conditions in this
         case is not of a significant magnitude to overtake the reduction in per-vehicle emission
         rates.

3.6      Water Quality / Stormwater

         The Project proposes a stormwater management program that will improve the quality of
         stormwater runoff and promote recharge. Practices to control pollution during construction
         will be implemented. A stormwater management system will be installed to treat and
         infiltrate stormwater supplemented with a long-term operation and maintenance plan.

         Stormwater pollution prevention measures will include good housekeeping such as
         properly storing materials, spill prevention and response plans, and proper storage and
         disposal of solid wastes. Erosion and sediment controls will be used during construction up


3241 PNF/3.0-EnvironmentalProtection.doc                 3-25                          Environmental Protection
161 South Huntington Avenue                                                              Epsilon Associates Inc.
       until such point that the site is stabilized. Controls may include hay bales, silt fence, and
       catch basin filters. The Contractor will also be responsible for controlling dust through the
       use of a stabilized construction entrance, street sweeping, and watering if necessary.

       The stormwater management system will reduce the pollutant load to the municipal storm
       drain system. Deep sump catch basins and a water quality inlet will remove a portion of
       the total suspended solids inherent in surface parking runoff. Rooftop runoff will be
       directed to a subsurface infiltration system with overflows being directed to the municipal
       storm drain system.

       The Project will result in a decrease in peak discharge rates and volumes of runoff as well as
       improve groundwater recharge. This is accomplished primarily by the installation of a
       stormwater infiltration system.

3.7    Flood Hazard Zone / Wetlands

       The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
       indicates the FEMA Flood Zone Designations for the Project site (City of Boston,
       Community Panel Number 25025C0078G). The map for the Project site shows the Project
       is located outside of any designated flood zones. The Project site does not contain any
       wetlands.

3.8    Geotechnical / Groundwater

       This section describes existing site conditions, subsurface soil and groundwater conditions,
       and planned foundation construction methodology for the development which will include
       demolition of existing buildings and construction of an approximately 190,000 gross square
       foot, four - five story residential complex with one level of basement parking level below
       the first floor.

       3.8.1         Existing Site Conditions

       The existing site is currently occupied by four buildings, ranging from one to four stories
       above ground, which was formerly the Jamaica Plain campus of the Home for Little
       Wanderers. The Project site is bounded by South Huntington Avenue to the east, the
       Jamaicaway to the west, the Sherrill House at 135 South Huntington Avenue, a five to six
       story skilled nursing facility to the north, and the Goddard House at 201 South Huntington
       Avenue, a six to seven story skilled nursing and rehabilitation center to the south Site grades
       vary by as much as 40 ft across the property from a low point of about El. 50 Boston City
       Base (BCB) Datum at the northwest corner of the site to a high of about El. 90 at the
       southeast corner of the site.

       3.8.2         Subsurface Soil and Bedrock Conditions

       Site and subsurface conditions at the Project site are based on review of available
       topographic and test boring information. A subsurface exploration program was completed
       at the property in 2008 which consisted of nine test borings spaced throughout the
       property, to depths of up to 25 ft below site grades at the locations drilled. Subsurface
       conditions at the site consist of miscellaneous granular fill soils overlying dense glacial soils
       over bedrock. Bedrock consisting of Roxbury Conglomerate underlies the glacial deposits
       at El. 85 +/- to greater than El. 60 +/, corresponding to depths between existing ground
       surface and greater than 20 ft below existing site grades. Bedrock outcrops are visible at
       some locations across the site, indicating abrupt changes in depth to bedrock surface over
       short distances.

       3.8.3         Groundwater

       Groundwater in soil was not encountered in test borings to a depth of 22 ft below existing
       site grades, corresponding to approximately Elevation 65 to El. 38 BCB. The Project site is
       located outside the limits of the Groundwater Conservation Overlay District (GCOD).
       Accordingly, the Project is not required to comply with the specific requirements of Article
       32. Groundwater management practices will be employed during construction to control
       surface water runoff and seepage during foundation excavation and construction.

       It is not expected that temporary or permanent site dewatering will be required for
       construction.

       3.8.4         Proposed Foundation Construction

       Development of the Project site will require demolition of the four existing buildings prior
       to excavation for foundations and below-grade walls. The Building is anticipated to be
       supported on conventional shallow footing foundations bearing in competent glacially
       deposited soils and/or bedrock. Due to the variable depth to top of bedrock across the site,
       removal of bedrock may be required to achieve design subgrade within portions of the new
       building footprint. Removal of bedrock will be required in limited areas and is expected to
       be completed with conventional earth moving equipment and by hoe ramming. Removal
       of bedrock will be conducted to limit adverse off site impacts to adjacent structures and
       utilities.

       The type and design of both the temporary earth support system and the permanent
       foundation wall system will provide for adequate support of the structures and utilities and
       be compatible with the subsurface conditions. As part of the design phase, the design team
       will prepare designs and specifications as well as review contractor's submittals for
       conformance to the Project contract documents

       Although a temporary earth support system has not been selected, it will likely consist of
       soldier pile and lagging installed adjacent to the west perimeter foundation wall of the
       proposed building. The temporary earth support system would be installed using low
       vibration techniques and be located approximately 60 to 70 ft from adjacent, offsite
       buildings and utilities. Given the method for installation and distance of the proposed
       temporary earth support system from adjacent structures, impacts are anticipated to be
       minimal beyond the limits of the site.

       3.8.5         Existing Hazardous Waste Conditions

       A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I ESA), using methods consistent with
       ASTM E1527-05, was conducted in March 2012. The site was not identified within the
       Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Waste Site/Reportable Release
       database. No Recognized Environmental Conditions were identified during the 2012 Phase
       I Environmental Site Assessment.

       Characterization of the soil and groundwater at the Project site has not been conducted to
       date. Evaluation of site environmental conditions will be conducted at the appropriate
       stage of the design process to further evaluate site environmental conditions. If required,
       management of soil and groundwater will be in accordance with applicable local, state, and
       federal laws and regulations. Characterization of environmental quality of excess material
       to be excavated and generated for offsite transport will be undertaken prior to removing
       material from the property.

3.9    Solid and Hazardous Waste

       3.9.1         Solid Waste Generation during Operation

       The Project will generate solid waste typical of other residential projects. Solid waste
       generated by the Project will be approximately 968 tons per year, based on the amount of
       amenity space proposed at a generation rate of 5.5 tons per 1,000 square feet per year
       and the amount of residential space proposed at a generation rate of 4 lbs per bedroom per
       day as shown in Table 3-5.

       Solid waste will include wastepaper, cardboard, glass, and bottles. A portion of the waste
       will be recycled as described below. The remainder of the waste will be compacted and
       removed by a waste hauler contracted by building management. With the exception of
       "household hazardous wastes" typical of residential uses (for example, cleaning fluids and
       paint), the residential and ground floor uses will not generate hazardous waste. Separate
       containers will be provided for the disposal of materials such as turpentine and paints.

       Recycling

       Recycling by residents will be encouraged and coordinated. To encourage recycling, the
       proponent will implement a recycling program throughout the Project. The Project will
       include space for recycling on the ground floor, and the loading/receiving area will include
       space for the storage and pick-up of recyclable materials. Recyclable materials are expected
       to continue to include newspaper, cardboard, cans, and bottles. The residential recycling
       program will be conducted in accordance with the City of Boston's recycling regulations.

       The Project will be provided with a trash chute with access from each floor. The chute will
       terminate on the ground floor and will feature a diverter that will allow the sender to select
       whether the contents will be sent to the trash bin or the recycling bin. A private trash
       collector will pick-up trash and recyclables as needed.

       3.9.2         Solid Waste Generation during Construction

       Solid waste generated by construction will consist primarily of demolition debris related to
       the selective interior demolition of the existing building and packaging and scrap materials
       (such as corrugated cardboard, glass, aluminum, scrap metal, and cable/wire) associated
       with new construction. It is estimated that approximately 475 tons of solid waste will be
       generated during construction.

       Construction waste material from demolition and new construction will be recycled when
       possible (see below). For those materials that cannot be recycled, solid waste will be
       transported in covered trucks to an approved solid waste facility, per DEP's Regulations for
       Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00. This requirement will be specified in the disposal
       contract. If any asbestos containing materials are identified, they will be treated as a special
       waste in accordance with Massachusetts DEP guidelines and addressed and disposed of
       accordingly.

       Recycling during Construction

       The proponent will take an active role with regard to the reprocessing and recycling of
       construction waste. An evaluation of the potential for recycling will occur before the
       construction commences. Construction will be conducted so that some materials that may
       be recycled are segregated from those materials not recyclable to enable disposal at an
       approved solid waste facility. A comprehensive recycling program will be included in the


3241 PNF/3.0-EnvironmentalProtection.doc          3-29                        Environmental Protection
161 South Huntington Avenue                                                     Epsilon Associates Inc.
       final Construction Management Plan. The Proponent will also coordinate with the Boston
       Materials Resource Center and direct materials to them where possible to reduce the
       amount of surplus building material that is sent to landfills. Materials that cannot be reused
       or recycled will be transported in covered trucks by a contract hauler to a licensed facility,
       per the MassDEP regulations for Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00.

3.10   Noise

       The primary operational noise caused by the Project will be the result of mechanical
       equipment, which will be all new, state of the art mechanical equipment to meet the City's
       new Stretch Code energy requirements. The Project will include a high efficiency air
       cooled chiller designed for quiet operation which will be located on the roof. The chiller
       will incorporate an acoustic screen enclosure that will modulate noise as well as visual
       impacts. Given the urban location and proximity to South Huntington Avenue and the
       Veterans Administration Hospital directly across the street, existing condition sound levels
       are moderately high. Therefore, it is anticipated that noise levels from the Project will be
       less than or similar to noise levels of the existing buildings, and impacts are anticipated to
       be minimal based on information provided by the architect's acoustical consultant. The
       Project is anticipated to meet the requirements of the City of Boston's zoning district noise
       standards.

3.11   Construction Impacts

       A Construction Management Plan ("CMP") in compliance with the City's Construction
       Management Program will be submitted to the Boston Transportation Department ("BTD")
       once final plans are developed and the construction schedule is determined. The
       construction contractor will be required to comply with the details and conditions of the
       approved CMP.

       Proper pre-planning with the City and neighborhood will be essential to the successful
       construction of the Project. Construction methodologies, which ensure public safety and
       protect nearby residences, will be employed. Techniques such as barricades, walkways,
       and signage will be used. The CMP will include routing plans for trucking and deliveries,
       plans for the protection of existing utilities, and control of noise and dust.

       During the construction phase of the Project, the developer will provide the name,
       telephone number and address of a contact person to communicate with on issues related
       to the construction.

       The proponent intends to follow the guidelines of the City of Boston and the Massachusetts
       DEP, which direct the evaluation and mitigation of construction impacts. As part of this
       process, the proponent and its construction team will evaluate the mitigation methods
       employed by the Commonwealth's Clean Air Construction Initiative.

       3.11.1        Construction schedule

       Construction of the Project is estimated to last approximately 18 months, with initial site
       work expected to begin by the end 2012. There will be a one-month site mobilization
       period.

       The City of Boston allows construction work from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through
       Friday. Construction outside of those hours requires a permit. Typical construction hours
       for the Project will be in compliance with the City's regulations with no work anticipated
       on the weekends. In the event that weekend work is necessary, the proponent will obtain
       required City approvals.

       The construction contractor will be responsible for coordinating construction activities
       during all phases of construction with City of Boston agencies in order to minimize
       potential scheduling and construction conflicts with other ongoing construction Projects in
       the area.

       3.11.2        Demolition

       The three buildings currently located on the site will be demolished. The demolition debris
       will be disposed of at a properly licensed solid waste disposal facility. Concrete, brick, and
       asphalt will be separated for crushing and possible re-use on site. During demolition,
       provisions will be made for the use of water spray to control the generation of dust. An
       Asbestos and Hazardous Material Evaluation was conducted in 2009, and additional
       asbestos investigations in 2010. Several types of common asbestos containing (ACM) and
       hazardous materials were identified to be present in various building materials. The
       identified ACM, lead, and hazardous materials were in generally good condition. Prior to
       conducting demolition activities, Massachusetts-licensed abatement contractors will be
       retained to remove the ACM and other materials

       3.11.3        Construction Staging / Public Safety / Access

       Construction truck access to the Project site will be outlined in the CMP to be filed with
       BTD in accordance with the City's transportation maintenance plan requirements. Staging
       for the Project is anticipated to start by the end of 2012.

       The construction staging plan will be designed to isolate the construction while providing
       safe access for pedestrians and vehicles during normal day-to-day activity and emergencies.
       The staging areas will be secured by chain-link fencing to protect pedestrians from entering
       these areas.

       Although specific construction and staging details have not been finalized, the proponent
       will work with the construction contractor and the City of Boston to ensure that staging
       areas will be located to minimize impact to pedestrian and vehicular flow. Secure fencing
       and barricades will be used to isolate construction areas from pedestrian traffic. In addition,

3241 PNF/3.0-EnvironmentalProtection.doc          3-31                        Environmental Protection
161 South Huntington Avenue                                                     Epsilon Associates Inc.
       public safety for pedestrians on abutting sidewalks will also include covered pedestrian
       walkways when appropriate and, as required, the suspension of the use of certain sidewalks
       during the most hazardous periods of overhead construction activity. If required by the
       Boston Transportation Department and the Boston Police Department, police details will be
       provided to facilitate traffic flow. The Project will include debris nets on various levels of
       the building elevations to protect the public and the abutters. All construction procedures
       will be designed to meet all OSHA safety standards for specific site construction activities.

       A process to protect existing trees (to remain) will be implemented to prevent damage from
       the construction operation.

       Examples of the protection measures are described below:

            Fencing to prevent material staging;

            Signage/training to inform and educate workers of the area that we are protecting;
            and

            Hay bales/filter fabric to ring area to be protected.

       3.11.4        Construction Air Quality

       During the construction period of the Project, temporary affects on ambient air quality
       adjacent to the construction site may occur. Impacts associated with construction activities
       may generate fugitive dust which may result in localized increases in particulate levels. The
       Project does not involve any significant excavation. Therefore, air quality impacts
       associated with fugitive dust is anticipated to be minimal. The Proponent will explore
       participation in the DEP Diesel Retrofit Program.

       The construction contract will provide for a number of strictly enforced measures to be
       utilized by contractors to reduce potential emissions and minimize impacts. These are
       expected to include:

            Using wetting agents on area of exposed soil on a scheduled basis;

            Using covered trucks;

            Minimizing spoils on the construction site;

            Monitoring of actual construction practices to ensure that unnecessary transfers and
            mechanical disturbances of loose materials are minimized;

            Minimizing storage of debris on-site;

            Periodic Street and sidewalk cleaning with water to minimize dust accumulations;
            and

            Wheel washing station for trucks at exit gates.

       3.11.5        Construction Noise

       During operations, neither the Project's mechanical equipment nor traffic noise associated
       with the Project is expected to result in a perceptible change in noise levels. Intermittent
       increases in noise levels will occur in the short-term during construction. Construction work
       will comply with the requirements of the City of Boston noise ordinance. Every reasonable
       effort will be made to minimize the noise impact of construction activities. Mitigation
       measures are expected to include:

       Mitigation measures are expected to include:

            Instituting a proactive program to ensure compliance with the City of Boston noise
            limitation policy;

            Using appropriate mufflers on all equipment and ongoing maintenance of intake
            and exhaust mufflers;

            Muffling enclosures on continuously running equipment; such as air compressors
            and welding generators;

            Replacing specific construction operations and techniques by less noisy ones where
            feasible;

            Selecting the quietest of alternative items of equipment where feasible;

            Scheduling equipment operations to keep average noise levels low, to synchronize
            the noisiest operations with times of highest ambient levels, and to maintain
            relatively uniform noise levels;

            Turning off idling equipment; and

            Locating noisy equipment at locations that protect sensitive locations by shielding or
            distance.

            Monitoring noise levels with calibrated sound equipment to ensure compliance.

       3.11.6        Construction Period Transportation Issues

       Details of the overall construction schedule, working hours, number of construction
       workers, worker transportation and parking, number of construction vehicles, and routes
       will be addressed in detail in a Construction Management Plan to be filed with BTD in
       accordance with the City's transportation maintenance plan requirements.




3241 PNF/3.0-EnvironmentalProtection.doc         3-33                       Environmental Protection

       The number of workers required during the construction period will vary, depending on the
       phase of construction. The number of workers on-site will average between 75 to 150
       workers per day. Because the construction workers will arrive and depart prior to peak
       traffic periods, the construction trips are not expected to impact local traffic conditions.

       To reduce vehicle trips to and from the construction site, all workers will be strongly
       encouraged to use public transportation. Space on-site will be made available for workers'
       supplies and tools so they do not have to be brought to the site each day.

       Specific delivery truck access routes will be established in consultation with the BTD
       through its approval of the CMP required for the Project. Construction contracts will
       include clauses restricting truck travel to primary roads. Enforcement of truck routes will be
       accomplished through clauses in the subcontractors' agreements.

       3.11.7        Protection of Utilities

       Protection of BWSC water, sewer, and drain lines will begin before commencement of site
       work. The proponent will request that the locations of all existing water, sewer, and
       drainage lines by marked by BWSC. Excavation in the area of existing water, sewer and
       drain lines will proceed with caution. Hand excavation will take place when excavation in
       the immediate area of pipe walls is required. BWSC will require additional protection
       measures if new pipes are to cross existing pipes.

       The BWSC will require the proponent to submit a General Service Application and a site
       plan for review prior to construction. The site plan must include existing water mains,
       sanitary sewers, storm drains, and proposed service connections.

       3.11.8        Generation and Disposal of Construction Debris

       The proponent will take an active role with regard to the reprocessing and recycling of
       construction waste.

       The disposal contract will include specific requirements that will ensure that construction
       procedures allow for the sufficient space for the necessary segregation, reprocessing, reuse
       and recycling of materials. For those materials that cannot be recycled, solid waste will be
       transported in covered trucks to an approved solid waste facility, per MassDEP's
       Regulations for Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00. This requirement will be specific in
       the disposal contract. Construction will be conducted so that materials that may be
       recycled are segregated from those materials not recyclable to enable disposal at an
       approved solid waste facility. The Proponent will also coordinate with the Boston Materials
       Resource Center and direct materials to them where possible to reduce the amount of
       surplus building material that is sent to landfills. Materials that cannot be reused or
       recycled will be transported in covered trucks by a contract hauler to a licensed facility, per
       the MassDEP regulations for Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 16.00.

       Removal of any hazardous materials will be treated as special waste in accordance with
       Massachusetts DEP guidelines and addressed and disposed of accordingly. Lead and
       asbestos will be removed in accordance with applicable regulations.

       3.11.9        Rodent Control

       A rodent extermination certificate will be filed with the building permit application to the
       City. Rodent inspection monitoring and treatment will be carried out before, during, and at
       the completion of all construction work for the Project, in compliance with the City's
       requirements. Rodent extermination prior to work start-up will consist of treatment of areas
       throughout the Project site. During the construction process, regular service visits will be
       made.

3.12   Wildlife Habitat

       The Project is a developed site in an established, dense urban neighborhood. As such, the
       Project will not have impacts on wildlife habitats.

3.13   Sustainable Design

       3.13.1        Article 37 Boston Zoning Code

       To comply with Article 37, the Proponent intends to measure the results of their
       sustainability initiatives using the framework of the LEED (Leadership in Energy and
       Environmental Design) rating system. The building will seek LEED Certification through the
       USGBC at a minimum of a Certified level, exceeding the requirements of Article 37 of the
       Boston Zoning Code. As a new construction residential apartment building, the Project at
       161 South Huntington Avenue is categorized as a LEED V3 NC 2009 (New Construction)
       Project. The LEED rating system tracks the sustainable features of the Project by achieving
       points in the following categories: Sustainable Sites; Water Efficiency; Energy and
       Atmosphere; Materials and Resources; Indoor Environmental Quality; and Innovation in
       Design. Presently, 45 points have been targeted, not including any of the potential Boston
       Zoning Code Article 37 points. The checklist, included in Appendix D, will be updated
       regularly as the design develops and engineering assumptions are substantiated.

       3.13.1.1      Sustainable Sites

           1. Construction Activity Pollution Prevention (SS prerequisite 1). A management plan
              will be created and implemented to reduce pollution from construction activity.

           2. Site Selection (SS credit 1). The Project site is currently completely developed and is
              located in a dense urban area. This development does not violate any of the
              established LEED criteria.

           3. Development Density and Community Connectivity (SS credit 2). The development
              is in a dense urban area with existing infrastructure and basic services.

           4. Alternative Transportation ­ Public Transportation Access (SS credits; 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
              & 4.4). The Project is sited near several heavily served mass transit stops. The site's
              adjacency to basic services in the community and the development density of its
              urban context enable the Project to satisfy both available approaches to the
              Development Density and Community Connectivity credit. The Project also

Site Design and Urban Design
4.0    SITE DESIGN AND URBAN DESIGN

4.1    Existing Conditions

       The existing Home for Little Wanderers buildings are comprised of three distinct structures
       including the 1914 Home for Little Wanderers building and its associated 1950s additions,
       the late 1980s residential building and the 1990 gymnasium structure.

       The buildings are constructed using various materials and situated in a random fashion on
       the site with varying amounts of height and setback to South Huntington Avenue. Double
       loaded parking lots supporting 53 cars separate the buildings from the sidewalk. These
       setbacks are atypical for commercial properties in the area, which typically have consistent
       setbacks from the street.

4.2    Urban Design Objectives

       Key Design Goals

       The urban design approach for the Project includes responding to the unique site conditions
       between South Huntington Avenue and the Jamaicaway. The building has been designed
       to respond to this mid-block in-fill location by acknowledging the massing, height, and
       materials of the adjacent structures as shown in Figure 4-1. Urban design goals include:

            Enhancing the South Huntington Avenue urban condition by creating an active
            street front;

            Using massing and material differentiation to reduce the scale of the Project;

            Improving the Project Site's relationship to its surroundings; and

            Creating a pleasing urban presence by negotiating the vastly differing conditions on
            each side of the Project Site.

       Proposed Development

       By locating the buildings closer to South Huntington Avenue consistent with the
       neighboring structures, the Project aims to contribute to an active urban experience in a
       more significant way than the existing structures. The buildings extend to approximately 50
       feet off South Huntington Avenue, while the opposite side facing the Emerald Necklace
       pulls away from the existing stand of mature trees and the Jamaicaway. The building retains
       some parking in the front for visitors, but reduces the number to 16 spaces. The balance of
       the parking will be provided below the building and out of public view in a partially below
       grade garage.

       The existing deteriorating iron fence along South Huntington's sidewalk edge will be
       reintroduced in a more contemporary manner, incorporating landscape treatment on both
       sides of the fence, with modulated heights following the site slope. The development will
       enhance pedestrian access by providing new sidewalks, fencing, and lighting and will offer
       an active streetscape with multiple pedestrian entry points.

       Pedestrians and cars will enter the Project site from South Huntington Avenue at locations
       similar to existing conditions, with the main lobby entrance prominently situated near the
       center of the building facing along the street. The lobby will visually flow from front to
       back and provide a direct view and access through the building and onto the Emerald
       Necklace. The residential amenity areas adjacent to the lobby also take advantage of the
       long tree lined views looking towards the Jamaicaway.

       The Project's massing and design will help tie the neighborhood's varied building stock and
       uses together by respecting the fabric of the neighborhood. The design of the new building
       centers on simple volumes which are broken down in scale through the modulation of
       façade depth, bay windows, building heights, and varying materials of masonry, metal
       panel, and glass. The building generally aligns with adjacent parcels to provide definition
       to South Huntington Avenue, and is designed to maintain and enhance the existing scale of
       the built street wall. The design acknowledges the sloped site by stepping the building and
       is organized into two major elements of four story and five stories. The building will meet
       the sky with simply articulated cornices capping major architectural elements. Figures 4-2
       through 4-6 include elevations of the proposed Project.

       The building will seek LEED Certification through the USGBC at a minimum of a Certified
       level, exceeding the requirements of Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code. The
       redevelopment of this site will promote public safety, encourage walking and transit usage
       and improve safety and the pedestrian environment.

5.0    HISTORIC AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES

5.1    Introduction

       This section of the Expanded PNF identifies and describes existing buildings on the Project
       site, significant historic resources within the vicinity of the Project, and assesses potential
       Project related impacts to historic and archaeological resources.

5.2    Buildings on the Project Site

       5.2.1          The New England Home for Little Wanderers

       Constructed in 1914, the New England Home for Little Wanderers building is a Georgian
       Revival style red brick, three story structure set on a raised basement level. The 11 bay
       main block features a symmetrical façade with a center entrance; three story, side,
       projecting pavilions flank the main block. Designed by the Boston architecture firm
       Brainerd and Leeds, the building displays a cast stone balustrade at the roof line, bracketed
       cast stone hoods over the front and side entrances, splayed window lintels with keystones
       on the second and third floors and cast stone window surrounds on the first floor. The
       building is further detailed with a decorative iron fire escape that spans across the façade at
       the second floor level and is supported with iron scroll brackets.

       The top floors of the side pavilions feature loggia-like forms with paired columns separating
       late 20th century one-over-one replacement windows in openings once occupied by multi-
       light casement windows. On the remainder of the building, original six-over-one and nine-
       over-one sash have also been replaced with late 20th century one-over-one replacement
       windows.

       The west elevation consists of the seven bay main block and projecting three bay side
       pavilions. The main block features a cast stone balustrade at the roof line and a frieze
       between the first and second floors inscribed "THE NEW ENGLAND HOME FOR LITTLE
       WANDERERS." In the late 1950s, a single story addition was added to the raised basement
       level of the west elevation. The addition spans the full width of the main block and the
       three bays of the north pavilion. The addition altered a central classical cast stone
       entablature entry framed with engaged columns.

       Also in the late 1950s, a two story addition was added to the south elevation of the
       southern pavilion. The two additions, both designed by The Architectural Collaborative,
       feature large plate glass windows, red brick, bands of concrete and flat roofs.

       Founded by 10 Boston area businessmen and incorporated under a Massachusetts
       Legislative Act in March 1865, The Baldwin Place for Little Wanderers, as the institution
       was originally known, was established with an original goal of caring for children who had
       been orphaned and left homeless. Originally, the Home occupied the Baldwin Place

161 South Huntington Avenue                                                      Epsilon Associates Inc.
       Baptist Church, located off North Street in Boston's North End. The Home provided a
       residence for homeless children of every age. In its early years, the Home housed a large
       number of orphans of Civil War soldiers from across New England. In addition to orphans,
       the Home provided for children with only one living parent. During its first 12 years of
       operation, the Home provided for 4,288 children, including 960 which were five years old
       or younger. The Home also offered a day care service for working poor mothers. During
       the 1870s, the Home provided day care services for approximately 70 children annually
       ranging in age from a few weeks to four years old.

       In 1888, in response to growth and demand for additional space, the Home built a new
       building at 200 West Newton Street. The Home's continued growth in the early 20th
       century lead to the construction of the South Huntington Avenue building in 1914. The
       present building was constructed on land formerly associated with the George E. Nickerson
       estate. In the late 1890s, South Huntington Avenue was extended beyond Heath Street.
       Following the extension of South Huntington Avenue, the Nickerson estate was subdivided
       and developed with institutional buildings. In addition to the Home's 1914 building, other
       developments constructed on the former Nickerson estate included the 1907 Vincent
       Memorial Hospital at 125 South Huntington Avenue and the 1926 Home for Aged Women
       at 201-205 South Huntington Avenue.

       The site is defined on its east and west boundary by an iron fence in varying degrees of
       deterioration. On the east side of the property, the iron picket fence runs along the back of
       the South Huntington Avenue sidewalk. There are two pairs of brick piers at the original
       two entrance drives. While the northern entrance drive remains in continued use, the
       southern entrance is no longer used as the drive has been relocated further south. Infill
       sections of fencing fill the original south entrance. The new south entrance was created
       with the removal of original sections of the iron pickets.

       The fence on the west side of the property follows the curve of the sidewalk along the
       Jamaicaway. While deteriorated in condition, the original fence retains its original two
       pairs of brick piers at the two pedestrian gates located at the northern and southern limits of
       the property.

       5.2.2        Modern Residential Building and Gymnasium

       Additional buildings constructed on the Project site by the Home include a 1987, red brick,
       three story residential dormitory building near the southern limits of the site. The
       residential building was constructed into the natural sloping topography of the site, such
       that the South Huntington Avenue side (east elevation) is a single story in height, whereas
       the Jamaicaway side (west elevation) is three stories in height.

       A metal clad gymnasium building, constructed by the Home in 1991, is located near the
       northern limits of the site. The gable roof structure is set on a raised concrete block
       foundation and features bands of windows set beneath the overhanging roof line.

       Throughout the 20th century the Home expanded services offered at its South Huntington
       Avenue property and at other sites that it operates, including opening branch offices in
       Maine and Western Massachusetts, acting as a pioneer in bringing child welfare services to
       other parts of New England. During World War II, the Home worked with the U.S.
       Committee for Care of European Children to shelter and place over 250 young refugees.

       Today, the Home is the nation's oldest and one of New England's largest nonprofit child
       and family service agencies. Currently, the Home and its staff of approximately 600
       provide services to more than 7,000 people through 13 locations in communities including
       Boston, Walpole, Waltham, and Plymouth. In Boston, the Home has become the largest
       provider of mental health services in the Boston's public school system and operates 15
       other Boston-based programs that offer community-based services in homes, hospitals and
       clinics.

       In addition to its other locations, the Home provides services at its 166-acre Longview Farm
       campus in Walpole, Massachusetts, which it has occupied since the 1940s. Currently, the
       Home is in the process of constructing a $19 million project at its Walpole property that
       will include a new, state-of-the-art, two-story special education school and four new
       residences. While the services currently offered at the South Huntington Avenue site will
       relocate to Walpole in late 2012, the Home will continue to maintain its administrative
       headquarters in Boston and the majority of its overall programming will continue to be run
       within the city at other locations.

       The Home for Little Wanderers 1914 building is included in the Massachusetts Historical
       Commission's Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth.
       When the inventory form was prepared for the building in 1985, staff of the Boston
       Landmarks Commission (BLC) applied its rating system for the purposes of establishing
       significance for consideration for landmark designation. BLC staff assigned the building a
       rating of "IV" (out of a possible I, II, III, IV, or V). Only buildings with a rating of I, II, or III
       are considered eligible for landmark designation.

       In recent years, the BLC has revised it rating system from the previous numerical system to a
       system based on the criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Currently,
       the building is not listed in the National Register of Historic Places. While the Home, as an
       institution, has historical significance as the nation's oldest and one of New England's
       largest nonprofit child and family service agencies, physical alterations and additions to the
       property have compromised its architectural integrity and setting. Alterations including the
       two 1950s additions, the construction of the 1987 residential building and 1991
       gymnasium, the replacement of the building's original multi-light casement and double
       hung sash, and replacement of original doors have compromised the building's overall
       architectural integrity and setting. Appendix A contains photographs of the existing
       buildings on the Project site.

5.3    Historic Resources in the Project's Vicinity

       5.3.1         Olmsted Park and the Jamaicaway, Olmsted Park System/Emerald Necklace

       Olmsted Park and the Emerald Necklace were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted as part
       of the Boston's linear park system. Olmsted Park contains a chain of picturesque fresh-
       water ponds, alternating with attractive natural groves and meadows. Included in the plans
       for Olmsted Park was the creation of Leverett Pond from a swamp near Brookline Village.
       Originally named Leverett Park, the park's name was changed in 1900 by the Boston Parks
       Commissioners to honor Olmsted and his work.

       Olmsted Park has three major ponds, a watercourse connecting them, six historic pedestrian
       bridges and attractive walkways and stone walls sheltered from the busy city by the densely
       wooded areas. The park has the second largest historic forest in the Emerald Necklace
       System with 17 acres of forest cover.

       Land for the park construction was purchased between 1881 and 1894 from private
       property owners. Seven "Natural History" ponds were created between Ward's and Willow
       ponds in 1893 for Natural History Society educational programs. They were filled in during
       the last years of the 19th century.

       The Jamaicaway forms the eastern boundary of the Olmsted Park. Also designed by
       Frederick Law Olmsted as part of the Boston Park System, the Jamaicaway originally served
       as a tree lined carriageway connecting Boston to Jamaica Plain, then a streetcar suburb.
       Today, the Jamaicaway is a heavily traveled, four lane, curvilinear undivided roadway lined
       with mature tree plantings.

       Both Olmsted Park and the Jamaicaway are listed in the National Register of Historic Places
       as part of the National Register designation for the Olmsted Park System/Emerald Necklace.
       Figure 5-1 identifies the proximity of the Project site to the State and National Register listed
       Olmsted Park and Jamaicaway. With the exception of Olmsted Park and the Jamaicaway,
       no other State or National Register listed properties are located within a quarter mile radius
       of the Project site.

5.4    Project Impacts to Historic Resources

       5.4.1         Demolition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers

       Development of the Project requires the demolition of the 1914 New England Home for
       Little Wanderers building. As discussed above, while the 1914 building is included in
       MHC's Inventory, it is not listed in the State or National Registers of Historic Places. While
       the Home, as an institution, has significance as the nation's oldest and one of New
       England's largest nonprofit child and family service agencies, physical alterations and
       additions to the 1914 building and the site have compromised the building's overall
       architectural integrity and setting.

       The two other buildings on the Project site proposed for demolition, the 1987 residential
       building and 1991 gymnasium, lack historic or architectural significance.

       5.4.2         Design and Visual Impacts

       As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, Site Design and Urban Design, the design
       concept for the Project starts with the placement of the new building in a manner that
       respects and protects the stand of mature trees along the Jamaicaway. Also, by locating the
       building closer to South Huntington Avenue consistent with the neighboring structures, the
       Project aims to contribute to an active urban experience. The new building will be placed
       approximately 50 feet off South Huntington Avenue, consistent with the setback of other
       buildings along the South Huntington Avenue corridor, while the opposite side facing the
       Emerald Necklace pulls away from the existing stand of mature trees and the Jamaicaway.

       The iron fence along the South Huntington Avenue sidewalk will be replaced with a
       contemporary interpretation of the original feature. As envisioned, the new fence will
       feature modulated heights following the natural slope of the site and incorporate landscape
       treatments on both sides.

       The original iron picket fence, and associated brick piers, along the Jamaicaway will be
       retained and repaired, thereby preserving an important feature which contributes to the
       natural setting of the Jamaicaway and the greater Boston Park System.

       5.4.3         Shadow Impacts

       As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3, the Project will result in some new shadow. The
       shadow impact analysis considered net new shadow created by the Project during 14 time
       periods. In order to provide a conservative shadow analysis, these studies did not take into
       consideration shadows cast by existing trees, which are significant due to the density of the
       large and mature stand of trees being maintained on the Project site. The Project will not
       cast new shadow onto Olmsted Park except during winter mornings when shadows are
       among their greatest. New shadows resulting from the Project will generally be limited to
       the Project's wooded area located between the Project and Jamaicaway, space between the
       Project and the existing building to the north, the proposed parking lot, and a portion of
       South Huntington Avenue.

       All new shadows will be limited to isolated areas and last a short duration and will not have
       any material impact on the integrity of Olmsted Park or the Jamaicaway.

5.5    Archaeological Resources

       The Proposed Project Site consists of a previously developed urban parcel. Due to previous
       development activities and disturbances, including construction of the existing buildings
       and parking areas, as well site grading activities, it is not anticipated that the site contains
       significant archaeological resources.

5.6    Boston Landmarks Commission Review

       Constructed in 1914, the Home for Little Wanderers building is greater than 50 years old
       and therefore subject to review by the Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC) in accordance
       with Article 85 of the Boston Zoning Code. An Article 85 application for the proposed
       demolition of the buildings on the site will be submitted to the BLC at the appropriate time.
       The Proponent is committed to working collaboratively with the BLC and the community
       throughout the Article 85 review process.

Infrastructure Systems
6.0     INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS

6.1     Introduction

        The existing infrastructure surrounding the site of 161 South Huntington Avenue appears of
        adequate capacity to service the needs of the Project. The following sections describe the
        existing sewer, water, and drainage systems surrounding the site and explain how these
        systems will service the development. The analysis also discusses any anticipated Project-
        related impacts on the utilities and identifies mitigation measures to address these potential
        impacts.

        The Project is moving into the Design Development phase where a detailed infrastructure
        analysis will be performed. The Project's team will coordinate with the appropriate utilities
        to address the capacity of the area utilities to provide services for the new building. A
        Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) Site Plan and General Service Application is
        required for the proposed new water, sanitary sewer, and storm drain connections. In
        addition, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan will be submitted specifying best
        management measures for protecting the BWSC and the Department of Conservation and
        Recreation's (DCR) drainage systems during construction.

        A Drainage Discharge Permit Application will be submitted to the BWSC for any required
        construction dewatering. The appropriate approvals from the Massachusetts Department of
        Environmental Protection (MassDEP), Massachusetts Department of Conservation and
        Recreation (DCR) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will also be sought.

6.2     Wastewater

        6.2.1          Existing Sanitary Sewer System

        The BWSC owns, operates, and maintains the sanitary sewer system located in South
        Huntington Avenue to the east of the Project site (See Figure 6-1). There is an existing 10-
        inch clay pipe (sanitary sewer) located in South Huntington Avenue. This sanitary sewer
        line flows in a northerly direction and eventually discharges into a 24-inch by 31-inch
        combined sewer in Huntington Avenue. Three of the existing buildings (main building,
        south addition, and gymnasium) have a sanitary sewer service tied into this pipe.

        The DCR owns, operates, and maintains the sanitary sewer system located within the
        Jamaicaway to the west of the Project site. One existing building (residence building) has a
        6-inch clay sanitary sewer service tied into this system. This service exits the westerly-side
        of the building where ties into an on-site sewer system consisting of two sewer manholes
        connected by 8-inch clay pipes. This system ties into the DCR-owned sanitary sewer
        system in the Jamaicaway near the northwest corner of the Project site.

        Based on the existing building uses and water account records, the total existing sewer flow
        from on-site buildings is estimated at 7,203 gallons per day (gpd).

        6.2.2          Project-Generated Sanitary Sewer Flow

        The Project will generate an estimated 26,118 gallons per day (gpd) based on design sewer
        flows provided in 314 CMR 7.00-Sewer System Extension and Connection Permit Program
        as summarized in Table 6-1. This is a net increase of 18,915 gpd over the estimated flows
        from the existing buildings.

        6.2.3          Sanitary Sewer Connection

        The building's sanitary sewer service is proposed to tie into the existing BWSC 10-inch
        sanitary sewer main in South Huntington Avenue. It is anticipated that the building will
        require two 8-inch sanitary services. Also a 4-inch garage waste line is proposed and will
        be routed through and oil and sand trap prior to tying into the sanitary sewer system.All
        existing building services will be cut and capped at the main if the wyes are not reused.

        The flow full capacity of the 10-inch sanitary sewer adjacent to the site is 3.39 cfs (2.19
        MGD). The projected maximum daily sewer flow for the Project is 0.027 MGD, which is
        about 1% of this line's capacity.

        The Proponent will submit a Site Plan to the BWSC for review and approval. Based on the
        proposed estimated sanitary flow, a Compliance Certification will be required. This
        Certification will be submitted to BWSC for review and approval prior to submitting to the
        Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection ("MassDEP").

        6.2.4          Effluent quality

        The Project is not expected to generate industrial wastes. Flows from the floor drains in the
        parking structure will be treated through an oil and grease separator before discharging to
        the municipal system.

        6.2.5         Sewer system mitigation

        To help conserve water and reduce the amount of wastewater generated by the Project, the
        Proponent will investigate the use of water conservation devices such as low-flow toilets
        and flow-restricting faucets.

6.3     Water system

        6.3.1         Existing Water Service

        The water distribution system in the vicinity of the Project site is owned and maintained by
        BWSC (see Figure 6-2). There is one cement-lined ductile iron (CLDI) distribution line
        located in South Huntington Avenue. The distribution line begins as an 8-inch CLDI off the
        southeast corner of the Project site and increases to a 12-inch CLDI near the VA Boston
        Healthcare System's facility. Both are part of the Southern High service network and were
        installed in 1979.

        According to BWSC records, the existing buildings have two existing water services; a 4-
        inch service near the northerly portion of the main building and a 4-inch service to the
        residence building located at the southeast corner of the Project site. These services are
        connected to the 12-inch (Southern High) water main in South Huntington Avenue.

        There is a fire hydrant located on South Huntington Avenue in front of the main building
        and it appears this hydrant will provide sufficient coverage for the Project. The Proponent
        will confirm this with BWSC and the Boston Fire Department (BFD) during the detailed
        design phase.

        6.3.2         Anticipated Water Consumption

        The maximum daily water demand is estimated to be 28,730 gpd based on the sewage flow
        estimate and an added factor for system losses including the average requirements for the
        Project's cooling system. More detailed water use and meter sizing calculations will be
        submitted to BWSC as part of the Site Plan approval process.

        6.3.3         Proposed Water Service

        A new 6-inch domestic water and a dedicated 6-inch fire protection service for the Project
        are expected to tie into the 12-inch water main (Southern High) on South Huntington
        Avenue with a tapping sleeve and valve. Water meters will be of a type approved by
        BWSC and tied into the BWSC's Automatic Meter Reading system.

        Given the combination of urban planting conditions and the constriction of available
        planting space along South Huntington Avenue, irrigation is anticipated to be used to create
        the desired gardens and inviting landscape that is proposed. In addition, for all landscapes
        above structure, such as the elevated terraces, irrigation will also be required.

        The Proponent will provide BWSC an estimate of the water usage. Also, methods to reduce
        water usage will be investigated including soil moisture indicators and the use of water
        efficient landscaping.

        It is anticipated that the existing water services will be abandoned and cut and capped at
        the main with the valve box, frame and cover removed. Fire protection service removal
        will be coordinated with BWSC, BFD, and Inspectional Services Department. A
        Termination Verification Approval Form for Demolition will be submitted for approval by

        BWSC prior to demolition of the existing structures. The Contractor will obtain a Hydrant
        Meter Permit from BWSC if hydrant use is required during construction.

        6.3.4         Water Supply Conservation and Mitigation Measures

        The Proponent is investigating the use of low consumption plumbing fixtures. It is expected
        that low-flow water closets and showers will be used. Lavatories are expected to have
        aerated faucets to reduce water usage.

6.4     Storm Drainage System

        6.4.1         Existing Storm Drainage System

        BWSC owns and maintains two 12-inch storm drains in South Huntington Avenue off the
        easterly side of the site. DCR owns and maintains a storm drain system in Jamaicaway off
        the westerly side of the site.

        The existing Project site consists of a mixture of impervious surfaces (rooftops and paved
        parking lots), grass lawns, and wooded areas. Currently, only a small portion of the Project
        site directs stormwater runoff to the BWSC owned system in South Huntington Avenue.
        The landscaped area abutting South Huntington Avenue on the easterly side of the Project
        site drains overland where it is collected by catch basins on South Huntington Avenue.

        The current, on-site storm drain system generally collects runoff from the existing paved
        parking areas and building rooftops. This system then quickly conveys the runoff to the
        DCR owned storm drain system in Jamaicaway. This system provides minimal water quality
        improvement and little opportunity for infiltrating runoff collected from impervious areas
        prior to discharging to DCR's storm drain system in the Jamaicaway.

        Runoff from the parking area in the southeast corner of the Project site drains overland and
        discharges into a swale located along the southern edge of the property. This swale runs in
        a westerly direction and ultimately discharges to the DCR storm drain system in
        Jamaicaway.




3241 PNF/6.0-Infrastructure.doc                   6-6                           Infrastructure Systems
161 South Huntington Avenue                                                    Epsilon Associates Inc.
        Runoff from the paved parking and lawn areas to the south and east of the main building
        drain overland and are captured by catch basins. These catch basins tie into the on-site
        storm drain system and eventually discharge into the Jamaicaway storm drain system.

        The runoff from the paved parking area in the northeast portion of the Project site drains
        overland and is captured by an apparent leaching basin. This leaching basin appears to
        have minimal capacity before it overflows onto the property abutting the Project to the
        north.

        Rooftop runoff from the four existing buildings is conveyed by building service pipes to the
        on-site stormwater conveyance (pipe) system, ultimately discharging to the DCR's storm
        drain system in the Jamaicaway.

        The lawn and wooded areas located on the western portion of the Project site drain in a
        westerly direction towards Jamaicaway. Ultimately the runoff from these areas is captured
        by catch basins in Jamaicaway and enters the municipal system.

        6.4.2         Proposed Storm Water System

        The Project will improve both the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff. Quality will
        be improved through the installation of deep sump catch basins, water quality inlet, on-site
        infiltration system, and stabilization of the on-site swale. Quantity of runoff will be reduced
        by the proposed stormwater infiltration system.

        Runoff from the surface parking area on the eastern portion of the site is expected to be
        collected by deep sump catch basins. Flows to the catch basins will be routed through a
        water quality inlet (e.g. particle separator) before being piped downstream and tie into the
        existing on-site system located in the northwest corner of the Project site.

        The building will occupy a large portion of the site. Runoff from the rooftop will be
        collected and sent to the proposed infiltration system. Runoff from most rainfall events will
        be infiltrated into the ground. The infiltration system is expected to have an overflow
        structure in case the system gets inundated by larger storm events. The overflow structure
        will be tied to the existing on-site system located in the northwest corner of the Project site.

        The storm drain system will be designed in accordance with BWSC's design standards and
        the BWSC "Requirements for Site Plans." A Site Plan will be submitted for BWSC approval
        and a General Service Application will be completed prior to any off-site drain work. Any
        drain connections terminated as a result of construction will be cut and capped at the storm
        drain in the street in accordance with BWSC standards. In addition, coordination and
        approval from DCR for the proposed storm drain improvements that will affect their system
        will occur during the detailed design phase.

        Erosion and sediment controls will be used during construction to protect adjacent
        properties, the municipal storm drain system and the on-site storm drain system. A
        pollution prevention plan will be prepared for use during construction including during
        demolition activity. An operation and maintenance plan will be developed to support the
        long-term functionality of the proposed stormwater management system.

6.5     Electrical Service

        NSTAR owns and maintains the electrical transmission system located in South Huntington
        Street. The actual size and location of the building services will be coordinated with
        NSTAR during the detailed design phase.

        The Proponent is investigating energy conservation measures, including high efficiency
        lighting.

        The street lighting system adjacent to the site consists of shoebox luminaires in good
        condition. Construction may require the removal and storage of one or more street lights,
        which will be reinstalled during the appropriate stage of construction. Work on the City's
        street lighting system will be approved by the Public Works Department, Street Lighting
        Section.

6.6     Telecommunications Systems

        Verizon maintains infrastructure in South Huntington Avenue and offers telephone and
        high-speed internet services in the area.

6.7     Gas Systems

        National Grid owns and maintains a gas main in South Huntington Avenue. The Project is
        expected to use natural gas for heating and domestic hot water. The actual size and
        location of the building services will be coordinated with National Grid during the detailed
        design phase.

6.8     Steam Systems

        Veolia Energy does not have steam structures adjacent to the Project site.

6.9     Utility Protection during Construction

        The Contractor will notify utility companies and call "Dig Safe" prior to excavation. During
        construction, infrastructure will be protected using sheeting and shoring, temporary
        relocations, and construction staging as required. The Construction Contractor will be
        required to coordinate all protection measures, temporary supports, and temporary
        shutdowns of all utilities with the appropriate utility owners and/or agencies. The
        Construction Contractor will also be required to provide adequate notification to the utility

Air Quality Analysis
AIR QUALITY APPENDIX

Introduction

This Air Quality Appendix provides modeling assumptions and backup for results presented in
Section 3.5 of the report. Included within this documentation is a brief description of the
methodology employed along with pertinent calculations and data used in the emissions and
dispersion calculations supporting the microscale air quality analyses.

Motor Vehicle Emissions

The EPA MOBILE6.2 computer program generated motor vehicle emissions used in the mobile
source CAL3QHC modeling. The model input parameters were provided by MassDEP. Emission
rates were derived for 2012 and 2017 for speed limits of 2.5, 10, 15, and 30 mph for use in the
microscale analyses.

CAL3QHC

For the intersections studied, the CAL3QHC model was applied to calculate CO concentrations at
sensitive receptor locations using emission rates derived in MOBILE6.2. The intersection's queue
links and free flow links were input to the model along with sensitive receptors at all locations
nearby each intersection. The meteorological assumptions input into the model were a 1.0 meter
per second wind speed, Pasquill-Gifford Class D stability combined with a mixing height of 1000
meters. For each direction, the full range of wind directions at 10 degree intervals was examined.
In addition, a surface roughness (z0) of 175 cm was used for the intersection. Idle emission rates for
queue links were based on 2.5 mph emission rates derived in MOBILE6.2 and converted from
grams per mile to grams per hour. Emission rates for speeds of 10, 15, and 30 mph were used for
right turn, left turn, and free flow links, respectively.

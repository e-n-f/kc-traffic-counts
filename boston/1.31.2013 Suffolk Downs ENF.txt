     Off-site Project elements related to the Boardman Street improvements and Route 1A flyover will also create 1.04 acres
     of impervious area, and will not involve any wetlands impacts, buildings, or wastewater.

     According to the applicable FEMA-FIRM maps 25025C0038G and 252025C0019G, a portion of the Project site is located
     within a mapped 100-year floodplain, Zone AE, Base Elevation 9 feet NGVD (15.46 feet Boston City Base). Under the
     Wetlands Protection Act regulations, the 100-year floodplain may be classified as Bordering Land Subject to Flooding
     (BLSF) (310 CMR 10.57) or Land Subject to Coastal Storm Flowage (LSCSF) (310 CMR 10.04) depending on site
     specific conditions and flooding characteristics. As described in further detail below, the Project has conservatively
     classified the 100-year floodplain as BLSF based on two open Orders of Conditions issued by the Boston and Revere
     Conservation Commissions in 2011 (MassDEP File Nos. 006-1276 and 061-0620).

     Existing and proposed square footage does not include existing horse barns.

    Under existing conditions, the Project site generates trips associated with the Suffolk Downs Racetrack which, although
    somewhat seasonal in nature, is operational throughout the year. In addition, the three vehicular site access points (Rte
    1A/Tomasello Drive, Rte 145/Winthrop Avenue/Tomasello Drive, and Rte 1A/Furlong Drive) attract other users not
    associated with the Project site itself. These include trips associated with the retail plaza abutting the site on Furlong
    Drive and unrelated trips that utilize Tomasello Drive as a connection between Rte 1A and Rte 145/Winthrop Avenue. It
    is difficult to distinguish accurately between the different users of the three site access points. Therefore, the existing site
    trips include a summation of the Average Daily Trips (ADT) established by full-week Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR)
    counts performed on each access roadway in July 2012.

    Based on preliminary analysis. The DEIR will present a comprehensive trip generation analysis to refine this estimate.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Describe the existing conditions and land uses on the project site:

EXISTING CONDITIONS

Section 2.1 of the Supplemental Project Information in Attachment A describes existing conditions and the
geographic context of the Project site.

Describe the proposed project and its programmatic and physical elements:

PROPOSED PROJECT

Section 2.2 of the Supplemental Project Information in Attachment A contains a detailed Project description
that includes programmatic and physical elements; open space and landscaping plans are described in
Section 2.2.4. The Project's numerous public benefits are identified in Section 1.5, and the Proponent's
commitment to green design and practices is described in Section 2.3. Urban design elements of the
proposed Project, including sustainable design and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
goals, are described in Section 4.2.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS

Wetland Resource Areas/100-Year Floodplain: Potential impacts related to on-site wetland resource areas,
off-site wetland resource areas, and the 100-year floodplain are described in Section 4.1.6 of the
Supplemental Project Information in Attachment A.

Wastewater: Section 4.4.2 of the Supplemental Project Information in Attachment A addresses wastewater.
Estimated wastewater generation is quantified in Section 4.4.2.2, and sewer capacity and impacts are
described in Section 4.4.2.3.

Water: Section 4.4.3 of the Supplemental Project Information in Attachment A addresses water. Estimated
proposed water consumption is quantified in Section 4.4.3.2, and water system capacity and impacts are
described in Section 4.4.3.3.

Transportation: Section 3.0 contains an overview of transportation conditions relative to the Project that
includes data and information regarding the existing transportation system supporting the Project site, a
discussion of expected transportation characteristics of the Project, and proposed technical analyses and
information to be included in the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR).

Air/Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Sections 4.1.5 and 4.1.11 of the Supplemental Project Information in
Attachment A address air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, respectively. Due to the size of the
Project and the proposed changes in traffic operations, the potential air quality impacts will be modeled for
both existing and future conditions in the DEIR to demonstrate conformance with the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards. Project GHG emissions will come from three sources: (1) on-site fuel combustion in the
Central Utility Plant (CUP); (2) off-site emissions related to electricity provided by utilities and used on-site and

                                                 -4-
off-site for water supply and wastewater treatment; and (3) transportation-related emissions. All of these will
be described and quantified, and mitigation measures will be documented, in a GHG Analysis within the DEIR
in accordance with the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) GHG Emissions Policy and Protocol.
At this time, the exact size and capacity of combustion units for the Project have not been finalized. Typical
boilers and emergency generators for development projects fall under the Environmental Results Program
(ERP) supervised by MassDEP. At the time of final design, it will be determined if preconstruction Air Plan
Approvals are required or post-construction ERP certifications are needed.

Historic/Archaeological Resources: The Project involves continued operations at the Suffolk Downs
racetrack with renovations to the grandstand, clubhouse, and barn area. Proposed improvements will be
reviewed with the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC) as plans are developed.

Construction-Period Air and Noise: Construction-period air and noise impacts are described in Sections
4.5.1 and 4.5.2, respectively.

INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

The Proponent will coordinate the design of the proposed water, drainage, and sewer connections with the
Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC). The appropriate permits and approvals will be acquired prior
to construction.

Sewage System: Section 4.4.2.1 of Attachment A describes existing sewage infrastructure, as well as the
Project's anticipated sewage generation; proposed wastewater infrastructure is described in Section 4.4.2.4.

Water Supply System: Existing water infrastructure is described in Section 4.4.3.1 of Attachment A, and
proposed water infrastructure is addressed in Section 4.4.3.4.

Stormwater: The Project includes a new stormwater management system that will significantly improve
existing conditions and thereby improve the water quality of nearby wetlands and water bodies (see Section
4.4.4 of Attachment A). In addition, the proposed development will decrease impervious area on the site by
approximately nine acres, thereby reducing the rate and volume of stormwater leaving the site. A combination
of new conventional and Low-Impact Development (LID) drainage Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be
included as part of the site's drainage design to improve water quality treatment. Proposed stormwater BMPs
will likely include catch basins with deep sumps and hoods, water quality swales, bioretention basins, and
proprietary water quality units, when necessary to meet design standards. The Proponent will continue to
explore the feasibility of incorporating additional sustainable stormwater mitigation techniques such as
constructed stormwater wetlands and rainwater harvesting. These BMPs will be further evaluated as the
design progresses. Project compliance with MassDEP Stormwater Management Standards is discussed in
Section 4.4.4.4 of Attachment A.

Additional Utility Connections: Energy and site utilities are discussed in Section 4.4.1 of the Supplemental
Project Information (see Attachment A). In summary, new power service will be brought to the site to supply
the Project's electrical needs. The incoming power feed from the electric utility will terminate in one or two
customer stations located on the site. Power will be routed underground from the stations to main electrical
service in the CUP. Natural gas will be provided via a new or existing service, as will water supply and
wastewater disposal. Mechanical and electrical systems will be designed to meet requirements of the
                                               -5-
Massachusetts Stretch Energy Code and to achieve the energy use requirements of the Stretch Code and the
LEED standard(s). The Proponent anticipates that the Project will include at least the following energy
efficiency measures: high-efficiency chillers, condensing boilers, water- and air-side economizers, heat
recovery, high-efficiency lighting with energy-saving lighting controls, and water-conserving plumbing fixtures.

NOTE: The project description should summarize both the project's direct and indirect impacts (including
construction period impacts) in terms of their magnitude, geographic extent, duration and frequency, and
reversibility, as applicable. It should also discuss the infrastructure requirements of the project and the capacity
of the municipal and/or regional infrastructure to sustain these requirements into the future.

Describe the on-site project alternatives (and alternative off-site locations, if applicable), considered by the
proponent, including at least one feasible alternative that is allowed under current zoning, and the reasons(s)
that they were not selected as the preferred alternative:

ALTERNATIVES

Even with its abundance of open space and view corridors, without expanded gaming it is not financially viable
to maintain the 161-acre Project site solely as a thoroughbred racetrack. For over ten years, the Suffolk Downs
owners have sustained the racetrack use at a huge economic loss with the hope that gaming legislation would
permit a compatible entertainment use which could be used to permit the continued existence of the site as a
racetrack venue. Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs represents that compatible alternative.

The current use (i.e., the No Build Alternative) is not a feasible or practical economic alternative for the use of
the site. As currently zoned, the land in both Boston and Revere, including the area in East Boston specifically
zoned as an Economic Development Area (EDA), would yield its highest and best use for the owners as a
mixed commercial/residential use with its proximity to Logan Airport, two existing Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA) stations, and downtown Boston with an existing network of adjacent highways
and connector roads.

For a comparative environmental impact analysis, as well as a comparative analysis of public benefits and
mitigation, it is fortunate that redevelopment of the entire 161-acre Project site for mixed uses was studied in
2006. Specifically, Vanasse & Associates, Inc. (in consultation with the Cities of Revere and Boston, DCR, the
Massachusetts Highway Department, and the MBTA) conducted a feasibility study to assess the impacts of the
potential redevelopment of the site with respect to access and off-site improvements that may be required to
accommodate such redevelopment. The study considered a mixed-use development including 3,236
residential units (consisting of 1,618 rental apartment units and 1,618 condominium units) together with
698,305 square feet of retail and restaurant uses.

The proposed mixed use development would have utilized the majority of the open space at the site, including
the racetrack and infield area (which will be preserved as part of the proposed casino development).
Comparing results of that analysis to impacts of the proposed Project using the site as a destination resort
casino, racetrack, and ancillary development shows the Project as proposed will avoid and minimize damage to
the environment. Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs, as now proposed, will not only minimize new acres of land
altered, but will actually decrease impervious area from 70 acres to 61 acres. In contrast to the mixed use




                                                -6-
development alternative, there will be no additional BVW wetlands alteration. The most significant
environmental impact under both development alternatives is the generation of new traffic and its resultant air
quality impacts.

From a transportation perspective, there are three important distinctions among the alternatives, each
discussed in the following paragraphs, all of which support the preferred alternative.

First, a destination resort casino's traffic patterns are starkly different from a mixed-use development's traffic
patterns in terms of peaking characteristics. Peak hours for a mixed-use development typically coincide with
the peak commuting periods on the roadway network. Peak hours for traffic associated with the proposed
destination resort casino, in contrast, are not expected to coincide with commuter peaks, thus reducing impacts
to traffic operations.

Second, the amount and degree of private financial investment into local and regional transportation
infrastructure improvements is drastically different under the statutorily-mandated gaming legislation than it is
under traditional development scenarios.         Under the 2006 mixed use development scenario, traffic
improvements would have consisted of normal or somewhat aggressive signalization improvements, lane
additions and alterations, intersection improvements, etc. Under the proposed destination resort casino
development, major new roadway infrastructure will be designed in coordination with the Massachusetts
Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and the City of Boston, and constructed with private funds, along
Route 1A in the vicinity of the site. These improvements could include a northbound flyover at Boardman
Street, an additional southbound lane on Route 1A, and signalization of both the Waldemar Avenue intersection
and the Tomasello Drive intersection to improve safety and enhance access to the neighborhood and the
Project site. Improvements at the Route 1/Route 16 interchange and along Revere Beach Parkway will also be
evaluated in coordination with MassDOT, DCR, and the cities of Revere and Chelsea to address long-standing
regional traffic issues, and the Proponent will assist in funding additional locally-desired roadway and safety
improvements. This discussion does not include alternatives for the proposed off-site transportation
improvements because, given the traffic demand patterns and existing bridge and roadway network, there is no
feasible alternative to what is proposed.

Third, the effectiveness and types of TDM programs that can be considered and implemented for a traditional
residential/commercial mixed use development are often somewhat limited. The TDM program associated with
the consolidated management of the Project, in contrast, will go beyond traditional TDM concepts to provide a
multi-modal transportation plan for the Project, possibly including shuttle services and transportation linkages
with other entertainment and tourism venues across the region.

In addition, the Project will increase open space, including pervious open space, whereas the considered
alternative would reduce open space on the Project site.

In summary, environmental impacts from the Project will be less than the impacts of any reasonably-sized
development alternative at the site, and the public infrastructure investment and improvements constructed or
funded by the Project will be far superior even without considering the jobs, local revenues, mandated
infrastructure and mitigation investments, and tourism multiplier effects that the Project will generate, which a
traditional mixed use development would not.



                                               -7-
The reason that the owners of the site are pursuing the preferred alternative, Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs,
rather than the alternative as a full-site commercial/residential mixed use development is that Caesars Resort
at Suffolk Downs combines the financial strength of a destination casino resort with the green space and
agricultural-sector benefits of the existing thoroughbred racetrack and helps them meet their long-term goal of
keeping racing alive at historic Suffolk Downs.

NOTE: The purpose of the alternatives analysis is to consider what effect changing the parameters and/or siting
of a project, or components thereof, will have on the environment, keeping in mind that the objective of the
MEPA review process is to avoid or minimize damage to the environment to the greatest extent feasible.
Examples of alternative projects include alternative site locations, alternative site uses, and alternative site
configurations.

Summarize the mitigation measures proposed to offset the impacts of the preferred alternative:

MITIGATION MEASURES

Transportation Demand Management (TDM): A comprehensive package of TDM actions and strategies to
reduce single-occupancy vehicle (SOV) travel by employees and patrons and encourage use of alternative
transportation modes will be presented in the DEIR.

Transit: The Proponent will collaborate with the MBTA to determine ways to enhance the connections
between the Suffolk Downs Station and the resort. Stronger pedestrian, bicycle and shuttle bus connections
will be made on-site to promote use of the station. The DEIR will include details of these proposed
improvements.

Pedestrian Access: The Project site layout has been designed to encourage pedestrian activity to and from
the site by making appropriate connections to the existing off-site pedestrian network in the area.
The Project recognizes the existing connection between the Orient Heights neighborhood and the retail stores
located north of the site, and the Project site plan will enhance and strengthen the safety and quality of this
pedestrian link.

Pedestrian accommodations and safety will be afforded priority in the design development of off-site
infrastructure. Pedestrian improvements incorporating "Complete Streets" principles will be identified in the
DEIR analysis.

Bicycle Access; The Project's proposed expansion of the existing bicycle network would extend bicycle
accommodations from Saratoga Street along Bennington Street to Eliot Circle at Revere Beach. This
connection would provide the area with an almost continuous route between the East Boston waterfront,
Constitution Beach, and the front entrance to DCR's Belle Isle Marsh and Revere Beach, connecting several
residential neighborhoods with retail, recreation, and transportation opportunities. The Proponent also plans to
provide a spur connection from the Bennington Street corridor to the site to support Project employees and
patrons with bicycle access to the site.

Bicycle paths and connections will be integrated into the Project site plans, and secure bicycle parking will be
provided at the employee entrances and at locations convenient for patrons. Bicycle improvements
incorporating "Complete Streets" principles will be identified in the DEIR analysis.
                                               -8-
Traffic and Roadway Infrastructure: The Project includes major off-site roadway, traffic, and safety
improvements, comprising new roadway infrastructure to be designed and constructed in consultation with
MassDOT and the City of Boston on Route 1A in the vicinity of the site. These improvements could include a
Route 1A northbound flyover at Boardman Street, an additional Route 1A southbound lane, traffic signal
control at Waldemar Avenue, and signalization of the Tomasello Drive intersection to address existing local
and regional traffic difficulties at Boardman Street, improve safety, and provide ample capacity to
accommodate Project trips entering and exiting the site.

In addition, as part of the discussions for the Host and Surrounding Community Agreements, the cities of
Revere and Chelsea have asked that existing regional traffic issues along the Route 60 and Route 1 corridors
be studied to identify and assist in funding potential improvements. New ramp connections at the Route
1/Route 16 interchange and improvements along the Revere Beach Parkway corridor have been identified as
potential mid-term improvements, which would shift some regional and Project traffic from the Route 60
corridor to Route 1/Route 16. Such strategic new connections, and other improvements along the Revere
Beach Boulevard corridor, would be developed in consultation with MassDOT, DCR, and the cities of Revere
and Chelsea, and would be expected to address long-standing regional traffic issues in the Cities of Revere
and Chelsea along the Route 60 corridor through Butler Circle and Bell Circle, as well as along Route
16/Revere Beach Parkway between Webster Avenue and the split to Route 145.

A full analysis of these and other infrastructure improvements will be presented in the DEIR. The design of
local traffic and roadway improvements will be developed incorporating "Complete Streets" principles.

Wetland Resource Areas: Wetland resource area impacts associated with the on-site development work is
limited to minor re-grading to install stormwater management BMPs (e.g., rip rap, flared end structures) within
the 25-foot Riverfront Area of Sales Creek, portions of which are previously developed and degraded as
defined by the Wetlands Protection Act regulations (310 CMR 10.58(5)). The Project does not propose to alter
Sales Creek nor does it propose any activities in Bordering Vegetated Wetlands (BVW) located elsewhere
along the perimeter of the Site.

Activities proposed in the 100-year floodplain will occur primarily in two locations: (1) in the vicinity of the
proposed entrance drive and traffic circle area at the southern end of the site; and (2) in the parking lot located
at the north end of the Project site. These activities will likely include raising site elevations in some areas to
construct the interior driveways and parking areas, utility connections and stormwater management system
improvements. The work will occur in previously developed areas comprised of pavement or urban fill. As
previously noted, under the Wetlands Protection Act regulations, the 100-year floodplain may be classified as
Bordering Land Subject to Flooding (BLSF, 310 CMR 10.57) or Land Subject to Coastal Storm Flowage
(LSCSF, 310 CMR 10.04) depending on site specific conditions and flooding characteristics. The Proponent
has conservatively classified the 100-year floodplain as BLSF based on two open Orders of Conditions issued
by the Boston and Revere Conservation Commissions in 2011 (MassDEP File Nos. 006-1276 and 061-0620).
The Proponent has been made aware that there may be differing interpretations based on specific site
characteristics and specific storm conditions because, even though no portion of the property is subject to tidal
action, the site may experience flooding due to one or more causes during extreme (e.g., 100-year flood)
events and the floodplain may therefore be characterized as Land Subject to Coastal Storm Flowage (LSCSF).
The Proponent intends to work in consultation with the local Conservation Commissions to explore this matter
further. Neither BLSF nor LSCSF have a 100-foot Buffer Zone as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act
regulations. As a general rule, filling LSCSF located in an A-zone does not require compensatory flood storage
                                                -9-
    as is required in BLSF. The reason lies with the vast size of the ocean as a water body in comparison with
    inland water bodies.9 Compliance with the Wetlands Protection Act regulations is generally demonstrated by
    complying with the construction provisions of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as
    incorporated in the State Building Code at 780 CMR 3107.

    The Proponent currently plans to provide compensatory flood storage to mitigate potential impacts from
    flooding as is required under 310 CMR 10.57. The compensatory storage will result in floodplain storage
    capacity equivalent to or exceeding the existing floodplain storage capacity on the property. Exact locations of
    floodplain compensation areas will be further defined as the site design progresses.

    With regard to activities proposed in the 100-foot buffer zone, erosion controls comprised of hay bales and
    siltation fence will be installed along the limit of work line in these locations to protect the adjacent wetland
    resource areas.

    Off-Site Wetland Resource Areas: The off-site roadway improvements associated with the Project currently
    include approximately 40,000 square feet of work within LSCSF and approximately 20,000 square feet of work
    within the 100-foot buffer zone to Coastal Bank and Salt Marsh. A 25-foot Riverfront Area (in Boston) and 200-
    foot Riverfront Area (in Revere) is associated with the Chelsea River, however this resource does not extend
    into the proposed work area. Work proposed in LSCSF and buffer zone will occur in or immediately adjacent to
    areas that are presently developed (i.e. paved surfaces). Measures to prevent adverse impacts will include
    installation of erosion and sedimentation controls and installation of measures to treat stormwater runoff from
    adjacent roadways. Please see Figure 4-1 in Section 4.0, Off Site Wetland Resource Areas for a graphical
    depiction of these resource areas. The current design does not currently result in alterations to other wetland
    resource areas located in the vicinity of the proposed work zone including Riverfront Area, Salt Marsh and
    Coastal Bank.
     
    Water and Sewer: The Proponent will work closely with the BWSC to ensure the design and capacity of the
    proposed wastewater infrastructure will avoid adverse impacts to the existing BWSC 12-inch sanitary sewer
    gravity main. In addition, the Proponent will submit a General Service Application and site plan for review as
    the Project progresses. All proposed improvements and connections to BWSC infrastructure will be reviewed
    as part of the BWSC site plan review process. This process will include a comprehensive design review of
    proposed service connections, an assessment of estimated Project demands and system capacity, and the
    establishment of service accounts.

    The State Building Code requires the use of water-conserving fixtures. Water conservation measures such as
    low-flow toilets and restricted flow faucets will reduce the domestic water demand on the existing distribution
    system. Sensor-operated sinks with water-conserving aerators and sensor-operated toilets will be installed in
    all restrooms. All new water services will be installed in accordance with the latest local, state, and federal
    codes and standards. Backflow preventers will be installed at domestic and fire protection service
    connections. New meters will be installed with Meter Transmitter Units as part of the BWSC's Automatic
    Meter Reading (AMR) system.

Stormwater and Erosion Control: The Project includes a new stormwater management system that will
significantly improve existing conditions. A detailed discussion of proposed stormwater management is
provided in Section 4.4.4.2 of Attachment A.

Various measures will also be utilized during construction to minimize potential adverse impacts from runoff.
Erosion and sediment control measures such as silt fence and hay bales will be installed to protect off-site
areas and BWSC storm drain systems. Existing and proposed catch basins will be protected with filter fabric,
hay bales, and/or crushed stone to remove sediment from runoff during construction. These controls will be
inspected and maintained throughout construction until disturbed areas have been stabilized by the placement
of pavement, structure, or vegetative cover. All necessary dewatering will be conducted in accordance with
applicable MWRA and BWSC discharge permits. Once construction is complete, the Project will be in
compliance with all local and state stormwater management policies to the maximum extent practicable (see
Section 4.4.4.4 of Attachment A).

Energy: Mechanical and electrical systems will be designed to meet requirements of the Massachusetts
Stretch Energy Code and to achieve the energy use requirements of the Stretch Code and the LEED standard.
The Proponent anticipates that the Project will include at least the following energy efficiency measures: high-
efficiency chillers, condensing boilers, water- and air-side economizers, heat recovery, high-efficiency lighting
with energy-saving lighting controls, and water-conserving plumbing fixtures.

Construction-Period: Construction-period mitigation measures, including adherence to a Construction
Management Plan (CMP), are described in Section 4.5.6 of the Supplemental Project Information in
Attachment A.

Partnership, for a release in soil and groundwater related to heavy metals, petroleum, and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons. The reportable conditions were identified during a due diligence environmental
investigation completed in association with a real estate transaction, and the site was assigned
Release Tracking Number (RTN) 3-14857.

Completion of a subsequent subsurface investigation, sampling, and testing program of soil and
groundwater media and a Method 3 Risk Characterization by Rizzo Associates, Inc. (Rizzo) found a
condition of No Significant Risk to human health or the environment. Rizzo ultimately closed the file
under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) in February 1998 by submitting a Permanent
Solution Class B-1 Response Action Outcome (RAO) to MassDEP (RAO Statement, Suffolk Downs, East
Boston and Revere, MA, RTN 3-14857, February 12, 1998, prepared by Rizzo Associates, Inc.). No
Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) has been placed on the property and none is proposed in connection
with the preferred alternative. The preferred alternative does not involve disturbance of the easement
area in the Revere portion of the racetrack infield in which the Commonwealth may have deposited
materials dredged from the Sales Creek drainage channel in the early 1980s.

Additional subsurface investigations with soil and groundwater sampling and testing were completed
by GEI Consultants, Inc. in 2007. The resulting Phase I/II report (Phase I/Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment, Suffolk Downs, East Boston and Revere, MA, GEI Consultants, Inc., February 14, 2007)
notes that the further testing in 2007 confirmed low levels of various analytes in soil and/or
groundwater which are relatively common at urban sites and are entirely consistent with the 1998
Permanent Solution RAO.

Is there an Activity and Use Limitation (AUL) on any portion of the project site? Yes ___ No X ;
if yes, describe which portion of the site and how the project will be consistent with the AUL: _____________.
MassDEP has clarified in previous guidance that hotels are not considered to be a residential use, AULs are
not expected to be required for this Project.

Are you aware of any Reportable Conditions at the property that have not yet been assigned an RTN?
Yes ___ No X ; if yes, please describe:

SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE:

If the project will generate solid waste during demolition or construction, describe alternatives considered for re-
use, recycling, and disposal of, e.g., asphalt, brick, concrete, gypsum, metal, wood:

The Proponent will reuse or recycle demolition and construction materials to the greatest extent
feasible. Construction procedures will allow for the segregation, reuse, and recycling of materials such
as asphalt pavement. As described above, the existing grandstand building will be renovated, with new
gaming and restaurant functions incorporated below the seating area. During the demolition and
                                                - 13 -
renovation phases, appropriate measures to be identified in the CMP will be employed to provide
required demolition notices and manage materials arising from demolition and renovation, and all
recyclable materials will be sorted and diverted from landfills. Existing asphalt will be recycled and
may be reused on site. Recyclable construction and demolition waste, including packaging waste and
material scraps, will be sorted either on-site or hauled to a local sorting facility. Materials that cannot
be reused or recycled will be transported in covered trucks by a contract hauler to a licensed facility.
The Construction Management team will target a minimum diversion rate of 75%. Recyclable waste
from typical daily job site activities such as plastic beverage bottles, metal and glass containers,
cardboard, and paper waste will be collected, sorted, and recycled.

Site-specific information regarding environmental conditions related to the presence of oil and
hazardous materials was summarized in the above-referenced reports. Though the intent is to limit off-
site disposal or transport of excavated soils to the maximum extent practicable, foundation
construction and associated earthwork activities for the new buildings will likely generate some soil
that may require off-site transport. This soil will likely consist primarily of urban fill materials
generated from pile cap construction and installation of an on-site stormwater recharge system.
Chemical testing of the material will be required for acceptance by receiving facilities to confirm
chemical constituents and contaminants present. Additional testing of the specific soil material to be
generated is planned. Chemical testing of the material will be conducted prior to construction in
accordance with facility requirements.

Any material leaving the Project site will be required to be legally transported in accordance with local,
state and federal requirements. In addition, any unanticipated conditions related to oil or hazardous
materials will be managed in accordance with appropriate MassDEP regulatory requirements. In the
event that potential contaminants are detected, they will be compared with those constituents and
levels previously observed in the historical release which achieved a Permanent Solution RAO in 1998
under RTN 3-14857. If the contamination is consistent with that observed previously, there would be no
new reporting obligation to MassDEP under the MCP and construction could be managed outside of
the regulatory process as post-RAO construction. If this is not the case and there is evidence of new
or newly discovered contamination above reportable concentrations and above levels resolved by the
1998 Permanent Solution RAO, then a reporting obligation would exist and construction would need to
be completed under a Release Abatement Measure (RAM) Plan within the regulatory process. In any
case, the CMP will include construction-period dust control measures and will address construction
vehicle trips associated with any off-site soil transport. As previously noted, a draft CMP will be
provided in the DEIR. Also as previously noted, the Project does not involve disturbance of the
easement area in the Revere portion of the racetrack infield in which the Commonwealth may have
deposited materials dredged from the Sales Creek drainage channel in the early 1980s.

(NOTE: Asphalt pavement, brick, concrete and metal are banned from disposal at Massachusetts landfills and
waste combustion facilities and wood is banned from disposal at Massachusetts landfills. See 310 CMR
19.017 for the complete list of banned materials.)

Will your project disturb asbestos containing materials? Yes X No ___;
if yes, please consult state asbestos requirements at http://mass.gov/MassDEP/air/asbhom01.htm
Based on a February 14, 2007 Phase I/Phase II Environmental Site Assessment report completed by GEI
Consultants, Smith & Wessel of Merrimac, Massachusetts conducted an on-site inspection for
asbestos-containing building materials in select buildings on the Project site. Materials that tested
positive for asbestos included floor tile and paper, wall and ceiling panels, insulation, window glazing
compound, and door caulking. It is unclear whether the existing grandstand roof contains asbestos.
See Section 4.5.5 of the Supplemental Project Information in Attachment A.

Describe anti-idling and other measures to limit emissions from construction equipment:

The construction contract will require contractors to use a number of measures to reduce potential
emissions and minimize impacts from construction vehicles, including:
    Use wetting agents where needed on a scheduled basis;

                                              - 14 -
        Use covered trucks;
        Minimize exposed storage of debris on-site;
        Monitor construction practices to minimize unnecessary transfers and mechanical disturbances
        of loose materials;
        Store aggregate materials away from the areas of greatest pedestrian activity, where and when
        possible;
        Establish a tire cleaning area at the exit gate to prevent dirt from reaching the street;
        Clean streets and sidewalks regularly to minimize dust accumulations;
        Use appropriate mufflers on equipment, and properly maintain intake and exhaust mufflers;
        Use muffling enclosures on continuously-operating equipment (e.g., air compressors and
        welding generators);
        Use the most quiet construction operations, techniques, and equipment, where feasible;
        Schedule equipment operations to keep average noise levels low, synchronize noisiest
        operations with times of highest ambient noise levels, and maintain relatively uniform noise
        levels;
        Turn off idling equipment; and
        Use shielding or distance to separate noisy equipment from sensitive receptors.

      B. Describe the project's consistency with that plan with regard to:
          1) economic development ­ The Project will create and support economic development
             and provide jobs for East Boston, Revere and the surrounding community.


                                                      -17-
    2) adequacy of infrastructure ­ The Project will improve existing infrastructure
       including transportation networks, enhance access to and from the MBTA Blue
       Line Suffolk Downs Station, and will upgrade pedestrian and shuttle connections
       to the Project site.

    3) open space impacts ­ The Project will create additional pervious area and will
       redevelop an existing impervious parking lot. The Project will preserve existing
       open spaces and create new open spaces for the public to enjoy.

    4) compatibility with adjacent land uses ­ The Project will improve access to and from
       the MBTA Blue Line Suffolk Downs Station and will upgrade pedestrian and shuttle
       connections within the Project site.        In addition, the Project will promote
       connectivity to adjacent land uses and includes on-street bicycle accommodations
       to connect Constitution Beach to Revere Beach along the Bennington Street
       corridor, along with connections to the Project site behind the Suffolk Downs
       MBTA Station and from Winthrop Avenue. This network will establish access to a
       walkway in the Belle Isle Marsh that is being constructed as part of a separate
       project associated with a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) consent
       decree and in accordance with a plan developed by the Friends of Belle Isle Marsh.

   The Project is consistent with the City of Revere Strategic Plan by increasing economic
   development and employment opportunities, one of the major objectives of the
   Strategic Plan. The Project will also provide funding to the City which could be used for
   infrastructure improvements, another objective in the Plan. The Project will also
   increase access to open space on site and will provide bicycle accommodations to
   enhance access to open spaces and beaches.

C. Identify the current Regional Policy Plan of the applicable Regional Planning Agency (RPA)
      RPA: Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization
      Title: Journey to 2030 (September 27, 2007)

D. Describe the project's consistency with that plan with regard to:
   1) economic development
   2) adequacy of infrastructure
   3) open space impacts

   The Project is consistent with Journey to 2030, the Metropolitan Planning
   Organization's current Transportation Plan, by proposing growth near transit services,
   improving the streetscape, and supporting pedestrians and bicycle use, which will
   reduce single-occupant vehicle trips in the area. The Project will improve the
   pedestrian environment by providing new lighting, landscaping, and walkways, improve
   access to and from the Suffolk Downs MBTA Blue Line Station, and will provide
   upgraded pedestrian and shuttle connections to the Project. In addition, the Project
   includes on-street bicycle accommodations to connect Constitution Beach to Revere
   Beach along the Bennington Street corridor, along with connections to the Project site
   from the Suffolk Downs MBTA Station and from Winthrop Avenue. This network will
   establish access to a walkway in the Belle Isle Marsh that is being constructed as part
   of a separate project associated with an EPA consent decree and in accordance with a
   plan developed by the Friends of Belle Isle Marsh.

   Based on an analysis of the existing wastewater infrastructure and the estimated
   proposed sewer generation, the existing BWSC 12-inch gravity sewer line demonstrates
   adequate capacity to accept and convey the increase in flow from the proposed Project.
   Furthermore, water capacity problems are not anticipated within the existing system as
   a result of Project construction.

         C. If applicable, describe proposed mitigation measures on state-controlled roadways that the
            project proponent will implement:

             The Project includes major off-site roadway, traffic, and safety improvements, comprising
             new roadway infrastructure to be designed and constructed in consultation with MassDOT
             and the City of Boston on Route 1A in the vicinity of the site. These improvements could
             include a Route 1A northbound flyover at Boardman Street, an additional Route 1A

11
     Existing Site trips include a summation of the Average Daily Trips (ADT) established by full-week Automatic
     Traffic Recorder (ATR) counts performed on each access roadway in July 2012.
12
     The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation manual does not contain guidance appropriate to
     the proposed Project land use. Therefore, the Project trip generation projection is based on preliminary analysis.
     A comprehensive trip generation analysis will be presented in the DEIR.

                                                            -26-
   southbound lane, traffic signal control at Waldemar Avenue, and signalization of the
   Tomasello Drive intersection. The design of these improvements will be developed in
   consultation with MassDOT and the City of Boston to address existing local and regional
   traffic difficulties at Boardman Street, improve safety, and provide ample capacity to
   accommodate Project trips entering and exiting the site.

   In addition, as part of the discussions for the Host and Surrounding Community
   Agreements, the cities of Revere and Chelsea have asked that existing regional traffic
   issues along the Route 60 and Route 1 corridors be studied to identify and assist in
   funding potential improvements. New ramp connections at the Route 1/Route 16
   interchange and improvements along the Revere Beach Parkway corridor have been
   identified as potential mid-term improvements, which, consistent with the Boston
   Metropolitan Planning Organization (Boston MPO)'s Lower North Shore Transportation
   Improvement Study (prepared by the Central Transportation Planning Staff for the
   Massachusetts Highway Department in October 2000), would shift some regional and
   Project traffic from the Route 60 corridor to Route 1/Route 16. Such strategic new
   connections would be expected to address long-standing regional traffic issues in the
   Cities of Revere and Chelsea along the Route 60 corridor through Butler Circle and Bell
   Circle, as well as along Route 16/Revere Beach Parkway between Webster Avenue and the
   split to Route 145. Any such improvements would be intended primarily to address pre-
   existing regional traffic problems, independent of the proposed Project and would be
   expected to realize benefits for regional traffic that far exceed the potential impacts of
   Project traffic. Again the design of the improvements would be developed in consultation
   with MassDOT, DCR, and the cities of Revere and Chelsea.

   A full analysis of these and other infrastructure improvements will be presented in the
   DEIR. The design development for all traffic and roadway improvements will incorporate
   "Complete Streets" principles.

D. How will the project implement and/or promote the use of transit, pedestrian and bicycle facilities
   and services to provide access to and from the project site?

    The Project site is served by the MBTA Blue line (at Suffolk Downs and Beachmont
    stations) as well as several MBTA bus routes.              The Project will improve the
    pedestrian/shuttle link between Suffolk Downs Station and the Project entrances to
    encourage travel by public transit. In addition, the feasibility of connections between the
    Project and water transportation will continue to be explored, along with potential HOV
    service between the Project and area transportation, hotel and other visitor locations.
    Pedestrian access to, and circulation within, the Project site will be improved, and new
    on-street bicycle accommodations on the Bennington Street corridor will improve bicycle
    access. The proposed transportation infrastructure improvements will be supported by
    robust TDM plans for employees and patrons to reduce SOV travel and encourage use of
    alternative modes of transit.


E. Is there a Transportation Management Association (TMA) that provides transportation demand
   management (TDM) services in the area of the project site? X Yes ___ No; if yes, describe if
   and how will the project will participate in the TMA:

   The Proponent has already initiated discussions with Massport with the intention of
   joining the Logan Airport TMA and coordinating with Massport to seek efficiencies in
   sharing transportation services for patrons, employees and airport users.




                                              -27-
     F. Will the project use (or occur in the immediate vicinity of) water, rail, or air transportation facilities?
         X Yes ____ No; if yes, generally describe:

        The Project site abuts the MBTA Blue Line corridor and is located within approximately
        one mile of Logan International Airport.

     G. If the project will penetrate approach airspace of a nearby airport, has the proponent filed a
        Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission Airspace Review Form (780 CMR 111.7) and a
        Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
        (CFR Title 14 Part 77.13, forms 7460-1 and 7460-2)? The Proponent is in the process of
        conducting this analysis and, if necessary, will submit the appropriate notices to the
        FAA.

  III. Consistency
         Describe measures that the proponent will take to comply with municipal, regional, state, and
         federal plans and policies related to traffic, transit, pedestrian and bicycle transportation
         facilities and services:

        The Project is consistent with Journey to 2030, the Metropolitan Planning
        Organization's current Transportation Plan, by proposing growth near transit services,
        improving the streetscape, and supporting pedestrians and bicycle use, which will
        reduce single-occupant vehicle trips in the area. The Project will improve the
        pedestrian environment by providing new lighting, landscaping, and walkways, improve
        access to and from the Suffolk Downs MBTA Blue Line Station, and will provide
        upgraded pedestrian and shuttle connections to the Project. In addition, the Project
        includes on-street bicycle accommodations to connect Constitution Beach to Revere
        Beach along the Bennington Street corridor, along with connections to the Project site
        from the Suffolk Downs MBTA Station and from Winthrop Avenue. This network will
        establish access to a walkway in the Belle Isle Marsh that is being constructed as part
        of a separate project associated with an EPA consent decree and in accordance with a
        plan developed by the Friends of Belle Isle Marsh.

Introduction                                                                       Epsilon Associates, Inc.
1.2     Project Summary

        Sterling Suffolk Racecourse, LLC (the Proponent), is the owner of a 161-acre parcel of land
        located both in the cities of Boston and Revere, Massachusetts where it operates the historic
        Suffolk Downs, a thoroughbred horse racing facility (the "Property"). The existing Project
        site is shown in Figures 1-1 through 1-3. The Proponent plans to file an application with
        the Massachusetts Gaming Commission seeking a license to operate a category I gaming
        establishment at Suffolk Downs pursuant to the provisions of M.G.L. chapter 23K (on
        August 10, 2012, the Proponent paid to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission a
        statutorily-established fee to commence that process and filed its RFA-1 suitability
        application with the Commission on January 15, 2013). Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs
        (the Project) is a redevelopment proposed to contain two distinct gaming areas (referred to
        herein as "Casino Area I" and "Casino Area II"), up to 450 guestrooms in two hotels, a
        multi-purpose meeting/entertainment space, dedicated covered parking, fine dining, and
        retail space (see Figure 1-5).

        The Project will bring significant new investment to the cities of Boston and Revere,
        increased governmental revenue, and new permanent employment opportunities for
        residents of Boston, Revere, and other local communities. Furthermore, pursuant to M.G.L.
        chapter 23K, a portion of the taxes on the proposed Project's gross gaming revenue will be
        allocated to a community mitigation fund, from which the Massachusetts Gaming
        Commission will allocate funds to the cities of Boston and Revere and others to address
        potential Project impacts. Public benefits are further described in Section 1.5, and a
        detailed Project description is provided in Section 2.0. That detailed description addresses
        existing conditions (see Section 2.1) and the context of development and proposed site
        uses.

1.3     Consistency with Planning

        The Project is consistent with the policy and planning objectives set forth by the City of
        Boston in the East Boston Master Plan (April 2000). Specifically, the Project will serve to
        promote the goals of supporting economic development in East Boston and increasing the
        quality and variety of employment opportunities for residents of East Boston. The Project
        will also improve bicycle and pedestrian access to the Belle Isle Marsh as well as other local
        amenities.

        The Project is also consistent with the planning objectives set forth by the City of Revere in
        the City of Revere Strategic Plan, FY2010-2015. Specifically the Project will increase
        economic development and employment opportunities, one of the major objectives of the
        Strategic Plan. The Project will also provide funding to the City which will be available to
        fund infrastructure improvements, another objective in the Plan. The Project will increase
        access to open space on site and will provide bicycle accommodations to enhance access
        to open spaces and beaches.

        In accordance with Section 9(a)(18) of M.G.L. chapter 23K, the Proponent's gaming license
        application will include information related to whether the proposed gaming establishment
        is part of a regional or local economic plan.

1.4     Consistency with Zoning

        1.4.1           Revere

        Within Revere, the Project site is located in an area designated in the City's Zoning
        Ordinances as PDD (Planned Development District) 1. Currently, the Project includes only
        racing and ancillary parking uses within the City of Revere, which are permitted by right in
        the PDD1. Gaming facilities are permitted within the PDD1 by special permit. The
        Proponent will apply for the necessary special permit at the appropriate time.

        1.4.2           Boston

        Within Boston, the Property is located in the Suffolk Downs EDA and the Suffolk Downs
        Special Study Overlay Area, both of which are contained within the East Boston
        Neighborhood Zoning District, which is governed by Article 53 of the Boston Zoning Code.
        The Proponent intends to comply with the relevant provisions of the Boston Zoning Code,
        including obtaining any zoning approvals or zoning relief as may be required for Project
        development. It will submit relevant plans to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA)
        for development review pursuant to the provisions of Article 80 of the Boston Zoning Code,
        including any design review of proposed buildings required pursuant to the BRA's
        development review guidelines. The Proponent will pay to the BRA any Development
        Impact Project Fees required under Article 80. At the completion of development review,
        the Proponent and the BRA will enter into a Cooperation Agreement pursuant to Article 80
        in which the Proponent will commit to undertake such mitigation measures and such
        additional undertakings as are typically included in Cooperation Agreements for similar
        projects. Any mitigation and other commitments that may be made by the Proponent in the
        Host Community Agreement may also be included in the Cooperation Agreement.

1.5     Public Benefits

        The Project will provide numerous significant public benefits, included but not limited to
        the following:

                New Real and Personal Property Tax Revenue: Enhanced annual property tax
                revenues;

                Tax Revenues: The Project will generate significant new tax revenue at the state and

                Sustainable Design/Green Building: The Proponent will set a new standard of
                excellence in sustainable design for gaming development projects. Striving for
                LEED Gold, the Project will be sustainably designed, energy efficient,
                environmentally conscious, and healthy for its employees and visitors. Innovative
                technologies are currently being explored to determine what works best with the
                Project as well as what might set a visible example for those visiting the site.

                Open Space: The Project will promote connectivity to adjacent land uses and
                includes on-street bicycle accommodations to connect Constitution Beach to Revere
                Beach along the Bennington Street corridor, along with connections to the Project

                will increase pervious surfaces by at least nine acres.

                Support for Local Businesses: The Proponent expects to spend approximately $150
                million annually for goods and services at local and regional businesses in
                connection with the ongoing operation of the Project and also intends to partner
                with Boston, Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop area hotels, restaurants, entertainment
                venues and tourism organizations to attract visitors and boost the local economy;

                Partnership with Citi-Center: The Performing Arts Center (including the Wang,
                Shubert, and Emerson Colonial theaters), a 77 year old non-profit, has partnered
                with the Project to collaborate on the entertainment and cultural activities at a future
                resort casino

                City of Revere Infrastructure Improvements: Provision to the City of Revere of a
                concept plan for streetscape, lighting, planting, and other infrastructure

                bounded by Winthrop Avenue, Unity Avenue, Bennington Street, and Washburn
                Avenue), and funding for the City to plan, design, and construct such
                improvements;

                Boston and Revere Host Community Agreements: Payment to the cities of Boston
                and Revere of Community Impact Fees pursuant to the respective Host Community
                Agreements for each city;

                Water Quality Improvements: Improved stormwater management on the Project
                site, which will lead to enhanced water quality reaching Sales Creek, the Belle Isle
                Inlet, and Rumney Marshes ACEC;

                Strengthened MBTA Connection: Improved access to the MBTA Blue Line Suffolk
                Downs Station, including upgraded pedestrian and shuttle connections to the
                Project;

                New Bicycle and Pedestrian Connections: To enhance local and regional
                connectivity, the Project will improve bike and pedestrian circulation and access.
                The Project includes provision of on-street bicycle accommodations to connect
                Constitution Beach to Revere Beach along the Bennington Street corridor, along
                with connections to the Project site from the Suffolk Downs MBTA station and from
                Winthrop Avenue. On-site pedestrian paths and aesthetically-pleasing open spaces
                will encourage pedestrian activity and access, including at the site entry

                Additional Community Benefits: In collaboration with the cities of Boston and
                Revere, the establishment of Community Advisory Boards to provide additional
                community benefits (e.g., inclusion of local vendors) relevant to Project impacts and
                to generally benefit the communities and their residents.; and

                Agricultural Support: The Project, unlike conventional mixed-use development
                alternatives which would typically involve higher-density build-out, will maintain
                open space and support continued agricultural and open space practices in
                Massachusetts.

        In addition to the specific Project benefits listed above, the Proponent has committed as part
        of a consent decree with the U.S. EPA to fund over the next four years three important
        regional supplemental environmental projects valued at approximately $742,000. This
        includes construction of a boardwalk that will improve public access through Belle Isle
        Marsh and protect natural resources within the marsh from degradation through pedestrian
        contact. The Proponent is also contemplating a potential connection to water shuttle
        service.

Introduction                                                                         Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the disclosure of the environmental
        impacts of proposed "major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
        environment" (40 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)). Such "major Federal actions" include "projects and
        programs entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated or approved by federal
        agencies" (40 CFR § 1508.18(a)). At this time, it does not appear that the Project will
        involve any Federal funding or subsidy, any Federal permit, license, or approval or any
        other Federal agency activity that would trigger NEPA review. Although the Proponent may
        seek one or more Determinations of No Hazard from the FAA and may also make a NPDES
        general permit filing for stormwater runoff related to construction, these filings do not
        typically trigger NEPA review.

        1.6.1        Legislation

        Chapter 194 of the Acts of 2011: An Act Establishing Expanded Gaming in the
        Commonwealth (the "Gaming Act") was signed into law by Governor Deval Patrick on
        November 22, 2011 with the goal of providing economic investment and job creation
        within the Commonwealth (and to continue to preserve racetracks in the Commonwealth,
        including the distribution of purse funds to those racetracks). The Gaming Act provides for
        the licensing of up to three destination resort casinos in diverse geographic locations within
        the Commonwealth as well as one slots facility and the creation of a Gaming Commission
        to oversee the implementation of expanded gaming within the Commonwealth. The
        Proponent plans to file an application with the Massachusetts Gaming Commission seeking
        a license to operate a category I gaming establishment at Suffolk Downs pursuant to the
        provisions of M.G.L. chapter 23K (on August 10, 2012, the Proponent paid to the
        Massachusetts Gaming Commission a statutorily-established fee to commence that process
        and filed its RFA-1 suitability application with the Commission on January 15, 2013). With
        the potential creation of approximately 2,500 construction jobs and more than 4,000
        permanent jobs, as well as substantial proposed investment in infrastructure and the local
        economy, the Project is in keeping with the economic development and job creation goals
        of the Gaming Act.

        1.6.2        City Referendum

        The Proponent is actively engaged with the Cities of Boston and Revere to plan for a
        referendum in each of its host communities of East Boston and Revere as required by the
        Gaming Act.

        1.6.3        Surrounding Community Agreements

        The Proponent plans to enter into Surrounding Community Agreements with Chelsea and
        Winthrop.

2.0     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This section describes existing conditions as well as the proposed Project development.

2.1     Project Site and Context

        Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs is a redevelopment proposed on approximately 161 acres
        of land in East Boston and Revere (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). Of the 161 acres comprising
        the site, approximately 116 are located in Boston and 45 are located in Revere. To the
        west, the property is bordered by a retail shopping plaza, properties containing fuel storage
        tanks owned by Irving Oil Terminals Inc. and Global Petroleum, and McClellan Highway
        (Route 1A). Winthrop Avenue is located to the north of the Project site. The neighborhood
        north of Winthrop Avenue is Crescent Beach, which in turn borders Revere Beach and the
        Atlantic Ocean. The Project site is located less than one mile from the beach. The MBTA
        Blue Line and Bennington Street lie east of the Project site, and Waldemar Avenue is at the
        southern boundary. Orient Heights is the residential neighborhood located immediately
        south of the Project site.

        The portion of the Project site located within Boston is located within the East Boston
        Neighborhood District and is zoned as the Suffolk Downs EDA, the purpose of which is to
        "encourage sound development and growth that will expand the City's economic base and
        afford broad employment opportunities." The site is also included in a Special Study
        Overlay Area that overlays the EDA.

        The main access point to the site is from Route 1A via Tomasello Drive. Another access
        point is from Winthrop Avenue at the north end of the property. Two mass transit stops on
        the MBTA Blue Line (Suffolk Downs and Beachmont stations) currently serve the Project
        site. Parallel to the train tracks is Bennington Street, which connects East Boston to the
        Town of Winthrop and to the City of Revere. Beyond Bennington Street lies the Belle Isle
        Reservation where DCR manages a 28-acre park with pathways, benches, and an
        observation tower; the reservation is part of the 241-acre Belle Isle Marsh, the last
        remaining salt marsh in Boston. As described in Section 2.2.2, the Project includes a
        comprehensive network of on-street bicycle accommodations and pedestrian paths that will
        provide access to these public amenities.

        DCR manages the Sales Creek drainage channel and culverts within the Project site as a
        flood control project and pursuant to non-exclusive easements. DCR also manages the
        related Sales Creek flood control structures downstream of the Project site. The proposed
        Project does not involve disturbance of the easement area in the Revere portion of the
        racetrack infield in which the Commonwealth may have deposited materials dredged from
        the Sales Creek drainage channel in the early 1980s. As noted below (see Section 4.1.6.2),
        the new stormwater management facilities and BMPs associated with the proposed Project
        will reduce the rate and volume of stormwater leaving the site and will improve stormwater
        quality.

        The property is currently home to Suffolk Downs, which opened in 1935 and remains New
        England's only operating thoroughbred racetrack. Historically, the Project site has
        contained as many as 10,000 to 12,000 parking spaces. Racetrack operations require
        approximately 63 acres for a one-mile oval racing surface and related open space, all of
        which exist in an urban environment. The maintenance of this open space and related view
        corridor is an important community amenity. Existing structures on the Project site are
        listed in Table 2-1 and shown on Figure 1-3. Photographs of existing conditions are
        provided in Attachment J.

                                                  total to be demolished               16,700


        The grandstand building was constructed in 1935 along with the clubhouse, which was
        originally separated from the grandstand by an access path from the original paddock.
        Originally designed in the International Style, the property has undergone substantial
        renovations through the years including enclosure of the grandstand in 1945, major
        renovations and modifications in 1962 with a new grand entrance and the joining and
        complete enclosure of the grandstand and clubhouse, another major renovation in 1992,
        and a series of updates and improvements over the past five years. Smaller existing
        buildings on the site are the administration building, electrical substation, sewer pump
        station, maintenance building, and stables. Figure 1-3 illustrates an existing conditions
        plan.

        As shown on Figure 1-4, the Project site does contain some wetlands, and existing
        vegetation largely coincides with the existing wetlands. Of the 161-acre Project site,
        approximately 71 acres are impervious and 90 acres are pervious. The existing racetrack
        and infield comprise the majority of the pervious area.

        Sales Creek is associated with the Belle Isle Inlet and Rumney Marshes ACEC and extends
        through the Project site, primarily as a manmade drainage channel, from approximately the
        northwest corner of the site, passing between the proposed construction and the existing
        horse barns, through the northern portion of the racing track infield, and continuing east of
        the Project site (see Figure 1-6). Areas north of Sales Creek house stables for the ongoing
        racing program.

        2.1.1            Existing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation

        To the Proponent's knowledge, the stable area at Suffolk Downs constitutes the only
        Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) in Massachusetts. In October 2012, a
        consent decree was finalized between EPA and Sterling Suffolk Racecourse as a result of
        unauthorized discharges from the CAFO into Sales Creek and an adjacent wetland. In
        addition to making the needed reparations and repairs to the stormwater system, Sterling
        Suffolk Racecourse agreed to apply a portion of its proposed penalty to three Supplemental
        Environmental Projects (SEPs), projects intended to improve the water quality of nearby
        rivers and waterways.3

        Sterling Suffolk Racecourse worked closely with local community groups and not-for-profit
        organizations within the cities, towns, and watersheds connected to Suffolk Downs.
        Ultimately, Sterling Suffolk Racecourse recommended that SEP funds be made available to
        three organizations: (1) the Mystic River Watershed Association, which monitors the water
        quality of the Mystic River and the 44 lakes and ponds within its Watershed, impacting 22
        communities; (2) the Saugus River Watershed Council (SWRC), whose goal is to protect and
        restore the natural resources of the Saugus River Watershed and its 11 communities; and (3)
        DCR's Belle Isle Marsh, which has a strong and active Friends group and which is located
        downstream of the Suffolk Downs property.

        A number of meetings were held and site visits conducted to determine, in conjunction
        with the organizations, which projects would produce the most impactful environmental
        and public health benefits. Ultimately, Sterling Suffolk Racecourse recommended and the
        court approved a number of improvements, which Sterling Suffolk Racecourse will fund
        over the next several years. Specifically, the SEPs are:

              Sterling Suffolk Racecourse will make available $495,000 over three years to the
              Mystic River Watershed Association. The Association will use the majority of those
              funds to continue its comprehensive collection of water quality data, evaluate
              changes in that data to identify and address water pollution problems, and raise
              public awareness of water quality in the watershed. Additional funds will be made



3
    Sterling Suffolk's provision of funding toward the SEPs referenced herein is being undertaken in connection with the
    settlement of an enforcement action, United States v. Sterling Suffolk Racecourse, LLC on behalf of the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act.

                available for "hot spot" monitoring, a more intensive effort to document water
                quality conditions in tributaries to the Mystic River, monitor stormwater outfall
                pipes, and compare water quality in dry and wet weather.
             SRWC will receive $90,000 over four years. Initially it will develop a Quality
             Assurance Project Plan for collection of water quality data. In accordance with that
             plan, SWRC will raise public awareness of the overall water quality in the
             watershed and will supervise and ensure collection and analysis of all water quality
             samples collected.
             In conjunction with DCR, Sterling Suffolk Racecourse will design and construct
             a boardwalk and related signage at Belle Isle Marsh Reservation intended to protect
             the marsh habitat.

        In 2011 and 2012 Sterling Suffolk Racecourse installed a number of new stormwater
        separation and CAFO process water management facilities in and around the horse barns
        and portions of the racetrack infield, under supervision of the U.S. EPA and a variety of
        Massachusetts authorities, to address Federal CAFO requirements. This work was covered
        by an ENF filed in May 2011 (EEA #14747). In June 2011, the Secretary of Energy and
        Environmental Affairs (EEA) issued a MEPA Certificate determining that no EIR was required
        for that work. That work has been completed and is reflected on existing conditions plans.

2.2     Detailed Project Description

        Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs is a redevelopment proposed on approximately 161 acres
        of land that will contain two distinct gaming areas (referred to herein as "Casino Area I" and
        "Casino Area II"), up to 450 guestrooms in two hotels, a multi-purpose
        meeting/entertainment space, dedicated covered parking, fine dining, and retail space (see
        Figure 1-5, Proposed Project).          The Proponent proposes to construct substantial
        infrastructure improvements on Route 1A in the vicinity of the Project site as an integral part
        of the Project (see Section 2.2.1). The Project elements are more specifically listed below:

             Two hotels: an approximately 300-room Hotel I and an approximately 150-room
             Hotel II;
             Multi-purpose meeting/entertainment space;
             Dining: approximately 16 restaurants including fine dining concepts, casual outlets,
             and a marketplace;
             Gaming Space: approximately 200,000 square feet of gaming space containing
             4,000-5,000 slot machines, 200 table games, and a World Series of PokerTM room;
             Retail: approximately 30,000 square feet;
             Central Utility Plant; and

              Parking: an approximately 2,600-space, seven-story parking garage, one level of
              underground valet parking for approximately 450 cars, and approximately 2,100
              surface parking spaces (total of 5,150 spaces).

        The Project also involves continued operations at the Suffolk Downs racetrack as well as
        ongoing maintenance in the existing horse barn area which will include replacing or
        improving horse barns as necessary. As shown in Table 2-2, the Project involves both
        renovation and new construction. Figure 2-1 shows a view of the proposed development
        from the Orient Heights neighborhood, while Figures 2-2 and 2-3 illustrate the north and
        south arrival plazas, respectively. Floor plans are provided as Figures 2-4 through 2-7.

        Casino Area I will be housed on the first floor of the existing, re-purposed Suffolk Downs
        grandstand building and link building on the Project site. In its current design, the first floor
        will be a gaming floor (slot machines and table games) that will include restaurants, a
        dedicated poker room, and a high-limit gaming area. Figure 2-8 provides an elevation view
        of Casino Area I. The second floor of the grandstand building will be re-purposed to house
        a marketplace, back-of-house support spaces, and a service connection to Casino Area II.
        The second floor of the adjacent link building will be re-purposed to house gaming offices
        and additional back-of-house support spaces. A double-bay loading dock and employee
        service entrance will be located on the north side of the building. Construction of the
        second hotel and retail component may follow development of the casino areas, initial
        hotel, and other amenities. Just to the north, a CUP will provide utility services for the
        entire Project. The Proponent is committed to developing a Project that is sustainably
        designed, energy efficient, environmentally conscious, and healthy for its employees and
        visitors. Pursuant to Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code and the Gaming Act legislation,
        the Project is striving for Gold certification in the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC'S)
        LEED program.

        The existing clubhouse, attached to the grandstand building via the link building, will
        undergo renovations and will continue to house the horse racing program (see Figure 2-9).
        Gaming and racing components will be operated jointly and will be fully accessible to
        patrons.

        The main entrance of Casino Area II, centered on the crescent-shaped luxury hotel (Hotel I),
        will be flanked by two fine dining restaurants and the hotel lobby (see Figure 2-10). The
        lower-story façade will provide a clear visual connection to the interior, and terrace dining
        will support an urban, pedestrian-friendly environment along the access drive. A draped
        glass canopy and port-cochere (i.e., covered entrance) will accommodate drop-off and valet
        services. The 300-room, seven-story luxury Hotel I will feature breathtaking views of
        Boston and the eastern Massachusetts seacoast. A two-story entrance lobby will lead to the
        gaming floor of Casino Area II, which will be flanked by an additional three fine dining
        restaurants, high-limit gaming room, and support services (see Figure 2-11). Escalators in
        the front lobby will provide access to a 25,000-square-foot multi-purpose conference and
        entertainment space flanked by a spa. The two-story entrance lobby will allow for views
        from these function areas into the lobby below. Below-grade parking under Casino Area II
        will provide approximately 450 valet parking spaces. Direct access to a double-bay loading
        dock and mechanical area will be provided northwest of the gaming floor.

        A northern entrance to Casino Area II will have access from a detached seven-story, 2,600-
        space parking structure and will support a lobby dedicated to the 150-room Hotel II.
        Elevation views of Hotel II and the parking structure are provided as Figures 2-12 and 2-13
        in Attachment B; additional renderings and views are provided in Attachment C. A glass
        pavilion will connect the two casino areas at the ground-level adjacent to the north
        entrance of Casino Area II. This pavilion will also be the primary arrival point for the drop-
        off loop for dedicated charter buses and shuttles from Logan Airport and other major tourist

Project Description                                                               Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        or travel venues in Boston as well as from the mass transit station. The Proponent expects
        that a significant number of visitors and a substantial proportion of Project employees will
        access the site via public transportation. .

        Supplementary parking will be provided by 2,100 surface parking spaces in lots located
        north and south of the entrance drive to Casino Area I.

        The Project will bring significant new investment to the cities of Boston and Revere,
        increased governmental revenue, and new permanent employment opportunities for
        residents of the cities and other local communities. Furthermore, pursuant to Chapter 23K,
        a portion of the taxes on the proposed Project's gross gaming revenue will be allocated to a
        community mitigation fund, from which the Massachusetts Gaming Commission will
        allocate funds to the cities of Boston and Revere and others to address potential Project
        impacts. In addition to new jobs, public funding, and direct investment at Suffolk Downs,
        the proposed Project will promote small business and the tourism industry and have
        positive economic effects on the cities and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Locating
        a category I gaming establishment at Suffolk Downs will permit tourists to enjoy both the
        gaming establishment and the unique cultural and social resources of Boston and Revere,
        and will result in additional enjoyment of and support for those resources.

        Caesars Entertainment believes that the most compelling destination resort casinos, those
        that provide the maximum value to host and surrounding communities as well as their own
        customers, are integrated into a destination's existing infrastructure and its restaurant,
        entertainment, hospitality, and recreational offerings. As such, the resort is being designed
        to emphasize linkages with existing local and regional attractions and services, and these
        community assets will benefit from the Project's ability to attract tourists and local visitors.

        Aesthetically, the Project will create a resort embedded within a beautifully-landscaped site
        to establish a vibrant, accessible, and attractive urban destination. Proposed Project
        massing will offer a sense of monumentality, while the carefully-scaled composition of new
        and restored buildings, streets, and open spaces will be contextually-relevant to the
        surrounding landscape. Visitors entering the resort from Route 1A will be welcomed by a
        tree-lined entrance drive.

        As a City-integrated resort, the Project design incorporates an iconic physical design for the
        casino and core amenities that are intended to be a magnet for tourism, an anchor for other
        leisure and hospitality businesses, and a regional engine for economic growth. Specifically,
        Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs will promote and utilize civic, cultural, entertainment, and
        hospitality offerings available in the Greater Boston region. Project patrons will have
        coordinated access to those offerings through the resort's marketing team and via a
        concierge desk located in the Project's winter garden.

        Proposed roadway infrastructure improvements are described in Sections 3.4.7 and 3.4.8.

Project Description                                                               Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        2.2.1         Bike and Pedestrian Circulation and Access

        To enhance local and regional connectivity, the Project will improve bike and pedestrian
        circulation and access. The Project includes provision of on-street bicycle accommodations
        to connect Constitution Beach to Revere Beach along the Bennington Street corridor, along
        with connections to the Project site from the Suffolk Downs MBTA station and from
        Winthrop Avenue. On-site pedestrian paths and aesthetically-pleasing open spaces will
        encourage pedestrian activity and access, including at the site entry (see Figure 2-16).
        Circulation for bicyclists and pedestrians is shown on Figure 2-17. Section 3.7 contains a
        more detailed regional description of bike and pedestrian circulation.

        2.2.2         Public Transportation

        The Project site is served by the MBTA Blue line (at Suffolk Downs and Beachmont stations)
        as well as several MBTA bus routes. The Project will improve the pedestrian/shuttle link
        between Suffolk Downs Station and the Project entrances to encourage travel by public
        transit. In addition, the feasibility of shuttle services between the Project and Logan Airport,
        water transportation terminals, local and downtown hotels, downtown Boston, the Boston
        Convention and Exhibition Center, the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal, and major tourist
        attractions will be explored. As described in detail in Section 3.7, the TDM Plan for the
        Project will include a range of incentives to encourage public transit as an access mode,
        particularly for employees.

        2.2.3         Parking and Transportation Demand Management

        Parking management and transit, bicycle and pedestrian connectivity enhancements to
        support alternate travel modes will be supported by a robust TDM plan. The TDM plan,
        described in Section 3.7, will comprise a comprehensive package of incentives to
        encourage non-single occupant vehicle travel, including public transit as an access mode,
        particularly for employees.

        2.2.4         Open Space and Landscaping Plan

        The open space and landscaping plan for the proposed Project responds to five central
        tenets:

             History: The proposed landscape design embraces the history of the Project site, its
             unique location between the waterfronts of Boston and Chelsea, and its
             transformation over the last 100 years into an active racetrack and clubhouse (see
             below).

             Natural Connections: The site design seeks to link neighborhoods and ecosystems
             by re-connecting adjacent land uses and includes on-street bicycle accommodations
             to connect Constitution Beach to DCR's Belle Isle Marsh and to Revere Beach along
             the Bennington Street corridor, along with connections to the Project site from the

Project Description                                                               Epsilon Associates, Inc.
                Suffolk Downs MBTA Station and from Winthrop Avenue. This network will
                establish access to a walkway in the Belle Isle Marsh that is being constructed as
                part of a separate project associated with an EPA consent decree and in accordance
                with a plan developed by the Friends of Belle Isle Marsh.

             Public Accessibility: The proposed open space design will create a publicly-
             accessible landscape offering a variety of open space experiences for visitors and
             community members. Bike accommodations and pedestrian connections along
             Tomasello Drive will connect Route 1A with Winthrop Avenue and Waldemar
             Avenue through a park-like setting. By creating a hierarchy and diversity of open
             spaces, the landscape design seeks to transform the existing asphalt parking lots into
             to a series of gardens and landscaped parking lots which will surround the proposed
             resort and existing racetrack. Each area will have its own identity and atmosphere,
             offering places for events, markets and dining, promenading and spectator views
             towards the racetrack. Approximately nine acres of existing impervious paving in
             the parking lots will be transformed into a vibrant and active landscape. Visitor
             experiences will range from the ceremonial Entry Boulevard of Tomasello Drive, to
             the park-like setting of the open space bordering the Orient Heights Neighborhood,
             to the active programmed plazas and gardens of the proposed resort offering places
             to sit and relax for patrons and visitors alike. The Project will improve pedestrian
             connections to the Suffolk Downs MBTA Station, strengthening the pedestrian
             connection. Pedestrian amenities will include benches, picnic tables, and new
             lighting fixtures.

             Permeable Surfaces: New surface parking will be integrated into the landscape
             design through the use of landscaped parking lots, where trees will be planted to
             create shade and improve the visual appearance of the parking lots. Approximately
             nine acres of existing impervious paving in the parking lots will be transformed into
             pervious landscaping.

             Sustainability: In fostering a regenerative approach to the site and landscape design,
             the planting plan will be based on an understanding of the regional landscape
             character and natural communities in the Northeast Coastal Zone Eco region,
             specifically the Boston Basin. Sustainable features will be a priority, and select
             existing trees and vegetation will be considered for preservation while new
             landscape plantings will feature native plant materials which correspond to natural
             communities. This strategy will help establish a more resilient landscape in the face
             of climate change as well as foster a stronger local landscape identity.

        2.2.5         Water Transportation Opportunities and Constraints

        The Proponent understands the importance of water transportation to the area, is supportive
        of innovative ways to increase the use of water transportation to East Boston, and plans to
        coordinate with Massport regarding potential water/bus shuttle system from downtown

3263/Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF                 2-9   Attachment A: Supplemental Project Information
Project Description                                                            Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        Boston to East Boston and the resort. The Project team has also met with Super Duck Tours
        to explore the possibility of utilizing the "duck boat" vehicles to provide water
        transportation access to the proposed casino. Although the Proponent will continue to
        explore this and other water transportation options, the following analysis has concluded
        that water transportation dedicated to the Project is not practical.

        The Boston Inner Harbor is generally well sheltered and often remains essentially ice-free
        throughout the winter. Hence, public and commercial water transportation within the Inner
        Harbor is available year-round and has become a well-established mode of transportation to
        certain destinations. Of particular note within the Inner Harbor are the water shuttle routes
        between downtown Boston and Logan Airport, the Seaport District, and the Charlestown
        Navy Yard. Constraints to establishing water transportation in the upper reaches of the
        Inner Harbor include limited bathymetric and overhead clearances, a lack of existing
        landings, the potential for shipping conflicts, and lack of landside services and support.
        Time of travel can also pose a practical limitation on water transportation when timeliness is
        of concern.

        The Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs Project site does not directly abut a navigable
        waterway that could support commercial water transportation access directly to the site.
        There are essentially three routes to the Project site that could potentially incorporate
        indirect water transportation for a segment of the access routes from the downtown Boston
        and Seaport waterfronts: Chelsea Creek; Boston Inner Harbor (the Logan Airport Dock and
        the Boston Harbor Shipyard & Marina); and the Orient Heights/Belle Isle embayment north
        of Logan Airport. Chelsea Creek, and to a lesser degree the Orient Heights/Belle Isle
        embayment, are located in relatively close proximity to the Project site but are highly
        constrained by navigational considerations, limited landing and multi-modal transportation
        opportunities and significant travel times. Meanwhile, while the Boston Inner Harbor
        routes to the Logan Airport Dock and the Boston Harbor Shipyard & Marina offer a direct
        connection across the Boston Inner Harbor via existing water transportation routes, they
        also necessitate a physically longer landside connection to the Project site. The water
        segments for each of these routes are shown on Figure 2-18 (Attachment B) and are
        reviewed below.

        2.2.5.1       Chelsea Creek

        Chelsea Creek is the closest navigable waterway to the Project site, approaching to within
        approximately 500 feet of the site's Tomasello Drive access. Unfortunately, Chelsea Creek
        is also the most highly-constrained water transportation route to the site, with heavy
        commercial marine traffic in the form of deep-draft oil tankers and associated tugboats.
        These vessels can effectively occupy the entire navigable channel while in transit, and often
        extend well into the channel when at dock. The presence of these vessels would
        significantly interfere with efficient travel times of any water transportation in this area.




3263/Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF                   2-10 Attachment A: Supplemental Project Information
Project Description                                                             Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        In addition, although water depths are sufficient for water transportation, navigation in the
        upper half of Chelsea Creek is impeded by the seven-foot clearance of the Chelsea Street
        Bridge. Navigation beyond the bridge requires raising the structure, thus impacting
        automobile traffic on Chelsea Street.

        There are no public landings located along Chelsea Creek upstream of the McArdle Bridge,
        and there are currently no existing public docking structures or amenities along the Chelsea
        Creek shoreline, which is marked by intertidal mud flats that pose a considerable constraint
        on shoreline access. Compounding this constraint, the New England Division of the U.S.
        Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has established a typical setback for in-water structures
        equal to three times the design depth of the navigation channel. In Chelsea Creek, this
        equates to a 114-foot setback from the designated federal channel, which would push the
        siting of any new water-side docking structure into intertidal mud flats, requiring the
        dredging of a side channel to establish navigable water depths to the landing. Furthermore,
        the industrial nature of the southern shoreline of Chelsea Creek offers limited opportunity
        for the development of a water transportation landing facility, particularly in that section of
        Chelsea Creek upstream of the Chelsea Street Bridge.

        Even if a new landing facility could be sited and built, the landside component would be
        constrained by existing industrial or commercial land uses. Landside transportation
        infrastructure along this section of the Creek is also limited, with only internal private
        roadways along or proximate to the Creek, no public transportation connections, and
        limited or one-way vehicle access to Route 1A.

        The development of water transportation landing facility along the Chelsea Creek shoreline
        between the McArdle Bridge and Chelsea Street Bridge is similarly constrained by the
        required federal channel setbacks and the industrial nature of the adjacent land uses.
        However, there are two notable open space parcels: the new Condor Street Urban Wild
        Park built on the site of a former fuel tank farm on Condor Street; and the adjacent MBTA
        "Car Barn" site on Condor and Eagle Streets. The park protrudes into Chelsea Creek and
        includes remnants of a formerly-dredged landing on its downstream edge. The Car Barn
        site is located in an indent along the shoreline. Condor Street and Eagle Street are both
        improved roads with limited traffic which, while not proximate to public transportation, are
        readily accessible by taxi or shuttle bus. The park does not include landside or waterside
        boat landing facilities, and some maintenance dredging would likely be required to
        establish a new landing with adequate water depths. The Car Barn site is fronted by an
        extensive mud flat which would require extensive dredging to be made navigable.

        2.2.5.2       Boston Inner Harbor

        Boston Inner Harbor routes to the Logan Airport Dock and the Boston Harbor Shipyard &
        Marina offer direct connections across Boston Inner Harbor, but necessitate a physically
        longer landside connection to the Project site. These routes have the benefit of existing
        waterside and landside docking infrastructure as well as proximity to public transportation

3263/Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF                   2-11 Attachment A: Supplemental Project Information
Project Description                                                              Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        and direct vehicular connections. The development of additional water taxi or water ferry
        landings at undeveloped or underdeveloped sites in East Boston that are located closer to
        existing bus routes or the Maverick Station may also be possible.

        There are no depth or clearance limitations for water transportation from the public wharfs
        and commuter docks along the downtown Boston and Seaport waterfronts and the existing
        Logan Airport Dock and Boston Harbor Shipyard & Marina in East Boston.

        Both the Logan Airport Dock and the Boston Harbor Shipyard & Marina are located
        approximately one mile directly opposite Boston Inner Harbor from the downtown Boston
        and Seaport waterfronts. The other potential East Boston water landing sites are similarly
        located within close proximity to the downtown Boston and Seaport waterfronts. Water
        travel times to these existing and potential sites are on the order of five to seven minutes.

        The Boston Harbor Shipyard & Marina is within walking distance of MBTA rail and bus
        services, although the existing bus route to the Project site is not direct. The other potential
        East Boston water landing sites are also within walking distance of these landside services.
        Although the East Boston waterfront is more distant from the Project site by land than
        Chelsea Creek or the Orient Heights/Belle Isle Embayment, the existing roadway
        infrastructure is such that landside travel to the Project site by vehicle (e.g., taxi, livery
        service, or shuttle bus) is approximately 10 minutes. As a result (and discounting existing
        bus travel as a component), the combined time of travel to the Project site via the Boston
        Inner Harbor routes is a little over 15 minutes. However, use of this alternative would
        require multiple different transportation modes, which numerous studies have shown
        significantly discourages passenger use.

        2.2.5.3       Orient Heights/Belle Isle Embayment

        The Orient Heights/Belle Isle Embayment is located almost eight miles from the downtown
        Boston waterfront via water. The first half or more of the route travels the eastern extent of
        the Boston Inner Harbor, then veers northward past the approaches to Winthrop Harbor
        and around the eastern edge of Logan Airport. Time of travel and the lack of existing or
        potential docking facilities constrain the feasibility of utilizing this route for water
        transportation to the Project site.

        While the first half of the water route from the downtown Boston and Seaport waterfronts to
        the Orient Heights/Belle Isle Embayment is located within deep waters, the second half
        follows a relatively narrow channel between shoals of the Governors Island Flats and Deer
        Island Flats, past the shallows of Snake Island in Winthrop Harbor, and through the Belle
        Isle straights between Chelsea Point in Winthrop and the runway extensions of Logan
        Airport. While the most recent nautical chart for the Governors Island Flats and Deer Island
        Flats area suggests water depths of 10 feet or more at Mean Low Water, the most recent
        edition of Coast Pilot I suggests a "least depth of 3 feet" along this route. The channel width
        is generally narrow, and decreases to approximately 100 feet through the Belle Isle

Project Description                                                               Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        straights. Meanwhile, the portion of the route east of Logan Airport and within the
        President Roads approach to the Harbor is susceptible to adverse wind and weather during
        storm events.

        There are no public landings within the Orient Heights/Belle Isle Embayment, and the
        residential character of the northern (i.e., Project-side) of the Orient Heights/Belle Isle
        Embayment limits the potential for establishing a new landing facility. It may be possible to
        establish a public access point for water taxi service at one of the existing private marinas,
        but high-volume access with landside vehicular support may create traffic concerns.

        A public ferry boat landing is located at the Town Pier in Winthrop Harbor, but both the
        water and the landside transportation segments of this route would be as long as or longer
        than those matching segments of the Boston Inner Harbor or Chelsea Creek routes.
        Furthermore, there is no direct public transportation from the Winthrop Town Pier to the
        Project site, and thus the route would require passengers to obtain access to either a second
        bus or the Blue Line rapid transit from the Orient Heights Station.

        Although boats speeds are generally much greater in the outer portions of the Inner Harbor,
        the distances to Winthrop Harbor and the Orient Heights/Belle Isle Embayment, and
        constraints on channel width and configuration, which also limit safe boat speed, are such
        that travel times to the Project site via these routes would be two or three times those of the
        Chelsea Creek and Boston Inner Harbor routes.

        2.2.5.4       Summary

        In terms of convenience and practicality of utilizing water transportation as a component of
        transportation to the Project site, the access across Boston Inner Harbor to the East Boston
        waterfront, and thence to a ground transportation link, is the most efficient route.
        Waterside and landside docking infrastructure is in place, and the landside transportation
        component includes, or is set to include, multimodal options. Conversely, the Chelsea
        Creek and Orient Heights/Belle Isle Embayment are without established docking
        infrastructure, and the locations for establishing such infrastructure are not apparent at the
        terminus of either route. In addition, even if a facility could be constructed at a favorable
        location along either of these routes, a landside transportation component would still be
        required. In either case, the necessary landside component would not be significantly
        different in terms of convenience and practicality than that of the Boston Inner Harbor
        landside component. Ultimately, there would be no benefit to utilizing either of the longer
        water transportation routes in the hope of decreasing the landside travel component.

2.3     Commitment to Green

        The Proponent will set a new standard of excellence in sustainable design for gaming
        development projects. Striving for LEED Gold, the Project will be sustainably designed,
        energy efficient, environmentally conscious, and healthy for its employees and visitors as

Project Description                                                              Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        well as the nearby neighborhoods. Innovative technologies are currently being explored to
        determine what works best with the Project as well as what might set a visible example for
        those visiting the site.

        Caesars is committed both locally and nationally to achieving a degree of environmental
        sustainability unparalleled in the industry. In 2011, Caesars was the first member of the
        national gaming industry to receive U.S. EPA approval for its GHG reduction plan. In
        2010, Caesars won the WasteWise new Partners Gold Achievement Award from U.S. EPA,
        and in 2008 it was the first in the industry to join the EPA's Climate Leaders Program.

        Caesars' CodeGreen initiative focuses across the board on the company, its employees,
        guests, and suppliers to ensure it remains at the pinnacle of corporate sustainability
        leadership. The Proponent will fully comply with the goals of Massachusetts' revised Solid
        Waste Master Plan and hopes to push the state's goals to new levels of achievement by
        investing in technology such as, possibly, anaerobic digestion for both food waste and
        racetrack wastes.

        As summarized below, the Project includes a conservative approach on floodplain
        management, sea level rise, LEED certification, GHG emissions, and climate change
        preparedness.

        2.3.1         Floodplain Management

        Portions of the Project site are located within the 100-year floodplain as delineated by
        FEMA (see Figure 1-7), and the floodplain has been conservatively classified as BLSF (see
        Section 4.1.6.1) based on two open Orders of Conditions issued by the Boston and Revere
        Conservation Commissions in 2011 (MassDEP File Nos. 006-1276 and 061-0620).
        Recognizing the Project's location within the floodplain and associated exposure to flood
        hazards, careful engineering and design considerations have targeted risk reduction
        strategies and measures to improve existing conditions. The Proponent currently plans to
        provide compensatory flood storage to mitigate potential impacts from flooding. The
        compensatory storage would result in floodplain storage capacity equivalent to or
        exceeding the existing floodplain storage capacity on the property. Exact locations of
        floodplain compensation areas will be further defined as the site design progresses.
        Proposed stormwater management controls will substantially improve the quality of
        discharged water relative to existing conditions, and coupled with the design of site
        development will reduce the rate and volume of stormwater leaving the site (see Section
        4.1.6.2).

        While these measures will attenuate, or at a minimum will not accentuate, flood hazard risk
        on the Project site, flooding will nonetheless occur under storm conditions above a certain
        magnitude. Therefore, all building foundations designed for the Project will be constructed
        to withstand flood conditions and the on-grade parking design for will allow gravity-
        controlled stormwater flows to exit the Project site, and all occupiable spaces for the Project

3263/Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF                   2-14 Attachment A: Supplemental Project Information
Project Description                                                              Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        will be located at or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) of 15.46 feet (Boston City Base).
        Mechanical equipment will be placed above the base flood elevation to the maximum
        extent practicable.

        Although the Project site is partially located within a floodplain (see Figure 1-4), there is no
        practicable alternative that would allow redevelopment of this area while avoiding flooding
        hazards entirely. Nonetheless, the Proponent has designed the Project to responsibly
        minimize the risk of flood-related damage and to improve existing conditions. Compliance
        with Federal Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, is described in Section
        4.1.12.1.

        2.3.2         Sea Level Rise

        In addition to complying with building codes and FEMA requirements that account for flood
        risks, a responsible development in a coastal area must acknowledge the potential for sea-
        level rise to adversely affect activities in the future. Although the U.S. Geological Survey
        (USGS) assigns a "low" coastal vulnerability level to the Project area, this does not mean the
        area is immune to sea-level rise. A more detailed sea level rise analysis is provided in
        Section 4.1.12.

        As shown on Figure 1-4, the Base Flood Elevation at the Project site is 15.46 feet (Boston
        City Base). The Proponent has conservatively classified the 100-year floodplain as BLSF
        based on two open Orders of Conditions issued by the Boston and Revere Conservation
        Commissions in 2011 (MassDEP File Nos. 006-1276 and 061-0620). The Proponent has
        been made aware that there may be differing interpretations based on specific site
        characteristics and specific storm conditions because, even though no portion of the
        property is subject to tidal action, the site may experience flooding due to one or more
        causes during extreme (e.g., 100-year flood) events and the floodplain may therefore be
        characterized as LSCSF. The Proponent intends to work in consultation with the local
        Conservation Commissions to explore this matter further. Neither BLSF nor LSCSF have a
        100-foot Buffer Zone as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act regulations.

        Although the floodplain does cover portions of the Project site, the proposed building
        footprints for the Resort, including the casino, hotel, and parking garage will not be within
        the currently-designated floodplain. The proposed Casino and hotel first floor elevation will
        be at approximately elevation 28, which is approximately 12 feet higher than current
        floodplain and future estimated floodplain elevations accounting for sea level rise. Every
        effort will be made to locate buildings at an elevation that is above current floodplain
        elevation or future floodplain elevation to the maximum extent practicable.

        As the design of the Project advances, the Proponent will also evaluate as necessary the site
        design for consistency with the United States Army Corps of Engineers guidance document
        guidance for sea level rise as well as the EEA Climate Change Adaptation Report. Finally, in
        the DEIR the Proponent will also evaluate the first floor elevation in relation to flood
        elevation.

        2.3.3         LEED Commitments

        As required under Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code, projects that are subject to Article
        80, Large Project Review, shall be LEED certifiable. There are seven categories in the LEED
        certification guidelines: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere,
        Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Innovation in Design Process and
        the additional Regional Priority Credits. For this Project, the Proponent is striving to
        achieve LEED Gold, and sustainable measures included in the design include, but are not
        limited to, those addressed in Section 4.2.1.

        2.3.4         Greenhouse Gas Emissions

        Project GHG emissions will be described and quantified, and mitigation measures will be
        documented, in a GHG analysis that will be included within the DEIR in accordance with
        the MEPA GHG Emissions Policy and Protocol. The analysis will clearly demonstrate
        consistency with the objectives of MEPA review by documenting the means by which the
        Proponent plans to avoid, minimize, or mitigate Damage to the Environment to the
        maximum extent feasible. The GHG emissions analysis in the DEIR will address the
        feasibility of mitigation measures suggested in the Policy appendix and, if deemed feasible,
        will include them in the modeling inputs. The rationale for not including any of the
        suggested mitigation measures that would result in a significant reduction of GHG
        emissions will be provided.

        The potential for alternative and renewable energy sources to be incorporated into the
        Project will be examined. Potential use of photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation and
        green roofs will be examined, as well as a CHP system and the potential for anaerobic
        digestion. In compliance with LEED guidelines, the Project will practice Enhanced
        Refrigerant Control, where refrigerants will be selected to minimize their ozone depletion
        and global warming potential. In addition, the management of manure and food waste will
        also be considered as part of the GHG analysis in the DEIR. The DEIR will also address the
        Boston Climate Action Executive Order. Transportation-related GHG emissions reductions
        from roadway and signalization changes and TDM programs will be calculated and
        reported.

        A more detailed discussion of the proposed GHG analysis is provided in Section 4.1.11.

        2.3.5         Climate Change Preparedness

        In addition to floodplain management, sea level rise, sustainable design, and GHG
        emissions, the DEIR will also include a discussion of the Proponent's climate change
        preparedness in terms of the Project's potential vulnerability to storm surge, increased storm
        frequency, rising temperatures, increased frequency of extreme heat, and precipitation
        changes, as appropriate.

        2.3.6         TDM Commitments

        The Proponent proposes significant physical enhancements to pedestrian and bicycle access
        to, and circulation within, the Project site to support alternate travel modes. These
        enhancements include ample bicycle parking for employees and patrons and an enhanced
        shuttle service connecting the Suffolk Downs MBTA Blue Line station to the Project
        buildings as an alternate "all-weather" connection to the enhanced pathway system. In
        addition to addressing existing deficiencies in off-site pedestrian and bicycle
        accommodations, the Proponent is committed to incorporating "Complete Streets"
        principles in the design of on- and off-site traffic and roadway improvements.

        Multi-modal transportation access for the Project will be supported by a robust TDM plan
        that will provide incentives to encourage use of alternative transportation modes and
        discourage SOV travel. The TDM plan will be tailored to the differing specific needs of
        patrons and employees. In addition, the Proponent is committed to exploring opportunities
        for connections to water transportation and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) service to
        transportation nodes, hotels, and other visitor hubs, including coordination with Massport
        and other entities. The DEIR will contain additional detail about these commitments.

2.4     Construction Schedule

        Project construction will commence promptly following receipt of the gaming license and
        necessary permits and approvals beyond applicable appeal periods. The widening of Route
        1A and the Route 1A "flyover" are expected to commence approximately four months after
        Project site construction work begins. Barring unforeseen delays, the full Project is
        expected to be complete approximately 30 months after commencement of construction.

      Section 3.0
TRANSPORTATION
3.0     TRANSPORTATION

This section describes the multi-modal transportation characteristics of the proposed Caesars Resort
at Suffolk Downs, and discusses existing conditions and potential future conditions without, and
with, the proposed Project (i.e., No-Build and Build conditions, respectively). A range of potential
transportation improvements and mitigation measures are identified to address existing local and
regional transportation problems in the area and to minimize potential negative impacts of the
Project. These include physical multi-modal transportation infrastructure improvements and
strategies as well as a proposed TDM plan to reduce SOV travel and encourage use of alternative
transportation modes by patrons and employees. It is intended that the proposed transportation
plan for the Project will go far beyond mitigating potential traffic impacts of the Project, and will
also address long-standing issues of local and regional concern.

3.1     Introduction

        Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. (VHB) was retained by Sterling Suffolk Racecourse LLC (the
        Proponent) in 2009 to: (i) study the access needs and potential impacts of a resort casino
        project at Suffolk Downs, and (ii) identify existing local and regional transportation issues.
        VHB performed a preliminary analysis of the transportation needs and impacts of a resort
        gaming project including approximately 3,000 slot machines and 60 gaming tables, along
        with supporting hotel, restaurant, bars and retail facilities. The study also identified specific
        existing local and regional traffic problems on the study area roadway network, and
        developed infrastructure improvement concepts that would address existing traffic and
        safety problems as well as mitigate potential project impacts and provide satisfactory access
        for the Project site.

        Among other key findings, the 2009 study confirmed substantial existing peak period
        congestion and delay at the Boardman Street intersection on Route 1A as well as
        inadequate capacity and safety of the existing site access on Route 1A at Tomasello Drive.
        A preliminary improvement concept to address these issues was developed, referred to as
        the Boardman Street Fly-over,

        New traffic counts were performed at key locations where then-current data were not
        available. This program included Friday evening peak and Saturday afternoon peak period
        turning movement counts (TMCs) at study intersections and automatic traffic recorder (ATR)
        counts over consecutive seven-day periods at key locations.

        3.1.1          Project Overview

        The proposed Project is described in detail in Section 2.0. In brief, Caesars Resort at Suffolk
        Downs is a redevelopment proposed on approximately 161 acres of land that will contain
        two distinct gaming areas, two hotels, a multi-purpose meeting/entertainment space,
        parking, fine dining, sports bars, and retail space, while maintaining and enhancing the
        existing horse racing facilities. Specific Project elements are discussed in Section 2.2.

Transportation                                                              Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.
        The Project includes major off-site roadway, traffic, and safety improvements, comprising new
        roadway infrastructure to be designed and constructed in consultation with MassDOT and the
        City of Boston on Route 1A in the vicinity of the site. These improvements could include a
        Route 1A northbound flyover at Boardman Street, an additional Route 1A southbound lane,
        traffic signal control at Waldemar Avenue, and expansion and signalization of the Tomasello
        Drive intersection. The design of these improvements will be developed in consultation with
        MassDOT and the City of Boston to address existing local and regional traffic difficulties at
        Boardman Street, improve safety, and provide ample capacity to accommodate Project trips
        entering and exiting the site.

        A preliminary concept plan for these improvements is shown in Figure 3-10, presented in
        Section 3.4.

        In addition, as part of the discussions for the Host and Surrounding Community
        Agreements, the cities of Revere and Chelsea have asked that existing regional traffic issues
        along the Route 60 and Route 1 corridors be studied to identify and assist in funding
        potential improvements. New ramp connections at the Route 1/Route 16 interchange and
        improvements along the Revere Beach Parkway corridor have been identified as potential
        mid-term improvements, which, consistent with the Boston MPO's Lower North Shore
        Transportation Improvement Study (prepared by the Central Transportation Planning Staff
        for the Massachusetts Highway Department in October 2000), would shift some regional
        and Project traffic from the Route 60 corridor to Route 1/Route 16. Such strategic new
        connections would be expected to address long-standing regional traffic issues in the Cities
        of Revere and Chelsea along the Route 60 corridor through Butler Circle and Bell Circle, as
        well as along Route 16/Revere Beach Parkway between Webster Avenue and the split to
        Route 145.
        Any such improvements would be intended primarily to address pre-existing regional traffic
        problems, independent of the proposed Project and would be expected to realize benefits
        for regional traffic that far exceed the potential impacts of Project traffic. The design of the
        improvements would be developed in consultation with MassDOT, DCR, and the cities of
        Revere and Chelsea. A preliminary concept plan for these improvements is shown in
        Figure 3-11, presented in Section 3.4.
        3.1.2         Study Scope
        The transportation analysis for the Project to be presented in the DEIR will consider four
        scenarios, as follows:
            1. Existing (2012) conditions, based on recent traffic counts at study area locations and
               inventory of the existing transportation infrastructure;

            2. 2020 No-Build future conditions, assuming that the Project is not built;

            3. 2020 Build future conditions, with the Project complete and operational; and

Transportation                                                             Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.
            4. 2020 Build with Mitigation.

        It should be noted that the 2020 No-Build and Build conditions reflect a "horizon" year
        beyond the standard 5-year timeline typically addressed in a DEIR analysis. A proposed
        study area and study intersection locations for the DEIR are presented in Figure 3-1, as
        detailed in Section 3.2.6. Should the City of Boston, the City of Revere or MassDOT
        believe it is necessary, the Proponent is prepared to add additional local intersections to the
        study area for the DEIR analysis.

        In addition to the roadway and traffic analysis, the DEIR analysis will evaluate transit,
        bicycle, and pedestrian access and identify TDM programs and strategies to be
        implemented by the Proponent. Potential TDM strategies are presented in Section 3.7.

        3.1.3        Summary of Transportation Context and Potential Project Benefits

        Key aspects of the transportation overview presented in the following sections include the
        following:

        3.1.3.1      Existing Transportation Conditions

            1. The Project site is very well located in relation to the Interstate and regional
               roadway systems and enjoys direct connections via Route 1A and the Ted Williams
               Tunnel and the Sumner Tunnel to I-93 North, I-93 South (Southeast Expressway),
               and I-90 West continuing west through central Massachusetts, as well as to and from
               Downtown Boston and I-93 via the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels.

            2. Observations indicate that there is significant regional congestion in the Route 1A
               corridor, and continuing north on Route 60 through Revere to Route 1. Difficulties
               on Route 60 are exacerbated by missing direct connections between Route 1 and
               Route 16, and to the north by limited roadway space on Route 1 at Copeland Circle
               and beyond.

            3. Existing regional traffic congestion impacts local access for East Boston, Revere and
               Winthrop, in particular at the Boardman Street/Route 1A intersection. Although the
               Project site is served by three vehicular access points, access to the site is also
               impacted by the regional traffic congestion.

            4. Regional and local traffic congestion is expected to prevail in the foreseeable future
               in the absence of any specifically programmed and funded major transportation
               infrastructure improvements.

            5. The Project site is well served by public transportation and benefits from MBTA
               Blue line service at the abutting Suffolk Downs station, as well as local and express
               bus routes within one-quarter mile of the site.

            6. Sidewalks are provided on the majority of the study area roadways, but the physical
               condition of sidewalks and ADA compliance is deficient in several locations, and
               appropriate pedestrian crossing accommodations are absent at many locations.

            7. The existing bicycle infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of the Project site is
               limited, although significant bicycle improvements have been made, in particular in
               the East Boston neighborhoods.

        3.1.3.2      Project Travel Characteristics

            1. Based on proprietary data from numerous existing Caesars venues, it is expected
               that project trip generation will be spread over the 24-hour day, and throughout the
               7-day week, with more than half of weekly gaming activity occurring on Friday,
               Saturday and Sunday combined.

            2. The Project is expected to generate very limited trips during the morning commuter
               period. Peak Project generation is expected to occur after the evening peak
               commuter period during the week and after the afternoon peak on Saturdays.
               Therefore, the existing commuter peak periods are not expected to coincide with
               peak Project trip generation.

            3. As a result of the regional highway connections, a high proportion of Project trips
               are expected to arrive from Route 1A south of Suffolk Downs. Very limited use of
               the Bennington Street corridor and neighborhood streets by Project traffic is
               expected.

            4. While the majority of patrons are expected to travel by auto, the majority of
               employees are expected travel by transit and high-occupancy shuttle service.

        3.1.3.3      Project Benefits Addressing Existing Local & Regional Transportation Issues

            1. Subject to design development in coordination with MassDOT and the City of
               Boston, the proposed Route 1A improvements that are integral to the Project will
               likely go far beyond mitigating the potential impacts of Project trips, significantly
               improving safety and traffic capacity in the vicinity of the site, with reduced queuing
               and delays for both local and regional traffic as well as excellent access to the site
               for Project trips.

            2. Of key importance, the incorporation of well-designed facilities for sidewalks at
               intersections and roadway crossings will enhance pedestrian safety. In addition, the
               Project site layout has been designed to encourage pedestrian activity to and from
               the site by making appropriate connections to the existing off-site pedestrian
               network in the area.

            3. As part of the Host and Surrounding Community Agreements to be committed to by
               the Proponent, the Project benefits may, subject to design development in
               coordination with MassDOT, DCR and the cities of Revere and Chelsea, include
               new ramp connections at the Route 1/Route 16 interchange and other safety
               improvements along the Revere Beach Parkway corridor, consistent with the Lower
               North Shore Transportation Improvement Study.

            4. Again subject to design development in coordination with MassDOT, DCR and the
               cities of Revere and Chelsea, the Route 1/Route 16 improvements would be
               expected to significantly relieve the Route 60 corridor through Revere by reducing
               traffic volumes, including volumes at Bell Circle. While they would be intended
               primarily to address pre-existing regional traffic problems, independent of the
               proposed Project, it is expected that patrons of the Project would take advantage of
               these new connections should they be built. Nevertheless, the connections would
               be expected to realize benefits for regional traffic that far exceed the potential
               impacts of Project traffic.

            5. Such Route 1/Route 16 improvements would be expected to also provide significant
               relief to observed current congestion at the Route 16/Webster Avenue/Garfield
               Avenue intersection in Chelsea.

            6. Other potential traffic, roadway and safety infrastructure improvements will be
               studied at key local intersections.

            7. The Proponent intends to coordinate with the MBTA on ways in which to maximize
               the use of MBTA services by patrons and employees, and to strengthen the
               connections between the Project and public transportation.

            8. The Project will provide on-street bicycle accommodations, with spur bicycle
               connections to the Project site. These improvements will create a `beach-to-beach'
               connection between Constitution Beach to the south and Revere Beach to the north,
               as well as enhancing bicycle access to the Project's on site bicycle accommodations
               and parking and the entrance to DCR's Belle Isle Marsh.

            9. The Project site plan will enhance and strengthen the safety and quality of the
               existing pedestrian link across the site from the Orient Heights neighborhood and
               from points in Revere.

        3.1.3.4      Parking and Transportation Demand Management (TDM)

            1. The existing site parking supply of some 6,000 spaces will be reduced to
               approximately 5,150 spaces, which is expected to adequately accommodate the
               Project's peak parking demand.

            2. Parking management and transit, bicycle and pedestrian connectivity enhancements
               to support alternate travel modes will be supported by a robust TDM plan. The
               TDM plan will comprise a comprehensive package of incentives to encourage non-
               single occupant vehicle travel, including public transit as an access mode,
               particularly for employees.

3.2     2012 Existing Conditions

        This section provides an overview of existing transportation conditions in the study area
        including transit service, pedestrian and bicycle accommodations, and observed conditions
        on the local and regional roadway networks.

        3.2.1        Public Transit

        The Project site is well served by public transportation, with several public transportation
        options within one-quarter mile of the site including bus routes and subway routes provided
        by the MBTA. These services are illustrated in Figure 3-2, and their service and operational
        characteristics are described in further detail below.

        3.2.1.1      Bus Service

        There are eight bus routes available near the Project site, as follows (all trip times and
        service levels are weekday service):

             Route 119 (Northgate to Beachmont Station) runs from 5:00AM to 10:48PM on 25-
             to 35-minute headways during peak periods and 60-minute headways during off-
             peak periods. This bus route stops on Route 145/Winthrop Avenue in the vicinity of
             the Project site.

             Route 120 (Orient Heights to Maverick Station) runs from 5:25AM to 1:18AM on
             16- to 20-minute headways during peak periods and 30- to 60-minute headways
             during off-peak periods. This bus route stops on Bennington Street near Orient
             Heights in the vicinity of the Project site.

             Routes 424, 434, 448 and 449 are all Commuter Buses running from different
             communities in the north shore to Haymarket Station or Downtown Crossing
             Station. Commuter routes have local service at the ends of the routes, but run
             express for the majority of the route in and out of Boston. Although the routes
             travel down Route 1A/ McClellan Highway/ Lee Burbank Highway, there are no
             stops in the vicinity of the Project site.

             Routes 450 (Salem Depot to Haymarket Station) runs from 4:46AM to 1:42AM on
             30-minute headways during peak periods and 60- to 80-minute headways during
             non-peak periods. This bus route stops on Route 1A/ McClellan Highway/ Lee
             Burbank Highway in the vicinity of the Project site.

              Routes 459 (Salem Depot to Downtown) runs from 5:40AM to 8:15PM on 60- to
              65-minute headways through the day. This bus route stops on Route 1A/ McClellan
              Highway/ Lee Burbank Highway in the vicinity of the Project site.

        Based on the MBTA's Route Performance Indicators data, provided on the MBTA website,
        the average daily ridership in 2010 on the two local bus routes serving Suffolk Downs are
        1,101 daily passengers and 3,071 daily passengers on Routes 119 and 120, respectively.
        The two express buses which have stops in the vicinity of the Project Site currently serve
        1,549 and 1,085 average daily passengers on Route 450 and Route 459, respectively.

        3.2.1.2        Rapid Transit Service

        The Blue Line rapid transit line provides service from Wonderland Station in Revere to
        Bowdoin Station in Boston between 5:13Am and 12:49AM, running every five minutes
        during the peak hour. The closest station to the Project site is Suffolk Downs Station, which
        is accessible from both Bennington Street and Waldemar Avenue. The Blue Line connects
        with the Orange Line at State Street, the Green Line at Government Center, and water
        shuttle service at Aquarium. According to the 13th Edition of the Ridership and Service
        Statistics Blue Book, published by the MBTA in 2010, on a typical weekday approximately
        57,273 riders board the Blue Line, 794 of whom (1.4% of typical weekday ridership) are
        reported to board at the Suffolk Downs Station.        There are no alighting data readily
        available from the MBTA.

        Table 3-1 presents a summary of the peak-hour frequencies for MBTA services in the area.

        3.2.1.3         Shuttle Buses

        Suffolk Downs Racetrack operates a shuttle bus service between Suffolk Downs Station and
        the racetrack facilities. The shuttle runs with approximately 10-minute headways when the
        racetrack is open.

        3.2.2           Pedestrian Environment

        In addition to collecting vehicle volume data, data collection to date includes pedestrian
        counts at key intersections. A brief overview of pedestrian activities in the study area
        follows.

        Sidewalks are provided on the majority of the study area streets except for Tomasello Drive
        (privately owned), which provides a sidewalk only for a short distance in the vicinity of the
        north driveway into the Project site. The physical condition of sidewalks is deficient in
        several locations.

        Crosswalks are provided on the majority of the study area intersections, although Americans
        with Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliance is deficient at many locations. In addition, there are
        malfunctioning or missing pedestrian signal equipment (e.g., pedestrian push buttons or
        signal heads) at several locations.

        Observations indicate that peak hour pedestrian activity in the area is relatively low, with
        the exception of the commercial/transit nodes at Beachmont Station and Orient Heights
        Station.

        3.2.3        Bicycle Accommodations

        The existing bicycle infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of the Project site is limited,
        although significant bicycle improvements have been made, particularly in the East Boston
        neighborhoods. The East Boston Greenway and the bicycle accommodations along
        Chelsea Street and Bennington Street provide good connectivity south of the Project site.
        Figure 3-3 shows existing, as well as proposed, local area bicycle accommodations. Bicycle
        improvements proposed by the Proponent will be described in detail in the DEIR.

        3.2.3.1      East Boston Greenway

        The East Boston Greenway is a linear park that runs approximately three miles between the
        East Boston waterfront and East Boston neighborhoods just north of Prescott Street. The
        Greenway is "L-shaped" and starts at Piers Park, runs along Marginal Street, turns 90
        degrees and runs parallel to Bremen Street, and then terminates near Lovell Street. The
        Greenway provides mixed use pedestrian and bicycle paths and provides good recreational
        connection between several parks in East Boston.

        3.2.3.2      Chelsea Street and Bennington Street Corridors

        The City of Boston has installed on-street bicycle lanes along Chelsea Street between
        Maverick Square in the south and Day Square to the north (approximately three-quarters of
        a mile). These bicycle lanes serve both directions and provide on-street accommodations
        parallel to the East Boston Greenway. A typical cross section of the road includes curbside
        parallel parking, a bicycle lane, and a single vehicular travel lane in each direction.

        Shared lane markings exist on the length of Bennington Street between Neptune Road and
        Saratoga Street. Shared lane markings are provided on both sides of the street, which has a
        typical cross-section containing parking lanes on each side and two vehicular travel lanes in
        each direction. The shared lane markings are located on the travel lane adjacent to the
        curbside parking.

        3.2.3.3      Bicycle Infrastructure Planned by Others

        The City of Boston has plans to extend the East Boston Greenway from its existing northern
        terminus to the new Neptune Green Park, adjacent to the Wood Island MBTA Station,
        between the Blue Line tracks and Logan Airport's new bus depot, and to a small Wood
        Island Marsh Overlook park to be built at the end of Short Street. Construction of the
        extension is expected to begin in the near future.

        Additional discussions regarding extending the Greenway to connect to Constitution Beach
        and even further to the Belle Isle Marsh Reservation are currently in the early phases of
        planning and the future of these plans is unknown. This extension to the Belle Isle Marsh
        would provide a bicycle/pedestrian connection for the entire length of East Boston.

        The Metropolitan Area Planning Council is working with several community clusters to
        create safe networks for non-vehicular travel. The City of Revere is included in one of 4
        clusters, along with the cities of Chelsea, Everett, Malden and Lynn, and the Town of
        Saugus. The status of this initiative will be discussed in the DEIR.

        3.2.4        Roadway Network

        The location of the Project site in relation to the regional roadway network is shown in
        Figure 3-4. The Project site is surrounded by Route 1A (a state highway) to the west, Route
        145 (Revere Beach Pkwy/Winthrop Avenue) to the north, Bennington Street to the east, and
        Waldemar Avenue to the south.

        Because of its location in East Boston and Revere, the Project site is well located in relation
        to the Interstate and regional roadway systems. Specifically, the site is located on Route 1A
        approximately 1 mile north of the eastern terminus of I-90 (Massachusetts Turnpike) at
        Logan Airport, and therefore enjoys direct connections via the Ted Williams Tunnel and the
        Sumner Tunnel to I-93 North and I-93 South (Southeast Expressway), as well as I-90 West
        continuing west through central Massachusetts. In addition, Route 1A connects to and from
        Downtown Boston and I-93 via the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels. There is a toll for
        vehicles travelling toward Downtown Boston (away from the Project site) in both the
        Sumner and Ted Williams Tunnels.

        From the north, Route 1 is an important regional corridor, but it relies on connections via
        Route 60 through Revere, and an incomplete connection with Revere Beach Parkway, to
        access the Project site via Route 1A or Route 145(Winthrop Avenue). Additional sub-
        regional access from the north is provided by Route 1A North through Swampscott and
        beyond, and via Route 60 and Route 107 to Salem.

        Immediately to the west, Route 145 (Revere Beach Parkway) provides connections to Route
        16, which in turn connects with I-93 in Medford, and somewhat circuitously to Routes 2
        and 3 to the northwest.

        3.2.5        Site Access

        As shown in Figure 3-5, existing vehicular access to the site is provided by Tomasello
        Drive, a privately-owned roadway through the site, with connections to Route 1A and
        Route 145 (Revere Beach Pkwy/Winthrop Avenue). Furlong Drive, a public way from
        Route 1A to the Target/Stop & Shop plaza, provides an additional access connection
        between Route 1A and Tomasello Drive, via a publically-accessible private drive through
        the plaza.

        Tomasello Drive at Route 1A is un-signalized, and left-turns out of the site to Route 1A
        southbound are prohibited, except during large events at Suffolk Downs when a police
        detail is provided. At Route 145 (Revere Beach Pkwy/Winthrop Avenue), Tomasello Drive
        is signalized in coordination with the off-set intersection at North Shore Road. While

        Furlong Drive connects with Tomasello Drive at a stop-controlled intersection within the
        site, turning movements to and from Furlong Drive at Route 1A are limited to right-in and
        right-out on the northbound side of Route 1A.

        3.2.6          Proposed Study Area

        A proposed study area for the DEIR, as previously presented in Figure 3-1, includes the
        following intersections:

            1. Route 1A at Suffolk Downs (Tomasello Drive);
            2. Route 1A at Furlong Drive (un-signalized);
            3. Winthrop Avenue (Route 145) at Route 1A southbound On-Ramp;
            4. (a) Winthrop Avenue (Route 145) at North Shore Road;
                 (b) Winthrop Avenue (Route 145) at Suffolk Downs (Tomasello Drive);
            5. Bennington Street/State Road at Winthrop Avenue;
            6. Bennington Street at Saratoga Street;
            7. Boardman Street at Route 1A;
            8. Winthrop Avenue (Route 145) at Revere Beach Parkway (Route 16)/Harris Street;
            9. (a) Route 60 (American Legion Highway) at Bell Circle;
                 (b) Route 1A (Beach Street) at Bell Circle;
                 (c) Route 16 and Route 1A at Bell Circle;
                 (d) Beach Street at Bell Circle;
            10. Ocean Avenue at State Road/Revere Beach Parkway;
            11. Eliot Circle (roundabout/rotary);
            12. Route 1A at Jug Handle;
            13. (a) Bennington Street at Neptune Road;
                 (b) Neptune Road at Route 1A NB off-ramp;
            14. Butler Circle (roundabout/rotary);
            15. Revere Street at Route 60;
            16. Brown Circle (roundabout/rotary);
            17. Copeland Circle (three weave locations, one merge location)
            18. Route 1/Route 16 Interchange (three merge locations);
            19. Route 16 (Revere Beach Parkway) at Garfield Avenue/Webster Avenue; and
            20. Route 1A northbound at Waldemar Avenue (un-signalized).

        Although the majority of study intersections operate under traffic signal control, two
        locations on Route 1A (Furlong Drive and Waldemar Avenue) are under stop control. The
        expanded study area includes three roundabouts/rotaries (Elliot, Butler, and Brown Circles).
        Despite its name, Bell Circle (the intersection of Routes 1A, 16, and 60) is not a roundabout
        or rotary, but rather it is controlled by a set of four coordinated traffic signals. Similarly,
        Copeland Circle is not a roundabout or rotary, but comprises a series of weave and merge
        sections within its rotary-style layout. Because it comprises a series of on- and off-ramps,
        the Route 1/Route 16 interchange also involves merge locations.

        The differences in the types of intersection control will be reflected in the DEIR traffic
        operations analysis.

        3.2.7        Data Collection

        To provide a basis for evaluation of existing traffic operational conditions in the DEIR
        throughout the study area, bi-directional daily traffic volume data were collected for an
        entire week in June 2010 along Route 1A (two locations), Route 16, and Route 60, the key
        roadways surrounding the Project site.

        Supplemental daily counts were performed for a full week in July 2012 along Route 1A, as
        well as at the three site access roads, Tomasello Drive at Route 1A, Tomasello Drive at
        Route 145, and Furlong Drive.

        In addition to daily traffic volumes, manual TMCs were conducted in June 2010 at the
        majority of the proposed study area intersections, while data from local studies conducted
        in 2009 were available for a limited number of locations. Counts were conducted during
        the Friday evening commuter peak hours and Saturday afternoon hours.

        3.2.8        Existing Daily Traffic Volumes

        Daily traffic volumes were established by ATR counts at seven locations in June 2010, as
        presented in Figure 3-6. These counts were performed over a full week (seven-day) period,
        and include a repetition of the ATR on Route 1A near the Project site in July 2012 to
        provide a comparison with the 2010 data.

        The daily traffic volume information derived from the ATR data is summarized in Table 3-2.
        In addition to illustrating the pattern of traffic flow in the study area, as influenced by
        nearby land-use and commuting patterns, these data will also serve as the basis for
        identifying the critical analysis and design periods for the Project.

        Daily traffic patterns from the ATRs show that the most traveled corridor of the locations
        counted currently is Route 1A south of Furlong Drive with a weekday ADT of
        approximately 61,700 vpd. The directional split is slightly greater in the SB direction
        towards Boston (56%). Route 1A north of the Route 145 ramps has a higher split in the NB

                     direction towards Bell Circle (58%). On Saturday, traffic on Route 1A is approximately
                     15% less compared to Friday, the busiest weekday. At other locations, traffic volumes are
                     between approximately 13-15% lower on Saturday compared to Friday.

                     The three vehicular access points to Suffolk Downs have a combined weekday ADT of
                     15,933 vpd. Of the 15,933 vpd, 63% of the total volume enters/exits on Tomasello Drive
                     south of Route 145, 20% enters/exits on Furlong Drive east of Route 1A, and 17%
                     enters/exits on Tomasello Drive east of Route 1A. On Tomasello Drive south of Route 145
                     the majority of traffic, 63% and 56%, is exiting Suffolk Downs on Friday and Saturday
                     respectively. On Tomasello Drive east of Route 1A the majority of traffic is entering, 85%,
                     on Friday and exiting, 52%, on Saturday. Traffic on Furlong Drive has roughly an even split
                     between entering and exiting on both Friday and Saturday.

                      3.2.9             Peak Hour Traffic Volumes

                      The Friday and Saturday peak period TMCs were analyzed to identify the peak one-hour
                      (60-minute) period for the roadway network. The actual peak hour is not necessarily the
                      same at each study location, but generally occurs between 4:00PM and 6:00PM on a
                      weekday, and between 2:00PM and 5:00PM on a Saturday. Because the base traffic counts
                      reflect year 2010 conditions, a nominal growth factor of 0.5% per annum was applied to
                      provide a conservative 2012 Existing condition baseline. In practice, very limited, if any,
                      growth has been experienced on area roadways over the past five years or so, and indeed
                      volumes at some locations may even have declined since that time. When the 2012 ATR
                      performed on Route 1A north of Tomasello Drive is compared to the previous 2010 ATR
                      and seasonally adjusted, there is no significant change at that location.

                      The 2012 Existing condition Friday PM and Saturday peak hour traffic volumes at all
                      proposed study locations are presented in Figures 3-7 (A & B) and Figures 3-8 (A & B),
                      respectively.

             Transportation                                                                                  Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.
        3.2.10       Existing Project Site Traffic

        Under existing conditions, the Project site generates trips associated with the Suffolk Downs
        Racetrack which, although somewhat seasonal in nature, is operational throughout the year.
        In addition, the three vehicular site access points (Route 1A/Tomasello Drive, Route
        145/Winthrop Avenue/Tomasello Drive, and Route 1A/Furlong Drive) attract other users not
        associated with the Project site itself. These include trips associated with the retail plaza
        abutting the site on Furlong Drive and un-related trips that utilize Tomasello Drive as a
        connection between Route 1A and Route 145/Winthrop Avenue.

        It is difficult to distinguish accurately between the different users of the three site access
        points, but the aggregate traffic volumes on each access road are identified in the Friday PM
        and Saturday peak turning movement network figures. Based on the daily driveway
        volumes discussed previously in Section 3.2.8 and presented in Table 3-2, approximately
        63% of total existing driveway volumes use Tomasello Drive at Route 145, compared to
        approximately 17% on Tomasello Drive at Route 1A and 20% on Furlong Drive.

        3.2.11       Crash Analysis

        The DEIR/DEIR will include an analysis of study-area crash data from MassDOT records for
        the most recently available three-year period.

        3.2.12       Parking

        A substantial portion of the Project site comprises surface parking, with a total capacity of
        approximately 5,830 spaces. The parking areas are generally defined by surface striping and
        limited raised curbing. Although crosswalks are marked along parts of Tomasello Drive,
        there are no sidewalks or formal pedestrian walkways on the site.

        Off-site parking in the vicinity of the site is presented in Figure 3-9. While some time-
        restricted on-street parking is available, portions of the abutting residential neighborhoods
        are controlled by Resident Parking Permit (RPP) restrictions. Limits of the East Boston and
        City of Revere RPP zones and time-restricted parking cover residential streets that are within
        easy walking distance of the MBTA stations, and it is assumed that these are intended to
        deter commuter parking in the neighborhoods.

3.3     2017 No-Build Traffic Projections

        The DEIR will include a No-Build traffic analysis based on the projection of traffic volumes
        for a "horizon" year of 2020, assuming that the proposed Project is not built. This will
        comprise general background growth due to regional growth and traffic associated with
        specific planned developments or transportation projects.

Transportation                                                               Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.
        Preliminary review of traffic volume data suggests that there has been little, if any, growth,
        in recent years. Therefore, a conservative rate of 0.5% per year is suggested as an
        appropriate background growth rate for the DEIR analysis.

        As discussed in Section 2.2, the proposed Project will retain the existing racetrack
        operations at Suffolk Downs. In the event that the Project does not proceed, however, it is
        anticipated that the racetrack function will not be sustainable in the long term, and that
        more realistically the entire Suffolk Downs site might be developed for some form of mixed-
        use development. This potential outcome is not anticipated in the near term, however, and
        therefore it would not be appropriate to include the potential traffic associated with such a
        build-out in the No-Build traffic projections.

        A Draft Traffic Feasibility Study for a previously proposed mixed-use development of the
        Project site was prepared by Vanasse & Associates, Inc. in 2008 (based upon 2006 traffic
        volumes). A detailed trip generation comparison will be presented in the DEIR.

3.4     2017 Build Conditions

        The DEIR will include a detailed travel demand/trip generation analysis for the Project by all
        modes. Build (2017) condition traffic volumes on study area roadways will be developed to
        facilitate analysis of potential traffic impacts.

        3.4.1        Project Travel Demand

        The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation manual does not contain
        guidance appropriate for the proposed Project land use. Therefore, the Project trip
        generation projections will be based on research of data for other comparable projects, and
        information provided by the Proponent including proprietary data for existing gaming
        venues and projected data for its proposed operations at Suffolk Downs.

        A synthesis of information and data used in the development of the Project travel
        characteristics and trip generation will be included in the DEIR.

        3.4.2        Trip Generation Characteristics

        The trip generation characteristics of the proposed Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs will be
        unique to this type of proposed land use and the specific operator. In addition, the general
        travel demand characteristics will need to be adjusted to reflect the unique geographic
        location of the proposed Project and its supporting transportation infrastructure. These
        characteristics will be reflected in the DEIR analysis.

        In general, it is expected that the Project trip generation will vary by both day of week and
        time of day, with more than half of the weekly gaming activity expected to occur on Friday,
        Saturday, and Sunday.

        Since the proposed Project is expected to operate 24 hours per day, it is expected that there
        will be significant variation in trip generation throughout the day. The distribution by time
        of day will be based on an analysis of data for other gaming facilities owned or operated by
        Caesars. The DEIR analysis will reflect different hourly distributions for employees and
        patrons. In addition, the analysis will reflect employee shift changes, which are expected to
        include a wide range of employee types with differing shift changes.

        3.4.3         Projected Project Trips

        The DEIR analysis will include the basis for mode share and vehicle occupancy
        assumptions from which trip generation by mode is developed. Daily and peak hour
        Project trip projections by mode will be presented for patrons and employees separately
        and combined. The continuation of operation of the race track will be included in the
        Project trip projections. It is not expected that activity associated with the race track itself
        will attract additional patrons in its own right, except for special events which, as racing is a
        daytime activity, will not occur during peak activity periods. Rather, it is expected that
        some race track patrons will choose to also use the Project's resort facilities, and, to a lesser
        extent, visa-versa.

        Based on preliminary analysis for the ENF, a total of approximately 24,600 daily vehicle
        trips are projected for the Project, as noted on the ENF form. A portion of the Project
        vehicle trips will comprise existing trips already using the roadway network.

        3.4.4         Trip Distribution & Assignment

        The geographic directional distribution of Project trips is a function of several variables
        including the relative locations and densities of population, competing land uses, existing
        travel patterns, and the efficiency of the roadways leading to the Project site. Trip
        distribution patterns for the DEIR analysis will be developed based on the gravity
        model prepared by the Proponent which yields the geographic distribution of patrons by
        community or zip code. Project vehicle trips will be assigned to the regional and local
        roadway network based on existing travel patterns and route choices available to drivers.

        The choice of routes by drivers to get to and from the Project site access points will be
        influenced by significant roadway infrastructure improvements. As noted previously, the
        Project includes major off-site roadway, traffic, and safety improvements, specifically the
        construction of major new roadway infrastructure on Route 1A in the vicinity of the site.
        The DEIR analysis will reflect these changes.

        A further factor in the assignment of project trips will be the impact of tolls returning west-
        bound through both the Sumner and Ted Williams tunnels. It is expected that some trips
        arriving through the Harbor tunnels will depart via Route 16 to access I-93 North in order to
        avoid paying a toll. Again, the DEIR trip assignment analysis will reflect this phenomenon.

        3.4.5        Peak Hour Build Condition Traffic Volumes

        The DEIR will include an analysis to determine the worst combination of projected Project
        traffic and existing roadway volumes to determine the critical peak hours for analysis on a
        Friday and a Saturday.

        3.4.6        Build Condition Project-Related Roadway Infrastructure

        As noted in Section 3.1.1, the Project includes a proposal for major off-site roadway, traffic,
        and safety improvements, comprising new roadway infrastructure to be designed and
        constructed in consultation with MassDOT and the City of Boston on Route 1A in the vicinity
        of the site. These improvements could include a Route 1A northbound flyover at Boardman
        Street, an additional Route 1A southbound lane, and the signalization of the Route
        1A/Waldemar Avenue and Route 1A/Tomasello Drive intersections.

        A preliminary concept plan for these improvements is presented in Figure 3-10. The design
        of these improvements will be developed in consultation with MassDOT and the City of
        Boston to reflect specific findings of the DEIR traffic analysis.

        Due to the preliminary nature of the design, the Proponent does not, as yet, control all of
        the land necessary to construct the improvements. The Proponent is in discussions with the
        various property owners regarding land acquisition. An updated report on land ownership
        will be included in the DEIR.

        3.4.7        Potential Regional Roadway Improvements

        As part of the discussions for the Host and Surrounding Community Agreements, the cities
        of Revere and Chelsea have asked that existing regional traffic issues along the Route 60
        and Route 1 corridors and various local intersections be studied to identify and assist in
        funding potential improvements. New ramp connections at the Route 1/Route 16
        interchange and improvements along the Revere Beach Parkway corridor have been
        identified as potential mid-term improvements, which, consistent with the Boston MPO's
        Lower North Shore Transportation Improvement Study (prepared by the Central
        Transportation Planning Staff for the Massachusetts Highway Department in October 2000),
        would shift some regional and Project traffic from the Route 60 corridor to Route
        1/Route 16.

        Such strategic new connections would be expected to address long-standing regional traffic
        issues in the Cities of Revere and Chelsea along the Route 60 corridor through Butler Circle
        and Bell Circle, as well as along Route 16/Revere Beach Parkway between Webster Avenue
        and the split to Route 145. Any such improvements would be intended primarily to address
        pre-existing regional traffic problems, independent of the proposed Project, and would be
        expected to realize benefits for regional traffic that far exceed the potential impacts of
        Project traffic.

        A preliminary concept plan for potential mid-term improvements is presented in Figure 3-
        11. The DEIR will include a study of such improvements using the CTPS Regional
        Transportation Model, and any design of the improvements will be developed in
        coordination with MassDOT, DCR, and the cities of Revere and Chelsea.

        Other supporting improvements at the Route 16/Route 145 Revere Beach Parkway
        intersection at Harris Street will be explored in the DEIR analysis, again in coordination
        with MassDOT, DCR, and the City of Revere.

3.5     Traffic Operations Analysis

        Capacity analyses for the Existing (2012), 2020 No-Build, 2020 Build and 2020 Build with
        Mitigation conditions will be performed in the DEIR analysis to determine how well the
        roadway facilities serve existing and future traffic demands. A full evaluation of level of
        service (LOS) results, including volume/capacity ratios and vehicular delay as appropriate,
        will be presented in the DEIR.

3.6     Alternative Modes of Transportation

        While auto travel is expected to be a dominant mode of travel for the proposed Project, the
        Proponent is committed to improvements and strategies to encourage and maximize multi-
        modal access for the Project, and take advantage of the unique adjacency of a rapid transit
        line.

        3.6.1        Transit

        As discussed in Section 3.2.1, the Project site is well served by public transportation, with
        several public transportation options including the Blue line rapid-transit Suffolk Downs
        station abutting the site and bus routes within one-quarter mile of the site, all provided by
        the MBTA.

        The Proponent will collaborate with the MBTA to determine ways to enhance the
        connections between the Suffolk Downs Station and the Resort. Stronger pedestrian, bicycle
        and shuttle bus connections will be made on-site to promote use of the station. The DEIR
        will include details of proposed improvements.

        As described in detail in Section 3.7, the TDM Plan for the Project will include a range of
        incentives to encourage public transit as an access mode, particularly for employees.

        In addition, the proponent will work with the MBTA to develop an analysis of potential
        impacts to Blue Line and bus routes as a result of the Project. This analysis will be
        presented in the DEIR.

        3.6.2        Pedestrian Access

        Due to the close proximity of residential areas to the Project site, walking is, and will
        continue to be, attractive to some employees and patrons. For this reason, the Project site
        layout has been designed to encourage pedestrian activity to and from the site by making
        appropriate connections to the existing off-site pedestrian network in the area.

        The Project recognizes the existing connection between the Orient Heights neighborhood
        and the retail stores located north of the site. Currently, the residents of the Orient Heights
        neighborhood access these stores through the Suffolk Downs site. The Project site plan will
        enhance and strengthen the safety and quality of this pedestrian link.

        On-site pedestrian circulation is described in detail in Section 2.2.           Pedestrian
        accommodations and safety will be afforded priority in the design development of off-site
        infrastructure. Associated pedestrian improvements will be evaluated in the DEIR analysis.

        3.6.3        Bicycle Access

        The Project seeks to continue the ongoing north-eastward expansion of the bicycle network
        from the East Boston piers. This expansion provides an excellent opportunity for the Project
        to significantly add to the bicycle infrastructure of the area, which will not only benefit
        Project patrons and employees but also the communities of East Boston, Revere, and other
        nearby municipalities.

        The Proponent currently proposes to provide on-street bicycle accommodations along the
        Bennington Street corridor extending between Saratoga Street to the south and Revere
        Beach Boulevard to the north. With the current on-street bicycle accommodations on
        Bennington Street south of Saratoga Street, the proposed extension will provide the
        communities of East Boston and Revere with a `beach-to-beach' connection between
        Constitution Beach to the south and Revere Beach to the north. In addition to these
        proposed accommodations on Bennington Street, the Proponent proposes to provide
        bicycle connections that extend from these proposed accommodations into the Project site
        at the Suffolk Downs Station at the south of the site and at the Route 145 driveway to the
        north. Figure 3-3 presents a summary of both existing and proposed bicycle
        accommodations in the vicinity of the site.

        3.6.3.1      Bennington Street Corridor connection to Revere Beach

        The Project's proposed expansion of the existing bicycle network would extend bicycle
        accommodations from Saratoga Street along Bennington Street to Eliot Circle at Revere
        Beach. This connection would provide the area with an almost continuous route between
        the East Boston waterfront, Constitution Beach, and the front entrance to DCR's Belle Isle
        Marsh and Revere Beach, connecting several residential neighborhoods with retail,
        recreation, and transportation opportunities. It is anticipated that the changes to the
        corridor would be within the existing curb-to-curb width, thus minimizing the impact to

3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF         3-20    Attachment A: Supplemental Project Information
Transportation                                                            Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.
        adjacent communities. A bicycle route connecting several recreational opportunities may
        bring additional visitors to the area and has the potential to increase neighborhood livability
        and economic activity without significantly increasing automobile traffic and impacts.

        The Proponent also plans to provide a spur connection from the Bennington Street corridor
        to the site to support Project employees and patrons with bicycle access to the site. It is
        expected that many Project employees will live within adjacent neighborhoods, and
        providing bicycle access from Bennington Street will encourage them to bicycle to work.

        3.6.3.2      Site Accommodations

        As described in Section 2.2.2, bicycle paths and connections are integrated into Project site
        plans. These paths will connect the Project's main bicycle access points from the wider
        area bicycle network with desired destinations within the Project site. Secure bicycle
        parking will be provided at the employee entrances and at locations convenient for patrons.

        In addition, bicycle access from Bennington Street and accommodations internal to the site
        will provide bicycle access to the retail plaza north of the Project for residents living near
        and adjacent to the Bennington Street corridor.

3.7     Transportation Demand Management

        The primary objective of the TDM program to be developed for the Project is to reduce
        SOV travel, thereby reducing parking demand, congestion, and associated environmental
        impact from the resort. Complementary to the reduction in vehicular impacts, the TDM
        plan also will support enhancement of mobility via alternate modes of travel by promoting
        walking, bicycling, ridesharing, and transit. The TDM Plan is an integral component of the
        overall Project mitigation package and it overlaps with other key plan elements such as
        parking demand management and infrastructure improvements.

        While the goals for TDM programs targeted at employees and patrons are the same (i.e., to
        reduce drive-alone travel, reduce travel during commuter peak hours, reduce reliance on
        personal automobile, etc.), the actual execution and implementation of these programs vary
        because of the differences in travel behavior and characteristics of employees and patrons.
        As such, TDM programs need to be tailored to each group and should account for unique
        needs. The Proponent proposes to develop and implement TDM actions and strategies
        appropriate for each user group.

        The Proponent will prepare the TDM plan in close coordination with other stakeholders
        such as Massport, MassDOT, the MBTA, and the cities of Boston and Revere, and will
        commit to the plan by executing a Transportation Access Plan Agreement (TAPA) with the
        Boston Transportation Department (BTD). The plan will be comprehensive and include
        policy/management, infrastructure, and programmatic components. The remainder of this
        section discusses the proposed TDM plan in more detail.

        3.7.1        Regulatory Context

        Existing state and local regulations create TDM requirements that influence the way in
        which the Project can proceed. The Proponent intends to comply with both the letter and
        the spirit of these regulations.

        State Regulation 310 CMR 7.16, also referred to as the "Rideshare Regulation", is part of the
        Massachusetts State Implementation Plan (SIP) and requires employers of more than 250
        employees to establish a SOV reduction target goal and to implement a variety of TDM
        measures for their employees to reach that goal.

        In addition, the City of Boston also will require the Proponent to submit a TAPA, which will
        establish a variety of TDM programs to be implemented by the Proponent and monitored
        by the BTD. It is the Proponent's expectation that a coordinated set of TDM measures will
        be developed for the Project regardless of jurisdiction.

        In combination, the regulatory framework creates an environment in which TDM can be
        successful by aggressively managing parking, requiring employers to implement TDM
        programs and working with developers to mitigate transportation impacts through the TAPA
        agreements. They also provide means for the city and the state to monitor the TDM
        measures identified in this plan.

        3.7.2        Construction Management Plan

        In accordance with requirements under Article 80 Large Project Review, the Proponent will
        prepare a CMP which details measures to ensure the maintenance of existing levels of
        service on adjacent roadways during the construction of the Project and to minimize
        disruption in the area. The CMP will be submitted to BTD for approval, which will be
        obtained prior to the Proponent obtaining any building permit from ISD. It is understood by
        the Proponent that the development of a CMP is a precondition to the issuance of a
        building permit for the Project by ISD.

        A framework for the CMP will be presented in the DEIR.

        In addition to the CMP for the on-site construction, the Proponent will also develop a
        construction phasing and maintenance of traffic plan (MTP) in coordination with MassDOT
        and the BTD for the construction of the off-site roadway improvements on Route 1A which
        are part of the project. Similarly, the Proponent will prepare a MTP in coordination the
        MassDOT, DCR and/or the cities of Boston and Revere as appropriate for the construction
        of any other off-site traffic and roadway improvements or mitigation required for the Project.

3.8     Parking

        Today, large sections of the Suffolk Downs site are dominated by expansive impervious
        parking areas, providing a total of approximately 6,000parking spaces. It is expected that
        the total number of parking spaces will be reduced to a supply of approximately 5,150
        spaces, comprising 2, 600 spaces in a parking garage structure, 450 spaces below grade,
        and 2,100 spaces in surface lots, which is expected to adequately accommodate the
        Project's peak demands. The layout and allocation of the parking areas is described in
        detail in Section 2.

        While patron cars will be accommodated on site, it is anticipated that employee cars will be
        accommodated only during off-peak parking demand periods. While employee parking
        demand will be substantially reduced by management and TDM strategies to accomplish
        maximum use of public transportation, alternative transportation will be necessary for
        employees who commute outside of the MBTA operating hours. It is anticipated that this
        demand will be accommodated by HOV shuttle service, potentially in coordination with
        Massport or other area employers.

        The DEIR will include a detailed parking demand and supply analysis, reflecting all of the
        foregoing considerations.

DEVELOPMENT REVIEW COMPONENTS
4.0    DEVELOPMENT REVIEW COMPONENTS

The development review components discussed in this ENF include transportation, environmental
protection, urban design, historic resources, and infrastructure systems. Where potential for direct
or indirect impacts exists, design measures may be required to mitigate the impacts, to the extent
economically feasible. Transportation is discussed in Section 3.0, and the remainder of this section
is devoted to the studies and mitigation that may be required.

To analyze potential impacts to the general Project area as well as nearby neighborhoods, a future
conditions year (or horizon year) used in the transportation, air, and noise analyses will be 2020
rather than a more typical five-year projection.

4.1    Environmental Protection

       4.1.1         Wind

       Existing and the approximate proposed building heights associated with the Project and
       Project site are provided in Table 4-1. The Proponent expects that the DEIR will include
       results from a quantitative analysis of potential pedestrian-level wind impacts at selected
       locations. Due to the relatively low building heights, impacts on pedestrian use and
       enjoyment of the site from wind are anticipated to be minimal.

       4.1.2         Shadow

       The Project proposes two buildings over 100 feet tall: Hotel I, at 135 feet in height; and
       Hotel II, at 166 feet in height. For the DEIR, shadow impacts will be studied for the 21st of
       March, June, September, and December.

       4.1.3         Daylight

       In addition to casting shadows, buildings can also, depending on their locations, heights,
       and proximity to other buildings, block views of the sky. The Project is composed of the
       crescent-shaped Hotel I and other structures with carefully-considered massing. The
       arrangement of Project buildings has been designed to preserve access to daylight for public
       open spaces and pedestrian areas. As part of its review under Article 80 of the Boston
       Zoning Code, the Proponent will conduct a daylight analysis using the Boston
       Redevelopment Authority Daylight Analysis (BRADA) model.

       4.1.4         Solar Glare

       Non-reflective glass will be included in the Project design to avoid adverse impacts from
       spot glare. Steps will be taken in final design to mitigate areas where reflected sunlight and
       glare have the potential to impact vehicular traffic, pedestrian, or neighborhood areas.
       Solar glare will be studied by the Proponent as part of its review under Article 80 of the
       Boston Zoning Code.

       4.1.5         Air Quality

       Potential long-term air quality impacts will be limited to emissions from Project-related
       mechanical equipment and pollutant emissions from vehicular traffic generated by the
       proposed site development. Due to the size of the Project and the proposed changes in
       traffic operations, the potential air quality impacts will be modeled for both existing and
       future conditions in the DEIR to demonstrate conformance with the National Ambient Air
       Quality Standards. Both regional and local analysis will be conducted. A microscale (local)
       intersection analysis as required by the BRA will be conducted for all years and conditions
       included in the transportation analysis which includes the year 2020. In addition a
       mesoscale (regional) emissions analysis will be included in accordance with the triggers set
       forth by the MEPA regulations and/or the BRA.

       Implementation of a TDM program will provide mitigation by reducing vehicle trips to the
       site, and TDM details will be evaluated in the DEIR.

       Construction period air quality impacts and mitigation are discussed in Section 4.5.1.

       4.1.6         Floodplain and Wetlands

       4.1.6.1       On-Site Wetland Resource Areas

       On April 24 through 26 and May 3, 2012, wetland and soil scientists from Epsilon
       Associates, Inc. delineated wetlands and other resource areas within an approximately 200-
       acre study area on and immediately adjacent to the Project site. Wetlands and other
       resource areas off-site were also evaluated by wetland scientists from VHB, Inc. for the
       proposed Route 1A flyover, and are discussed in more detail in Section 4.1.6.3. The


3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF        4-2    Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       purpose of the delineation and evaluation efforts was to define the extent of wetlands
       resource areas and associated buffer zones regulated under the Massachusetts Wetlands
       Protection Act (WPA) (MGL Ch. 131 § 40), Sections 401 and 404 of the U.S. Clean Water
       Act (33 U.S.C. 1344), and local wetland ordinances in the cities of Boston and Revere.

       The Suffolk Downs facility is located adjacent to Route 1A in Revere and East Boston,
       Massachusetts. The vast majority of the site, including the buffer zone to delineated
       wetland resource areas, is heavily developed with a thoroughbred race track, ancillary
       facilities and structures, paved parking lots and areas of urban fill. The site is bordered to
       the north by Winthrop Avenue and residential developments, to the east by Washburn
       Avenue, and beyond it the MBTA Blue Line tracks and Bennington Street as well as a mix of
       residential and commercial developments, to the south by Waldemar Avenue and
       residential developments, and to the west by Route 1A, a large fuel storage facility with
       numerous above ground storage tanks, and a retail shopping plaza. On-site wetland
       resource areas and related buffer zones are depicted on Figure 1-4 and are described below.

       100-year Floodplain

       Portions of the Project site are located within the 100-year floodplain as delineated by
       FEMA (see Figure 1-7). The Proponent has conservatively classified the 100-year floodplain
       as BLSF based on two open Orders of Conditions issued by the Boston and Revere
       Conservation Commissions in 2011 (MassDEP File Nos. 006-1276 and 061-0620). The
       Proponent has been made aware that there may be differing interpretations based on
       specific site characteristics and specific storm conditions because, even though no portion
       of the property is subject to tidal action, the site may experience flooding due to one or
       more causes during extreme (e.g., 100-year flood) events and the floodplain may therefore
       be characterized as LSCSF. The Proponent intends to work in consultation with the local
       Conservation Commissions to explore this matter further. Neither BLSF nor LSCSF have a
       100-foot Buffer Zone as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act regulations.

       Riverfront Area

       Sales Creek, which in the Project site is primarily a manmade drainage channel, is depicted
       as a perennial stream on the applicable USGS quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). According
       to 310 CMR 10.58(2)(a)1a, a river or stream shown as perennial on the current USGS
       quadrangle or more recent map provided by MassDEP is perennial. Perennial streams (i.e.,
       rivers) have an associated Riverfront Area that is defined as the area of land between a
       river's mean annual high-water line and a parallel line located 200 feet away, except that
       the parallel line is located 25 feet away in Boston and 25 feet away in densely developed
       areas as designated by the EEA Secretary pursuant to 301 CMR 10.00 (see 310 CMR
       10.58(2)(a)3). On March 12, 1999, the EEA Secretary designated those portions of Sales
       Creek not within the City of Boston and the surrounding environs on the Project site as a




3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF        4-3    Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       densely developed area. Accordingly, the Riverfront Area on the Project site that is
       associated with Sales Creek is 25 feet wide. Similar to BLSF, Riverfront Area does not have
       a 100-foot buffer zone.

       Bordering Vegetated Wetlands

       According to the WPA regulations (310 CMR 10.55), BVWs are freshwater wetlands which
       border on creeks, rivers, streams, ponds and lakes. The types of freshwater wetlands are
       wet meadows, marshes, swamps and bogs. BVWs are areas where the soils are saturated
       and/or inundated such that they support a predominance of wetland indicator plants.

       Epsilon delineated a total of eight (8) separate areas on the Project site that meet the
       regulatory definition of BVW. These areas are shown on Figure 1-4. BVW has a 100-foot
       buffer zone under the WPA regulations. The BVWs delineated by Epsilon border on
       intermittent streams (drainage channels), Sales Creek or are otherwise hydologically
       connected to other BVWs via culverts and pipes. From a functions and values perspective,
       the BVWs on the Project site are generally degraded given their juxtaposition in a heavily
       developed urban environment. The primary function of these BVWs appears to be flood
       control, storm damage prevention and pollution attenuation. The BVWs are comprised
       primarily of invasive herbaceous and woody plant species including but not limited to
       common reed (Phragmites australis), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), buckthorn (Frangula
       alnus), and purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria). Non-invasive species include but are not
       limited to sweetgale (Myrica gale) and various sedges, rushes and grasses.

       Two artificial man-made stormwater detention/retention basins located in the City of Revere
       were not classified as BVW or other jurisdictional wetland resource areas under the WPA
       (310 CMR 10.00) regulations because they do not meet the criteria to be regulated as inland
       wetland resource areas. In addition, the up-gradient intermittent stream that flows into the
       jurisdictional pond located in the racetrack infield in the City of Boston was also not
       classified as a WPA-jurisdictional wetland resource area per the definition of "stream" in
       310 CMR 10.04.

       Inland Bank and Land Under Water Bodies and Waterways

       Inland Bank (310 CMR 10.54) and Land Under Water Bodies and Waterways (LUW) (310
       CMR 10.56) on the Project site are associated with intermittent streams/drainage ditches,
       Sales Creek and the pond located in the center of the racetrack infield.

       Area of Critical Environmental Concern

       An ACEC is an area designated by the EEA Secretary in accordance with 301 CMR 12.00 of
       the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) regulations. Sales Creek is associated with the Belle
       Isle Inlet that is within the Rumney Marshes ACEC. The ACEC extends through the Project

Development Review Components                                                 Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       site from approximately the northwest corner, passing between the proposed construction
       and the existing horse barns, through the northern portion of the racing track infield, and
       continuing east of the Project site (see Figure 1-6).

       4.1.6.2       Potential On-Site Wetlands Impacts

       Project activities are proposed within BLSF (see Section 4.1.6.1), the 100-foot Buffer Zone
       to BVW and potentially 25-foot Riverfront Area associated with Sales Creek. No on-site
       activities are proposed in BVW, Inland Bank and/or LUW.

       Activities proposed in floodplain will occur primarily in two locations: (1) in the vicinity of
       the proposed entrance drive and rotary area at the west end of the site, and (2) in the
       parking lot located at the north end of the Project site. These activities will involve altering
       the parking lot elevations as well as raising the grade in the vicinity of the proposed traffic
       circle. There will also be some grading involving the placement of fill in grassed areas
       around the traffic circle and the construction of stormwater Best Management Practices.
       The work will occur in previously developed areas comprised of pavement or urban fill.
       Pursuant to the WPA regulations (310 CMR 10.57), the filling of BLSF requires
       compensatory flood storage to prevent an increase in potential flood hazard during peak
       flows. Although the Project may fill some areas of BLSF, compensatory flood storage areas
       will be provided on the Project site to mitigate these impacts and result in floodplain
       storage capacity equivalent to or exceeding the existing floodplain storage capacity on the
       property. The compensatory flood storage areas will be designed to comply with the WPA
       performance standards for BLSF. The location of the potential storage areas along with the
       estimated volume will be further detailed in the DEIR.

       With regard to the Sales Creek Riverfront Area, activities in this location are limited to
       proposed stormwater management system improvements and upgrades. The proposed
       upgrades to the stormwater management system, including any new or modified discharges,
       will be set back from the receiving water and will comply with MassDEP stormwater
       standards. The proposed upgrades to the stormwater management system should
       substantially improve the quality of discharged water relative to existing conditions. In
       addition, the proposed development will decrease impervious area on the site by
       approximately nine acres, thereby reducing the rate and volume of stormwater leaving the
       site. Refer to Section 4.4.4.2 for additional information on stormwater management. No
       work is anticipated to occur on or below the Inland Bank of Sales Creek or its adjoining
       BVW.

       Activities in the 100 foot buffer zone to BVW and Inland Bank include construction of the
       proposed entrance drive and parking areas, utility connections and upgrades to the
       stormwater management system. These activities will occur in previously developed areas
       of the buffer zone comprised of impervious surfaces or urban fill. No work is proposed in
       BVW or Inland Bank. Erosion controls will be installed along the limit of work line in these
       locations to protect the resource areas.

                                                           management system improvements. The work
                                                           will occur in already developed areas comprised
                                                           of pavement or urban fill.           Work will be

                                                           compensation. Approximately 140,000 net cubic
                                                           feet of compensatory flood storage areas will be
                                                           required on the Project site to mitigate potential
                                                           impacts from filling BLSF. The compensatory
                                                           flood storage areas will be designed to comply
                                                           with the WPA performance standards for BLSF
                                                           (310 CMR 10.57). These areas will likely be
                                                           along the Project entrance from Route 1A as well
                                                           as in other areas, as necessary.

        4.1.6.3         Existing Off-Site Jurisdictional Wetland Resource Areas

        Wetland resource areas are present in and near the off-site improvements planned along the
        Route 1A corridor, but the only existing wetland resource area located where work is
        proposed is floodplain (see Figure 4-1).

        4.1.6.4         Potential Off-Site Wetlands Impacts

        The off-site improvements may potentially include approximately 40,000 square feet of
        work in areas subject to flooding (LSCSF) and approximately 20,000 square feet of work
        within the 100-foot Buffer Zone to Coastal Bank and Salt Marsh (see Figure 4-1). All work
        proposed in these areas will occur in or immediately adjacent to areas that are presently
        developed (i.e., covered by paved surfaces). Measures to prevent adverse impacts will
        include installing erosion and sedimentation controls and installing structural measures to
        treat roadway drainage.

        4.1.7           Groundwater

        Historical measurements of observation wells have indicated groundwater levels at the
        Project site are 0.5 to 16 feet below site grades, and are generally on the order of two to six
        feet below grade.1 In recent test pit explorations completed for this Project, groundwater
        was observed typically at depths of 2.5 to 7 feet below site grades. Seasonal fluctuations in
        groundwater levels can also be expected.

        Dewatering is discussed in Section 4.5.3.3.

        4.1.8           Geotechnical

        Based on the results of recent test boring programs completed at the Project site and borings
        previously completed by others, subsurface soil conditions underlying the Project site are
        expected to be characterized by the general soil profile described in Table 4-3.

Development Review Components                                                              Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Foundation support requirements for the proposed new structures have not yet been
       determined. However, based on available information, the currently planned development,
       and the height of the proposed structures, Project engineers anticipate the following:

            For new buildings, including casino facilities, two hotels, and a parking structure,
            deep foundation support will likely be required due to column spacing and
            structural loads, depth to suitable bearing materials, efforts to lower the potential for
            settlement, and depth to groundwater.

            Driven piles will be selected to support the new structures, and depending on the
            design loads, the foundation elements will be installed through overburden soils
            and driven to end bearing conditions in either glacial till or bedrock. Pile types that
            are under consideration include precast pre-stressed concrete piles and steel H-
            Piles. Means and methods for installation of the deep foundation system will
            consider potential impacts to abutting facilities to remain within the property limits
            (e.g., the grandstand). Vibration monitoring will be conducted during pile-driving
            activities. It is not anticipated that vibrations will approach thresholds that could
            potentially impact existing facilities.

            For the existing grandstand building that is proposed for renovation into a new
            casino facility, Project engineers anticipate supporting the structure on its existing
            pile foundation. Test pit operations were completed within the building to obtain
            information related to the existing pile foundation system to evaluate whether
            supplementary foundations may be required at column locations. The main
            purpose of these test pits is to determine the top of the existing pile caps. The
            existing floor will need to be lowered to achieve a higher floor-to-ceiling height for
            the Project. It is anticipated that the lowest level slab for this building will be a
            reinforced structural slab bearing within a few feet of existing grades.
            Supplementary foundation support required for the lowest level slab and columns is
            anticipated to include a foundation system associated with low vibrations and low
            headroom requirements for installation, such as micropiles.

                In an effort to lower the carbon footprint associated with the development, the
               Proponent intends to keep soils on-site to the extent possible, thus lowering the
               potential for off-site disposal or transport of soil. Currently the Project proposes just
               one-level of below-grade parking. Project engineers anticipate that small excavation
               support systems may be required locally for below-grade parking and elevator pit or
               similar excavations and, given the relatively shallow depth to groundwater in some
               areas, temporary construction dewatering efforts will be required to allow for
               construction in-the-dry.

            Project engineers anticipate that the lowest level floor slabs for the new buildings
            may have underslab drainage systems and likely will need to be waterproofed.

       4.1.9         Operational Solid and Hazardous Wastes

       Following construction, solid waste generated by the proposed development will be
       collected and disposed of off-site by a licensed contractor. The Proponent will implement a
       recycling program throughout the Project, with recycled materials expected to include
       newspaper, cardboard, cans, and bottles.

       A Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessment was conducted in 2007 which found
       asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint within the administration building and
       grandstand areas. These materials will be abated in accordance with all appropriate rules
       and regulations.

       In December 2012, MassDEP released a Revised Solid Waste Master Plan with the
       overarching goals largely focused on increasing recycling, advancing greater diversion of
       solid waste, and assisting municipalities in achieving these goals for municipal solid waste.
       Two major initiatives in the revised plan include a focused effort to achieve zero waste in
       the near future and a clear recognition that solid waste management activities play a
       significant role in GHG emissions. Pertinent regulatory changes have grown out of these
       initiatives:

             Implementing integrated organics and construction and demolition diversion
             strategies that include a combination of initiatives to both increase diversion and
             build new markets;

             Promoting a limited new degree of gasification or pyrolysis of municipal solid
             waste capabilities in the state by adjusting the state's moratorium on incineration;
             and

             Eliminating barriers to siting of anaerobic digestion recycling and composting
             facilities with a particular focus on organic food waste.

        Although it is too early to identify exactly which solid waste management strategies will be
        employed at the proposed resort casino, the Proponent is committed to the following:

             As a racetrack and major entertainment venue, the Project provides a unique
             opportunity to study innovative technologies such as anaerobic digestion as both a
             waste diversion and green energy model. The Proponent is studying the possibility
             of using this technology on site and has been corresponding with proponents of
             this green technology in the state. A more thorough analysis of the feasibility of
             employing anaerobic digestion for the Project will be included in the DEIR.

             Caesars is committed both locally and nationally to achieving a degree of
             environmental sustainability unparalleled in the industry. In 2011, Caesars was the
             first member of the national gaming industry to receive U.S. EPA approval for its
             GHG reduction plan. In 2010, Caesars won the WasteWise New Partners Gold
             Achievement Award from U.S. EPA, and in 2008 it was the first in the industry to
             join the EPA's Climate Leaders Program.

        Caesars' CodeGreen Initiative focuses across the board on the company, its employees,
        guests, and suppliers to ensure it remains at the pinnacle of corporate sustainability
        leadership. The Proponent will fully comply with the goals of the state's new Solid Waste
        Master Plan and hopes to push the state's goals to new levels of achievement by investing
        in technology such as, possibly, anaerobic digestion for both food waste and racetrack
        wastes.

       4.1.10        Noise

       Stationary project-related operational noise sources are expected to consist of the following:
       ventilating fans for the parking garage; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
       equipment for the casinos, hotels, and restaurants; emergency generators at the CUP; and
       vehicular traffic generated by the proposed site development. The Cadna/A software
       program will be used to predict future exterior sound levels from the Project at the nearest
       on-site and off-site sensitive receptors. Cadna/A uses the ISO 9613-2 standard for sound
       level propagation. As part of the Article 80 review process, future sound levels will be
       compared to the City of Boston noise regulations. In addition, a baseline sound level
       measurement program will be conducted in and around the residential neighborhoods
       north, east, and south of the Project site to determine existing daytime and nighttime sound
       levels. The existing racetrack will be included as part of the existing condition
       measurements.

       An analysis of noise generated by the traffic using the facility is only required for highway
       projects receiving Federal aid. The roadway improvements for this Project will be funded
       privately; therefore, a traffic noise analysis is not required. However, the applicant will
       conduct an analysis of traffic-generated noise using the Federal Highway Administration
       (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model (TNM) for informational purposes. The analysis will examine
       both on-site and off-site traffic within the study area to understand what, if any, impact the
       additional Project-generated traffic has on community sound levels. Based on a review of
       hourly traffic data over the course of a typical 24-hour day, two scenarios will be analyzed:
       a daytime off-peak hour and a nighttime hour. Modeled sound levels will be compared to
       both existing condition measurements and the FHWA Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC).

       Construction-period noise impacts and mitigation are discussed in Section 4.5.2.

       4.1.11        Greenhouse Gas Emissions

       A GHG analysis will be conducted in accordance with the MEPA GHG Emissions Policy
       and Protocol (GHG Policy).

       Project GHG emissions come from three sources:

                    on-site fuel combustion in the CUP;

                    off-site emissions related to electricity provided by utilities and used on-site and
                    energy used off-site for water supply and wastewater treatment; and

                    transportation-related emissions.

       All of these will be described and quantified, and mitigation measures will be documented,
       in a GHG Analysis within the DEIR in accordance with the MEPA GHG Emissions Policy
       and Protocol. The analysis will clearly demonstrate consistency with the objectives of
       MEPA review by documenting the means by which the Proponent plans to avoid,
       minimize, or mitigate Damage to the Environment to the maximum extent feasible.

       The GHG Policy requires proponents to use energy modeling software to quantify projected
       energy usage from stationary sources and mobile source modeling software to predict
       transportation-related emissions. The DEIR will clearly state the types of modeling software
       used, the Building Code used for baseline case, and emissions factors applied to GHG
       calculations. Modeling assumptions will be clearly described, and the analysis will explain
       which GHG reduction measures have been modeled and which cannot be modeled due to
       constraints of the modeling software.

       The GHG Analysis in the DEIR will include building energy modeling for two cases, the
       baseline case and preferred case. Boston and Revere are both Stretch Code communities,
       which means they require very high standards for efficient use of energy in buildings; this
       will be reflected in the preferred case. The Proponent will compute the Energy Use Index
       (EUI) for baseline and proposed buildings, using the differential percentage to confirm that
       the Boston/Revere Stretch Code will be complied with.

       The DEIR will include energy use and emissions tables that compare base case with the
       preferred design, showing the anticipated reductions in emissions by emissions source (i.e.,
       direct, indirect, and transportation). A technical appendix will be provided containing a
       clear and complete listing of modeling inputs (e.g., R-values, U-values, efficiencies, lighting
       power density) for items such as equipment, walls, roofs, windows, lighting, and HVAC
       units for both the base case and preferred design. The appendix will also contain the
       modeling results printout for each building in both Base and Preferred cases.

       The GHG emissions analysis in the DEIR will address the feasibility of mitigation measures
       suggested in the Policy appendix and, if deemed feasible, will include them in the
       modeling inputs. The rationale for not including any of the suggested mitigation measures
       that might result in a significant reduction of GHG emissions will be provided.

       The potential for alternative and renewable energy sources to be incorporated into the
       Project will be examined. Potential use of PV electricity generationwill be examined, as
       well as a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system and the potential for anaerobic digestion
       of organic wastes to derive fuel gas.

       The management of manure will also be considered as part of the GHG analysis in the
       DEIR. The Proponent will also address the Boston Climate Action Executive Order as part
       of the Article 80 review process for the Project.

       Commitments to Project-related programs that have indirect GHG reduction elements, such
       as reducing water use and maximizing recycling, will also be addressed. Transportation-
       related GHG emissions reductions from roadway and signalization changes and TDM
       programs will be calculated and reported.

       The Proponent will arrange a meeting with the MEPA Office, the Massachusetts Department
       of Energy Resources (DOER), and MassDEP to discuss the approach to the GHG Analysis
       during preparation of the DEIR. Furthermore, the Proponent will consult with State
       environmental and energy programs, including the Clean Energy Center, to identify possible
       energy-efficiency or environmental technology programs that may be feasible for inclusion
       in the Project.

       4.1.12        Sea Level Rise

       The Proponent has assessed potential impacts to the Project as a result of projected sea-level
       rise. The Project is designed to comply with building codes and FEMA requirements, which
       account for flood risks in the context of proposed uses. In addition to meeting the FEMA
       requirements, a responsible development in a coastal area must acknowledge the potential
       for sea-level rise to adversely affect activities in the future.

       The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI), created by the USGS, is intended to provide a
       preliminary overview of the relative susceptibility along the U.S. coastline to impacts
       associated with sea-level rise. As a tool to assess relative risks, the CVI is based on
       geomorphology, regional coastal slope, tidal range, wave height, shoreline erosion and
       accretion rates, and projected rates of future sea-level rise. Although the CVI delineates
       broad regions with different relative magnitudes of likely physical changes, it is a useful tool
       for completing a baseline evaluation of the issue; to facilitate such an evaluation, CVI data
       are available in a GIS data-layer.




3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF        4-12    Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                    Epsilon Associates, Inc.
        The CVI assigns a "low" risk ranking to the Project location; this low vulnerability to future
        sea-level rise is also delineated for the majority of northern New England's coastline.2
        Based on this information, the level of risk at the Project site from damage due to sea-level
        rise is low. However, this does not mean the area is immune to sea-level rise. The
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that sea-level rise in
        the Boston area will occur at a rate of 2.65 mm/year (0.104 inches/year), translating to 0.87
        feet (10.44 inches) over the next century (NOAA, 2007) according to the "South Shore
        Coastal Hazards Characterization Atlas", published by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal
        Zone Management in 2005, sea level rise in the general vicinity of the Project site is
        estimated as 2.45 mm/year (0.096 inches/year). Over the Project's assumed 100-year
        lifespan, this Atlas estimate suggests a 0.80 feet (9.6-inch) rise in sea level. It is relevant to
        note, however, that this rise in sea level may not directly correlate with a rise in flood
        elevation.

        As shown on Figure 1-4, the BFE at the Project site is 15.46 feet (Boston City Base). The
        Proponent has conservatively classified the 100-year floodplain as BLSF based on two open
        Orders of Conditions issued by the Boston and Revere Conservation Commissions in 2011
        (MassDEP File Nos. 006-1276 and 061-0620). The Proponent has been made aware that
        there may be differing interpretations based on specific site characteristics and specific
        storm conditions because, even though no portion of the property is subject to tidal action,
        the site may experience flooding due to one or more causes during extreme (e.g., 100-year
        flood) events and the floodplain may therefore be characterized as LSCSF. The Proponent
        intends to work in consultation with the local Conservation Commissions to explore this
        matter further. Neither BLSF nor LSCSF have a 100-foot Buffer Zone as defined by the
        Wetlands Protection Act regulations.

        Although the floodplain does cover portions of the Project site, the proposed building
        footprints for the Resort, including the casino, hotel, and parking garage will not be within
        the currently-designated floodplain. The proposed Casino and hotel first floor elevation will
        be at approximately elevation 28, which is approximately 12 feet higher than current
        floodplain and future estimated floodplain elevations accounting for sea level rise. Every
        effort will be made to locate the maintenance building at an elevation that is above current
        floodplain elevation or future floodplain elevation to the maximum extent practicable.

        As the design of the Project advances, the Proponent will also evaluate the site design for
        consistency with the USACE guidance document guidance for sea level rise as well as the
        EEA Climate Change Adaptation Report. Finally, in the DEIR the Proponent will also
        evaluate the first floor elevation in relation to flood elevation.

Development Review Components                                                               Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       4.1.12.1      Compliance with Federal Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management

       Executive Order 11988 was signed in 1977 with the intent "to avoid to the extent possible
       the long and short term adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of
       floodplains and to avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development wherever
       there is a practicable alternative..." As such, the Order directs all federal agencies to
       evaluate how agency actions may affect floodplain use, management, and/or exposure to
       flood hazards. In the case of an action located within a floodplain, an alternatives analysis
       must demonstrate efforts to avoid and minimize adverse effects.

       Section 4.1.6 describes in detail the location of the Project within the floodplain, and
       demonstrates how the Project design exceeds minimum floodplain construction
       requirements. Furthermore, the ENF Form contains an alternatives analysis which
       demonstrates the efficacy of redeveloping this particular area of previously-disturbed land in
       the Cities of Boston and Revere.

       Recognizing the Project's location within the floodplain and associated exposure to flood
       hazards, careful engineering and design considerations have targeted risk reduction
       strategies and measures to improve existing conditions. As described in Section 4.1.6.2, the
       provision of compensatory storage in a volume equaling or exceeding the volume of
       potential floodwater displacement by the redevelopment will ensure that the Project
       expands, rather than reduces, the floodwater storage capacity of the area. The DEIR will
       include additional detail on both the locations of compensatory storage as well as
       anticipated volumes required. Proposed stormwater management controls will substantially
       improve the quality of discharged water relative to existing conditions, and coupled with
       the design of site development will reduce the rate and volume of stormwater leaving the
       site (see Section 4.1.6.2).

       While these measures will attenuate, or at a minimum will not accentuate, flood hazard risk
       on the Project site, flooding will nonetheless occur under storm conditions above a certain
       magnitude. Therefore, all building foundations designed for the Project will be constructed
       to withstand flood conditions and the on-grade parking design for will allow gravity-
       controlled stormwater flows to exit the Project site, and all occupiable spaces for the Project
       will be located at or above the BFE of 15.46 feet (Boston City Base).

       Although the Project site is partially located within a floodplain (see Figure 1-4), there is no
       practicable alternative that would allow redevelopment of this area while avoiding flooding
       hazards entirely. Nonetheless, the Proponent has designed the Project to responsibly
       minimize the risk of flood-related damage and to improve existing conditions.

       4.1.12.2      Climate Change Preparedness

       In addition to those items included above, the Proponent will also consider in the DEIR
       potential impacts or changes resulting from a storm surge, increased frequency of storms,
       rising temperatures, increased frequency of extreme hot days, precipitation changes, as
       appropriate.

       4.1.13        Rodent Control

       A rodent extermination certificate will be filed with the building permit application to the
       City of Boston. In compliance with City requirements, rodent inspection monitoring and
       treatment will be carried out before, during, and at the completion of construction. Rodent
       extermination prior to work start-up will consist of treatment throughout the Project area,
       including building interiors. During construction, regular service visits will be made to
       maintain effective rodent control levels.

       Operation of the proposed development will focus on a high quality of maintenance.
       Although the details have not yet been finalized, the Proponent will develop a safe, cost-
       effective, and ecologically sound pest management program.

4.2    Urban Design

       The Project's main objectives are to create a resort destination embedded within beautifully-
       landscaped, lush surroundings and to establish a vibrant, accessible urban environment
       offering visitors a respite from their busy lives. Massing of the proposed new buildings will
       offer both a sense of monumentality and a carefully-scaled composition of new and restored
       buildings, streets, and open spaces that will tie back into the surrounding urban landscape.

       Upon entering the resort from Route 1A, visitors will be welcomed by a stately, tree-lined
       entrance drive reminiscent of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston. A circular driveway will
       lead to the main entrance of Casino Area II and the crescent-shaped seven-story, 300-room
       luxury Hotel I. Turning north at the end of the entrance drive, along Tomasello Drive, will
       allow visitors to bypass the main entrance of Casino Area II and proceed toward the main
       entrance drive of Casino Area I, located along the northern edge of the detached seven-
       story, 2,600-car-capacity parking garage. The parking garage will define the western edge
       of the inner courtyard, a 170-foot by 540-foot urban square that will articulate the main
       entrance to Casino Area I and the north entrance to Casino Area II. Hotel II will mark the
       northern end of the long axis of the new urban space.

       4.2.1         Sustainable Design and LEED

       Beyond striving for LEED Gold, the Proponent will set a new standard of excellence in
       sustainable design for gaming development projects.

       At all of its casino resorts, Caesars Entertainment implements an Environmental-Social-
       Governance sustainability strategy. This strategy, CodeGreen, is committed to addressing
       critical issues of energy, waste, water, and carbon emissions and seeks to engage Caesars
       employees in efforts to reduce natural resource use, conserve energy, and promote reuse
       and recycling. In the past nine years, Caesars has invested nearly $70 million on energy
       conservation projects alone and has invested in more than 162 retrofits involving, among
       others items, energy-efficient lighting, improved air-handling systems, upgraded
       thermostats, advanced energy-saving sensors, and low-flow water controls and fixtures.
       Annual savings from these retrofits include in excess of 208 million kilowatt-hours in
       energy, over 3.3 million therms in natural gas, more than $24 million in annual resources,
       and 298 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. A CodeGreen Fact Sheet from
       Caesars is provided as Attachment I.

       Building on the CodeGreen program, the Project will be sustainably designed, energy
       efficient, environmentally conscious, and healthy for its employees and visitors. Innovative
       technologies are currently being explored to determine what works best with the Project as
       well as what might set a visible example for those visiting the site.

       As required under Article 37 of the Boston Zoning Code, projects that are subject to Article
       80B, Large Project Review, shall be LEED certifiable. There are seven categories in the
       LEED certification guidelines: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere,
       Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Innovation in Design Process and
       the additional Regional Priority Credits. For this Project, the Proponent is striving to
       achieve LEED Gold, and sustainable measures included in the design include, but are not
       limited to, those addressed below.

       4.2.1.1       Sustainable Sites

       The Project site is in a dense urban neighborhood close to the MBTA Blue Line and other
       public transportation options. The proposed Project design includes maintaining the
       existing racetrack, renovating the existing grandstand building, and constructing a new
       casino resort that will include gaming areas, hotels, restaurants, a spa, and all necessary
       administrative and support spaces. Parking will be accommodated in a seven-story parking
       structure, limited underground parking as well as surface parking.

       Sustainable stormwater designs will be incorporated into the Project to the maximum extent
       practicable. The Proponent will make every effort to design the Project consistent with
       LEED Credits 6.1 (Stormwater Design Quantity Control) and 6.2 (Stormwater Design
       Quality Control). The ability to obtain these points will be determined as the Project's
       drainage design advances. Since the Project will reduce impervious surface on the site by
       approximately nine acres, there will be a reduction in the rate and volume of stormwater
       leaving the site. Stormwater runoff from the 90% annual rainfall will be captured and




3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF       4-16   Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                 Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       treated, which will remove 80% of total suspended solids. LID drainage BMPs, including
       water quality swales, bioretention basins, and constructed wetlands, are being considered
       where appropriate to promote infiltration and provide water quality treatment.

       4.2.1.2       Water Efficiency

       The State Building Code requires the use of water-conserving fixtures. Water conservation
       measures such as low-flow toilets and restricted flow faucets will reduce the domestic water
       demand on the existing distribution system. Sensor-operated sinks with water-conserving
       aerators and sensor-operated toilets will be installed in all restrooms.

       4.2.1.3       Energy and Atmosphere

       In addition to compliance with stringent standards for energy use in the Stretch Code, the
       Proponent is evaluating the feasibility of installing PV arrays on several rooftops, including
       the parking structure, where they could also function as sunshades for parked vehicles.
       High-efficiency mechanical equipment, such as boilers and chillers, and high performance
       building shells, will substantially reduce energy use.

       Building systems will not use refrigerants that are harmful to the environment. The
       Proponent will engage a Commissioning Agent to confirm the building systems are installed
       and operated as intended and designed.

       4.2.1.4       Materials and Resources

       Throughout construction, the Construction Management team shall endeavor to divert
       Construction and Demolition waste from area landfills and procure materials that have
       recycled content and/or are extracted and manufactured within 500 miles of the Project
       site.

       4.2.1.5       Indoor Environmental Quality

       Air quality will be monitored during Project construction and likely prior to occupancy.
       Low-emitting materials will be used throughout construction to maintain and improve air
       quality. Building occupants will be able to maintain a comfortable environment through
       access to thermal and lighting controls.

4.3    Historic and Archaeological Resources

       This section identifies historic resources within and in the vicinity of the Project. A review
       of the State and National Registers of Historic Places and the survey files of the MHC and
       Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC), as well as a field review of the areas in the vicinity of
       the Project, were undertaken to identify historic resources.

       4.3.1          Historic Resources within the Project Site

       The Project site encompasses the Suffolk Downs Racetrack, Grandstand, and Clubhouse,
       which are included in the Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the
       Commonwealth (Inventory) (MHC No. 209). Constructed in 1935, the facility was the first
       major racetrack in New England. Originally designed in the International Style, the
       property has undergone substantial renovations through the years, including enclosure of
       the grandstand in 1945, major renovations and modifications in 1962 with a new grand
       entrance and the joining and complete enclosure of the grandstand and clubhouse, a major
       renovation in 1992, and a series of updates and improvements over the past five years.

       4.3.2          Historic Resources in the Vicinity of the Project Site

       The Project site is located in the towns of Revere to the north and East Boston's Orient
       Heights neighborhood to the south. A review of the State and National Registers, Inventory,
       and MHC databases revealed there are limited previously identified historic resources in the
       vicinity of the Project area. Directly north of the Project site is the Revere Beach Parkway,
       which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. To the east of the site in Revere's
       Beachmont neighborhood is the Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church Complex.
       To the south of the Project site is the Madonna Queen Shrine and Don Orione Rest Home
       complex on Orient Avenue. In addition, there are two residences on Orient Avenue
       included in the Inventory. These historic resources are described below.

       Table 4-4 lists State and National Register-listed and inventoried properties located within a
       quarter mile radius of the Project site. The resources are keyed to Figure 4-2.

       Revere Beach Parkway is a curvilinear, 5.3-mile, heavily traveled boulevard that runs
       between Wellington Circle in Medford and Eliot Circle in Revere. Designed by Olmsted,
       Olmsted and Eliot, and its successor firm, Olmsted Brothers for the Metropolitan Park
       Commission, Revere Beach Parkway was originally built in 1896-1905. Throughout its
       history, the parkway has undergone changes, including having been widened to
       accommodate increased traffic and to improve crossings and intersections. The parkway
       was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

       The Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church Complex is comprised of the Church,
       Rectory, Garden with Shrine, and Garage (MHC Nos. REV.G, REV.7, REV.83, REV.84,
       Rev.958). The complex was designed by Maginnis, Walsh and Sullivan in the Neoclassical
       style in 1907. It is associated with the development of the Beachmont section of Revere in
       the early twentieth century. The complex was surveyed in 2005 and recommended eligible
       for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.

       The Don Orione Complex at the top of Orient Heights in East Boston is the national
       headquarters for the Don Orione religious order. The Madonna Queen National Shrine
       (MHC No. BOS.902), constructed in 1954, features a full-size replica of the statue at the
       Don Orione Center in Rome, Italy. It was constructed in 1954 by Jewish-Italian sculptor
       Arrigo Minerbi to show his gratitude to the Catholic Church for having protected him and
       his family during World War II. Across the street from the Shrine is the Don Orione
       Nursing Home (MHC No. BOS.113), a nursing home which was also founded by the Don
       Orione order. The complex includes the Mother Queen Shrine Chapel (BOS.114), Don
       Orione Rest Home (BOS.110) and the Franciscan Sisters of Mary Convent (BOS 111).

       In addition to the Don Orione complex, two nearby properties at 54-56 and 75-79 Orient
       Avenue (MHC Nos. BOS.109 and 112) are included in the Inventory. Both are Colonial
       Revival residences constructed ca. 1915.

       4.3.3         Archaeological Resources on the Project Site

       There are no known archaeological resources listed in the State and National Registers of
       Historic Places or included in the Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the
       Commonwealth within the Project site. New construction associated with the proposed
       Project is sited on a previously developed parcel consisting of filled land. It is not
       anticipated that the Project site will impact archaeological resources.

4.4    Infrastructure Systems

       This section discusses energy, wastewater, water, and stormwater.             Transportation
       infrastructure is discussed in Section 3.0.




3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF       4-19   Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                 Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       4.4.1         Energy and Site Utilities

       New power service will be brought to the site to supply the Project's electrical needs. The
       incoming power feed from the electric utility will terminate in one or two customer stations
       located on the site. Power will be routed underground from the stations to main electrical
       service in the CUP. Natural gas will be provided via a new or existing service, as will water
       supply and wastewater disposal.

       4.4.1.1       Mechanical Systems

       Cooling for the Project will be provided from the CUP, with high-efficiency centrifugal
       chillers producing chilled water to serve as the cooling medium. The chilled water will be
       pumped throughout the casino areas and two hotels. A variable flow pumping system will
       be used to reduce energy consumption. It is anticipated that a waterside economizer will
       be provided to provide free wintertime cooling. Cooling towers will be located outside the
       CUP.

       Heating for the facility will be provided from the CUP, with high-efficiency, natural gas-
       fired condensing boilers producing hot water as the heating medium. A variable flow
       pumping system will be used to reduce energy consumption. The hot water will be
       pumped throughout the casino areas and two hotels.

       Domestic hot water will be produced via natural gas-fired condensing hot water heaters that
       will be located near areas with high domestic hot water demands (e.g., restaurants, hotel,
       etc.).

       Space heating and cooling for the restaurants, gaming, and back-of-house areas will be
       accomplished primarily via air handling units. The air handling units will use chilled water
       and hot water as the cooling and heating sources. Economizer sections will be
       incorporated. Energy recovery devices (e.g., enthalpy wheels and/or run-around heat
       exchanger loops) will be used to reduce energy consumption for areas with high outside air
       requirements. Fan coils will be used for supplemental cooling where needed, or where
       building geometry dictates; the fan coil units will be "four-pipe" units.

       Space ventilation will be designed in accordance with the Massachusetts Building Code and
       ASHRAE-62 guidelines.

       The parking garage will be unheated. It will be partially naturally ventilated, and partially
       mechanically ventilated.

       4.4.1.2       Electrical Systems

       The electrical distribution will be based on the programmatic and mechanical system needs
       of each portion of the Project (i.e., Casino Area I, Casino Area II, two hotels, and garage).
       The main electrical service will enter the CUP from which it will be transformed and

3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF         4-20   Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                   Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       distributed throughout the Project. Code-required emergency power and optional standby
       power will be provided for each portion of the Project. Emergency and standby power will
       be obtained from on-site generators burning ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel.

       Power will be brought to the Project from an existing utility substation with spare capacity
       via new buried electrical conductors; thus, the existing electrical grid serving adjacent
       neighborhoods should not be affected.

       Lighting systems will be designed to meet requirements of the Massachusetts State Energy
       Code and ASHRAE 90.1, where applicable. Lighting control schemes including daylight-
       responsive control will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis for implementation.

       4.4.1.3       Energy Management System

       The facility will be equipped with a direct digital control (DDC) energy management system
       that will allow operators to monitor and adjust system and energy performance of the
       mechanical systems.

       4.4.1.4       Energy Efficiency

       Mechanical and electrical systems will be designed to meet requirements of the
       Massachusetts Stretch Energy Code and to achieve the energy use requirements of the
       Stretch Code and the LEED standard. The Proponent anticipates that the Project will
       include at least the following energy efficiency measures: high-efficiency chillers,
       condensing boilers, water- and air-side economizers, heat recovery, high-efficiency lighting
       with energy-saving lighting controls, and water-conserving plumbing fixtures. Section 4.2.1
       contains additional details regarding sustainable design and LEED.

       4.4.2         Wastewater

       4.4.2.1       Existing Sewer Infrastructure

       Currently, sanitary sewage generated by the existing grandstand and other utility buildings
       on site are collected by a gravity sewer line that runs north-south and connects to a private
       sewer pump station located on the southerly side of the property. This pump station pumps
       sanitary sewer via force main to an existing BWSC 12-inch sanitary gravity sewer in
       Waldemar Avenue. This gravity sewer runs easterly in Waldemar Avenue until it ultimately
       discharges into a 24-inch sanitary sewer main at the end of Waldemar Avenue. Additional
       wastewater from the existing CAFO, or horse stable, is pumped from a settling pond at the
       northeastern corner of the racetrack to an existing sewer manhole located in the bus drop-
       off near the Suffolk Downs MBTA station on the Suffolk Downs property. Wastewater from
       this manhole discharges to the same existing BWSC sanitary sewer manhole located in
       Walley Avenue between the Suffolk Downs MBTA station and the southeast corner of the
       Project site. From there, wastewater flows easterly via a BWSC 24-inch sanitary main in



3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF        4-21   Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Leverett Avenue. Flow is eventually transported by the BWSC sewer system to the ultimate
       discharge point at the MWRA Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant for treatment and
       disposal. The existing sewer system is illustrated in Figure 4-3.

       The Project will replace the existing pump station located on the property, and the existing
       force main connecting to the gravity sewer line in Waldemar Avenue will be discontinued.
       Instead, wastewater from the new pump station will be pumped to the existing sewer
       manhole located near the bus drop-off near the Suffolk Downs MBTA station; this is the
       same manhole that accepts wastewater from the CAFO. Due to the configuration of the
       proposed development program, a second pump station is expected to be required. The
       second pump station will collect sanitary sewage via a gravity collection system from the
       portion of the development located in the existing grandstand area as well as portions of
       Casino Area II. This pump station will convey sewage via force main to a new pump station
       proposed in the vicinity of the existing pump station. It will also collect and convey sewage
       form the other portions of the Project as well as from the existing grandstand area and
       discharge via force main to the gravity sewer manhole located on the Project site in the bus
       drop-off area near the Suffolk Downs MBTA station. This new configuration will divert
       wastewater flows that are currently discharged to the 12-inch gravity sewer located in
       Waldemar Avenue and will relocate the discharge point from the Project site downstream
       of the residential neighborhood along Waldemar Avenue. Therefore, any sanitary sewage
       generated by the Project will not impact the existing 12-inch gravity sewer line in
       Waldemar Avenue.

       No changes are proposed to the existing discharge from the stable area to the BWSC
       sanitary sewer at the east end of Waldemar Avenue.

       4.4.2.2       Estimated Wastewater Generation

       Sewage generation rates for the proposed Project were estimated using the MassDEP
       regulations at 310 CMR 15.00. The State Environmental Code, Title 5: Standard
       Requirements for The Siting, Construction, Inspection, Upgrade and Expansion of On-Site
       Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems (310 CMR 15.00) lists typical generation values for
       the sources listed in Table 4-5 for the proposed Project. Typical generation values are
       generally conservative for estimating sewage flows from new construction. Sewage flow
       design criteria values at 310 CMR 15.00 are used to evaluate new sewage flows or the
       increase in flows to existing connections. Table 4-5 describes the increased sewage
       generation in gallons per day (gpd) for the proposed Project.

       In 310 CMR 15.00 under the Establishment column, there are no provisions for Casino
       uses. Therefore, wastewater estimates were developed based on the various uses proposed
       within the new development to best describe the sewage generation in a manner that
       coincides with 310 CMR 15.00, as shown in Table 4-5.

        Wastewater generation factors from Title V were applied to different uses within the
        proposed casino. Since some Title V factors were not directly applicable to the casino uses,
        care was taken to apply those factors from Title V to corresponding uses as appropriate. For
        example, a flow factor of 20 gallons per day was used for all seats at gaming tables, office
        building factors (75 gpd/1000 sf) were used for the office uses within the casino, restaurant
        factors (35 gpd/seat) were used for restaurant uses, and theatre seating flow factors (3
        gpd/seat) were used for the grandstand areas. Estimates of the numbers of seats in each
        gaming and restaurant area were determined by the Project's program. These flows were
        verified against flow factors used in other states for casino uses.

        Estimates provided for racing also include flows for a lounge area and a restaurant. Flow
        estimates were performed assuming full capacities, and therefore may be conservative when
        compared to actual flow values since the facilities will not always operate at full capacity.
        Estimates provided below for the racing component of the proposed Project are based on
        Title V flow factors. Although they indicate a higher flow than is currently experienced by
        the racing facility, this should not be interpreted as an increase in size of the racing program
        or imply any increases in size to the stable area. The stable area may decrease in size,
        resulting in a reduction in flows generated by the CAFO operation.

        Peak flows generated by the Project will be developed using the Merrimack curve as the
        design progresses. These peak flows will be shared with BWSC to assist in evaluating the
        Project's effects on the BWSC system.

       4.4.2.4              Proposed Wastewater Infrastructure

       Sanitary sewage generated by the proposed Project will be discharged to an existing sewer
       manhole located on the property and conveyed via a 12-inch PVC gravity sewer line to the
       BWSC sanitary sewer system located near the Suffolk Downs MBTA station. This pipe

Development Review Components                                                                       Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       discharges to a BWSC 24-inch gravity sewer pipe conveys flow from the Suffolk Downs site
       as well as flows from Waldemar Avenue underneath the MBTA tracks to the BWSC system.
       The Proponent will work closely with the BWSC to ensure the design and capacity of the
       proposed wastewater infrastructure will avoid adverse impacts to the existing BWSC 24-
       inch sanitary sewer main as well as any downstream conveyance infrastructure. The
       Proponent will continue to coordinate with BWSC regarding potential Project impacts on
       downstream piping, and will provide appropriate mitigation if necessary. As the Project
       design progresses, revisions to the wastewater flow estimates will be provided. The
       Proponent understands that these flows will be utilized by BWSC's consultant to model the
       existing system and determine Project impacts. In addition, the Proponent will submit a
       General Service Application and site plan for review as the Project progresses. All
       proposed improvements and connections to BWSC infrastructure will be reviewed as part of
       the BWSC's site plan review process for the Project. This process will include a
       comprehensive design review of proposed service connections, an assessment of estimated
       Project demands and system capacity, and the establishment of service accounts.

       Renovation of the existing grandstand building will include installation of a new gravity
       sanitary sewer main in the courtyard in between the grandstand and the proposed parking
       garage; a majority of the proposed development will be connected to the new gravity
       sanitary main. The main will transport flow to a proposed pump station located northwest
       of the parking garage, although the exact location of the pump station has not yet been
       determined. This pump station will transfer flow to a second new pump station that will
       replace the existing pump station on the south side of the property.

       The existing gravity sewer servicing the grandstand building will be abandoned, and new 8-
       inch gravity sewer line will be installed in a similar location. A new force main is proposed
       to connect to an existing sewer manhole and 12-inch PVC gravity sewer pipe that leaves the
       Suffolk Downs property. This 12-inch line connects to a 24-inch gravity sewer line that
       flows underneath the MBTA tracks.

       The Project will generate new wastewater flows greater than 50,000 GPD; therefore, a
       Sewer Connection Permit BRP WP 74 will be required from MassDEP. Since the Project
       also includes an extension of sewer line greater than 1,000 linear feet, it will also require a
       Sewer Extension Permit (BRP WP 71) from MassDEP.

       4.4.3         Water

       4.4.3.1       Existing Water Infrastructure

       BWSC provides water service to the Project site. Of the five different water systems within
       the City of Boston, which provide service to portions of the City based on ground surface
       elevation, the northern high service exists at the Project site. There is an existing 8-inch
       northern high water main beneath Waldemar Avenue. The City of Revere also provides
       water service to the Project site. The existing water system is illustrated in Figure 4-4.


3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF        4-25    Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                   Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Existing domestic water use on the Project site is approximately 17,800 GPD, and existing
       irrigation of the racetrack is approximately 6,700 GPD (April through October only). The
       Project site uses an additional 15,700 GPD for operations of the maintenance facility as
       well as outdoor racetrack irrigation that is supplied by the City of Revere.

       4.4.3.2        Estimated Proposed Water Consumption

       The Project's water demand for domestic services is estimated by applying a conservative
       factor of 1.1 (i.e., 110%) to the estimated sewage generation described in Section 4.4.2.2.
       Based on this calculation, the Project's total estimated water demand for domestic services
       is approximately 355,410 GPD (based on a total domestic sewage generation of 323,100
       GPD) (see Table 4-7). The total change in domestic water use is 337,610 GPD which is
       calculated by subtracting the existing 17,800 GPD from the projected water use of 355,410
       GPD. The Project will not change the existing 6,700 GPD that are used to irrigate the
       racetrack from April through October, or the 15,700 GPD supplied by Revere that that is
       used to operate the maintenance facilities. Additional irrigation of the Project site, based on
       an estimated one-inch of watering per week of the 14.3 acres of irrigation landscape around
       the casinos, parking garage, and entry drive, will be approximately 58,000 GPD. Water for
       the Project will be supplied by the BWSC system. The Proponent will engage in further
       discussions with the City of Revere to determine if the existing water service will be
       maintained.

       The Project design will incorporate various measures to reduce water consumption,
       including aeration fixtures and appliances that conserve water and sensor-operated faucets
       and toilets. Section 4.2.1.2 contains a description of sustainability measures that describe
       water-conserving design features in greater detail.

       All new water services will be installed in accordance with the latest local, state, and
       federal codes and standards. Backflow preventers will be installed at domestic and fire
       protection service connections. New meters will be installed with Meter Transmitter Units
       (MTUs) as part of the BWSC's AMR system. The existing water use numbers in Table 4-7
       were developed based on water use records provided by Suffolk Downs. Proposed water
       use volumes are based on Title V flow factors for the proposed Project only and do not
       contemplate any additional site development.

       Water capacity problems are not anticipated within the existing system as a result of Project
       construction. However, the design team will evaluate hourly peak flows as well as
       maximum daily flows as the Project design progresses.

       4.4.3.4         Proposed Water Infrastructure

       The Project includes an upgrade to the existing water connection in Waldemar Avenue that
       will serve the entire proposed development. The new water service connection will be
       located in generally the same location as the existing service to the site. The Project also
       includes a secondary looped water connection to the Waldemar Avenue main. The second
       connection will be located near the Route 1A entrance.

       Domestic and fire protection water service connections required by the proposed Project
       will meet the applicable City and State codes and standards, including cross-connection
       backflow prevention. Compliance with standards for the domestic water system service
       connection will be reviewed as part of BWSC's Site Plan Review Process. This review will
       include, but will not be limited to, sizing of domestic water and fire protection services,
       calculation of meter sizing, backflow prevention design, and location of hydrants and
       siamese connections that conform to BWSC and Boston Fire Department requirements.

       4.4.4         Water Quality and Stormwater

       4.4.4.1       Existing Stormwater Infrastructure

       When the existing Suffolk Downs development was constructed in 1935, the stormwater
       management system was designed and installed consistent with standard engineering
       practice at that time. The system was constructed to convey stormwater from the site but
       not to provide water quality treatment. Due to the age of the existing stormwater system,
       some of the catch basins and piping have filled with sand and are unable to convey
       stormwater; during heavy rains, ponding occurs throughout the parking lot. The existing
       on-site drainage system is shown on Figure 4-5.

       As determined by recent soil testing on site, existing soil conditions are primarily urban fill
       material that was placed during the site's original development. Groundwater is generally
       encountered at approximately two to six feet below existing grade, and soils are generally
       unsuitable for groundwater infiltration. This combination of poor soil and large impervious
       areas generate a significant amount of stormwater runoff.

       The site generally grades and drains to wetlands systems located along the perimeter of the
       property. These systems, many of which were man-made during site development in the
       1930s, ultimately drain to Boston Harbor.

       Storm drain improvements were recently made in the stable area located north of the
       racetrack and Sales Creek to collect stormwater in that area. Since the stable area is
       considered a CAFO, all precipitation that falls on the ground in this area is considered
       process water. All process water is collected by a closed collection system and routed to an
       impoundment facility located in the racetrack infield. Water collected in the impoundment
       pond is pumped to the BWSC sewer system via a force main that runs through the racetrack
       and discharges to the previously-described gravity collection system in Waldemar Avenue.

       Stormwater that falls on the roofs within the CAFO area is collected by a separate system, is
       considered stormwater, and is discharged directly to Sales Creek.

       4.4.4.2       Proposed Stormwater Management

       The Project includes a new stormwater management system that will significantly improve
       existing conditions. In addition, the proposed development will decrease impervious area
       on the site by approximately nine acres, thereby reducing the rate and volume of
       stormwater leaving the site. A combination of conventional and LID drainage BMPs will be
       included as part of the site's drainage design. These measures will include water quality
       swales, bioretention basins, catch basins with hoods and sumps, and proprietary structural
       water quality units. Additional sustainable stormwater measures, such as constructed
       wetlands and rainwater harvesting, are currently being evaluated. The Proponent will make
       efforts to increase the amount of retention, reuse, and infiltration of stormwater on the
       Project site, further reducing water quality impacts to adjacent properties. Furthermore,

3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF        4-28      Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                     Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       installation of stormwater BMPs designed in accordance with MassDEP Stormwater
       Management Guidelines will improve water quality treatment. Proposed stormwater BMPs
       include catch basins with deep sumps and hoods, water quality swales, bioretention basins,
       and proprietary water quality units, when necessary. The improved drainage system will
       significantly improve the quality of discharged water relative to existing conditions.

       Stormwater management in the northern and northeastern portions of the site where the
       existing stables are located has already been addressed by the CAFO work and so will
       remain generally the same.

       Since the Proponent anticipates discharging stormwater to wetlands or private
       infrastructure, any connections to BWSC infrastructure will be minimal. However, all
       improvements and connections to BWSC infrastructure, if any, will be reviewed as part of
       BWSC's site plan review process. This process will include a comprehensive design review
       of proposed service connections, an assessment of Project demands and system capacity,
       and compliance with the City of Boston Zoning Code.

       4.4.4.3       Water Quality Improvements

       As described above, the Project will improve the water quality of nearby wetlands and
       water bodies by significantly improving stormwater management and treatment on site.

       Various measures will also be utilized during construction to minimize potential adverse
       impacts from runoff. Erosion and sediment control measures such as silt fence and haybales
       will be installed to protect off-site areas and BWSC storm drain systems. Existing and
       proposed catch basins will be protected with filter fabric; hay bales, and/or crushed stone to
       remove sediment from runoff during construction. These controls will be inspected and
       maintained throughout construction until disturbed areas have been stabilized by the
       placement of pavement, structure, or vegetative cover.

       All necessary dewatering will be conducted in accordance with applicable MWRA and
       BWSC discharge permits. Once construction is complete, the Project will be in compliance
       with all local and state stormwater management policies to the maximum extent practicable
       (see Section 4.4.4.4).

       4.4.4.4       Compliance with MassDEP Stormwater Management Policy Standards

       In 1997, MassDEP adopted a new Stormwater Management Policy to address non-point
       source pollution and published the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook as guidance on
       the Stormwater Policy. The Handbook and Guidelines were revised in 2008. The Policy
       prescribes specific stormwater management standards for development projects, including
       urban pollutant removal criteria for projects that may impact environmental resource areas.
       Compliance is achieved through the implementation of BMPs in the stormwater
       management design. The Policy is administered locally pursuant to MGL Ch. 131, s. 40.

Development Review Components                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       A brief explanation of each Policy Standard and proposed system compliance is provided
       below.

       Standard #1: No new stormwater conveyances (e.g., outfalls) may discharge untreated
       stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or waters of the Commonwealth.

       Compliance: The proposed Project design will comply with this Standard. All stormwater
       from the Project site will be treated via conventional or LID drainage BMPs.

       Standard #2: Stormwater management systems must be designed so that post-development
       peak discharge rates do not exceed pre-development peak discharge rates.

       Compliance: The proposed Project design will comply with this Standard. Stormwater
       management improvements associated with the proposed Project will decrease the existing
       discharge rate. Project development will decrease impervious area on the Project site by
       approximately nine acres, which will decrease the rate and volume of stormwater
       discharged from the Project site.

       Standard #3: Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use
       of infiltration measures to the maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge from the
       post development site should approximate the annual recharge from the pre-development
       or existing site conditions, based on soil types.

       Compliance: The Project will decrease impervious area on the site by approximately nine
       acres, which will decrease peak flows from the Project site and promote infiltration. Due to
       the site's poor soil conditions and high groundwater table, dedicated underground
       infiltration facilities are not proposed as part of the Project.

       Standard #4: For new development, stormwater management systems must be designed to
       remove 80% of the average annual load (post-development conditions) of Total Suspended
       Solids (TSS). It is presumed that this standard is met when: Suitable nonstructural practices
       for source control and pollution prevention are implemented; Stormwater management best
       management practices (BMPs) are sized to capture the prescribed runoff volume; and
       Stormwater management BMPs are maintained as designed.

       Compliance: The proposed Project is a redevelopment project, and every effort will be
       made to treat stormwater to achieve 80% TSS removal. Stormwater generated on site will
       be treated using a mix of LID and conventional BMPs including water quality swales,
       bioretention basins, and catch basins with hoods and sumps. In areas where LID practices
       are not feasible, structural water quality units may be installed to provide additional
       stormwater treatment. All paved areas on the Project site will be treated to remove TSS.
       The Project will discharge treated stormwater to wetlands surrounding the site, the closed
       drainage system located along Tomasello Drive, and directly to Sales Creek.



3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF       4-30    Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Standard #5: For land uses with higher potential pollutant loads, source control and
       pollution prevention shall be implemented in accordance with the Massachusetts
       Stormwater Handbook to eliminate or reduce the discharge of stormwater runoff from such
       land uses to the maximum extent practicable. If, through source control and/or pollution
       prevention, all land uses with higher potential pollutant loads cannot be completely
       protected from exposure to rain, snow, snow melt, and stormwater runoff, the proponent
       shall use the specific structural stormwater BMPs determined by the Department to be
       suitable for such uses as provided in the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook. Stormwater
       discharges from land uses with higher potential pollutant loads shall also comply with the
       requirements of the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, M.G.L. c. 21, §§ 26-53 and the
       regulations promulgated there under at 314 CMR 3.00, 314 CMR 4.00 and 314 CMR 5.00.

       Compliance: Given that the proposed parking area will support over 1,000 vehicle trips per
       day, the Project site meets the definition of a Land Use with Higher Potential Pollutant
       Loads. All stormwater generated by the Project will be treated for TSS removal though
       either LID or conventional BMPs. As a redevelopment project, the Project design will strive
       to meet the requirements to the maximum extent practicable.

       Standard #6: Stormwater discharge to critical areas must utilize certain stormwater
       management BMPs approved for critical areas. Critical areas are Outstanding Resource
       Waters (ORWs), shellfish beds, swimming beaches, cold-water fisheries and recharge areas
       for public water supplies.

       Compliance: The Project will significantly improve the quality of stormwater discharged
       from the property relative to existing conditions by incorporating a mix of LID and
       conventional BMPs into the site design to provide water quality treatment. As a
       redevelopment project, the Project design will strive to meet the requirements to the
       maximum extent practicable.

       Standard #7: A redevelopment project is required to meet the following Stormwater
       Management Standards only to the maximum extent practicable: Standard 2, Standard 3,
       and the pretreatment and structural stormwater best management practice requirements of
       Standards 4, 5, and 6. Existing stormwater discharges shall comply with Standard 1 only to
       the maximum extent practicable. A redevelopment project shall also comply with all other
       requirements of the Stormwater Management Standards and improve existing conditions.

       Compliance: The Project is a redevelopment, and the design will comply with this
       Standard. The proposed Project will comply with the Stormwater Management Standards to
       the maximum extent practicable.

       Standard #8: Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to prevent impacts
       during construction or land disturbance activities.

Development Review Components                                                 Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       Compliance: The Project design will comply with this standard. Sedimentation and
       erosion controls will be incorporated into the Project design and employed during
       construction. These controls will be inspected regularly consistent with local, state, and
       federal requirements.

       Standard 9: A Long-Term Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Plan shall be developed and
       implemented to ensure that stormwater management systems function as designed.

       Compliance: The Project design will comply with this standard. An O&M Plan including
       long-term BMP operation requirements will be prepared for the Project to ensure proper
       maintenance and functioning of the stormwater management system.

       Standard 10: All illicit discharges to the stormwater management system are prohibited.

       Compliance: The Project design will comply with this standard. There will be no illicit
       connections associated with the proposed Project.

4.5    Construction-Period Considerations

       4.5.1         Air Quality

       Impacts associated with construction activities may generate fugitive dust, which will result
       in localized increases in airborne particulate levels. Fugitive dust emissions from
       construction activities will depend on such factors as the properties of the emitting surfaces
       (e.g., moisture content and volume of spoils), meteorological variables, and construction
       practices employed.

       The contractor will implement dust control measures during active demolition and
       construction that will primarily consist of using wetting agents regularly to control and
       suppress dust that may come from the structure being demolished or the construction
       materials. The contractor will comply with National Emission Standards for Hazardous
       Pollutants (NESHAP) throughout renovation, demolition, and construction activities.

       The proposed redevelopment may also include on-site processing of brick and concrete,
       which would involve use of an on-site crusher. Appropriate notifications 30 days prior to
       any crushing will be performed, including notifying local officials and MassDEP in
       accordance with 310 CMR 16.05(3)(e)6. At no time shall fugitive dust be allowed to
       migrate beyond the immediate work zone. Dust mitigation during processing will include
       the use of water sprayers.

       Site preparations involving construction haul roads, soil stockpiles, and vehicles exiting the
       Project site have the greatest potential to create fugitive dust; soil excavation does not
       typically generate dust, however, due to the natural moisture content of subsurface soils.
       As necessary, haul roads will be routinely misted to suppress dust generation. Soil
       stockpiles can either be covered or vegetated, depending on how long the stockpile will

3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF       4-32    Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       remain. Dust from construction traffic exiting the Project site onto public roads will be
       controlled with the use of vehicle tracking pads, which remove soil from the tires of
       construction vehicles. Paved construction entrances will also be routinely swept by street
       sweepers to remove accumulated soils. At no time will visible soils be permitted on public
       streets that could result in fugitive dust issues.

       4.5.2         Noise

       As a conservative measure, the Project will include a noise mitigation plan to minimize, to
       the extent practicable, the generation of sound levels that will impact off-site receptors. The
       noise mitigation plan will involve mitigation measures such as:

            Allowable construction timeframes will adhere to local requirements, and major
            activities such as excavation or demolition will typically be limited to normal
            working hours;

            In accordance with Massachusetts Vehicle Idling Regulations, idling of construction
            equipment will comply with 310 CMR 7.11;

            All construction equipment will be required to be properly maintained, lubricated,
            and fitted with properly functioning muffler systems; and

            To the extent practicable, specific activities such as crushing and pulverizing, as
            well as equipment staging areas, will be located at appropriate distances from
            residential receptors.

       Specific mitigation measures will be incorporated into the contract document based on the
       anticipated activities and impacts related to each stage of Project construction. Project
       activities will adhere to MassDEP's Noise Pollution Policy at 310 CMR 7.10.

       4.5.3         Water Quality and Stormwater

       The Proponent will prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and submit a
       Notice of Intent (NOI) to the EPA for coverage under EPA's NPDES Construction General
       Permit (CGP). The SWPPP will detail methods for preventing soil erosion and pollution of
       downstream receiving waters due to stormwater runoff from construction zones, and will
       include both structural and non-structural BMPs to be used during and after construction. It
       will also require site inspections in accordance with the CGP during all periods of
       construction when ground surfaces remain un-stabilized. Locations for materials stockpiles,
       construction staging, construction trailers, fueling areas, and equipment storage will be
       identified on the Civil Engineering sheet set.

       Construction-period erosion and sediment controls will include the non-structural and
       structural BMPs described below. These controls will be designed, installed, and
       maintained in accordance with the SWPPP as well as the following documents:

            Massachusetts Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines for Urban and Suburban
            Areas, A Guide for Planners, Designers and Municipal Officials, March 1997.

       4.5.3.1       Non-Structural Controls

       One of the most important methods of preventing soil erosion and sedimentation associated
       with stormwater runoff is to minimize the amount and duration of non-stabilized surfaces.
       Maintaining an efficient construction sequence that minimizes the size of disturbed areas
       reduces the exposure of non-stabilized surfaces to the erosive effects of stormwater. Both
       the SWPPP and CMP will require contractors to minimize areas of disturbance and to
       schedule equipment and materials deliveries to reduce the need for on-site storage. The
       thoughtful siting of storage and stockpile areas away from downstream receptors will also
       help prevent sedimentation from stormwater runoff.

       On-site storage of hazardous materials or toxic chemicals will be limited to what is
       absolutely necessary. Where necessary, these materials will be stored off the ground and in
       enclosed or covered structures to prevent contact with stormwater runoff.

       Daily mechanical street sweeping of construction areas and surrounding streets and
       sidewalks will be required throughout construction to control fugitive dust emissions. The
       mechanical sweeping and construction entrance mats will help prevent sediment from
       being tracked off site where they could be washed into surface waters, wetland resource
       areas, or the municipal stormwater management system. Permanent stabilization of
       exposed surfaces will be required within seven days of the completion of work in any given
       area. In instances when it is not possible to permanently stabilize exposed soils within
       seven days of work completion, or when soils will be exposed for 14 days or longer
       without work occurring, temporary stabilization of surfaces will be required. This
       temporary stabilization will be achieved by seeding with quickly-germinating grasses or the
       use of erosion control blankets.

       4.5.3.2       Structural Practices

       In addition to the non-structural controls discussed above, many construction-period
       structural BMPs will be required to prevent pollution from stormwater runoff. Appropriate
       perimeter controls such as silt socks, straw wattles, silt fence, and compost berms will be
       installed to filter and slow stormwater runoff as it leaves the construction site. To prevent
       the import of invasive species and weed seeds, hay bales will not be used for erosion and
       sedimentation control in the Project. These perimeter controls will be inspected in
       accordance with the General Permit. Sediment build-up behind perimeter controls will be
       removed when it reaches one-half the height of the controls, and controls will be repaired
       or replaced as needed.

       To prevent the tracking of sediments beyond the construction site, stabilized construction
       exits (i.e., site entrance mats) of crushed stone will be installed. All construction traffic will
       be directed over these exits when leaving the site to remove soils from vehicle tires.
       Construction exits will be inspected in accordance with the SWPPP, and will be repaired or
       replaced as necessary when sediment builds up on the surface or crushed stone is
       displaced. Appropriately-sized concrete truck wash-out basins will be installed in locations
       to prevent contact with stormwater runoff. These basins will be cleaned as needed, and
       concrete materials will be disposed of in accordance with applicable local, state, and
       federal regulations.

       New and existing inlets to stormwater management systems will be protected against
       sediment inflow. Catch basins will be fitted with filter inserts or will be surrounded by silt
       socks or other materials to filter incoming stormwater. The stormwater management
       systems will be constructed starting at the downstream end, and no flows will be directed to
       permanent stormwater BMPs prior to their completion and upstream surface stabilization.

       Where larger site disturbances are necessary to accommodate particular construction
       activities, various measures will be implemented to prevent sediment-laden runoff from
       leaving the Project site. Where long, exposed slopes are required, temporary check dams
       will be constructed to reduce runoff velocities and promote less erosive sheet flow. These
       check dams may be earthen berms, straw wattles, compost berms, or other appropriate
       systems of slowing runoff velocities and promoting sediment removal. Temporary sediment
       basins will be constructed where necessary to allow sediments to drop out of suspension
       prior to discharge and promote construction-period infiltration to groundwater. Disturbed
       surfaces will be temporarily graded towards these basins, or temporary diversion swales will
       be built to direct flows to these basins. Basin outlets will be constructed to promote low-
       velocity sheet flow and will be directed towards existing vegetated areas for further
       treatment.

       4.5.3.3       Dewatering

       Temporary construction dewatering will likely be required locally for various excavations.
       Intermittent pumping will be used as needed to allow for construction in-the-dry. Effluent
       generated during temporary construction dewatering will be infiltrated into the ground
       where possible. If necessary, effluent will be chemically tested and discharged in
       compliance with applicable regulations and discharge permits. In such a scenario, water
       quality of dewatering discharge effluent will also be monitored during construction as part
       of the discharge permit requirements.

       4.5.4         Infrastructure Protection

       Existing public and private infrastructure located in nearby public rights-of-way will be
       protected during Project construction. Installation of proposed utility connections within
       public ways will be performed in accordance with BWSC, Boston Public Works
       Department, the Dig-Safe Program, and applicable utility company requirements. Specific
       methods for constructing proposed utilities where they are near to, or connect with, existing
       water, sewer, and drain facilities will be reviewed by BWSC as part of the Site Plan Review
       process. All necessary permits will be obtained before commencement of work.

       The Proponent will continue to work and coordinate with BWSC and the utility companies
       to ensure safe and coordinated utility operations in connection with the Project.

       4.5.5         Construction and Demolition Debris

       The Project includes the demolition of existing buildings, paved driveways, parking lots,
       sidewalks, and various utilities including portions of existing water mains and sewer mains.
       Based on available information, a portion of the demolition waste will include hazardous
       materials such as asbestos and lead-based paint. These materials are classified as "special
       waste" under MassDEP solid waste regulations. Accordingly, the Proponent will segregate
       asbestos, asbestos-containing material, and materials with lead-based paint to follow the
       required special handling and transporting methods set out in MassDEP regulations.

       Based on a February 14, 2007 Phase I/Phase II Environmental Site Assessment report
       completed by GEI Consultants, an on-site inspection for asbestos-containing building
       materials and lead-based paint was conducted by Smith & Wessel of Merrimac,
       Massachusetts in select buildings on the Project site. Materials that tested positive for
       asbestos included floor tile and paper, wall and ceiling panels, insulation, window glazing
       compound, and door caulking. It is unclear whether the existing grandstand roof contains
       asbestos. It is also noted that some painted surfaces contain lead-based paint.

       Surveys and abatement plans related to asbestos-containing material, PCB-containing
       material, and lead-based paint will be required for each building prior to demolition.
       Asbestos, PCBs, and lead-based paint will be disposed, per MassDEP regulations, at landfills

       that have been approved to accept these materials. Any entity or individual engaged at the
       site for asbestos, lead-based paint, or PCB abatement or containment shall be licensed and
       certified under 453 CMR 6.00.

       Proposed demolition and construction activities will also generate solid waste. Brick,
       concrete, wood, gypsum wallboard and metal will be segregated from other construction
       debris for recycling. Other debris will be disposed of as non-banned construction waste in
       accordance with waste facility management regulations at 310 CMR 19.017. Asphalt
       pavement materials demolished during construction will be processed and reused as base
       course materials beneath new pavements. If concrete or brick is found to be coated, the
       Project would apply for a beneficial use determination permit prior to construction to allow
       for reuse.

       4.5.6         Construction Management Plan

       A CMP will be submitted to the BTD for review and approval prior to issuance of a building
       permit, and a draft will be included in the DEIR. This CMP will include detailed measures
       to ensure the maintenance of existing levels of service on adjacent roadways during Project
       construction and to minimize disruption in the area. The CMP will include such items as a
       construction activity schedule, construction staging areas, perimeter protection and public
       safety, material handling, construction trip generation and worker parking, defined truck
       routes and volumes, the need for full or partial street closures, delivery schedules,
       pedestrian and vehicle access, TDM measures for construction workers, construction-period
       air quality and dust control, construction-period noise, additional construction-period
       mitigation measures (e.g., rodent control), and coordination with other construction projects
       in the area.

       Appropriate construction techniques will be employed to ensure public safety and protect
       nearby residences and businesses. These techniques may include, as necessary, barricades,
       walkways, painted lines, and signage. Construction management and scheduling will
       minimize impacts on the surrounding environment by planning for construction worker
       commuting and parking, establishing routing plans and scheduling for trucking and
       deliveries, protecting existing utilities, maintaining fire access, and controlling noise and
       dust. Throughout Project construction, a secure perimeter will be maintained to protect the
       public from construction activities.

4.6    Request for a Public Benefit Determination

       In November 2007, the Massachusetts House and Senate passed An Act Relative to the
       Licensing Requirements for Certain Tidelands (HB 4324), which was signed by
       Governor Patrick on November 15, 2007 (Chapter 168 of the Acts of 2007) as the
       "Landlocked Tidelands Legislation." The legislation, among other things, names the
       Secretary of EEA as the "administrator of tidelands," and requires the Secretary to conduct a
       "public benefit review" for projects located on tidelands and to issue a written

3263/Caesars Resort at Suffolk Downs/ENF       4-37    Attachment A: Supplemental Project information
Development Review Components                                                  Epsilon Associates, Inc.
       determination (the "Public Benefit Determination"). The Secretary must conduct a public
       benefit review for any proposed project located on tidelands or on landlocked tidelands
       that requires an EIR pursuant to MEPA.

       4.6.1         Nature of Affected Tidelands

       As evidenced by Attachment F, MassDEP determined that the Project site is not subject to
       Chapter 91 licensing jurisdiction and the only tidelands on the Project site are landlocked
       tidelands. This determination has since been relied upon in two separate MEPA filings (one
       by DCR and one by the Proponent). Chapter 168 of the Acts of 2007 confirmed the validity
       of such previously-issued determinations from MassDEP. Pursuant to Chapter 168 of the
       Acts of 2007 and accompanying regulatory changes, the portion of the site that constitutes
       landlocked tidelands is subject to an analysis of its public benefits as well as any impacts on
       the public trust rights to access, use, and enjoy tidelands that are protected by Chapter 91.

       4.6.2         Public Benefit of Project

       In making the Public Benefit Determination, the Landlocked Tidelands Legislation requires
       that the Secretary consider the following:

               "Purpose and effect of the development, the impacts on abutters and the
               surrounding community; enhancement to the property, benefits to the
               public trust rights in tidelands or other associated rights, including but not
               limited to, benefits provided through previously obtained municipal permits;
               community activities on the development site; environmental protection and
               preservation; public health and safety; and the general welfare; provided
               further that the secretary shall also consider the differences between
               tidelands and landlocked tidelands and great ponds when assessing the
               public benefit and shall consider the practical impact of the public benefit
               on the development."

       The DEIR will include a request for a public benefit determination.

5.0    COORDINATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES

The Proponent will coordinate Project design and review with a number of governmental agencies
and community groups, some of which are addressed below. Section 1.6 contains a list of agencies
from which the Proponent will seek permits and approvals for the Project.

5.1    Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act

       The Project requires review under MEPA. The Project team met with the MEPA office
       before filing this ENF.

5.2    Chapter 91 Waterways Protection Act

       In a determination from the Assistant Commissioner dated June 23, 2000, MassDEP
       concluded that the filled portions of the Project site constitute landlocked tidelands, and
       therefore the site is not subject to Chapter 91 Licensing jurisdiction (see Attachment F).
       Chapter 168 of the Acts of 2007 confirmed the validity of such previously-issued
       determinations from MassDEP. A request for a Public Benefit Determination will be
       included within the DEIR.

5.3    Massachusetts Historical Commission

       The MHC has review authority over projects requiring state funding, licensing, permitting,
       and/or approvals that may have direct or indirect impacts to properties listed in the State
       Register of Historic Places, in compliance with M.G.L., Chapter 9, Sec. 26-27c, as amended
       by Chapter 254 of the Acts of 1988 (950 CMR 71.00). The State Register Review process
       will be initiated through the filing of this ENF under the MEPA.

5.4    Massachusetts Gaming Commission

       The Massachusetts Gaming Commission (the "Gaming Commission") was appointed
       pursuant to M.G.L. c.23K to license and regulate gaming in Massachusetts. The Proponent
       plans to file an application with the Massachusetts Gaming Commission seeking a license to
       operate a category I gaming establishment at Suffolk Downs pursuant to the provisions of
       M.G.L. Chapter 23K (on August 10, 2012, the Proponent paid to the Massachusetts Gaming
       Commission a statutorily-established fee to commence that process, and subsequently filed
       its RFA-1 suitability application with the Commission on January 15, 2013).

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CODEGREEN FACT SHEET
          Caesars Entertainment Corporation Sustainability
                           FACT SHEET

CodeGreen Sustainability Strategy:
Caesars Entertainment's CodeGreen strategy is committed to critical issues of energy, waste,
water, and carbon emissions at all of its casino resorts and seeks to engage Caesars employees
in efforts to reduce natural resource use, conserve energy, and promote reuse and recycling.

Employees implement company-wide strategy through an enterprise executive steering
committee and property CodeGreen teams. Many of these best practices come from employee
suggestions and result in big savings and far reaching impacts. Caesars' ability to rapidly evolve
its strategy and programs reinforce the effectiveness of this top-down, bottom-up approach.

Global CodeGreen programs have included:
 Participation in the World Wildlife Fund's Earth Hour: More than 40 of Caesars casinos
   and resorts powered down exterior and non-essential lighting for one hour to bring attention
   to the issue of global climate change.
   National Park Trust's (NPT) Kids to Parks Day: More than 30 Caesars Entertainment
   Corporation properties in more than 19 communities across the country hosted events to
   promote conservation and outdoor recreation as part of NPT's signature National Kids to
   Parks Day initiative ­ a grassroots movement that encourages children and families to get
   outside and explore local, state and national parks in their community. More than 3,500
   people attended these events in 2012.
   Big Green Bus Tour (BGBT): Dartmouth students travel from coast-to-coast on a bus with
   a fuel system converted to run on waste vegetable oil in an effort to educate and engage
   publics about energy and environmental responsibility. Caesars Entertainment has
   sponsored the BGBT through monetary and in kind donations including the refueling of the
   bus with recycled waste vegtable oil (WVO) from its resorts and casinos in nine regions.
   Thousands of gallons of WVO was donated by the properties to fuel the bus, and hundreds
   of people attended the hosted events this summer.
   (LAS VEGAS) Teacher EXCHANGETM: Las Vegas Meetings by Caesars Entertainment
   collects left over convention supplies (i.e. notepads, pens and other useable materials) and
   donates them to The Public Education Foundation for their use in classrooms. The company
   and its charitable arm, Caesars Foundation, have given nearly $1.5 million to aid in funding
   the operation of the program as well as purchase of school supplies.

   Clean the World Foundation: Since 2010, the Caesars Foundation has committed a
   combined $250,000 to aid Clean the World in opening a Las Vegas recycling operations
   facility, and decreasing acute respiratory infection and diarrheal disease related deaths that
   result from lack of soap and health education in impoverished communities around the world.
   In 2011, Caesars' U.S. properties donated more than 46 tons of soap and bottled amenities
   that were recycled and are helping to save lives every day
   Total CodeGreen At Home program: An employee-focused sustainability program
   designed to encourage employees to adopt green practices in their home, rewarding their
   efforts. By engaging employees in environmentally friendly practices, the company not only
   enhances its CodeGreen teams (sustainability advocates/leaders) but it also inspires whole
   communities.
   CodeGreen Day: A day at Caesars properties dedicated to celebrating and sharing the
   company's best sustainability practices that help to reduce energy, water use and waste
   consumption at our casino resorts with employees and guests.


Annual Resources Saved:
Caesars Entertainment has invested nearly $70 million on energy conservation projects alone
during the past nine years and has invested in more than 162 major retrofits, including:
 Installing energy efficient indoor and outdoor lighting, and reduce lighting usage
   Improving efficiency and effectiveness of air-handling systems
   Retrofitting equipment with energy-efficient upgrades
   Reducing water consumption in laundry facilities
   Upgrading guestroom thermostats

   Over 3.3 million therms in natural gas are saved each year.
   More than $24 million in annual resources is saved each year.
   298 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions is averted each year. The avoided carbon
   dioxide is equivalent to:

   difficult to reach areas.


Sustainable Success Stories:
   Several resorts, including the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino, Harrah's Lake Tahoe and
   Showboat Atlantic City; have co-generation facilities that generate electricity, reducing
   demand on the nation's power grid.
      o   A five-megawatt co-generation facility was installed at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino
          that uses waste heat from the generator stacks to warm water on-site for showers and
          other hot water needs.
      o   Harrah's Lake Tahoe hosts a co-gen facility that generates electricity and heats
          domestic water.
      o   A steam turbine in Atlantic City Showboat generates electricity as a by-product of the
          normal steam production at the resort. Use of the steam turbine produced an annual
          savings of 2,283,041 kWh and avoided emissions of more than 1,077,685 pounds of
          carbon dioxide and other gases.
   1,600,000 pounds of cardboard bailed and recycled at Caesars Atlantic City resorts.
   Designated Audubon Certified Golf Courses ­ Atlantic City Country Club and Sanctuary at
   Horseshoe Southern Indiana's Chariot Run Golf Course.
   At its domestic resorts, Caesars Entertainment recycles more than 320,000 gallons of waste
   vegetable oil annually.
   Caesars Entertainment's properties donated more than 140,000 tons of lightly used soap
   and bottled amenities to Clean the World Foundation to be recycled and distributed to
   peoples in need across the world saving lives and diverting waste from landfills.
